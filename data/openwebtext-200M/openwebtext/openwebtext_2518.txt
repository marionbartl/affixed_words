The federal and Ontario governments wo n't say if they are seeking a no - strike provision from teetering General Motors and Chrysler as a condition of up to $ 4 billion in loans .
The lack of confirmation follows revelations that their parent auto companies in the United States have agreed to a strike ban to secure up to $ 17.4 billion ( U.S. ) in loans .
GM and Chrysler must still seek the support of United Auto Workers in the U.S. , but the leader of the Canadian Auto Workers yesterday rejected any possibility that his union would approve a ban on walkouts here .
CAW president Ken Lewenza said such a provision would " trample " workers ' rights .
It appears anti-labour Republicans inserted the provision as part of the aid package south of the border , he noted .
" We would never agree to that , " Lewenza said in an interview .
" It 's a non-starter .
As far as we 're concerned , Canadian governments should n't be involved in the bargaining process between companies and workers . "
As it is , CAW members could n't legally walk off the job at GM and Chrysler until 2011 when their contracts expire .
That 's also when the companies are to repay the final portions of the loans .
However Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty have already conceded the two automakers may need more public money in future to survive the current downturn in the industry , a key engine of the North American economy .
In contrast to Canada , U.S. workers at individual GM and Chrysler plants can walk off the job in local disputes despite a national contract .
Lewenza said GM and Chrysler in Canada have not approached his union about any concessions to make them more competitive .
The federal and provincial governments have stressed workers must " be part of the solution " in any aid package .
The union is open to ideas that would help the companies , Lewenza has said .
Ottawa and Queen 's Park announced the aid package Dec. 20 and said the first payouts would occur on the " closing " date of Dec. 29 .
However , the governments disclosed this week that the companies asked to defer the payouts until next week as talks continue .
In Ottawa , Pierre - Luc Poisson , a spokesperson for Industry Canada , would not confirm that the no-strike provision is on the table .
" We are negotiating specific terms and conditions , " he said in an email response .

A DULAIS Valley man escaped jail after admitting possessing cannabis – claiming he smoked the drug to cure his tinnitus .
Ray Wyeth , 53 , of Khartoum Terrace , Onllwyn , was found with six grammes of cannabis resin when police executed a search warrant at his home on December 18 .
At a sentencing hearing at Port Talbot Magistrates ’
Court last week , Emma Miles , prosecuting , said : “ Mr Wyeth told the officers that the drug was for personal use and that he was given it by someone who he refused to identify .
“ He used the cannabis as a form of pain relief and fully intended to continue doing so despite his arrest . ”
Wyeth , originally from Southampton , had a previous conviction for cannabis possession in 2003 .
Iwan Jeffreys , defending , said his client deserved credit for his full and frank early admission of guilt .
Presiding magistrate Marion Reynolds told Wyeth :
“ Was it explained to you what would happen if you breached it ? ”
Wyeth replied : “ It ’s for pain relief , it ’s the only thing that works . ”
Mrs Reynolds said the bench had seriously considered activating the suspended sentence but instead decided to give him another chance .
He was fined £ 125 and ordered to pay £ 50 prosecution costs and a £ 15 victim surcharge .
A modern film version of “ The Women , ” Clare Boothe Luce ’s 1936 play about class distinctions and resentments , came and went in New York a few months ago , leaving a trail of unflattering newspaper reviews .
Now we have a real - life update involving some of the city ’s most prominent women : Caroline Kennedy , Katie Couric and Tina Fey .
A central role is played by an outlander named Sarah Palin .
Somehow , we suspect that the critics would be equally underwhelmed .
If you happened to be preoccupied over the weekend with lesser matters  war in the Middle East , the crumbling economy , the New York Giants ’ collapse  you may have missed clips from an interview with Ms. Palin that made their way to YouTube .
No one can accuse her of going gentle into that good Arctic night now that she is back on her regular job as Alaska ’s governor .
Ms. Palin talked last week with a conservative filmmaker , John Ziegler , about bias that she perceives in the news media .
She seems convinced that it explains why her campaign as Senator John McCain ’s running mate failed .
She bristled with resentment , some of it rooted in what she saw as class - based favoritism .
This is where Caroline Kennedy comes in .
MEXICO CITY ( Reuters ) -
From the live snakes that smugglers stuff with packets of cocaine to the white tigers drug lords keep as exotic pets , rare animals are being increasingly sucked into Mexico ’s deadly narcotics trade .

Drug gang leaders like to show off rarities like sea turtle skin boots and build ostentatious private zoos at their mansions .
They also reap additional profits by sharing routes with animal traffickers who cram humming birds into cigarette packs and baby monkeys into car air conditioning ducts to be sold to underground pet traders in the United States .
Mexico ’s raging drug war killed some 5,700 people last year and some cartel leaders have even been rumored to throw rivals to their big cats as food .
The global illegal trade in live species and animal parts -- used for luxury accessories , Asian medicine or folk remedies like aphrodisiacs -- is estimated to be worth up to $ 20 billion a year , Interpol has said .
The big profits available from selling wildlife on the black market -- where a certain type of endangered South American macaw can fetch $ 90,000 and a predatory python around $ 30,000 -- are added incentive to Mexican gangs moving other contraband .
“ You can sometimes make as much profit , if not more , than drug smuggling with less consequences , because law enforcement is not paying attention and if you are caught the penalty is just a slap on the wrist , ” said Crawford Allan , the North American head of wildlife trade watchdog group Traffic .
TURTLE SKIN AND COCAINE
China and the United States are the largest markets for banned pets and animal products , making the U.S. - Mexico border a busy corridor for the smuggling of many rare species from across Latin America and other parts of the world .
“ There is some evidence the same people are trading in both ( drugs and animals ) , ” Allan said in Mexico City , where Traffic is helping train inspectors to spot banned animal shipments .
In a major 2007 sting operation by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service , the largest of its kind , undercover agents spent three years infiltrating a ring smuggling endangered sea turtle skins from the shores of southern Mexico to as far north as Chicago .

Illegal drugs turned up on both sides of the border over the course of the investigation , U.S. Fish and Wildlife agent Nicholas Chavez said .
In the United States , marijuana was seized at one of the raided warehouses filled with animal skin boots .
On the Mexican side , smugglers offered to ship cocaine along with the hides of turtles whose numbers are rapidly dwindling in the wild .
“ It was just thrown out there like ‘ Hey , we can also move this stuff if you want .’...
They are pretty much moving anything that they can , ” Chavez said .
The animals can serve a double purpose when they are used to cover up drug shipments .
“ You have cases where there are drugs hidden in false compartments within crates containing live venomous snakes and written on top it says : ‘ Venomous snakes .
Do n’t open !’
So no customs guy is going to want to open that , ” Allan said .
Bags of liquid cocaine , transparent and only barely visible due to its slight yellow hue , have been found floating in or lining plastic bags containing live tropical fish .
In one shocking case at Miami ’s international airport , some of the 312 boa constrictors found in a 1993 shipment from Colombia were surgically implanted with condoms full of cocaine weighing a total of 80 pounds ( 36 kg ) .
All the snakes ended up dead .
NARCO ZOOS
Colombian drug lords used to stock their own private zoos with lions , tigers , hippos , venomous snakes and other exotic animals , and Mexico ’s cartel leaders picked up the same hobby as they took over as dominant players in the cocaine industry .
The head of the Gulf Cartel ’s feared armed wing the Zetas had two lions and a tiger on his ranch and it is widely rumored , and sometimes printed in newspapers , that he fed the cats with the bodies of cartel rivals .
Mexico ’s local market for exotic pets is also growing .
Since they breed well in captivity , you can legally buy a tiger in Mexico for a couple of thousand dollars , less than the cost of some pedigree dogs , government officials say .
“ It ’s a show of power and is incredibly common in the criminal underworld .
The worst of the worst have exotic animals , ” Patricio Patron , the head of Mexico ’s environmental protection agency , told Reuters .
A raid on a drug mansion last year in an upscale Mexico City neighborhood netted a menagerie of two lions , two Bengal tigers , two black jaguars and a monkey -- all of them well - fed and likely tended to by a personal veterinarian .
But not all pets are as lucky as the somewhat tubby big cats , which were sent to a public zoo after the drug raid .
Many smuggled animals do not survive their long , dark , suffocating journeys .
Chavez , the U.S. agent who works along the U.S. - Mexico border , once found nine baby monkeys -- which are usually captured in the wild after their mother is killed -- crammed into a car ’s air conditioning ducts , most of them dead of suffocation .
Jorge Yanez , a government wildlife expert who runs a shelter for rescued animals in central Mexico , said he once saw four hummingbirds bound and stuffed into an empty pack of cigarettes .
“ For every 10 that are trafficked , only one survives , ” Yanez said at the shelter , which is nestled in a pine forest and works to rehabilitate and release into the wild Mexican species like hawks , wild boars and lynxes that were seized in police raids or handed in by overwhelmed owners .

Scaling in games & virtual worlds
Online games and virtual worlds have familiar scaling requirements , but do n’t be fooled : everything you know is wrong .
Jim Waldo , Sun Microsystems Laboratories
I USED TO BE LIKE YOU .
I used to be a systems programmer , working on infrastructure used by banks , telecom companies , and other engineers .
I worked on operating systems .
I worked on distributed middleware .
I worked on programming languages .
I wrote tools .
I did all of the things that hard - core systems programmers do .
And I knew the rules .
I knew that throughput was the real test of scaling .
I knew that data had to be kept consistent and durable , and that relational databases are the way to ensure atomicity , and that loss of information is never an option .
I knew that clients were getting thinner as the layers of servers increased , and that the best client would be one that contained the least amount of state and allowed the important computations to go on inside the computing cloud .
I knew that support for legacy code is vital to the adoption of any new technology , and that most legacy code has yet to be written .
But two years ago my world changed .
I was asked to take on the technical architect position on Project Darkstar , a distributed infrastructure targeted to the massive - multiplayer online - game and virtual - world market .
At first , it seemed like a familiar system .
The goal was to scale flexibly by enabling the dynamic addition ( or subtraction ) of machines to match load .
There was a persistence layer and a communication layer .
We also wanted to make the programming model as simple as possible , while enabling the system to use all the power of the new generations of multicore chips that Sun ( and others ) were producing .
These were all problems that I had encountered before , so how hard could these particular versions of the problems for this particular market be ?
I agreed to spend a couple of months on the project , cleaning up the architecture and making sure it was on the right track while I thought about new research topics that I might want to tackle .
The three months have turned into two years ( and counting ) .
I ’ve found lots of new research challenges , but they all have to do with finding ways to make the environment for online games and virtual worlds scale .
In the process , I have been introduced to a different world of computing , with different problems , different assumptions , and a different environment .
At times I feel like an anthropologist who has discovered a new civilization .
I ’m still learning about the culture and practice of games , and it is a different world .
Everything You Know is Wrong
The first thing to realize in understanding this new world is that it is part of the entertainment industry .
Because of this , the most important goal for a game or virtual world is that it be fun .
Everything else is secondary to this prime directive .
Being fun is not an objective measure , but the goal is to provide an immersive , all - consuming experience that rewards the player for playing well , is easy to learn but hard to master , and will keep the player coming back again and again .
Most online games center around a story and a world , and the richness of that story and world has much to do with the success of the game .
Design of the game centers on the story and the gameplay .
Design of the code that is used to implement the game comes quite a bit later ( and is often considered much less interesting ) .
A producer heads the team that builds the game or the virtual world .
Members of the team include writers , artists , and musicians , as well as coders .
The group with the least influence on the game consists of the coders ; their job is to bring the vision of others to reality .
The computational environment for online games or virtual worlds is close to the exact inverse of that found in most markets serviced by the high - tech industry .
The clients are anything but thin ; game players will be using the highest - end computing platforms they can get , or game consoles that have been specially designed for the computational rigors of these games .
These client machines will have as much memory as can be jammed into the box , the latest and fastest CPUs , and graphics subsystems that have supercomputing abilities on their own .
These clients will also have considerable capacity for persistent storage , since one of the basic approaches to these games is to put as much information as possible on the client .
The need for a heavyweight client is , in part , an outcome of the evolution of these games .
Online games have developed from stand - alone products , in which everything was done on the local machines .
This is more than entropy in the industry , however ; keeping as much as possible on the client allows the communication with the server to be minimized , both in the number of calls made to the server and in the amount of information conveyed in those calls .
This communication minimization is required to meet the prime directive of fun , since it is part of the way in which latency is minimized in these games .
Latency is the enemy of fun — and therefore the enemy of online games and virtual worlds .
This is especially interesting in the case of online games , where the latency of the connection between the client and the servers cannot be controlled .
Therefore , the communication protocol needs to be as simple as possible , and the information transmitted from the client to the server must fit into a single packet whenever possible .
Further , the server needs to be designed so that it is doing very little , ensuring that whatever it is doing can be done very quickly so a response can be sent back to the player .
Some interesting tricks have been developed to mask unavoidable latency from the player .
These include techniques such as showing prerecorded clips during the loading of a mission or showing a “ best guess ” immediately at the result of an action and then repairing any differences between that guess and the actual result when the server responds .
The role of the server is twofold .
The most obvious is to allow players to interact with each other in the context of the game .
This role is becoming more important and more complex as these games and worlds become increasingly elaborate .
The original role of the server was to allow players to compete with each other in the game .
Now games and virtual worlds are developing their own societies , where players may compete but may also cooperate or simply interact in various ways .
Virtual worlds allow users to try out new personalities ; games let players cooperate to do tasks that they would be unable to complete individually .
In both , players are finding that a major draw of the technology is using it to connect to other people .
The second role of the server is to be the arbiter of truth between the clients .
Whether the client is running on a console or on a personal computer , control rests in the hands of the player .
This means that the player has access to the client program , and the competitive nature of the games gives the player motivation to alter the client in the player ’s favor .
Even in virtual worlds , where there is only social competition , the desire to “ enhance the opportunity ” of the individual player ( also known as “ cheating ” ) is common .
This requires that the server , which is the one component that is not under the control of the players , be the arbiter of the true state of the game .
The game server is used both to discourage cheating ( by making it much more difficult ) and to detect cheating ( by seeing patterns of divergence between the game state reported by the client and the game state held by the server ) .
Peer - to - peer technologies might seem a natural fit for the first role of the game server , but this second role means that few if any games or worlds trust their peers enough to avoid the server component .
Current Scaling Strategies
The use of the singular term server in the previous section represents a conceptual illusion of the system structure that can be maintained only by the clients of the game or world .
In fact , any online game or virtual world will involve a large number of servers ( or will have failed so miserably that no one either can or wants to remember the game or world ) .
Using multiple servers is a basic mechanism for scaling the server component of a game to the levels that are being seen in the online world today .
World of Warcraft has reported more than 5 million subscribers with hundreds of thousands active at any one time .
Second Life reports usage within an order of magnitude of World of Warcraft , and there is some evidence that sites such as Webkinz or Club Penguin are even more popular .
A single server is not able to handle such load , no matter how efficient the representation .
Even if a single server could deal with this load , such a server would be far too expensive for the smaller loads that are encountered ( sometimes by the same games or worlds ) at times of low demand ( or in parts of the product ’s life cycle when demand has decreased ) .
Having multiple servers means that part of building the game is deciding how to partition the load over these servers .
Two techniques are commonly used in both online games and virtual worlds .
Sometimes only one of the techniques is used , sometimes both , depending on the nature of the game or world .
The first technique is to exploit the geography of the game or world , decomposing the game into different areas , each of which can be mapped to a hosting server .
For example , an island in Second Life corresponds to a physical server running the code for the shared reality of the world .
Similarly , different areas of the World of Warcraft universe are hosted on different physical machines .
Anyone who is in the area will connect to the same server , and interactions among the players on that server can be localized ( and optimized ) .
Actions happening in a different part of the world are not likely to affect those in this part of the world , so the communication traffic between servers can be kept small .
The second technique is known as sharding .
A shard is a copy of a part of the game or virtual world .
Different shards reside on different servers , and players who are assigned to one shard can interact with the world and other players in the shard , but will not see ( or be able to interact with ) players or objects in other shards .
Shards not only allow more players to be supported in the world , but also permit independent explorations into the world by different sets of players .
Thus , when a new quest or mission is added to a game , it will often be replicated with multiple shards so that more than one player ( or group of players ) can experience the quest or mission in its original state .
Although sharding and geographic decomposition allow multiple servers to be used to handle the load on a single game or world , they do present the developer with significant challenges .
By creating noninteracting copies of parts of a world , shards isolate the players in different shards from each other .
This means that players who want to share their experience of the world or game need to become aware of the different shards that are being offered , and arrange to be placed in the same shard .
As the number of players who want to be in the same shard increases ( some guilds — groups of players who cooperatively play in a single game over an extended period of time — have hundreds of members ) , the difficulty of coordinating placement into shards increases and interferes with the experience of the world .
While shards allow scale , they do so at the price of player interaction .
Geographic decomposition does not limit player interaction , but does require that the designers of the game be able to predict the size of a geographic area that will be the correct unit of decomposition .
If one geographic area becomes very popular , play on that area will slow down as the server associated with the area is overloaded .
If a geographic area is less popular than originally predicted , computer hardware ( and money ) will be wasted on that section because not enough players are there .
Since the geographic decomposition is hardwired into the code of the game or world , changing the decomposition in response to observed user behavior requires rewriting part of the game or world itself .
This takes time , can introduce bugs , and is very costly .
While this is being done , gameplay can be adversely affected .
In extreme cases , this can have a major financial impact .
When World of Warcraft was introduced , the demand for the game so outstripped its capacity that subscriptions had to be closed off for months while the code that distributed the game was rewritten .
Changing Chip Architectures
Scaling over a set of machines is a distributed computing problem , and the game and virtual - world programming culture has had little experience with this set of problems .
This is hardly the only place where scaling requires the game programmer to learn a new set of skills .
A change in the trend of chip design also means that these programmers must learn skills they have never had to exercise before .
With the possible exception of the highest end of scientific computing , no other kind of software has ridden the advances of Moore ’s law as aggressively as game or virtual - world programs .
As chips have gotten faster , games and virtual worlds have become more realistic , more complex , and more immersive .
Serious gameplayers invest in the very best equipment that they can obtain , and then use techniques such as overclocking to push even more performance out of those systems .
Now , however , chip designers have decided to exploit Moore ’s law in a different way .
Rather than increasing the speed of a chip , they are adding multiple cores to a chip running at the same ( or sometimes slower ) clock speed .
There are many good reasons for this , from simplified design to lower power consumption and heat production , but it means that the performance of a single program will not automatically increase when you run the program on a new chip .
Overall performance of a group of programs may increase ( since they can all run in parallel ) but not the single program ( unless it can be broken into multiple , cooperating threads ) .
Games are written as single - threaded programs , however .
In fact , games and virtual worlds ( and especially the server side of these programs ) should be perfect vehicles to show the performance gains possible with multicore chips and groups of cooperating servers .
Games and virtual worlds are embarrassingly parallel , in that most of what goes on in them is independent of the other things that are happening .
Of the hundreds of thousands of players who are active in World of Warcraft at any one time , only a very small number will be interacting with any particular player .
The same is true in Second Life and nearly all large - scale games or worlds .
The problem is that the culture that has grown up around games and virtual worlds is not one that understands or is overly familiar with the programming techniques that are required to exploit the parallelism inherent in these systems .
These are people who grew up on a single ( PC ) machine , running a single thread .
Asking them to master the intricacies of concurrent programming or distributed systems takes them away from their concentration on the game or world experience itself .
Even when they have the desire , they do n’t have the time or the experience to exploit these new technologies .
Project Darkstar
It is for these reasons that we started Project Darkstar ( http://www.projectdarkstar.com), a research effort attempting to build a server - side infrastructure that will exploit the multithreaded , multicore chips being produced and scaled over a large group of machines , while presenting the programmer with the illusion that he or she is developing in a single - threaded , single - machine environment .
Hiding threading and distribution is , in the general case , probably not a good idea ( see http://research.sun.com/techrep/1994/abstract-29.html for a full argument ) .
Game and world servers tend to follow a very restricted programming model , however , in which we believe we can hide both concurrency and distribution .
The model is a simple event - based one in which input from the client is received by the server , which then sets off a task in response to that event .
These tasks can change the state of the world ( by moving a player , changing the state of an object , or the like ) and initiate communication .
The communication can be to a single client or to a group of clients that are all subscribed to the same communication channel .
We chose this model largely because this is the way most game and virtual - world servers are already structured .
The challenge was then to keep this model and allow servers written in this style to be scaled over multiple cores ( running multiple threads ) and multiple servers .
We were not trying to take existing code and allow it to run within our system .
This would have made the task much more difficult and would not have corresponded to the realities of the game and virtual - world culture .
Game and world servers are written from scratch for each game or world , perhaps reusing some libraries but rarely , once running , being rehosted into a different environment .
Efforts to bring different platforms into the game are restricted to the client side , where new consoles bringing in new players may be worth the effort .
Darkstar provides a container in which the server runs .
The container provides interfaces to a set of services that allow the game server to keep persistent state , establish connections with clients , and construct publish / subscribe channels with sets of clients .
Multiple copies of the game server code can run in multiple instances of the Darkstar container .
Each copy can be written as if it were the only one active ( and , in fact , it may be the only one active for small - scale games or worlds ) .
Each of the servers is structured as an event loop — the main loop listens on a session with a client that is established when the client logs in .
When a message is delivered , the event loop is called .
The loop can then decode the message and determine the game or world action that is the appropriate response .
It then dispatches a task within the container .
Each of these tasks can read or change data in the world through the Darkstar data service , communicate with the client , or send messages to groups of other game or world participants via a channel .
Under the covers , the task is wrapped in a transaction .
The transaction is used to ensure that no conflicting concurrent access to the world data will occur .
If a task tries to change data that is being changed by some other concurrent task , the data service will detect that conflict .
In that case , one of the conflicting tasks will be aborted and rescheduled ; the other task should run to completion .
Thus , when the aborted task is retried , the conflict should have disappeared and the task should run to completion .
This mechanism for concurrency control does require that all tasks access all of their data through the Darkstar data service .
This is a departure from the usual way of programming game or world servers , where data is kept in memory to decrease latency .
By using results from the past 20 years of database research , we believe that we can keep the penalty for accessing through a data service small by caching data in intelligent ways .
We also believe that by using the inherent parallelism in these games , we can increase the overall performance of the game as the number of players increases , even if there is a small penalty for individual data access .
Our data store is not based on a standard SQL database since we do n’t need the full functionality such a database provides .
What we need is something that gives us fast access to persistently stored objects that can be identified in simple ways .
Our current implementation uses the Berkeley Database for this , although we have abstracted our access to it to provide the opportunity to use other persistence layers if required .
Concurrency control is not the only reason to require that all data be accessed through the data store .
By backing the data in a persistent fashion rather than keeping it in main memory , we gain some inherent reliability that has not been exhibited by games or worlds in the past .
Storing all of the data in memory means that a server crash can cause the loss of any change in the game or world since the last time the system was checkpointed .
This can sometimes be hours of play , which can cause considerable consternation among the customers and expensive calls to the service lines .
By keeping all data persistently , we believe we can ensure that no more than a few seconds of game or world interaction will be lost in the case of a server crash .
In the best case , the players wo n’t even notice such a crash , as the tasks that were on the server will be transferred to another server in a fashion that is transparent to the player .
The biggest payoff for requiring that all data be kept in the data store is that it helps to make the tasks that are generated by the response to events in the game portable .
Since the data store can be accessed by any of a cluster of machines that are running the Darkstar stack and the game logic , there is no data that can not be moved from machine to machine .
We do the same with the communication mechanisms , ensuring that a session or channel that is connecting the game and some set of clients is abstracted through the Darkstar stack .
This allows us to move the task using the session or channel to another machine without affecting the semantics of the task talking over the session or channel .
This task portability means we can dynamically balance the load on a set of machines running the game or virtual world .
Rather than splitting the game up into regions or shards at compile time , virtual worlds or games based on the Darkstar stack can move load around the network of server machines at runtime .
While the participant might see a short increase in latency during the move , the overall latency will be decreased after the move .
By moving tasks , we not only can balance the load on the machines involved , but also try to collocate tasks that are accessing the same set of data or that are communicating with each other .
All of these mechanisms allow us to determine , while the game is being played , which tasks ( and which users ) should be placed on the same server .
The project is in its early stages of development and deployment .
It is based on an open - source licensing model and community , so we are relying on our users to educate us about the needs of the community that will build the games and worlds that will run on the infrastructure .
The research is part computer science and part anthropology , but each of the cultures has an opportunity to learn much from the other .
Even at this early stage , it is clear that this is going to be a complex venture .
While early experience with the code has shown that the programming model does relieve the game or world server programmer from thinking about threads and locking , it has also shown that there are places where they do have to understand something about the underlying concurrency of the system .
The most obvious of these is in the design of the data structures .
One of the earliest users of our code was getting terrible performance from the system .
When we looked at the code , we discovered that a single object was written to on every task , updating a global piece of game state .
By designing the server in this way , this user effectively serialized all of the tasks that were running in the system , making it impossible for the server to get any advantage from the inherent parallelism in the game .
Some minor redesign , breaking the single object into many ( much smaller ) objects , removed this particular bottleneck , with resulting gains in overall performance .
This experience also taught us that we need to educate users of the system in the design of independent data structures that can be accessed in parallel .
Our own implementation has not been without some excitement .
When we moved from a multithreaded server that ran on a single machine to an implementation that runs on multiple machines , we expected some degradation in the performance of the single - machine system .
We were delighted to find that the single - node system degradation was not nearly as large as we thought it would be , but we found that additional machines lowered the capacity of the overall system .
When presented with these measurements , this was not all that surprising to understand — the possibility for contention on multiple machines is greater than that on a single machine , and discovering and recovering from such contention takes longer .
We are working on removing the choke points so that adding equipment actually adds capacity .
Measuring the performance of the system is made especially challenging by the lack of any clear notion of what the requirements of the target servers are .
Game developers are notoriously secretive , and the notion of a characteristic load for a game or virtual world is not something that is well documented .
We have some examples that have been written by the team or by people we know in the game world , but we can not be sure that these are accurate reflections of what is being written by the industry .
Our hope is that the open - source community that is beginning to form around the project will aid in the production of useful performance and stress tests .
Seen in a broader light , the project has been and continues to be an interesting experiment in building levels of abstraction for the world of multithreaded , distributed systems .
The problems we are tackling are not new .
Large Web - serving farms have many of the same problems with highly variable demand .
Scientific grids have similar problems of scaling over multiple machines .
Search grids have similar issues in dealing with large - scale environments solving embarrassingly , but not completely , parallel problems .
What makes online games and virtual worlds interestingly different are the very different requirements they bring to the table compared with these other domains .
The interactive , low - latency environment is very different from grids , Web services , or search .
The growth from the entertainment industry makes the engineering disciplines far different from those others , as well .
Solving these problems in this new environment is challenging , and adds to our general knowledge of how to write software on the emerging class of multithreaded , multicore , distributed systems .
And best of all , it ’s fun .

The video game industry earned $ 8.85 billion in revenue in 2007 , almost as much as movies made at the box office .
Much of this revenue was generated by blockbuster titles created by large groups of people .
Though large development teams are not unheard of in the software industry , game studios tend to have unique collections of developers .
Software engineers make up a relatively small portion of the game development team , while the majority of the team consists of content creators such as artists , musicians , and designers .

One thing that becomes immediately apparent when creating and distributing mobile 3D games is that there are fundamental differences between the cellphone market and the more traditional games markets , such as consoles and handheld gaming devices .
The most striking of these are the number of delivery platforms ; the severe constraints of the devices , including small screens whose orientation can be changed ; limited input controls ; the need to deal with other tasks ; the nonphysical delivery mechanism ; and the variations in handset performance and input capability .

It has been a long journey from the days of multicolored sprites on tiled block backgrounds to the immersive 3D environments of modern games .
What used to be a job for a single game creator is now a multifaceted production involving staff from every creative discipline .
The next generation of console and home computer hardware is going to bring a revolutionary leap in available computing power ; a teraflop ( trillion floating - point operations per second ) or more will be on tap from commodity hardware .
Dean Macri - The Scalability Problem
Back in the mid-1990s , I worked for a company that developed multimedia kiosk demos .
Our biggest client was Intel , and we often created demos that appeared in new PCs on the end - caps of major computer retailers such as CompUSA .
At that time , performance was in demand for all application classes from business to consumer .
We created demos that showed , for example , how much faster a spreadsheet would recalculate ( you had to do that manually back then ) on a new processor as compared with the previous year ’s processor .
The differences were immediately noticeable to even a casual observer - and it mattered .

' No son , your school can't have that new computer because gay people eat soup '
by Jeremy Hooper
We 've told you about how the boycott fetishists at the American Family Association are lashing out against the Campbell 's soup company because the brand was " radical " enough to -- and you better sit down for this one -- advertise in a gay publication .
But if that did n't give you enough insight into how unscrupulous the supposedly " pro-family " organization is , just wait until you hear the latest .
This from the AFA :
Many people are n't aware that when their school participates in Campbell 's " Labels for Education " program they are supporting a company that has openly come out in support of homosexual marriage , and it has no intentions of stopping that support .
" Labels for Education " provides equipment for schools in exchange for proofs of purchase from the family of Campbell 's brands .
Many of the schools that participate do n't know that Campbell 's supports the homosexual publication The Advocate with advertising .
The Advocate is a leading promoter of same - sex marriage .
...
Take Action !
* Check to see if your school participates in Campbell 's " Labels for Education " program .
If so , ask them to stop participating .
These labels support a company that openly supports homosexual marriage .
Campbell 's labels help support gay marriage [ AFA ]
Did you get that ?
Essentially , because Campbell 's has chosen to market to queer soup consumers , the AFA is now encouraging parents to stop assisting a program that helps schools get needed equipment for free .
The " Labels for Education " program is in place in over 80,000 schools and organizations , catering to more than 42 million students .
It 's been running for more than 30 years , willingly handing over more than $ 100 million in merchandise towards the purpose of education .
But for the sole reason that gay people exist and buy broth , these " culture war " extremists want to ruin this TRULY pro-family program .
Even for the consistently mindblowing AFA , this is a new height in rip - your - hair - out frustration .
Though on the bright side ?
It has inspired Campbell 's to come up with a new soup : Cream of Nutty Bull Crap .
Mmm , mmm zealotry .
Your thoughts
Cutting off one 's nose to spite their face it seems .
But to be ' real ' , education obviously never ranked high on their list of priorities .
meanwhile AFTAH is getting their panties in a bunch over the MidAtlantic leather conference this weekend

But they are protecting the children , RainbowPhoenix !
They 're protecting them from us evil queers .
That 's so much more important than making sure they get a quality education and the other tools they need to grow into well adjusted adults and outstanding members of society .
Obviously , your priorities just are n't screwed up enough . ;)

Do they suppose that the computers will be gay somehow ?
That any child might open up Word and receive a sticky , viscous , glittery dollop of gay in the face ?
It 's terribly silly .
Luckily , I do n't think most people can be bothered to care that hard about what this or that company supports .

I ’ve written three posts on the AFA ’s anti-gay initiatives in the franchise industry .
The first two were on their McDonald ’s boycott and the most recent on the Curves for Women promo partnership with the AFA .
CURVES FOR WOMEN : Is Anti-Gay , Anti-Choice AFA a Healthy Promo Partner ?
http://www.franchisepick.com/curves-for-women-anti-gay/
I am surprised by the lack of comments on these posts by gay - rights supporters .
The few comments I ’ve received were from AFA supporters .
This is not for lack of commenting traffic – we get 400 - 500 comments per month on various issues .

Letting my kids eat Campbell 's Chicken Soup has many positives .
First of all , they love it , and it 's pretty nutritious .
Secondly , their school participates in the " Labels " program .
Is the fact that Campbell 's is helping the public school system going to " make " the kids gay because they advertise in a gay magazine ?
Get real !!
I think the people that come up with these stupid boycotts have way to much time on their hands .
Posted by : LV Mom | Jan 23 , 2009 2:20:12 AM
So I wonder if these same people have taken the time to check out their 401K ( and other investment ) companies ... how many of those companies produce chemicals that are used in abortions ?
Not grouping people together , but , okay , maybe I am ... that whole " holier than thou " group that does n't believe in gay relationships , abortion , or any other RIGHT that a human being has , AS a human being .
Whatever happened to life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness ?
My point is : are you going to go through life worried about little crap like this ?
They should put that energy toward something REALLY worthwhile .
I agree with earlier post ... too much time on their hands .

I want to talk about Microsoft 's web strategy .
But Microsoft is a huge company , with a lot of parallel activities in this space , and there are so many angles from which you can approach the subject .
So I 've decided to focus on a single , instructive example : the front page of Microsoft.com .
Disclaimer : this is a cheap shot .
I know it is .
A single HTML page does not embody the entirety of Microsoft 's strategic direction and corporate culture .
I 'm also subjecting it to rigorous scrutiny of the kind few web pages get .
Nevertheless , Microsoft.com is one of the most popular destinations on the Internet and they are trying to make a name for themselves in the web space and they do have a gigantic budget which they could expend on their front page .
Here 's where my journey began , and what started my investigation that led to this post .
This is the front page of Microsoft.com , rendered in Firefox ( v3.0.5 , Windows XP ) .
This and all subsequent screenshots are cropped ; click for the full capture .
It looks ... odd .
The big center image and the nav bar at the top are different widths , as is the lower section with content and navigation .
The navbar has too much vertical whitespace and the left and right edges are oddly cropped .
The alignment and relative vertical sizes of the logo , the search box , and the slogan at the top are odd .
The whole thing looks like a rendering error .
This impression was reinforced when I moused over the menu bar , and it looked like this :
Okay , this is clearly broken .
The white overlaps the border of top of the navbar , there 's no gradients to fit in with the rest of the look , the menu is gigantic and does n't have a top border , making it look odd in the top - left corner .
Clearly , Microsoft does n't care about what this page looks like in Firefox .
So I decided to see what it looked like in other browsers .
Here it is in Safari ( v3.2.1 , Windows XP ) :
Huh .
Well , it looks pretty much the same .
The green search buttons are now out of alignment with the search box , but otherwise it does n't look that different .
What about that crazy menu , does it look any better ?
It turns out the menus do n't work in Safari .
They just click through to a full HTML page containing all the same content .
What ?
How , in 2009 , do you fuck up your javascript so badly that you can't get drop - down menus to work ?
Are n't you a software company ?
Could you maybe throw an engineer at that hefty , complicated " drop down menus in web pages " problem , currently being solved by a 13 - year - old making his WordPress theme ?
Or just read the first hit on Google on the subject , which explains how to do it without using Javascript at all ?
Okay , fine , they must just hate Apple .
Let 's try it in Opera ( v9.63 , Windows XP ) :
Looks pretty much the same .
Search buttons are back in place .
How about that menu ?
Woah , still gross .
That 1 - pixel overlap on the left just shouts " we were not ready to launch " .
At this point I decided to take a look at the code and see what 's going on .
This is a really low blow -- the code on the frontpage of Yahoo ! , where I work ( important disclaimer ) , is no picnic .
People do weird things to get performance optimized on these giant pages , things that are a bad idea 95 % of the time .
Here 's what the code looks like when you open it up ( yes , also an image , I 'm being lazy ) :
That 's the whole page , btw : there are only 4 line breaks in the entire page .
Uh ... okay ?
I 'm sure you 're just very concerned about saving space .
Let 's pretty - print that code and see what we got :
Oy .
3 script tags in the head , and two external style sheets ?
Plus a bunch of embedded scripts everywhere else .
Consolidating CSS and JS and putting scripts at the bottom of the page are some pretty basic performance tweaks .
But I 'm not going to go into a long dissection of the code .
It 's not too bad , and front pages are weird , as I 've said .
Now let 's see what this page is supposed to look like .
Here it is in IE6 , Microsoft 's 8 - year flagship product :
Wait , what ?
This looks even worse !
Misaligned buttons , and now the dashes on the menu separators look terrible .
Do the menus work , at least ?
Ow !
Big gap , looks even worse than the others .
And note the presence of a black bar at the top of the highlighted menu item now , which indicates to me that there was at least at some point the intention of having the black bar there in all the other versions .
Once again , the lack of a black border on top of the menu item itself looks strange .
If you know this gap is happening in IE6 , you could at least fix that .
Oh , and if you happen to be mousing too slowly over that gap , the menu will close , because you 've moused out of it .
Wow , that 's pretty terrible .
I would n't have been allowed to ship a website with bugs like those , and even if they slipped through I 'd have fixed them by now .
But this page did n't launch just a week ago .
Okay , fine , maybe Microsoft is doing what everyone else is doing , and started ignoring IE6 in hopes of making people switch ( this site , for instance , shows IE6 users a horrifying red banner and an utterly broken page .
IE6 can suck it ) .
Let 's look at it in IE7 , Microsoft 's flagship browser and the most popular single browser in the entire world :
And this is what made me decide to blog about this .
Here it is , looking exactly the same .
Same weird sizes , odd font choices , strange white space , green buttons are out of alignment
The site actually looks better in Firefox .
And the menus are still broken :
An open letter
Dear Microsoft : I know these are minor things .
I 'm sure consumers do n't even notice , apart from maybe a vague feeling that your front page has a strange , unfinished look to it .
A pixel here , a pixel there , who cares ?
You know who should care ?
You should .
Either you have recognized the power of online advertising and want to become a major player in the web , or you do n't .
And if you do , then you have to start getting the web , which you currently do not .
Here , for comparison purposes , is the front page of Yahoo ! , as seen in Firefox :
This is also , down to the pixel , what the screenshot looks like in IE6 , IE7 , Opera , and Safari ( though Safari 's fonts are a little thicker ) .
Now again , this is not a fair comparison .
Your front page is n't a direct revenue - earner for you :
Yahoo's front page is a huge chunk of revenue , measured in tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars .
Obviously Yahoo ! can afford to throw a few more engineers at the problem .
But come on .
You 're Microsoft .
You have no shortage of money , or engineers , and this is your front page .
This is why Yahoo -- and Yahoo's employees -- do not want to get acquired by you .
You do n't care about the web the way that we do , you do n't get it like we do .
You 're a software company , not a web company , and those two things are not the same and that 's okay .
Keep building your operating systems .
Try to make them dependable like Window XP and 2000 , and not sucktastic like Windows ME and Vista .
Just stop trying to be something you 're not .
You 've branched out successfully before .
You got into office software after a late start and dominated .
You have made huge strides in getting into gaming , and XBox 360 is apparently pretty cool .
I like your hardware : I have bought a lot of Microsoft mice in the past , and I 'm typing on your ergonomic keyboard right now .
You can diversify successfully .
But you know which diversification was n't successful ?
MSN .
Oh , wait , or is it called Live now ?
Whatever .
After more than 10 years and hundreds of millions of dollars in losses , you run a distant third to Yahoo 's already distant second to Google , and you 're losing share , not gaining .
It 's time to admit defeat .
You 're not a web company .
Almost nothing you 've done has helped the web .
A controversial claim ?
Come on , give me the example of a great web technology by Microsoft .
Silverlight is your proprietary copy of Flash .
ActiveX , and the horrifically flawed security model that came with it , has been responsible for huge amounts of carnage .
Your broken JScript and messy , incompatible DOM were also horrible , but you share the blame for those with Netscape .
Although you were among the first to implement CSS , you were among the last to get it right .
You did invent XMLHttpRequest , for which I must give you credit , even though you did n't actually use it for anything interesting until it was rediscovered years later , and innerHTML , which is convenient .
But anything you might have contributed is drowned in the wave of awfulness that was IE6 , or more specifically , the way you let IE6 sit there for 7 years without fixing anything , because you did n't have to , because you 'd used your money to crush Netscape and you did n't care about the web .
Now it turns out the web does n't care about you .
Admitting defeat is okay .
Blame the crappy economy if you like , the advertising slowdown , evil monkeys , Jerry Yang , sunspots , whatever .
Sell MSN and Live -- sell them to Yahoo , in fact , and take a big but decidedly non-controlling ownership stake .
We can help those poor , abused , broken websites ; restore them pixel by pixel ; train them , with love and patience , to stop lashing out at customers and irritating them with crappy UI and mangled user experiences .
In time , they will flourish without you .
You can stop striving to play with the younger kids , settle down , and find a big , profitable niche that nobody else wants , like IBM did when you beat the crap out of them in the operating system market .
Microsoft , you are not a web company .
And that 's okay .
GENEVA , Jan 23 ( Reuters ) -
Twenty years of conflict has cost the Middle East $ 12 trillion , a study showed on Friday .
Unless the region ’s conflicts are resolved , the costs will continue to mount , said the study by India ’s Strategic Foresight Group , backed by governments or other agencies in Norway , Qatar , Switzerland and Turkey .
“ The choice they have to make is the choice between the danger of devastation and the promise of peace , ” said Sundeep Waslekar , the group ’s president and one of the report ’s authors .
The figures are all the more striking as global recession and slowdown forces governments to scramble for billions of dollars to shore up banks and economies .
The study looks at the costs of the failure to conclude peace after the 1991 Madrid conference -- an attempt by the international community to start Israeli - Arab peace talks in the wake of the Gulf War -- negating many of the region ’s advantages in location , resources and education .
The report looks at conflict in the entire region from Iran to Egypt , including between Israel and its Arab neighbours , the war in Iraq , tension between Iran and Israel and al Qaeda ’s activities in the Middle East .
It also includes rivalry between the Palestinian organisations Hamas and Fatah .
Much of the discussion at Friday ’s presentation of the report centred on the Israeli - Palestinian conflict in the aftermath of Israel ’s 22 - day assault on the Gaza Strip that killed 1,300 Palestinians , wounded 5,000 and left thousands homeless .
Israel lost 10 soldiers and three civilians .
HALF AS RICH
The report estimates the opportunity costs of conflict in the region at 2 percent of growth in gross domestic product .
It implies peace combined with good governance and sound economic policies would allow some countries to grow at 8 percent .
Some costs -- emotive ones such as the deaths of children and political intangibles such as the loss of America ’s credibility -- are difficult to quantify in monetary terms , but the study tracks them .
One conclusion is that individuals in most countries are half as rich as they would have been if peace had taken off in 1991 .
Incomes per head in Israel next year would be $ 44,241 with peace against a likely $ 23,304 .
In the West Bank and Gaza Strip they would be $ 2,427 instead of $ 1,220 .
For Iraq , income per head next year is projected at $ 2,375 , one quarter of the $ 9,681 that would have been possible without the conflicts of the past two decades .
One intangible cost is the loss of human dignity .
The study points to some economic consequences by calculating that negotiating checkpoints to and from Ramallah in the West Bank has cost Palestinians 100 million person hours since 2000 .
All countries in the region are suffering from conflict , Waslekar said .
If instability drives the price of oil back to $ 100 a barrel once the recession ends , it would wipe out all the gains from trade liberalisation of the past 20 - 30 years , he said .
“ Considering the enormity of the costs evidenced in this report which have direct or indirect negative consequences for the whole world , the urgent necessity of a stronger international engagement is inescapable , ” said Thomas Greminger , a senior Swiss diplomat who worked on the study .

Obama is expected to move swiftly to reverse executive orders regarding torture of terror suspects , the military prison at Guantanamo Bay and other controversial security policies , sources close to his transition said , in dramatic gestures aimed at reversing President Bush ’s accumulation of executive power .
44 to reverse 43's executive orders
President - elect Barack Obama is expected to move swiftly to reverse executive orders regarding torture of terror suspects , the military prison at Guantanamo Bay and other controversial security policies , sources close to his transition said , in dramatic gestures aimed at reversing President Bush ’s accumulation of executive power .
Senator Russ Feingold ( D - WI ) said he ’s been informed that President Obama will support his proposed legislation to make public some opinions from the Justice Department 's Office of Legal Counsel , which issued some of the Bush Administration 's most sweeping claims of executive power .
Obama also has promised to limit President Bush 's practice of using " signing statements " to amend legislation .

" Every day we get indications that they 're serious about reversing the abuses of the Constitution , " Feingold , a harsh Bush critic , told Politico .
Feingold said he thinks Obama is likely to issue executive orders rapidly reversing Bush policies , and others have indicate that those will likely cover the interrogation and detention of terror suspects , and keeping the records of past presidents secret .
" I do n't know in what order or how fast " Obama ’s executive orders could come , he said .
" It 'll be important that a couple of them be done immediately , and I think they will be , to show there 's a strong break from the current policy . "
Chris Lu , executive director of Obama ’s transition team , told supporters in a conference call earlier this month that Obama ’s aides have “ started developing executive orders that the pres elect is considering –not only ones the President - elect will sign after January 20 , but also ones we will want to repeal . "
Obama aides did n't respond to requests for more detail , but the president - elect campaigned against what he called Bush ’s abuse of executive authority .
" I was a constitutional law professor , which means unlike the current president , I actually respect the Constitution , " Obama told an audience at a campaign fundraiser in 2007 .
In “ Change for America , ” a book by the Center for American Progress Action Fund that was designed as a blueprint for Obama ’s presidency , Yale Law School dean Harold Hongju Koh outlined " a package of executive orders , proposed legislation , agency shakeups , and concrete foreign policy actions ” the new president should embrace , including “ four key executive orders ” requiring the closing of Guantanamo Bay and ending the torture of detainees .
The Associated Press reported Monday that transition advisers said Obama could sign an executive order in his first week ordering the closure of Guantanamo Bay , although shuttering the prison and transferring the prisoners somewhere else would take time .
On Sunday , Obama promised to close the military prison , but cautioned that it may not happen as quickly as civil rights advocates would like .
" I think it ’s going to take some time , and our legal teams are working in consultation with our national security apparatus as we speak to help design exactly what we need to do , " Obama said on ABC ’s ‘ This Week ’ .
" But I do n’t want to be ambiguous about this .
We are going to close Guantanamo , and we are going to make sure that the procedures we set up are ones that abide by our Constitution . "
Responding to a 2007 questionnaire from the Boston Globe , Obama said repeatedly that the president does n't have the power to disregard Congress in matters of war and national security .
But he was vague on the question of executive privilege — his right to keep documents and testimony about White House decisions from Congress .
Obama also defended a president ’s right to use signing statements to clarify law , but he criticized Bush ’s “ clear abuse of this prerogative ” to undermine laws he did n’t like .
" He is definitely going to handle signing statements in a very different fashion than Bush , " said Norm Ornstein , a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute .
" He 'll issue some , no doubt , but he 'll do it on a limited basis , and in a much more constrained way - he wo n't be saying , ' I refuse to execute this portion of the law , ' for example . "
Obama also may be less inclined to cross Congress as long as both houses are controlled by Democrats .
Although he has said little on the issue since his election , foes of executive power have been encouraged by several of Obama ’s hiring choices .
John Podesta , who Obama chose to lead the transition , testified before Feingold 's hearing on " restoring the rule of law " and made a series of specific recommendations , beginning with an executive order establishing " a presumption against classification in cases of significant doubt " and another revoking some secrecy privileges for vice presidents and for the relatives of former presidents .
Obama ’s incoming Attorney General , Eric Holder , also denounced Bush ’s policies , telling the American Constitution Society last year that “ our needlessly abusive and unlawful practices in the ‘ War on Terror ' have diminished our standing in the world community and made us less , rather than more , safe . ”
Perhaps Obama 's most important staff choice on this front was Dawn Johnsen , who will head Justice ’s Office of Legal Counsel .
Johnsen , a law professor at the University of Indiana , was a fierce critic of Bush administration interrogation policies and the legal opinions underlying them .
She recently wrote that " the assistant attorney general for OLC and other top Department of Justice officials must also be prepared to resign in the extraordinary event the President persists in acting unlawfully or demands that OLC legitimize unlawful activity . "
" I was pleasantly surprised that Obama seems to have picked a head of the Office of Legal Counsel who is willing to tie his hands , " said Gene Healy , a vice president at the libertarian Cato Institute .
At the same time , Johnsen served in the Clinton Administration office of legal counsel , which fiercely protected presidential power , and argued that the executive branch did not need authorization to take military actions in Haiti and Bosnia and to strike a pharmaceutical factory in Sudan .
" It will be very interesting to see which person we are going to see , " said a lawyer familiar with Johnsen 's work .
" Will it be like more like views of OLC of the 1990s , or has she decided that Clinton OLC went too far ? "
Indeed , not all of Obama ’s appointees are reflexive skeptics of executive authority .
A potential White House counterbalance to Johnsen is Cass Sunstein , a longtime Obama advisor from their University of Chicago days who will head the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs .
Although he 's best known as a prolific , and liberal , legal scholar , Sunstein defended Bush 's stand on his power to resist Congress -- though not of his claims of sweeping national security powers .
And observers agree that Obama will be sorely tempted to expand presidential power , not curtail them , once the secrets he 's keeping and the policies he 's defending are his own , not his predecessor's .
" Some people expect ( Obama ) to repudiate some executive powers , and it 's certainly possible he could say that , " said Eric Posner , a law professor at the University of Chicago School of Law .
" I just do n't think presidents voluntarily give up power .
. .
The last president who cut back on presidential powers was Taft . "
Obama 's critique of executive power , and discussions about it in the Bush years , have focused largely on foreign policy , but the new president takes office amid the largest - scale government intervention in the American economy since the middle of the last century .
The presidents of that era - Roosevelt and Truman - found themselves restrained by the courts in their attempts to meddle in the economy , and some scholars suggested that Obama may be seeking to expand his powers more at home than abroad .
" On the one hand , he 's dialing back some of the national security powers that have been controversial over the last eight years , " said Cato 's Healy .
" On the other hand , he seems very comfortable redesigning the economy by executive fiat . "
Barack Obama became the 44th President of the United States last Tuesday , January 20th at precisely 12:00 PM ET .
Many converged on the National Mall for this historic occasion , but exactly how many made this historic trek ?
Thanks to satellite imagery , provided by GeoEye , an accurate estimate of attendance , or at least area , can be ascertained .
I downloaded the high - resolution satellite image and traced the population areas in Adobe Acrobat .
Using the resulting polygons , the area can be calculated :
( Click the image for a larger version )
The effective scale is acquired by measuring the diameter of the Washington Monument 's base ( which we know to be 250 feet ) on the image , and converting to real world measurements .
In this case , each inch represents 500 feet .
A table of each polygon 's area is listed below :
Label Area ( sq ft ) Label Area ( sq ft ) 0 132,500 19 15,000 1 20,000 20 25,000 2 27,500 21 105,000 3 302,500 22 10,000 4 5,000 23 52,500 5 287,500 24 100,000 6 12,500 25 27,500 7 72,500 26 125,000 8 117,500 27 65,000 9 12,500 28 75,00 10 25,000 29 75,00 11 155,000 30 7,500 12 40,000 31 57,500 13 172,500 32 27,500 14 27,500 33
17,500 15 27,500 34 7,500 16 45,000 35 32,500 17 32,500 36 20,000 18 140,000 Total 2,365,000
Despite their appearance , these figures are not exact .
The area calculations are quantized based upon the capabilities of Adobe Acrobat and the resolution of the image .
It would have been better to use a tool like AutoCad to trace the regions , but even so , the resolution issue would still persist .
The resolution of the image makes it impossible to accurately trace each and every crowd region .
Based upon these assertions , and the knowledge that low - density crowds are not visible to a satellite , we know that some spectators were not and cannot be identified ; their exact number will forever remain unknown .
It then follows that our 2,365,000 sq. ft. figure excludes these spectators .
While we have a baseline measurement for the size of the crowd , we still do not know the quantity of the crowd .
Fear not , our Clinton Era tax dollars were hard at work :
In the model , all people are modeled in circles individually to consider human spatial requirement .
The diameter of a circle is determined as 0.4 meter with consideration of the size of body .
Using the distance between evacuees and spatial requirements , interactions between people are assessed .
It is an important factor in predicting congestion or contra - flows of a crowd .

The area within a circle of diameter . 4 m is 0.125 sq. meters ; this then converts to a crowd density of one person per 1.35 square feet .
If this density is uniformly applied to our baseline area of 2,365,000 ft. sq , we can obtain a minimum boundary for the number of inauguration onlookers ; at least 1,748,445 people attended Barack Obama 's Inauguration .
The Israeli onslaught in Gaza is having a " profoundly acute and unhealthy " effect on British Muslim communities and " patience is running out " , a government minister has said .
The justice minister , Shahid Malik , told the Guardian there was " immense anger " in British Muslim communities over developments in the Middle East .
He said : " There is a real feeling of helplessness , hopelessness and powerlessness among Britain 's Muslims in the context of Gaza and the sense of grievance and injustice is both profoundly acute and obviously profoundly unhealthy . "
The comments by Malik , the first Muslim to be made a minister in any British government , were echoed by the Conservative shadow security minister , Pauline Neville - Jones , who said she was concerned at the effect the conflict was having on radicalism in the wider Arab world .
David Miliband , the foreign secretary , is to make a statement to the Commons on Gaza later today .
Speaking to the Guardian , Malik expressed alarm that the vast majority of British Muslims were drawing no distinction between current UK government policy and that held by Tony Blair when he failed to condemn immediately an invasion of Lebanon by Israel in 2006 .
In August 2006 Malik became the most senior Muslim to criticise Blair in an open letter .
Though he was then outside government as a parliamentary private secretary ( PPS ) , etiquette restricts a PPS from criticising government policy .
Describing meetings he had held with Muslim communities in the past few days , Malik said : " I was extremely concerned that many British Muslims had failed to distinguish between the UK's current response and the response in 2006 during the Lebanon crisis .
People have become so disillusioned that they almost appear to have stopped listening to politicians . "
Malik said he had to explain to constituents the government 's position .
He said : " The prime minister and foreign secretary have talked about the violence being horrific , appalling , unacceptable and disproportionate – words not usually used in these situations by UK governments .
[ At meetings ] many were shocked that the government believes that there should be a viable Palestinian state based on pre-1967 borders alongside a secure Israel or that we object strongly to settlement expansion and Israel 's security wall , which contravenes international law . "
Khalid Mahmood , a Muslim and MP for Birmingham Perry Barr , also expressed support for the government 's stance so far but thought it could use stronger language .
He said : " The government needs to issue stronger lines in showing it is not happy , and that we as a nation are not happy , with what is going on in Gaza . "
Mahmood dismissed suggestions of an arms embargo .
Pola Uddin , a Labour peer , said that some Muslims had been hitherto disappointed in the profile of Muslim parliamentarians .
Uddin , who had been abroad monitoring elections in Bangladesh , said : " I got back to a sackful of letters from people asking why we are all silent .
One said , ' I know why you 're silent – it's because you can't do anything . ' "

Quoting an email [ from Paul Krugman ] , economists who " have spent their entire careers on equilibrium business cycle theory are now discovering that , in effect , they invested their savings with Bernie Madoff . "
I think that 's right , and as they come to this realization , we can expect these economists to flail about defending the indefensible , they will be quite vicious at times , and in their panic to defend the work they have spent their lives on , they may not be very careful about the arguments they make .
I do n't know if the defenders of the classical faith have come to this realization yet , at least beyond the subconscious level , and the profession will most likely move in the same old direction for awhile due to research inertia if nothing else .
But I think what has happened will have a much bigger impact on the profession and the models it uses to describe the world than most economists currently realize :
A Dark Age of macroeconomics ( wonkish ) , by Paul Krugman : Brad DeLong is upset about the stuff coming out of Chicago these days — and understandably so .
First Eugene Fama , now John Cochrane , have made the claim that debt - financed government spending necessarily crowds out an equal amount of private spending , even if the economy is depressed — and they claim this not as an empirical result , not as the prediction of some model , but as the ineluctable implication of an accounting identity .
There has been a tendency , on the part of other economists , to try to provide cover — to claim that Fama and Cochrane said something more sophisticated than they did .
But if you read the original essays , there ’s no ambiguity — it ’s pure Say ’s Law , pure “ Treasury view ” , in each case .
Here ’s Fama ...
And here ’s Cochrane ...
There ’s no ambiguity in either case : both Fama and Cochrane are asserting that desired savings are automatically converted into investment spending , and that any government borrowing must come at the expense of investment — period .
What ’s so mind - boggling about this is that it commits one of the most basic fallacies in economics — interpreting an accounting identity as a behavioral relationship .
Yes , savings have to equal investment , but that ’s not something that mystically takes place , it ’s because any discrepancy between desired savings and desired investment causes something to happen that brings the two in line .
... [ A ] fter a change in desired savings or investment ... , if interest rates are fixed , what happens is that GDP changes to make S and I equal .
That ’s actually the point of one of the ways multiplier analysis is often presented to freshmen .
Here ’s the diagram ...
In this picture savings plus taxes equal investment plus government spending , the accounting identity that both Fama and Cochrane think vitiates fiscal policy — but it does n’t .
An increase in G does n’t reduce I one for one , it increases GDP , which leads to higher S and T .
Now , you do n’t have to accept this model as a picture of how the world works .
But you do have to accept that it shows the fallacy of arguing that the savings - investment identity proves anything about the effectiveness of fiscal policy .
So how is it possible that distinguished professors believe otherwise ?
The answer , I think , is that we ’re living in a Dark Age of macroeconomics .
Remember , what defined the Dark Ages was n’t the fact that they were primitive — the Bronze Age was primitive , too .
What made the Dark Ages dark was the fact that so much knowledge had been lost , that so much known to the Greeks and Romans had been forgotten by the barbarian kingdoms that followed .
And that ’s what seems to have happened to macroeconomics in much of the economics profession .
The knowledge that S=I does n’t imply the Treasury view — the general understanding that macroeconomics is more than supply and demand plus the quantity equation — somehow got lost in much of the profession .
I ’m tempted to go on and say something about being overrun by barbarians in the grip of an obscurantist faith , but I guess I wo n’t .
Oh wait , I guess I just did .
Given their understanding of macroeconomics , and I mean the basics not the hard stuff , it 's becoming a lot easier to understand how financial economists missed the developing bubble and the effect it would have on the macroeconomy .
We specialize mightily in academic economics , people will work on very narrow questions for their entire careers and become world class experts on that question , but they tend to forget what they learned in other areas over time , and they can't possibly keep up with developments outside their areas of specialization .
So we rely and depend upon the expertise of others to inform us about areas in which we do n't normally work .
One thing I 've learned from the current episode is not to automatically trust that the most well - known economists in the field have done due diligence before speaking out on an issue , even when that issue is of great public importance , or even to trust that they 've thought very hard about the problems they are speaking to .
I used to think that , for the most part , the name brands in the field would live up to their reputations , that they would think hard about problems before speaking out in public , that they would provide clarity and insight , but they have n't .
In fact , in many cases they have undermined their reputations and confused the issues .
People have been deferential in the past , myself included , and these people have been given authority in the public discourse - even when they are demonstrably wrong their arguments show up in the press as a " he said , she said " presentation .
But , unfortunately for the economics profession and for the public generally , the so called best and brightest among us have not lived up to the responsibilities that come with the prominent positions that they hold .

[ Update : Greg mankiw responds to Paul Krugman . ]
My friend Joel Parker sent me a link to a wonderfully satirical article by a man who was ( also satirically ) running for President .
It consists of many short slices of ideas , including this one about homeopathy :
ONE OF THE PRINCIPLES of homeopathic medicine is that a smaller dose is considered more effective than a larger dose .
This has profound implications for U.S. foreign policy .
At the moment , we have 158,000 troops in Iraq .
Imagine if we had only six !
According to homeopathic logic , this presence would be much more successful .
This sentiment is certainly no more silly than any others that meet the standards , such as they are , of homeopathology .
Homeopathy is perhaps the most ridiculous of all quackery , since it says that the best medicine is medicine that is entirely gone .
In theory it hardly needs debunking ; it 's a cul - de-sac of reason , Poe 's Law incarnate .
It 's the solipsism of medicine .
Still , many people believe in it , so in practice it does need debunking .
In a typical essay showing all the myriad ways homeopathy goes wrong , the usual suspects are displayed : the theory behind it does n't make sense , water does n't have memory , diluting medicine actually makes it weaker , and all that .
But you do n't need to go into all that detail .
Why not ?
Because homeopathy is self - denying !
Just look at it this way :
If homeopathy works , then obviously the less you use it , the stronger it gets .
So the best way to apply homeopathy is to not use it at all .
Quod erat demonstrandum .
Still , homeopaths tend to be immune to logic and reason ( ironically , proving homeopathy at least in principle : the less likely you are to ask for scientific evidence to support it , the stronger homeopathological evidence gets ) .
So we need a practical application , a way to stop homeopathy practitioners cold .
And I think I have it .
The next time you meet one , ask them what they do when they get thirsty .
If they really believe homeopathy , then within days all the homeopaths will be gone , deceased due to diligently dogmatic dehydration .
And the beauty of it ?
According to their own logic , once all the homeopaths are gone , they will have reached maximum strength .
They win , we win , medicine wins , logic wins .
Everyone wins .
Well , technically , they do n't win , being dead and all .
But they made their point !
I think .
Anyway , spread the word !
And if you 're a homeopath , then it 's your duty to link to this very blog post : according to your own tenets , the more it gets out there , the weaker it is !
So submit it to Digg , submit it to Fark , put it on Slashdot , and Boing Boing , and Neatorama .
Get millions of people to visit this page .
It 's the only way to stop skepticism !

( CNN ) --
Trading two children for a bird landed three people in jail in Louisiana , authorities say .
The biological mother , who was not involved in the alleged trade , is to be interviewed by authorities Friday .
Investigators seek further details about a case that they say unfolded this way :
Paul and Brandy Romero advertised that they were selling their pet cockatoo for $ 1,500 .
A woman named Donna Greenwell responded and said she wanted to buy the bird .
Greenwell then told the Romeros that she was taking care of three children whose biological parents were going through a separation .
Greenwell proposed selling two of the couple 's children to the Romeros for $ 2,000 , saying that her job as a truck driver made it hard to take care of the children , said Capt .
Keith Dupre of the Evangeline Parrish Sheriff 's Office in Louisiana .
Do n't Miss FBI closing in on suspect in case of pilot thought kidnapped
The parties allegedly negotiated a trade involving the two kids , the bird and $ 175 .
An anonymous tipster contacted authorities after the children began living with the Romeros .
As a result , Greenwell and the Romeros were arrested February 21 and charged with aggravated kidnapping , Dupre said .
The children were well taken care of when they were with the Romeros , who badly wanted children , according to Dupre .
Greenwell said she needed the cash for a lawyer to handle adoption paperwork , authorities said .
She had placed the third child with another Louisiana couple , Dupre said , but he did n't know whether bartering was involved .
The two children were ages 4 and 5 , according to CNN affiliate WGNO .
Police did not identify the biological parents , and no other information was available .
The children have been placed in foster care .

I saw a late - night infomercial a long time ago for the Iron Gym pull up bar , and it looked pretty good .
But lately I 've been trying to get more active so I can actually keep my weight in control .
So I decided to give the Iron Gym a try .
I thought I might goof around with the Iron Gym then give it to one of my guy friends after I got bored with it .
I was surprised when I got it and actually really found it straightforward and a little fun !
It feels so good to really get your muscles going , but I hardly have the time to go to the gym or jog outside .
I usually use some little free weights that I got at a garage sale a while back , but even after working out , it didnâ€™t seem like they did anything .
I found that the Iron gym really helped me get an intense workout without taking a long time .
Watch The Iron Gym Pull Up Bar Commercial Video As Seen On Tv
The first time I used it , it was quite apparent that the bar was designed by someone in the military , there is nothing you do n't need , but all the features you could want in a compact little thing .
I used the Iron Gym As Seen on TV ( of course ) to find a good routine for myself :
I hang the bar from my door and do two kinds of pull ups
I drop the bar on the floor and do crunches
I do as many pushups as I can after I can't do any more crunches
Finally , I go back to crunches to really target my midsection
This all takes less than 15 minutes and really helps me get my blood going in the morning before work .
Sometimes , I also use the Iron Gym Ab Straps to do some floating crunches after work .
But they 're super intense , so I 've got to have a lot of energy after work .
Once I 'm done working out , I just put the Iron Gym bar behind my door and go on with my day .
Best of all , it did n't mess up my doors or need to be mounted .
I really can't recommend it enough , you could even bring it into the office for a quick lunch - break workout to battle the mid-afternoon slump .
Click
Here to order the Iron Gym pull up bar and see how easy it can be to really get a good workout fast .
And in .
Best .

Earlier this month , new U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder promised a clean break from the policies of the Bush administration .
Yesterday , during a live interview on C - Span , he affirmed that this change includes ending the DEA raids of state - authorized medical marijuana providers !
Responding to a reporter ’s question regarding the DEA ’s recent actions against several California medical cannabis providers , Holder stated : “ What the President said during the campaign . . . will be consistent with what we will be doing here in law enforcement .
. .
What [ President Obama ] said during the campaign . . . is now American policy . ”
You can watch the video of Attorney General Holder ’s remarks here .
Holder ’s statement marks a dramatic shift in U.S. drug policy , and is a major victory for the 72 million Americans who reside in states where the use of medical cannabis is legal !
It also lends support to the ongoing efforts in Minnesota , New Jersey , and Rhode Island — each of which are debating legislative proposals to make the production and distribution of medical cannabis legal under state law .
At this time , NORML would like to personally thank those of you who responded to our request to contact the Attorney General ’s office and urge Eric Holder to call off the DEA raids .
Your phone calls and e-mails have helped to change U.S. marijuana policy !
So go ahead and give yourself a pat on the back .
And while you ’re at it , click here to thank the new Attorney General for supporting the will of the people and the health and welfare of seriously ill patients .
“ Change we can believe in ? ” Yes it is , and it ’s about time .

Every year during the Super Bowl , we ’re treated with a very elaborate half time show .
These shows usually consist of major music acts of current or past decades performing live .
There ’s an element of grandeur associated to them .
Unfortunately for the Super Bowl event organizers , these half time shows do n’t always go without a hitch .
Here are the five most embarrassing half time events that have transpired over the past few years .
5 Kid Rock's US Poncho
The self - proclaimed American Badass sure lived up to the “ ass ” part in Super Bowl XXXVIII .
In an effort to showcase how patriotic he really is , Kid Rock slit up an American flag , wore it as a poncho and later threw it into the crowd .
In case you ’re unaware , this is actually an act of flag defacement .
The Veterans of Foreign Wars hastily filed a lawsuit against CBS as a result .
Blunder : Defacement of the US flag at the Super Bowl .
4 Paula Abdul Straight Up Sucked
Week after week , Paula Abdul is on American Idol trying to find ways to not break contestants ’ feelings by pointing out their one redeeming quality , even if it ’s material one .
As a judge on the show , she ’s supposed to be honest and help mentor the contestants by showing them areas where they can improve .
When she unveiled that she will be performing at last year ’s Super Bowl after over a decade of being in hiatus , you begin to expect something half decent .
Calling the performance a catastrophe would be an understatement .
If you ’re going to lip sync through the Super Bowl , at least make it look like you ’re trying .
I can just imagine the look on the faces of those who got rejected from Idol ; I ’d think it ’s the same face you ’d get if you found out your music teacher is deaf .
Blunder : American Idol judge lip syncs her way through the Super Bowl .
3 In Living Color Steals Gloria ’s Thunder
When you think of “ Super Bowl halftime show ” , you imagine some extravagant show with lots of prestigious talent .
In 1992 , that talent came in the form of Gloria Estefan and some figure skaters .
Well I ’m sold !
I ’m not sure who thought this was a good idea but it did n’t fare well with the audience .
In fact , over 20 million viewers switched channels to watch a then unpopular Jim Carrey do what he does best on In Living Color .
The two Olympic skating champions did n’t even perform the Iron Lotus , what a jip .
Blunder : Gloria Estafan caused many fans to tune in to see Jim Carrey who was relatively unknown back in 1992 .
We interrupt this Gloria Estefan video to bring you a " In Living Color " skit .
2 Prince ’s Cover Up
Prince ’s performance at Super Bowl XLI was actually really good .
That is n’t to say that his gig was n’t without controversy .
Two main conspiracies surrounded Prince at the big game .
Firstly his guitar , which sported the Prince symbol , looked like a hung penis when viewed behind the curtain ala “ Austin Powers : The Spy Who Shagged me ” .
The second comes from one of the songs he performed .
In 2003 , the Foo Fighters recorded a cover of Prince ’s Darling Nikki and put it on the B - Side of the single “ Have It All ” .
The song got some decent air time on the radio .
Prince went on a tangent against the Foo Fighters for doing the cover and claimed that it is a sign of lack of originality .
Which song did Prince perform at Super Bowl XLI ?
A cover of Foo Fighters ' “ Best Of You ” .
Blunder :
The phallic guitar or the cover hypocrisy ?
Take your pick .
1 Janet Jackson ’s Nipple Fiasco
This one goes without saying but what fun would that be ?
In the concluding moment of their “ Rock Your Body ” duet , Justin Timberlake ripped off a part of Janet Jackson ’s top exposing Janet ’s right breast which was covered with a star shaped ring .
Oh how furious the soccer moms got when they saw this one .
A hefty lawsuit was filed .
Following the incident , Janet Jackson ’s career fumbled while Timberlake continued being a massive success .
Blunder : Coining the term “ wardrobe malfunction ” is Janet 's career highlight .

An incandescent bulb gives off 90 % of its energy as heat , while a compact fluorescent ( CFL ) bulb squanders about 80 % as heat .
LEDs remain cool , thus wasting less energy .
An LED bulb that produces similar amounts of lights to an equivalent incandescent produces about 5 percent of the temperature .
All incandescent and CFL bulbs produce lights that flows in all directions , wasting lights as well as heat .
80 % of the electricity fed to an LED is converted to light .
20 % of the electricity fed to a conventional bulb is wasted .
A building ’s carbon footprint from lighting can be reduced by 85 % as a result of exchanging all existing incandescent bulbs for new LEDs .
Low power need : Several varieties of LED lamps can be operated with battery power supplies .
In recent years , they have become bright enough to use in familiar lighting applications .
As the price of wholesale LEDs has dropped , the power - saving properties of LED lighting have become more cost - effective .
This makes LED lighting far more efficient than any other home lighting option .
An LED bulb uses less power than compact CFL bulbs .
Hence , replacing compact fluorescent bulbs in your home or business will help to reduce both heat and power consumption .
As LED lamps need less power they can be run on batteries letting you have portable LED lamps and outdoor LEDs .
LED lights for home or office use will pay For themselves .
By replacing bulbs in your home with LED ceiling lights you are investing in a lighting system that is sure to pay you back many times over .
With a long expected lifespan LED lamps will bring years of usage so you can clock up some substantial savings .
It will pay several times over for the initial cost of LEDs .
Even outdoor LEDs and floodlights that would typically need power hungry halogen bulbs can be replaced by more economical and affordable high lumens LED floodlight and lamps .
Long Lifespan .
A Light Emitting Diode can function for decades when installed .
LED bulbs can last much longer than compact fluorescent and incandescent bulbs .
Compact fluorescent bulbs can last 8,000 hours while LED bulbs can last around 50,000 hours .
LED lifetimes are rated in a different way than conventional incandescent lights , which go out when the filament breaks .
The long operational lifetime helps achieve even more energy efficiency .
Especially in the large scale , like in urban infrastructure projects , such as cities , railroads , and airports .
LED bulbs and lamps are a cost - effective option for lighting a home or office space since they have a long lifespan .
Eco -Friendly .
LEDs do not contain toxic materials and are very recyclable .
This will help you to reduce your carbon footprint by up to a third .
In contrast , the majority of conventional fluorescent bulbs contain a multitude of materials .
Things such as mercury , which are dangerous for the environment .
A low - voltage power supply is adequate for LED illumination .
So it is easy to use LED lighting in outside settings .
You can also use an external solar - energy source , which is a big advantage when it comes to using LED technology in remote , rural areas .
Another great advantage is that LED illumination produces lower infrared lights and almost no UV emissions .
This makes LED 's suitable for goods and materials that are sensitive to temperature due to the benefit of lower radiated heat emission .
They are also good for illumination of UV sensitive objects such as museums , art galleries or archaeological sites .
Durable Quality .
Lights Emitting Diodes are resistant to shock , vibrations and external impacts .
Thus , they make great outdoor lighting systems for rough conditions .
They can also withstand greater exposure to weather such as the wind , rain .
They are now being implemented in large public areas , roads , and traffic lights , as well as in construction or manufacturing sites .
Because they do n't need to be changed very often , and over time offer large savings .
Flexible Design .
LED 's can come in a variety of shapes and sizes , while always producing a highly efficient illumination .
Individual LED 's can be dimmed .
This results in a dynamic control of lumens lights , color , and distribution .
LED 's measure approximately from 3 to 8 mm long and can be used singly or as part of an array .
The small size and low profile of LED 's permit them to be used in spaces that are considered too small for other bulbs .
Operational in Extreme Temperatures / Weather .
LEDs are perfect for operation in low outside temperature settings .
For fluorescent lamps , low temperatures may affect operation and present a problem .
LED illumination , operates well in cold settings , making them ideal to be used in outside winter environments or in freezer rooms .
They also perform well in extremely hot settings , such as boiler rooms and ovens .
LEDs can be designed to be waterproof allowing them to be used in harsh conditions or wet environments .
No Glass = Less Breakage .
On top of that , since LEDs contain no glass components , they are not vulnerable to vibration and breakage like conventional bulbs .
LEDs are consequently better suited for use in areas like sports facilities and within areas that are prone to vandalism .
LEDs typically operate at moderately low working temperatures , simplifying heat management and dissipation , which allows for the use of plastic lenses , filters , and diffusers .
Instant Lighting :
When powered on , LED light brighten up fully and instantly .
This poses great advantages for infrastructure projects , such as traffic and signal lights .
In addition , the lights can be switched off and on regularly and without affecting the LED ’s lifetime or lumens emission .
On the contrary , traditional LEDs may take several seconds to reach their full brightness , and frequent on and off switching does radically decrease operational life expectancy .

The Oregonian 's recent articles on the escalating cost of undergraduate education and the incredible debt carried by most graduating seniors did not address the fundamental issue underlying this problem :
Even at these costs , the quality of education being delivered to a majority of students is closer to remedial high school rather than college .
Undergraduate education in America is an enormous business , with 9 million undergraduates spending $ 20,000 to $ 50,000 each year on tuition , books , lodging , meals and entertainment .
Make no mistake about it : Administrators , academics , publishers , bankers and the sports industry all have a vested interest in increasing the undergraduate population .
Our colleges and universities compete to attract students through amenities such as fine facilities , strong sports programs , spas and easy course options .
A standing joke among faculty members is an adaptation of a communist adage : " We pretend to teach and they pretend to learn . "
We all know that there are so - called " graduates " who can barely read or write and could n't pick out the United States on a map .
A vibrant and rigorous higher education system is , of course , a vital part of our national infrastructure .
Indeed , we have many fine institutions and many students who are working hard to extract as much as they can from the schools they are attending .
The problem is that about half of our student population should n't be there for academic or motivational reasons .
Why are they there , then ?
Because the higher education business , in its zeal to keep expanding , has convinced us that everyone " has to " go to college regardless of what they get out of it .
We have managed to raise the bar for getting any kind of menial job to a bachelor 's degree and are well on the way to requiring a master 's to qualify for a barista position .
The sad thing is that the kids who are there for the wrong reasons are not only carrying a huge debt after their four or five wasted years , but they have also given up several years of productive output , on - the - job learning and income .
Most businesses have to train graduates from scratch anyway because most do n't come to them with useful skills ; they use the bachelor 's degree as a simple tool for winnowing applicants , because those with a bachelor 's may be more trainable than those without .
If a bachelor 's degree really meant something and there was a significant nonbachelor 's pool of talented people , job requirements would become more realistic .
The whining of the higher education business execs for more money from their students and state governments certainly would subside if the undergraduate population suddenly dropped by half and parents demanded that colleges actually deliver a rigorous education for the money invested .
It 's time to make the " higher " in higher education mean something .

Study : Hearing damage occurs after more than 5 minutes of full - volume listening on iPod earbuds
I ’m coming late to this , but back in 2006 a couple of audiologists decided to test a bunch of earbuds and headphones to measure how much hearing damage they cause when playing MP3 tracks at a range of volumes , from whisper - quiet to full - on 100 % .
That chart above summarizes the results .
It ’s slightly alarming to me , because I sometimes listen to my Sansa Fuze player — using earbuds — at 80 % or 90 % of the volume , in part because when I ’m walking around Manhattan , the ambient noise is pretty high , so the music has to cut over that .
If hese guys are right , I can listen for no more than 1.5 hours , and possibly as little as 22 minutes , “ without greatly increasing their risk of hearing loss ” .
Mind you , who really knows :
As the scientists note in their writeup , people ’s auditory physiology varies quite a lot .
But there ’s also some more , and newer , nifty research from this team — about the listening habits of young people .
One public - health - policy concern these days is that young people are listening to music waaaaaay too loud , and are all gonna be deaf by their mid 40s .
To figure out whether this was true , these same scientists studied 30 Denver - Boulder - area teenagers .
It turns out things are n’t so bad .
Only a small minority of kids — between 7 and 24 per cent — are listening to their MP3 players at eardrum - shredding levels .
“ We do n’t seem to be at an epidemic level for hearing loss from music players , ” Portnuff said .
What ’s more , boys tend to listen to music louder than girls , teenagers tend to listen at quieter levels as they get older , and some teenagers appear to have trouble judging precisely how loud they ’re listening .
But dig this …
The study also showed that teen boys listen louder than teen girls , and teens who express the most concern about the risk for and severity of hearing loss from iPods actually play their music at higher levels than their peers , said CU - Boulder audiologist and doctoral candidate Cory Portnuff , who headed up the study .
Such behaviors put teens at an increased risk of music - induced hearing loss , he said . [ snip ]
“ We really do n’t a have good explanation for why teens concerned about the hearing loss risk actually play their music louder than others , ” he said .
Heh .
Maybe it ’s because they ’ve been listening so loud for so long that it ’s just begun to unsettle even themselves .
Not enough to stop , yet , but enough to start wondering , hmmm , is n’t this gonna make me deaf ?

Bush Admin. to bar autoworkers from striking against GM John Byrne
Published : Friday January 9 , 2009
Print This Email This As GM chief coasts , workers forced to accept cuts , strike prohibition A little - noticed provision buried in the Bush Administration 's $ 13.4 billion loan package to General Motors will prohibit the United Auto Workers from launching a strike as long as the company receives funds from the federal government .
Not only that , but a strike would give the federal government the power to call in their loan -- putting the loan in default and forcing GM into bankruptcy .
The government now has the power to force a bankruptcy if any labor union or collective bargaining unit shall engage in a strike or other work stoppage . 
The terms of GM 's loan package were reported last night in the Detroit Free Press .
They did not become public until GM filed documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission .
The company 's headquarters are pictured above right .
Not everyone has felt the full brunt of the declining auto market , however .
In 2008 , GM CEO Rick Wagoner received a salary increase -- to $ 2.2 million , plus stock options -- despite the fact the company had been losing money since 2005 .
The US auto workers union is also saddled by another requirement of the loan : the UAW must now accept a plan to lower wages and benefits for GM to match those of other foreign - owned US automakers ' plants .
" The deal requires the UAW to accept by Feb. 17 a plan to lower wages and benefits for workers to match those of employees at foreign - owned U.S. plants by Dec. 31 , " the Free Press wrote Thursday .
" It also requires the union to take two - thirds of the money its due for a retiree health - care trust fund in company stock rather than cash or company debt . "
" GM has until Dec. 29 , 2011 to pay back the loan under the current deal , " the paper added .
" While the UAW has a no - strike clause in its contract with GM that runs through September 2011 , its local unions have different timetables for negotiating their contracts .
If the UAW was forced to reopen its contract to make concessions , the no-strike clause could be set aside . "

Remember all those months in which Chairman John Conyers ’ House Judiciary Committee staff refused to impeach but kept busy writing his next book .
Well , here it is : a bitter sweet thing .
It includes three recommendations , and the third one is pretty good :
3 . The Attorney General should appoint a Special Counsel , or expand the scope of the present investigation into CIA tape destruction , to determine whether there were criminal violations committed pursuant to Bush Administration policies that were undertaken under unreviewable war powers , including enhanced interrogation , extraordinary rendition , and warrantless domestic surveillance .
This criminal investigation should , for the first time , ascertain and critically examine the facts to determine whether federal criminal laws were violated .
It may be appropriate for certain aspects of the factual investigation by the prosecutor to await pertinent reports by the Inspectors General or information developed by any Blue Ribbon Commission or Select Committee .
As part of this process , the incoming Administration should provide all relevant information and all necessary resources to outstanding Justice Department investigations , including with respect to the U.S. Attorney removals , the politicization of the Civil Rights Division , and allegations of selective prosecution .
Congress should also consider extending the statute of limitations for potential violations of the torture statute , war crimes statute , laws
prohibiting warrantless domestic surveillance , or for crimes committed against persons in United States military custody or CIA custody to ten years .
Reason : Among other things , documented incidents of grave abuse of detainees at various detention facilities including Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay and the extraordinary rendition of terror suspects to countries where they have been tortured , and the implementation of warrantless surveillance inside the United States , raise credible concerns that criminal laws may have been violated .
1579
At present , the Attorney General has agreed only to appoint a special U.S. Attorney to determine whether the destruction of videotapes depicting the waterboarding of a detainee constituted violations of federal law .
1580 Despite requests from Congress , that prosecutor has not been asked to investigate whether the underlying conduct being depicted “ “ the waterboarding itself or other harsh interrogation techniques used by the military or the CIA “ “ violated the law .
1581 Thus far the Attorney General has similarly refused to appoint a special counsel to investigate whether the practice of extraordinary rendition and , in particular whether the extraordinary
rendition of Canadian citizen Maher Arar , violated the law .
Similarly , there remains a serious question as to whether the warrantless domestic surveillance engaged in as part of the so - called “ Terrorist Surveillance Program ”  prior to January 2007 , violated the law .
1582
It would seem that all or part of the above - described conduct meets the relevant requirements under federal regulations for the appointment of a special counsel ( 28 CFR 600.1 ) ,
in that ( i ) a criminal investigation is warranted ( e.g. , waterboarding and warrantless domestic surveillance appear to violate criminal laws ) ; ( ii ) the investigation would present a conflict of interest for the Justice Department ( e.g. , some of the potentially culpable parties have worked for or with the Department ) ; and ( iii ) appointment of a special counsel would be in the public interest ( e.g. , it would help dispel a cloud of doubt over our law enforcement system ) .
Here ’s the press release :
Judiciary Chairman Conyers Issues Report Documenting Bush Abuses , Calling For Further Committee Investigation , Blue - Ribbon Panel , and Criminal Probes
( Washington , D.C. ) — Today , House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers , Jr. released a nearly - 500 page report documenting numerous abuses and excesses of the Bush Administration .
The Report , titled “ Reining in the Imperial Presidency : Lessons and Recommendations Relating to the Presidency of George W. Bush , ” contains 47 separate recommendations designed to restore the traditional checks and balances of our constitutional system .
Recommendations include calls for continued Committee investigation , a blue ribbon commission to fully investigate Administration activities , and independent criminal probes .
“ Even after scores of hearings , investigations , and reports , we still do not have answers to some of the most fundamental questions left in the wake of Bush ’s Imperial Presidency , ” Conyers said .
Pointing to allegations of torture and inhumane treatment , extraordinary rendition , warrantless domestic surveillance , the Valerie Plame Wilson - leak , and the U.S. Attorney scandal , Conyers continued , “ Investigations are not a matter of payback or political revenge – it is our responsibility to examine what has occurred and to set an appropriate baseline of conduct for future Administrations . ”
In addition to the set of recommendations , the report contains a Foreword by Chairman Conyers and detailed discussions of : the Administration ’s legal approach to presidential power ; the politicization of the Department of Justice ; the Administration ’s far - reaching assaults on individual liberty ( including torture , extraordinary rendition , and warrantless domestic surveillance ) ; the misuse of Executive Branch authority ; the Administration ’s retribution against its critics ; and the Administration ’s excessive secrecy , noncompliance with congressional oversight , and manipulation of pre-Iraq War intelligence .

Las Vegas , Nevada , USA
Welcome to the home page for the biggest and most rational gathering on the planet : The Amaz!ng Meeting 7 , a conference on critical thinking .
From July 9 - 12 , 2009 , the James Randi Educational Foundation will host TAM 7 .
Our goal is to make each TAM better than the last , and this one is no exception : we have a fantastic lineup of speakers , events , workshops , and shows .
From the opening reception on Thursday night , to a live testing of a Million Dollar Challenge applicant on Sunday , TAM 7 will be a non -stop tour de force of critical thought .
At TAM 7 you 'll hear great talks , participate in workshops to help you sharpen your skeptical skills , and hear how other people are promoting a rational world .
Our keynote speaker this year is Bill Prady , Executive Producer of the hit TV show The Big Bang Theory .
Bill is a bona fide science geek who makes sure that every episode of Big Bang is chock full of science fiction and comic book references , as well as jokes based on cutting edge science -- going so far as to employ a PhD physicist as his science advisor for the show .
At Comic
Con last year Bill had the audience laughing so hard they were afraid they 'd miss the next thing he said .
We 're very excited to have him take time from his incredibly busy schedule to speak at TAM 7 .
We 've loaded our speaker list with both old friends -- Mythbuster Adam Savage makes his fifth TAM appearance -- as well as new up - and - comers , like science writer Jennifer Ouellette and pediatric physician Dr. Joe Albietz ; young skeptics and promoters of rational thought .
We 'll also have our usual dynamite roster of presenters such as JREF President and Bad Astronomer Phil Plait , paranormal investigator Joe Nickell , magician and mentalist Jamy Ian Swiss , and of course James Randi himself .
We also welcome back our long - time friend Hal Bidlack , who will MC the conference .
We 're also partnering with Dr. Steve Novella of The New England Skeptical Society to hold the Science - Based Medicine Conference , a one - day meeting about medicine , skepticism , and the need for critical thinking in the healthcare system ( more information about SBM , including the speaker and topics lists , can be found on Dr. Novella 's Neurologica blog ) .
But the best thing about TAM 7 ?
It 's the community .
You 'll be with hundreds of other people who prefer the world the way it really is : free from magical thinking , paranormal hucksters , irrationality , and antiscience .
Join us at TAM 7 and be a member of a community that 's proud to use their brains .
We 're skeptics .
And we can prove it .
More information is available in the menu bar at the top of every TAM 7 page .

Daemon Kit aims to simplify creating Ruby daemons by providing a sound application skeleton ( through a generator ) , task specific generators ( jabber bot , etc ) and robust environment management code .
Using simple built - in generators it is easy to created evented and non-evented daemons that perform a multitude of different tasks .
The first version , 0.1 sports a jabber generator , with the evented jabber generator coming soon .
The code is still pretty much rough around the edges , and it lives over at GitHub .

Beom Jun Kim , Dong Myeong Lee , Sung Hun Lee , Wan -Suk Gim , ``Blood - type distribution '' , Physica A 373 , 533-540 ( 2007 ) .
292組の夫婦のABO血液型を尋ねました：
女 A 女B 女AB 女O 男A 27 26 9 17 男B 28 23 6 31 男AB 9 10 1 16 男O 31 22 11 25
血液型の組合せはランダムでしょうか。これを調べるにはカイ2乗検定を使います。
x = matrix ( c( 27,26,9,17,28,23,6,31,9,10,1,16,31,22,11,25 ) , nrow=4 , byrow=TRUE ) chisq.test ( x )
p 値は 0.2964 で，統計的に有意な血液型による相性はなかったようです。
時間がかかってもいいなら，Fisherの正確検定のほうが正確です。 fisher.test(x , workspace=8000000 ) p 値は 0.3115 です。
次に，MBTIという性格検査をしてみます。MBTIは次のように性格を類型化します：
内向・外向 （Introversion / Extraversion ）
感覚・直感 （Sensing / iNtuition ）
思考・感情 （Thinking / Feeling ）
判断的態度・知覚的態度 （Judging / Perceiving ）
例えば内向・外向と血液型とをクロス集計すると次のようになりました：
内向 外向 A 195 102 B 123 82 AB 61 38 O 144 107
これ以外の結果も含め，Rで書くと次のようになります：
IE = matrix ( c( 195,123,61,144,102,82,38,107 ) , nrow=4 ) SN = matrix ( c( 200,111,63,178,97,94,36,73 ) , nrow=4 ) TF = matrix ( c( 181,121,67,149,116,84,32,102 ) , nrow=4 ) JP = matrix ( c( 140,75,42,109,157,130,57,142 ) , nrow=4 )
これらを Fisherの正確検定 で調べると ，SN（感覚・直感）だけ p = 0.001818 で非常に有意です。
SNをさらに男女別に見てみると，次のようになります：
SNM = matrix ( c( 146,70,49,125,72,67,27,57 ) , nrow=4 ) SNF = matrix ( c( 54,41,14,53,25,27,9,16 ) , nrow=4 )
すると，男だけ有意です（p = 0.007）。
さらに各血液型を見ていくと，B型とそれ以外で分けたときだけ有意になります：
fisher.test( matrix ( c( 70,67,390-70,223-67 ) , nrow=2 ) )
この p = 0.000837 です 。B型の男は感覚派（五感に基づいて行動する現実派）より直感派（空想派？）が多いということです。
これって B型の彼氏 の影響？

The government 's flagship policy to revolutionise welfare by paying private companies to find jobs for the unemployed was in crisis last night as firms said there were too many people out of work - and too few vacancies - to make it viable .
News that Labour 's radical plan is in turmoil and facing possible legal challenges comes as unemployment is about to pass the two million mark for the first time in more than a decade .
Analysts believe it will hit three million before the end of this year .
Responding to warnings that his reforms will not work without major changes , James Purnell , the work and pensions secretary , has abandoned plans to announce the preferred bidders for the multi-million - pound contracts this week .
This follows demands from the firms involved for hundreds of millions more in " up - front " cash .
A crisis meeting between top department officials and the bidding companies was cancelled on Friday after Whitehall announced a " short pause " in the tendering process .
The Department for Work and Pensions ( DWP ) said it had been called off " because of the snow " , but one company manager involved remarked : " The most telling thing is that no new date was set . "
The difficulties besetting Gordon Brown 's core welfare policy present a severe headache to ministers , who vowed last year - when jobs were abundant and unemployment low - to bring more private - sector rigour into the welfare system by paying employment firms and the voluntary sector " by results " .
This meant they would receive a sum for each person for whom they found a job , with extra cash when workers stayed in their new posts for more than 26 weeks .
The drive to " privatise " the welfare system is one of the most radical and controversial policies of Labour 's entire third - term agenda .
Richard Johnson , managing director of welfare - to - work policy at Serco , a provider of " outsourced public services " bidding for eight contracts from the DWP , said it was vital the government rescued the policy - but it would have to be more flexible .
" We recognise that , with twice as many people signing on and three times as many becoming unemployed , the services and funding we agreed 12 months ago is no longer fit for purpose , " he added .
Under the current contracts on offer , worth a total of more than £ 1bn over five years , firms and voluntary sector organisations chosen in a tendering process would be paid 20 % " up front " as a service fee and the remaining 80 % when they placed people in work .
Now many are demanding the service fee element be raised to 50 % .
Colin Birchall , chief executive of Pertemps People Development Group , which has been bidding for eight contracts under the " flexible new deal " , agreed that the government will have to release more capital at an earlier stage to satisfy bidding companies : " We need to review where we are , because we have a results - driven contract .
Because the programme has become larger , the requirement for capital outlay from each company will be greater . "
In a further twist , ministers have also been told by the industry that companies which decided last year not to bid for the contracts on the basis that there was not enough up - front cash on offer , may launch legal action against the government if it now offers more generous terms to existing bidders but refuses to start the entire tendering process from scratch .
In a submission to ministers sent on Friday , before the cancelled meeting , and leaked to the Observer , the representative body for the industry - the Employment Related Service Association - suggested the entire bidding process may have to start again .
" The current context is so different from that originally envisaged that , no doubt , the DWP will have considered carefully whether procurement law required the competition to restart from the beginning , " says the letter .
Mark Lovell , executive chairman of A4e which is bidding for several contracts , said he had heard that some failed bidders may try to take the government to court once the terms are redrawn .
" I have heard about possible legal action , but would caution against it because I think the steps being taken by the government are appropriate .
I cannot see what other bidders could say or what information they could provide that would change the outcome , " he said .
Mark Serwotka , general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services union , which opposes privatisation , said the policy stood little chance of getting under way as planned in the autumn .
" Nobody can have any confidence in the claim that the flexible new deal can start in October .
Any attempts to rescue these flawed plans will result in taxpayers handing a blank cheque to the preferred bidders . "
The DWP refused to comment on the problems in the tendering process or the reasons for the delay .
But officials insist the policy remains on track .
However , a letter sent to bidders by senior officials in Purnell 's department on January 30 spelt out the extent of the problem and the need for an urgent rethink .
Tom Cruise is n’t endearing himself to the natives in Brazil , with a nice little display of cultural stupidity .
Cruise was in town to promote Valkyrie , and decided it would be really smart to trying to speak to the locals in Spanish , saying “ hola ” ( hello ) and “ gracias ” ( thank you ) .
One tiny little problem though .
They do n’t speak Spanish in Brazil , they speak Portuguese .
It ’s the equivalent of a French actress doing a media conference in the United States flipping into Spanish instead of English ….actually , no , that does n’t work , chances are a good portion of the audience in the US would speak Spanish , but I digress , because it would still be rather rude .
I guess Xenu does n’t hand out pills for intelligence .
As we will soon painfully realize , Americans in all corners of the country will soon become extremely acquainted with the Alt - A and Option ARM terminology .
These loans initially were thought to be much safer than those pesky subprime mortgages .
You know , the loans that were made to low income families that supposedly set off financial Armageddon ?
Option ARMs are simply ticking financial time bombs .
These loans are heavily concentrated in California and Florida .
Other states have these useless and putrid mortgage products but the aftermath and damage will be deeply felt in both coastal states .
If the country decides to create a “ bad bank ” ( as if current banks were any good ) , then other states are going to get a delicious buffet of these exotic scorpions on a stick , otherwise known as Option ARMs .
As the housing market bubble expanded like financial Jiffy Pop , lenders spurred by an insatiable appetite on Wall Street for mortgage securitizations ( read the super Mortgage Birth Story ) started pushing these once arcane and relatively unknown products .
First , let us assess what we will be dealing with :
An Option ARM is simply an adjustable rate mortgage made to a “ prime ” borrower with various payment options .
You need to remember that most subprime loans had high interest rates but most of the damage in that area has already passed .
The borrower with an Option ARM can choose to pay the fully amortizing interest and principal , the full interest , or an incredibly low teaser rate in which the loan negatively amortizes .
Guess which option the vast majority of borrowers opted for ?
With negative amortization , the incredible thing is the actual balance of the mortgage increased while the home price decreased !
These loans were spawned in the delusional world where real estate prices never went down and gold flowed from the toilets installed in 3,000 square foot McMansions .
So now , not only are people with these loans massively underwater they now have a mortgage that has grown like a Chia Pet .
How in the world did this mortgage garner so much fanfare ?
As I have been saying for a very long time , Option ARMs were simply a speculator product only viable in a real estate mania .
That is , many of the borrowers never expected to live in their home forever and they would simply sell the home off to a greater fool before R - Day came along .
Now it would appear the media is highlighting much of what I have been saying regarding these loans .
The Washington Post has an excellent article talking about the growing foreclosure crisis .
What I like about the piece is that it shows that some people losing these homes were simply speculators and delusional about the expectations they had with real estate and not a sob story .
I read the piece more as a study of the consumer psychology that permeated and infected bubble states like California and Florida .
Let us take a look at the option ARM break down :
The article focuses on the Inland Empire :
“ Of the 20 Zip codes with the highest share of underwater loans , seven are in California and four are in Riverside County , the vast exurb southeast of Los Angeles where the Bohnens live .
Riverside ’s unemployment rate has zoomed to 10 percent , well above the national average of 7.2 percent .
About 94,200 people in the county are looking for work , many of them formerly employed in the real estate , banking and construction industries , according to the county ’s economic development agency . ”
The piece focuses on the Inland Empire , which has been ravaged like a hyena eating a carcass by the recent bubble bursting .
Prices have cratered and unemployment has skyrocketed .
These areas are the reason California will not see any housing bottom until 2011 .
These areas also had an incestuous relationship with housing .
Big - ticket stores sold items to fill these big McMansions , paid realtors , lenders got their delicious cut , and all seemed glorious in housingland .
Now that the golden calf of real estate is gone , these communities are realizing why it is simply wrong to rely on one industry for growth especially if that industry is in an epic bubble .
The story does a good job highlighting the numbers by showing a couple of real world examples :
“ The home to the left is listed for $ 699,900 and the other for $ 725,000 .
She and her husband owe $ 932,000 on their house , so they ’re facing at least a $ 200,000 shortfall .
That ’s not what they expected when they bought their home two years ago .
The economy looked good then , the housing market was still thriving and the house seemed like a steal .
It was the cheapest available in the exclusive gated community that they had been eyeing for some time . ”
So what do you really do here ?
Realistically , prices are going to come down even lower and lower in a limbo to the bottom .
The problem arises when you anchor your belief in bubble world economics and now expect that prices will be rising in the future .
They bought at the peak and as the article highlights , they both had jobs dependent on the housing market thriving .
So now that the market has tanked , they are also facing the wrath of wage and salary deflation .
The end game is here and Option Pac - Man has run out of real estate dots to eat .
This is going on across the country but here in California , the concentration of Option ARMs has made the amount of money breathtaking .
The story in the Inland Empire is playing out multiple times a day like a broken cuckoo clock :
“ Now the Bohnens are tapped out .
They missed their third mortgage payment yesterday and can barely keep up with their homeowner association dues .
Their twins are in college and their 4 - year - old in day care .
They ’re working with a housing counselor to try to modify their loan . ”
Really , what can you do with a nearly $ 1 million loan ?
Their income is shrinking or stagnant while their mortgage payment is growing .
Before you feel sorry , you will want to hear what is going on in the trenches :
“ There ’s this easy come , easy go mentality , ” said Mike Novak - Smith , a real estate agent in Moreno Valley , a working - class part of the county .
“ Some people would rather hold onto their pickup truck or Mercedes than their homes . ”
I ’ve recently heard some Podcasts of the Dave Ramsey show .
I have multiple shows I listen to but some of his stories revolve around people paying down their debt .
And when I say pay down their debt , I mean everything .
Typically , he ’ll have a story about a family who paid off their $ 100,000 mortgage or someone who just wiped out $ 30,000 and do a radio celebration .
He ’ll ask how they did this and many times you ’ll hear things like :
“ I sold the boat . ”
“ We ate rice and beans for 5 years . ”
“ We ate out less . ”
“ I sold my luxury car and bought a used bucket . ”
It is a simple lesson in frugality .
Now , I usually smirk when I hear these stories because I compare them to the above case of someone moonwalking away from their home to spare the much needed Mercedes .
The psychology of many here in California during the boom was that the avalanche of debt would never catch up to them .
I still think that people do n’t realize how big a $ 500,000 mortgage is ( that was the peak median price of the state according to one data source ) .
Now with prices half off , people think this is the bottom and will somehow come back up .
They will not .
The troubling psychology behind this exposes what I have argued many times .
Many are living in a silent depression and most Californians were all hat and no cattle .
The fact that these people want to hold on to their luxury symbols is that most people probably believe that keeping the car would catch more eyeballs on the street .
After all , how many people see your pad ?
A car will be seen when you go out , go to work , and visit friends .
It is a perverted epidemic here in the state but the repo stats are showing that this too will pass .
We are living in a financial 1984 .
Many that look rich are broke and drowning in payments .
Debt is wealth .
Just to highlight how bad things are , here are more stats on the Inland Empire :
“ In 2006 , about 25 percent of Riverside County home buyers took out loans without making a down payment , according to SMR Research , which analyzes mortgage data .
For those borrowers , Novak - Smith says , their loan payments are akin to rent :
They essentially have no stake in their homes , which makes walking away easier . ”
And this is n’t only to beat up on the Inland Empire .
These loans found there way through the entire state of California .
The fact that 25 percent of people made no down payment is simply stunning .
That is , they have absolutely no skin in the game .
Here is a new twist to the psychology of these borrowers ; they view their loan payment as basically paying the rent .
In fact , it is worse .
At least when you sign a lease you can leave in a year if you like .
With these underwater mortgages , the only way out is via foreclosure or forking over tens of thousands of dollars for someone to buy your home .
Short - sales ?
Come on .
From people I ’ve talked to lenders did very little short - sales and the stats back this up .
With little skin in the game including from lenders , many are choosing to take a hit on their credit score .
Yet I would argue the majority actually have no money to make the new adjusted payment .
They do n’t have a choice .
Oh , but the game is n’t over yet :
“ I had one the other day and she ’s telling me , ‘ We ’re going to buy this other house and let the one we ’ve got go because it ’s a money pit , ” Clark said .
“ They have three homes , including a vacation home and rental property .
. . .
I keep telling people : ‘ You signed a promissory note .
You told the bank you ’d pay it back .
It ’s like marriage .
It ’s for better or worse . ”
Do n’t you feel sorry for someone with 3 homes including a vacation home and rental property ?
One quick thing our government can do to stop this moral hazard from getting worse is revamping the title check system .
Let us be honest .
Most loans are now government backed and sponsored .
As such , anyone looking to buy a home needs to have a deep title check and anyone with multiple homes or loans should be exempt from buying a new place with a government loan .
Period .
This is a perfect example .
I would suspect the above scenario is with someone with still good credit .
Keep in mind to make the teaser rate payment is easy .
It is when the recast hits that the problems begin for these uber speculators .
What they want to do is while their credit is pristine , buy another home at a rock bottom price and let their current home go back to the bank as a parting gift .
Is this really what we had in mind when we think of the poor family struggling to make a loan payment ?
I despise this scenario because it really keeps us from going forward with more sane policies .
I think of a family in Ohio or Michigan , states that have been struggling for years and a family with a $ 70,000 or $ 80,000 mortgage on a modest home .
The home may be worth $ 50,000 or $ 60,000 now .
In these cases , the government can step in to help and it would only cost maybe $ 10,000 or $ 20,000 .
The above California scenario would cost $ 200,000 to $ 250,000 assuming we use the $ 1 million home .
Is a family in California deserving of 20 or 25 times the help of someone in other states ?
I ’d actually argue the family above should have their vacation home yanked to pay for their current home .
And government help especially in option ARM and Alt - A orgy states like California are a waste of time :
“ Federal regulators recently held a one - day seminar in Riverside for troubled IndyMac customers interested in a loan modification .
About 4,200 were invited .
Only 250 showed up , half of whom probably will not qualify for a more affordable loan . ”
Bwahaha !
This is exactly what I have been talking about in my article moonwalking away from your home mortgage .
The government is assuming these people actually want to stay in their home .
They want to stay in their home as long as they make a profit .
They are speculators .
They are no better than the banks that made these insane loans .
They married each other and now want others to suffer the ills of their mortgage divorce .
That is why I am so disgusted by the $ 700 billion TARP and this notion of a bad bank that is now making the rounds .
What I am for is cram - downs .
These people with no skin in the game need to be held accountable just like banks .
If a bad bank is set up , you can bet your skin that the vast amount of loans in terms of nominal value will come from California and Florida .
Many lenders are holding on to these toxic assets just anxiously waiting for that bad bank to get started so they can dump them off to you .
That is right .
You will own these loans .
How does that make you feel ?
Before you answer , we already can see that what we ’ve been predicting is coming to light :
“ Already , 24 percent of option ARMs were at least two months late in September , up from 5 percent a year ago , said Mahesh Swaminathan , a Credit Suisse mortgage strategist . ”
So much for blaming this entire mess on poor inner city subprime borrowers .
That mess is largely over .
We are now dealing with the mania and speculation of greed from borrowers and lenders on supposedly prime candidates .
But you ’ll love how people are rationalizing this entire thing :
“ Did you know that the housing market was going to collapse ? ” she says to her husband .
“ Did you know I was going to lose my store ?
Did you know you were going to lose your job ?
Come on .
There was no reason to believe any of this would happen .
It ’s not like we did anything impulsive .
You ’ve been doing this job for 10 years and making good money . ”
“ Twelve years , ” he said .
“ It ’s been 12 years . ”
Just because you have n’t seen a black swan does not mean the world lacks this species .
They did do something impulsive like running off to Vegas to get hitched by an Elvis impersonator .
They bought and over leveraged themselves .
No one told them to sign for a home that almost takes them into a 7 - figure debt .
They did n’t live prudently .
You think having a million dollar home is a constitutional right ?
There were many legitimate and rational reasons to believe this was going to happen .
Yet how can you argue with those blinded by the rose - colored glasses of greed and delusion manifested by their own pipe dreams of being mini Trumps ?
If they think things will be better soon , they can look at Japan who has seen virtually no growth in real estate prices for 20 years after their stock market and real estate crash .
12 years may actually be the time it takes for us to see California prices ramp up again .

筆者は以前，ある中 堅SEから「馬場さん，私はお客様の部長や課長と話す機会がほとんどありません。どうすれば機会が作れるでしょうか」と聞かれたことがある。また，別のSEから「担当者が反対するのではないかと思うと，なかなか部長や課長と直接話すことができないのです。何か良い方法はないでしょうか」「お客様の部長や課長と会っても形式的な話しかされません。なかなか突っ込んだ話ができないのです。どうすれば良いのでしょうか」という質問をもらったこともある。
SEが顧客の部課長の考えや意見をいかに把握しているか，部長や課長にいかにプロジェクトに参画してもらうかは，そのプロジェクトの進ちょくや成否を大きく左右する。また，SEは誰しも自分たちがやっているシステム開発・導入や保守・運用などのプロジェクトを顧客の部課長がどのように見ているか気になるものだ。それが分かれば，より満足のいく仕事のやり方を考えるからだ。もちろん，それはビジネスにとってもプラスになる。それほど，SEが顧客の部課長を訪問し仕事の話をすることは重要である。だが，SEの多くは部課長訪問を苦手としている。そこで，今回から数回にわたって，SEの部課長訪問について筆者の考えを述べる。
初めてのプロジェクトで徹底的に訪問する
SEが顧客の部課長訪問に強くなるには，プロジェクトの責任ある立場に“初めてなったとき”に徹底的に部課長を訪問することが重要だ。すなわち，プロジェクト・リーダーやサブリーダーに初めてなったときだ。仕事によっては若いときにその立場になったり中堅SEのときになったりするが，そのときに徹底的に部課長訪問を行ない，勉強することだ。するとその後，別の顧客に対しても部課長訪問ができるようになるものだ。
しかし，SEは誰しも部課長訪問をやりたいと思っても，初めてのときは悩む。「偉い人が自分のようなペイペイのSEに会ってもらえるだろうか」とか「どんなことを言われるだろうか」などと考えて悩む，そして部課長訪問をちゅうちょする。そして避けたくなる。この大きな壁にぶつかる。
部課長訪問のきっかけを作る
その壁を突破するには，部課長訪問のきっかけを作ることが重要だ。筆者も例に漏れず20代のころその壁にぶつかった。ある小規模プロジェクトを担当したときだった。「お客様の○○部長や△△課長は俺たちのサポートをどう思っているのだろうか」と思ったり，「今，プロジェクトではユーザー部門に協力してもらえなくて困っているが，○○部長や△△課長はこの状況をご存知だろうか？頼めばユーザー部門を動かしてもらえるだろうか」などと思ったりしていた。だが「会ってもらえるかな，どんなことを言われるかな」と考えると，怖くてなかなか部課長を訪問できなかった。
それを，ある先輩の営業担当者に話してみた。彼は黙って聞いていたが，数日後「馬場，今週金曜の午後1時から□□顧客の○○部長のところに一緒に行くから，時間を空けておけ」と言われた。筆者は「？」と思ったが，言われた通りにして，その日一緒に訪問した。
すると，その先輩の営業担当者は「○○部長，今日は仕事の話ではありません。SEの馬場が部長と話ができないと言っているので，雑談しに伺いました」と言われた。そこで彼は筆者を前面に出すよう気を使いながら，会社の話や最近の製品の話や野球の話など雑談した。そして最後に「○○部長，今度は馬場が今のプロジェクトの状況を話しますからよろしく」と話し，部長も「では馬場さんよろしく」と言われた。
そこまでセットされたら逃げることはできない。翌週○○部長に，現在行なっているプロジェクトの状況や問題点を冷や汗をかきながら説明し，部長の考えも聞いた。その経験をしてからは，定期的に部長や課長に仕事の状況を報告したり問題点を説明したりしていた。いつも緊張はしたがだんだんと怖くはなくなった。これが筆者の部課長訪問の最初の体験である。その後，いろいろな顧客を担当したが，部課長訪問を積極的にやってそのやり方に次第になれていった。
そして，いろいろなことを学んだ。例えば「部課長の方々は何を考えているのか」「部課長の考えは担当者の考えとは必ずしも同じではない」「担当者にはできないことも部課長にはやってもらえる」「部課長はプロジェクトの状況説明をSEに期待し，IT技術についてもっと知りたいと思っている」「どんなユーザーも部課長が考えていることは同じである」ことなどを知った。そして筆者自身の視野が広がったと思う。また，どんな顧客の部課長訪問も抵抗がなくなった。
そうした経験は，多くのプロジェクトで役立った。筆者は若いSE時代に部課長訪問のきっかけを作ってくれた営業担当者の先輩には，今でも感謝している。そして，SEマネジャ時代は部下に同じようなことをやった。部下のSEを連れて顧客の部課長を訪問し，SEを逃げられないようにして積極的に部課長訪問をさせた。効果は十分あったと思う。今でもある後輩はお酒を飲んだときなどに「若いSE時代，“○○部長に△△の説明をして来い”と馬場さんに言われて困った」など言う。
現在，部課長訪問で悩んでいるプロジェクト・リーダーやサブリーダーは営業担当者や上司に頼み，同行して訪問のきっかけを作ってもらうことが重要である。また，SEマネジャは部下のために積極的に部下の部課長訪問のきっかけを作ることだ。
自分できっかけを作 る
だが，SEマネジャの中には自分で部課長訪問ができない人がいる。そんな上司を持つプロジェクト・リーダーやサブリーダーは，営業担当者に頼むか自分で道を切り開くしかない。それには例えば，顧客の部課長と廊下で会ったらあいさつしたり，親睦会やたばこ部屋などでは積極的に話をしたりして，自分できっかけを作ることだ。
年末は，顧客の部課長訪問のきっかけを作るチャンスだ。部課長に自分で年末のあいさつをすることだ。そして「今年は大変お世話になりました。我々は一生懸命やりました。来年も頑張りますからよろしくお願いします」という類の話をすることだ。すると来年早々に部課長に「ちょっと時間を頂けませんか」と頼めば仕事の話ができる時間をとってもらえるものだ。SEはいろいろな機会を見つけてきっかけを意識して作ることが肝要だ。きっかけを作れないと，いつまで経っても部課長訪問はできない。
以上 ，SEの部課長訪問の “ きっかけ作り ” について述べた。読者の方々の意見はどうだろうか？次回は，部課長訪問時の注意点などについて述べる。
Have you ever been to a McDonald 's and noticed someone complaining about their weight ?
Ever notice that same 300 lb person ordering two big Macs , french fries and what must be a liter Coke ?
But what 's even worse is when they blame McDonald's ?
Sorry people ; you have to take responsibility for what you eat .
If McDonald 's makes you fat do n't eat there .
I can't help but feel a similar reaction to some of the response to Microsoft 's recent lawsuit against TomTom .
I 've previously taken Microsoft to task for spreading FUD and failing to disclose what patents , if any , they claim Linux infringes .
Set aside for the moment the real and serious questions of software patents and the extent to which our existing patent system is broken .
Those questions are orthogonal to the point I 'd like to make today : the computer industry as a whole has to accept some responsibility for the situation we are in today with respect to usage of Microsoft 's 's FAT filesystem .
We have to accept some responsibility , stop whining , and do something about it .
It 's time that we " Get the FAT Out . "
One of my first system programming jobs was building a network file system interface based on the filesystem in MS - DOS : Microsoft 's File Allocation Table or FAT filesystem .
Unfortunately , those of us who have PhDs in computer disciplines and have studied operating systems and file systems , do n't see anything particularly innovative in FAT or it's extension to support longer file names , FAT32 .
( The original FAT only supported a fixed 11 characters for the file name .
FAT32 extended that to support long file names . )
I say unfortunately because the industry has treated FAT and FAT32 as open , industry standard formats .
We all share some culpability in this ; including Microsoft .
But Microsoft , like McDonald's , has little incentive to disabuse us of our self delusion .
It appears that FAT32 is covered by Microsoft patents # 5,579,517 and # 5,758,352 on techniques for implementing a " common name space for long and short filenames . "
Thus FAT32 is not an open and unencumbered technology .
Again , I think many of us in the industry would vigorously disagree that the techniques covered are truly patentable .
Unfortunately that 's not our choice to make .
In early 2006 the USPTO upheld the validity of Microsoft 's patents on elements of the FAT filesystem .
Eben Moglen has been warning us for some time that this could be a problem for the industry .
Yet in spite of this the industry has continued down a path where FAT has become the default filesystem of choice in much digital media .
Amazon Kindle uses FAT .
Google Android uses FAT .
Virtually every digital camera uses FAT .
Rather than continue to delude ourselves that this technology is open and unencumbered it 's time for the industry to " Get the FAT Out " and aggressively move to a truly open and unencumbered industry standard filesystem format .
There are several to choose from : pick your favorite Linux filesystem such as ext2 for example .
Ext2 is arguably technically superior to FAT as well .
Plus it 's open source .
The software is already available under an open source license .
In 1989 Unisys " discovered " a patent that it held on LZW compression that was applicable to the popular GIF graphic format .
What the industry had thought was a free an open specification suddenly was encumbered .
The industry responded with " Burn All GIFs " , an effort to encourage the industry to switch to a truly open and unencumbered format such as PNG .
It 's time we did the same with FAT .
It 's time we stopped eating at McDonald's .
It time for us to " Get the FAT Out " .
President Obama ( never get sick of typing that ) has some strong words for the Wall Street companies who , per the New York Times ' reporting , rewarded their incompetence with a whopping $ 18.4 billion in bonuses last year .
AP :
" Outrageous . "
That 's President Barack Obama 's one - word reaction to a report that Wall Street employees got more than $ 18 billion in bonuses last year .
Said Obama : " That is the height of irresponsibility .
It is shameful . "
The president said he and new Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner will have direct conversations with corporate leaders to make the point .
Obama said there is a time for corporate leaders to make profits and get paid bonuses but now is " not that time . "
" Outrageous " is precisely the word .
The same people who two months ago came to Congress with hats in hand and took a boatload of taxpayer money are now doling out billions in " bonuses " ?
Bonuses ?
Are n't you supposed to get a bonus when you do something well ?
Immorality is literally disgusting : it appears to provoke an ancient brain system designed to identify rotten food .
Disgust was observed in test subjects who , given an unfair offer in a money - splitting game , literally turned up their noses .
The response was the same as to foul - tasting drinks and disgusting pictures .
" Our idea is that morality builds upon an old mental reflex , " said study co-author Adam Anderson , a University of Toronto psychologist .
" The brain had already discovered a system for rejecting things that are bad for it .
Then it co-opted this and attached it to conditions much removed from something tasting or smelling bad . "
Though philosophers have traditionally considered morality to be the pinnacle of purely rational thought , scientists have wondered whether emotion might also play a role .
Foremost among these emotions is disgust .
The latest findings , published Thursday in Science , suggest a key role for the neurobiology of disgust , though Anderson notes that it's not the entirety of morality .
" You reject food that 's unsafe to eat , " said Anderson .
" In moral cognition , you reject an action .
We can't point to what comes first , but I do n't think it 's disgust .
They 're wrapped together , and disgust influences the decision being made . "
Anderson 's team recorded the facial reactions of people as they drank sweet , tasteless and bitter liquids , then looked at sad , neutral and disgusting photographs .
From their reactions the researchers created a composite image ; disgust clearly produced " activation of the levator labii region " — in layman 's terms , a scrunched nose and raised upper lip .
Test subjects then played a game in which two people split 10 dollars , with the first player deciding the split and the second given the choice of taking or leaving it .
Presented with unbalanced allotments — nine dollars for the first player , one dollar for the second — most test subjects called the offers unfair , said they felt disgusted , and rejected the money with an expression of distaste on their face .
In evolutionary terms , levator labii activation makes sense : foul odors or stray food particles are blocked from entering the nose and mouth .
It also makes sense , said Anderson , for this tendency —
rather than , say , the confusion of fear , or the blind aggression of anger — to be adapted for guiding responses to unacceptable social situations .
In a critique accompanying the article , University of Pennsylvania psychologists Paul Rozin and Jonathan Haidt , along with University of
Virginia psychologist Katrina Fincher , were unconvinced by the results .
" It 's unclear whether it's ' the same ' disgust " aroused by immorality as by rotten food , they write , " or just common elements in the output system . "
Reactions to moral situations , they say , need to be tested before the role of disgust is clear .
But to Anderson , if people look disgusted and say they feel disgusted , then they 're disgusted — and even if they did n't feel exactly the same about lowball offers as nauseating drinks , there was plenty of overlap .
" It 's less important that the reactions are absolutely similar than generally similar , " he said .
Disgusted test subjects reported feeling other emotions , including anger , fear and sadness , though disgust was most pronounced .
To see if other types of cultural socialization might produce moral reactions with different physiological guides , Anderson plans to conduct the experiment with people from non-English speaking cultures .
" In a more collectivist culture , where part of being a person is being enmeshed in this larger cultural framework , maybe people would feel sadness as someone cheats them , " he said .
Asked whether the findings suggest that moral judgments are dictated by physiology , Anderson stressed that morality is far more complicated .
" It involves a lot of thinking .
Our results show that part of our moral compass is being guided by these older brain structures — but that 's not the whole story , " he said .
" This system does n't make decisions of fairness and unfairness .
That happens in a higher - order part of the brain that feeds down to the primitive system , which feeds back up to the thinking centers .
Emotion and cognition are intertwined . "
Neither do the findings suggest a free pass for wrongdoers who would dismiss morality as a side effect of evolutionary jury - rigging .
After all , babies are capable of disgust , but can't make adult judgments .
" Moral judgments involve something that 's cultivated , " said Anderson .
" When you start talking about the brain , it does n't release people from culpability or responsibility . "

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A man who drove up to the U.S. Capitol complex and told police he had a delivery for President Barack Obama was arrested by police after telling them he had a rifle in his truck , police said on Tuesday .
The man “ told officers that he had a delivery for President Obama so the officers began to question him further and he admitted to having a rifle in his truck , ” said Kimberly Schneider , a spokeswoman for the U.S. Capitol Hill Police .
The man , Alfred Brock , 64 , of Winnfield , Louisiana , has been charged with possession of an unregistered firearm and possession of unregistered ammunition , Schneider said .
CNN showed police removing a rifle from his truck .
Police also found several rounds of ammunition in it , Schneider said .
If you ’re looking for the cause of the most recent Israeli aggression against the Palestinians  over 300 killed so far , and many more wounded  forget Hamas .
The real casus belli is politics , in Israel and America .
On the Israeli front , elections loom large .
The current Israeli government is enormously unpopular , and  with polls showing a massive swing to the right  this latest " incursion " is its last attempt to shore up their sagging power base .
The rightist surge in Israel has been building for a long time , with the settler movement gaining momentum and the Likud Party likely the chief beneficiary  in which case there will be no chance of a peaceful settlement of the Palestinian question , no matter how evenhanded President Barack Obama turns out to be .
Speaking of Obama , the real focal point of the Israeli assault is n’t Gaza  it ’s Washington , D.C.
The whole point of this exercise in futility  which will not create a single iota of security for Israel , will not topple Hamas , and will not prove any more successful than the second Lebanese war  is to set the terms by which the Israelis will deal with the incoming U.S. president .
Before he even gets a chance to appoint his Middle East team , his special envoys and advisers , the Israelis will have sabotaged the peace effort they can clearly see coming  and put the Americans on notice that whatever " change " is in the air will have to be to Israel ’s advantage .
In short , the Gaza massacre is a preemptive strike against the prospect of American intervention on the Palestinians ’ behalf , or , at least , a more evenhanded policy framework .
I wo n’t bother answering the " talking points " of Israel ’s powerful lobby in the U.S.  the Palestinians are terrorists , they deserved what they got , those missile barrages fired in recent weeks ( in which not a single Israeli was killed ) were ample provocation , etc .
The whole world knows that none of these have anything to do with the latest Israeli military action .
The entire operation is , instead , part and parcel of a long - standing concerted campaign by the Israeli government to further marginalize and drive out the remnants of the Palestinian people who still cling tenaciously to what ’s left of their land .
It is a policy of military and economic warfare , aimed at making life impossible for the Palestinian helots .
As the new Sparta of the Middle East runs roughshod over the laws of morality and basic human decency , Israel ’s amen corner in the U.S. is going into overdrive in an effort to prettify one of the ugliest incidents in a decade of unmitigated cruelty and brutality .
All the familiar " progressive " voices  with certain sterling exceptions  are suddenly stilled : we hear nothing from our Democratic politicians , those fabled agents of " change , " except expressions of support for Israel ’s war crimes .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi declares that Israel has " the right to defend itself , " without deigning to inform us as to whether the Palestinians have the same right .
Given her record as AIPAC ’s most reliable congressional ally , who can always be counted on to echo the Israel - first party line , one assumes not .
Powerful foreign affairs committee chair Howard Berman concurs , as does our about - to - be - sworn - in chief executive .
Appearing on Face the Nation , Obama ’s chief adviser , David Axelrod , averred that " we have only one president at a time "  a consideration that has n’t stopped the world ’s most famous community organizer from publicly organizing the biggest raid on the U.S. Treasury in American history .
In any case , as the Huffington Post put it , Axelrod " did reaffirm Obama ’s commitment to the ‘ special relationship between the United States and Israel ’ in a way that suggested general sympathy for the Jewish state ’s actions . "
For all those hysterical ultra-Zionists in both Israel and the U.S. who thought Obama ’s election would be disastrous to the Zionist project , and their own efforts to expand it beyond its historic borders , let this be an object lesson in the danger of jumping to unwarranted conclusions .
If they ’d listened before they jumped  or paid attention to what they read on Antiwar.com  they would have realized how utterly misplaced their paranoia would turn out to be .
Obama has been in the Israel Lobby ’s back pocket from the beginning , as his speech to AIPAC  a masterstroke of groveling  made all too clear .
Like all U.S. presidents since Bush the Elder , this one is committed to maintaining and elaborating on our Israel - centric Middle East policy , of which the Iraq war was only the most dramatic chapter .
Obama may have opposed that particular war , but he will do nothing to reverse its consequences , the most dramatic of which appears to be the unleashing of the Israeli military machine on the region .
First it was Lebanon , followed by the buzzing of Syrian airspace and the bombing of an alleged " nuclear facility " that turned out to be an ordinary weapons dump .
Now we have the end of " disengagement " in Gaza and the opening up of a new front in Israel ’s relentless war of expansion .
It is a war that has been financed by U.S. tax dollars and fought with American weapons , with the active collaboration and support of our government .
We have paid for the radical expansion of the Israeli " settlements " by armed bands of ultra-nationalist fanatics , Israel ’s version of the Taliban .
Indeed , Israeli opinion is moving rapidly in the radicals ’ direction , and the victory of Benjamin Netanyahu and the far - right Likud Party in the upcoming election is virtually assured  with even more extreme elements waiting in the wings for their moment .
As the leaders of a settler colony implanted in the midst of Arab lands , the founders of the Israeli state were faced with a conundrum from the very start .
No matter how enlightened and progressive the early settlers considered themselves , they could not escape their status as unwanted interlopers , the advance guard of what was essentially a foreign invasion .
Living in their utopian kibbutzes and thinking they were constructing an egalitarian paradise , what they were really building was a rigidly hierarchical society , a caste system with the settlers and their descendants at the top , arranged in tiers according to their origins in the " diaspora , " with the Palestinians at the very bottom  a displaced underclass forcibly segregated and routinely subjected to Israeli state violence .
Like a caged lion , grievously wounded , which nevertheless manages to roar and occasionally strike out  however ineffectually  at its tormentors , the Palestinian people are unbowed .
The Israelis  and the U.S.  rail against Hamas as a gang of terrorists , yet most of the governments of the region started out as " terrorist " gangs .
Two were called the Irgun and the Haganah , the revolutionary movements that carried out attacks on civilians , including the British as well as the Arabs , in their battle to establish the state of Israel .
Hamas will do no more , and no less , in their bid to establish a Palestinian state .
If nothing else , this fresh paroxysm of Israeli aggression ought to debunk , once and for all , the neocon talking point that democracies never go to war with each other .
Yet here we have a country that styles itself an island of Western - style liberalism in a sea of Oriental despotism going to war with the only other democratically elected government in the immediate vicinity .
Whatever the military outcome of the present conflict  in all likelihood a stalemate  this is a big political victory for Hamas , which ordinary Palestinians see actively defending them against the rampaging Israelis .
The moderates on the West Bank are undercut , once again , and that has always been the Israeli strategy .
Their first target was the decidedly secular Palestine Liberation Organization , which they did everything to destroy and undercut  even to the point of providing legal status and covert funding to Hamas .
These followers of radical Islamist preachers began as a religious association , formally registered with the Israeli authorities .
Hamas was encouraged as a potentially more compliant competitor with the PLO .
Another case of blowback , with a vengeance .
Having given birth to the monster of Hamas , the mutant offspring of occupation and dispossession , the Israelis will be forgiven if they refuse to acknowledge the family resemblance .
Yet it is unmistakable .
Both Israel and Hamas - stan are the spawn of religious and ethnic exclusivism and messianism , their leaders fanatics armed with state power .
There are differences , of course , a major one being that one side is funded to the tune of $ 3 billion a year and supported unconditionally by Washington , while the Palestinians  shot at by their fellow Arabs as they try to cross the border into Egypt  stand pretty much alone .
This latest bloody chapter in the tragic history of the region is being written because all the main protagonists benefit : the Israelis , Hamas , and radicals of all stripes , especially those groups aligned with al - Qaeda .
As in the case of the Iraq war , bin Laden ’s narrative of an Israeli - Crusader invasion intent on stamping out Islam is seemingly verified as blood flows freely in the streets of Gaza .
The Israeli rampage is not in our interests , and the longer it continues the more it threatens the already tenuous position of U.S. troops in Iraq , endangering them by inflaming the local populace , which is vehemently pro-Palestinian .
The Israeli blitz is sending shockwaves through the region that could upset several apple - carts of U.S. construction , including the regime in Egypt , the pro-U.S. Jordanian monarchy , and especially our rambunctious Iraqi protectorate , where anti-U.S. sentiment is not so quietly building .
Quite naturally , the Israelis care not a fig for any of this .
That ’s what ’s so " special " about the much - vaunted " special relationship " between Israel and the U.S. , in which Uncle Sam plays the part of the henpecked husband who always gives in to the demands of his battle - ax of a wife , no matter how extravagant or unreasonable .
If American interests in the region are to be served , then this unhealthy relationship has to change .
Yet it wo n’t change until and unless the political power of the Israel Lobby is broken on the home front .
If it takes the prospect of World War III to bring us to that point , it will be far too high a price to pay  yet one that seems increasingly unavoidable .
A new year is usually a time for hope .
But today many of us are full of doubt .
The financial crisis has brought wave after wave of bad news , replacing the old certainties with a sense of dread and insecurity .
And then there 's terrorism , climate change and social breakdown ...
Are our nightmares based in reality or are we the victims of a very modern kind of mass hysteria ?
Out with the old ... in with a new age of anxiety
In the week that Lehman Brothers needed $ 20 bn to stay afloat , I needed £ 10,000 .
It was mid-September and we were at the end of a gruelling house renovation " project " ( what on earth could we have been thinking of ? ) that had sucked up more money than I cared to add up and the builder was waiting for his final payment .
No problem , I 'd thought , we 'll just add it to the mortgage .
Seeing as it was a relatively modest amount , I guessed a phone call would do it .
After all , when I 'd organised the loan a year before , they had seemed happy for me to take much more than I had bargained for .
That was then , though , way before Northern Rock , and now , in the week of the world 's biggest bankruptcy , it quickly became clear a phone call would no longer do it ; £ 10,000 was suddenly an awful lot of money .
In order even to ask for it , my full medical history was apparently required ( " Have you ever suffered from anxiety or depression ? "
" Um , not until now ... " ) .
And since my wife had an account in her maiden name , a marriage licence was called for .
Between us , we had banked with our mortgage provider for 40 years , I pointed out .
We already had a mortgage with them .
They understood that , sir , but they also needed posted proof of my current address ; a couple of utility bills and a council tax account agreement would do it .
But , I said , you send our statements to this address already .
They understood that , too , sir .
And then , after that , there would be a three - or four - week period in which a full credit check would be carried out .
We are talking about an extra payment of £ 47.32 per month here , yes ?
We are , sir .
September passed and October .
Credit crunched ; Gordon Bailout did his desperate stuff .
And I spent much of November engaged in character - building trials of mental fortitude with my bank 's call centre .
We are just connecting you , sir , again , with a screeching noise that will persist until you start the whole press - three - if - you - have - an- existing - mortgage process once more or until your will finally breaks and you exact immediate physical revenge at your nearest branch .
By this time , my builder was keen for his cheque ; he'd just had a new baby , Christmas was coming .
I called again .
My broker was not himself available , but a member of his " pod " was happily around to discover that , actually yes , the application had been turned down .
Was there a reason , I wondered , beyond the fact that the entire financial world was dissolving ?
Yes , sir , it says here you were late with a credit card payment in November 2007 .
It 's not exactly evidence of a life of reckless fiscal abandon , is it ?
It 's an automatic refusal .
Was his pod going to inform me of this ?
A letter does appear to have been sent ; have you changed your address , sir ?
I proceeded to offer a hastily improvised analysis of the self - serving hypocrisy of the nation 's financial system , and of banking call centres , which had always told us they liked to say yes and now just thought they could say no and hang up , not forgetting , of course , the " invisible sodding hand " of the bonus culture that got us into this mess with all of its insane risk - taking with our money ; it was a speech he gave the impression of having heard several times before .
The next day , an unnaturally cheerful woman called from India to wonder if I had 10 minutes to complete a customer satisfaction survey on my recent mortgage application .
Would I say " on balance that I was very satisfied , moderately satisfied or not satisfied at all with the customer experience I 'd had ? "
Where to begin ?
We managed in the end to cobble the builder 's money together , but in the nights that followed , I found myself suddenly awake and sweating at two and three in the morning , imagining myself holed up with Little Dorrit in the Marshalsea .
The radio alarmed me before it was light with talk of a squeeze and , never requiring much excuse to wake up worrying , I felt that squeeze somewhere in my throat .
I was not alone .
By November , the BBC was reporting a survey that showed that half the population of Britain was sleeping more fitfully than a year ago .
A quarter of those surveyed were waking up " more than three times a night " , with two - thirds blaming " money and work worries " for their insomnia .
Like many of us , I 've always lived with the sense of being about three pay cheques away from the Big Issue , but that sense has in recent years been softened by the idea that someone , somewhere would always be around to lend some cheap money .
( Failing that , there was always the house to sell : ha . )
Debt had not been hard to come by ; it was positively encouraged .
I 'd proved that point to myself three years previously when , for an article , I 'd spent the morning responding to all those flirty , unasked - for offers of credit cards with childish names - Egg and Smile and Goldfish - that made punitive interest rates seem like a primary coloured land of opportunity .
On that occasion , I had raised a theoretical £ 100,000 by simply offering up my mother 's maiden name repeatedly for a couple of hours .
That mood , I 'd seen first - hand at the time , was dangerously infectious .
I 'd also been round various debt agencies and met the people who had taken up all of those offers for real and were living in fear of the consolidated consequences .
It remained infectious right up until last September .
There was an extraordinary questionnaire carried out last July for the World Social Survey , one which future analysts of the great downturn of 2008 may find instructive .
The survey proposed the idea that urban life was shaped by fear and addressed the question of what people in the 10 major cities of the world - from Cairo to Beijing - were most worried about .
Londoners , it turned out in the ancient history of July 2008 , were the least anxious people , but it was what they were actually anxious about that was most telling .
Whereas in New York , where the new sub - prime reality had already taken hold , three of the top five worries listed were " not being able to maintain the same standard of living in the future " ( 17 per cent of respondents ) , " becoming jobless " ( 10 per cent ) , " fear that my children 's lives will be worse than mine " ( 10 per cent ) , in London , these worries did not even register anywhere in the top eight .
They were not only eclipsed by the biggest anxiety ( " losing loved ones " : 12 per cent ) , they also were felt less keenly than " being the victim of a natural disaster , tsunami , earthquake etc " ( 2.5 per cent ) , " being the victim of mass epidemic or food poisoning " ( 2.2 per cent ) and " remaining alone " ( 1.8 per cent ) .
Can there have been any other time in modern history when we had been so blithely unconcerned about our financial security than last July ?
But that was then : BC , before crunch .
Credit is rooted in the Latin credere , " to believe " .
Financial credit depends not only on a lender 's belief in you - and your mental health - but also on your belief in them - and theirs .
The sleepless anxiety with which at least half of us are facing the New Year is a crisis not only of liquidity but of faith .
Much that we believed in has , since September , melted into air and even Gordon Brown 's borrowed billions are n't enough to make it come true again .
There are many things that , as a result , already seem very 2008 .
There are the smaller things : bottled water , say , or £ 60 tickets to a bore - draw in the Premier League or letting your children download stuff with your credit card .
Then there are bigger things , too , like worries about work - life imbalance ( better than no - work - life balance ) , property ladders ( remember them ? ) , early retirement ( 70 if you are lucky ) , me- lancing , downshifting , sabbaticals ...
The main thing we have lost , though , is the seductive idea that , somehow , our future might follow a predictable pattern .
It was always a myth , this , and one not shared in the overwhelming majority of the world .
I was in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in September , an awfully long way from where our generally abundant nation was fretting about its mortgage extensions and its job prospects , and I wondered just how the people there - who had lived with war for 15 years - coped psychologically with the constant fears of their lives .
Why were n't they all on the verge of a nervous breakdown ?
How could they sit and laugh in the sun ?
The most plausible answer was that they did not have even the luxury of anxiety ; their expectation of security had never extended much beyond the next hour or two .
Anxiety is a disease of relative plenty ; it arises not from fear at what you do not have , but fear of what you might lose .
I spent the Christmas holiday anxiously reading Patricia Pearson 's recently published A Brief History of Anxiety .
Being anxious was not a recognised mental state , really , until the advent of Freud and paid - for psychiatry , and " stress - related illnesses " did not become the leading cause of absenteeism from work until work was readily available and the welfare state made provision for panic attacks .
The idea that we lived in an Age of Anxiety was coined by WH Auden exactly 60 years ago , just after the war .
It was a replacement for the age of terror and dread that had just ended , a shadow of those more visceral fears .
In industrialised nations since then , anxiety has co-existed with the idea that you had something stable to protect - a home , a family , savings , pension provision - and nurture .
Fears of uncertainty and disaster , though often remote from many of those lives , were still hard - wired in those heads , however , and so found what object they could ( hence in July 2008 the fears of tsunamis and pandemic among Londoners ) .
The more you had to protect , the greater the potential anxiety about what might threaten it .
The brain chemistry of anxiety , I discovered in Pearson 's book , works like a child 's fear of the dark .
It is irrational but often overwhelming .
The almond - shaped amygdala in the temporal lobes act as mission control for mammalian fear and when anxiety is triggered they send out alarm signals that easily overpower any kind of rational rejoinder or positive sentiment .
Neurologically , we have evolved to be far more sensitive to these irrational fears at night - that is when bad things used to happen to our Stone Age ancestors - and that is why we wake up at 3 am , fretting about events beyond our control , and wondering if we should turn over the back garden to subsistence crops .
Even if you were not an estate agent or an employee at Woolworths , there have been , over the last few months , many things to fuel such 3 am thoughts .
There was in the first instance the abrupt trauma of replacing one seductive fiction - that of endless boom - for another , the apparent possibility of endless bust , ' the Death of Capitalism ' , ' the Age of Scarcity ' and so on .
Some of this trauma had to do with numbers .
For a long while , it has seemed that numbers in newspapers , especially relating to money , looked barely credible , apparently random and , therefore , unnerving - how could oligarchs , footballers , bankers be that wealthy ?
How could , for example , the bonuses paid in 2007 to New York employees of Lehman Brothers , months before it collapsed , really amount to $ 5,700,000,000 ?
After September , the figures took that surreal quality to new extremes .
For a few weeks , and to a certain extent subsequently , everything that mattered seemed to be measured in tens of billions .
The numbers reminded me of that old joke : two men in a bar , towards closing time , challenging each other to name the biggest number in the world .
The first thinks for a long time before triumphantly announcing : " Eighty - seven ! "
The second , after some consideration , blearily impressed , replies : " OK .
You win . "
Except , on this occasion , no one won .
The numbers just got more preposterously large .
Why a £ 50bn bailout , why not a £ 500 bn one ?
What , in anyone 's head , was the difference ?
And once it became clear that the figures were being dreamt up by politicians not because they bore any calculated response to a problem but in the hope that their size alone would restore confidence to people used to checking the sixth zero on their payslip , who would n't lie awake anxious ?
Could this crisis really warrant ( in today 's figures ) the combined cost of the Marshall Plan , the Nasa space programme and the Vietnam War to be agreed as emergency finance by the end of the afternoon ?
Apparently it could .
With those figures disappeared any sense of proportionality .
We were apparently no longer facing a recession but a return of the Great Depression itself .
Though some suggested 1993 and 1983 as a comparison , many commentators , watching their pensions dwindling by the second , spurred on by their almond - shaped amygdala , took to comparing the present moment with the months before the Wall Street Crash .
Part of this was geographical ; if you had grown up , as I had , in the industrial Midlands , say , or the north of England or Wales or Scotland or Northern Ireland , present insecurities had a familiar taste from the Thatcher years .
But if you had lived your life in the south east , as had most of the financial services employees initially threatened by the recession , then the previous downturns had likely passed you by and the crisis close to home looked very much like a new kind of catastrophe .
In A History of Anxiety , Pearson suggests that one of the reasons we find it hard to allay irrational fears is that we have no irrational rituals to counter them .
Most children no longer pray at bedtime ; perhaps , Pearson suggests , if things get really bad , it is a habit we will all rediscover .
One of the most unfortunate aspects of the current crisis , you might argue , is that it coincided with the nadir in popularity of the prime minister .
Early on , when he stopped dithering about Northern Rock , Gordon Brown discovered a curious fact .
The worse the situation was perceived to be , the more his popularity soared .
Thereafter the zeros kept coming .
' If the financial system has a defect , ' historian Niall Ferguson wrote in The Ascent of Money , published in August , ( surely one of the least well - timed titles of all time ) , " it is that it reflects and magnifies what we human beings are like .
As we are learning from a growing volume of research in the field of behavioural finance , money amplifies our tendency to overreact , to swing from exuberance when things are going well to deep depression when they go wrong .
Booms and busts are products , at root , of our emotional volatility . "
And have we ever been more emotionally volatile , more in thrall to our sensations than now ?
We had become used to viewing all our neuroses as crises ; now a genuine crisis was upon us , it was a cataclysm .
Atheist or believer , we have in the last decade been primed for an end - time of sorts , with a stock of latent fears ready and waiting : there was the ongoing unease about terrorism , a fear that had been stoked so regularly by politicians that it almost seemed to have become a constant white noise .
There was the overriding anxiety of climate change , an anxiety so big and so global that it seemed almost impossible to contemplate .
Suddenly , all of those fears had an outlet .
We can probably only cope with one apocalypse at a time , and the financial crisis looked more immediate than the other two ; it overwhelmed even them with the drama of its figures .
But it was made to carry elements of the other threats - al - Qaida , we learned , rejoiced in the collapse of American and British banks ; while somewhere in the collective guilt about the mess we had made of the planet was the sense that greed would eventually produce , in Al Gore 's terms , a Reckoning ( the balance sheet metaphor was coming true ) .
And the fact was on a simply rational level , deep down we knew it was coming .
We only had to walk down an average street in the last couple of years and see how the value of houses on it had doubled to know ; or to absorb the fact that up to 75 per cent of all credit card debt in Europe was on British cards ; or to wander on a Sunday afternoon in one of those extraordinary shopping malls in Birmingham or in Leeds and see the spending ; or simply observe the way that across society , reward had so completely parted company from effort .
We knew , just as surely as those in the Madoff scam knew , somewhere deep down , that there was a trick involved .
But while house prices kept on going up , we kept the faith , just as Madoff 's millionaires kept pocketing their unlikely dividends and asking no questions .
Because in the absence of faith , what was there but doubt ?
For a while now , certain fashionable economists have been warning us about irrationality .
It 's been in the air , in books like Freakonomics .
People do n't operate in conventionally predictable ways and , therefore , neither do markets or any of the other institutions they create .
We fool ourselves constantly that the world can be orderly and predictable ; bankers with their risk - mapping systems have done this on a colossal scale .
A good antidote to some of our apocalyptic anxiety is , then , a proper sense of behavioural economics .
Dan Gardner 's brilliant book Risk : The Science and Politics of Fear is one place to start .
It is Gardner 's contention that , because of a globalised media , as individuals we have lost our ability to calculate probability and much of our anxiety flows from that .
I spoke to Gardner at his home in Canada .
I wonder if he believes this current Age of Anxiety is different to those that went before ?
" It depends on how you define the age .
If you are talking about the last 50 years , then , yes , there is more anxiety in the western world than there has ever been .
If you are talking about the time since August when the banks collapsed , then no . "
The fact is that we have been primed daily , even during the best of times , for imminent disaster .
We are addicted to crisis , perhaps as a factor of guilt at our collective waste and excess .
As the French poet Paul Valéry once observed : " If some great catastrophe is not announced every morning , we feel a certain void .
Nothing in the paper today , we sigh . "
In the past decade , mortality rates across the developed world have tumbled , but we have been obsessed with bird flu and Sars .
Politicians have routinely traded on fear ( George Bush won two elections with it ) , even while the routine business of our lives was ever more dominated by security .
Now that a real crisis has come along , our response comes not from our rational mind but from those almond - shaped amygdala .
" I appreciate that the current economic crisis is very real , " Gardner observes .
" This is certainly a time to have rational fears .
Not least if you are a journalist . "
But we need also to be doubly vigilant , he suggests , for the psychological traits and the herd instinct that got us into this situation in the first place .
The essential point of Gardner 's book is that there is a gap between risk perception and risk reality and often that gap increases to become a chasm .
" The problem is we have a brain that evolved in a hunter - gatherer environment , which is completely unlike the world in which we live .
You turn on the news , you see a parade of fantastically improbable events that are tragic and awful .
A child is snatched on the other side of the planet .
Now , you have a rational mind which states this event says nothing about the safety of your own children .
But you also have an unconscious mind and that does not process information in the same way .
" The unconscious brain has something called the ' availability heuristic ' , " Gardner suggests .
" If an event happens , it is this part of the brain that tries to work out how common an occurrence it is .
And it does so by calculating how often it has seen that event happen before .
That worked wonderfully in a Stone Age environment .
But when we are constantly gathering news from across the world , that in - built probability no longer works .
Have we seen a stranger snatch a child ?
Yes , we saw it last night on the television .
Let 's keep our own children indoors . "
That globalising of information undermines our sense of control .
Our brains are not wired to deal with the computation of large numbers .
They are wired to respond emotionally to storytelling .
That is why a single picture of a child suffering will prompt infinitely more charitable giving than the statistic that a million children are dying .
Or a photograph of a lottery winner unconsciously blows away the fact that your chance of winning is one in 14 million .
In fact , the more statistical information we have , the more likely we are to rely on irrational decision - making .
When applied to financial decisions , this fact becomes scary .
" There were two causes , " Gardner observes of the latest meltdown .
" One thing was the housing bubble and the other was a Wall Street misunderstanding of that bubble .
Did everyone who backed those positions on Wall Street understand those positions ?
No , they looked to their left and right and adopted the position that other so - called Wall Street wizards were adopting . "
Behavioural economists are fond of the idea of " attention cascades " .
The term was coined by Yale professor Robert Shiller , the man who , in his book Irrational Exuberance , was most prophetic of the current crisis .
An attention cascade is the herd instinct in action ; when many people believe something - that we are all going to hell in a handcart - the belief becomes exponentially attractive for no other reason than that many people believe it .
That 's the cascade .
The " attention " part is the result of what psychologists call " confirmation bias " .
Once a belief is in place , we look for information to support it - and disregard information that does not .
The internet multiplies this possibility by a googol .
The problem we have now , the reason for all our mounting anxieties and in part for the current crisis , is that , Gardner suggests : " Attention cascades are being empowered by technology .
At the sharp end of this , a trader can get information about market moves around the planet 24 hours a day . "
Even , you might add , in the wee small hours when his or her anxiety faculties are most awake .
" The herd as a result is now that much more dynamic and that much larger . "
A classic argument about the Great Depression is that the market was more volatile in the 1920s because of the introduction of the telephone , which allowed information to move that much more quickly .
" We have this impression that more information , quicker information , gives us better decisions , " Gardner says , " but that is often false .
If we are suffering information overload , we are going to fall back on cognitive crutches - namely doing what everyone else is doing .
The herd dynamic is getting much more potent . "
When you start to recognise the evidence of attention cascades in the current climate , you see them wherever you look .
The other morning , I was woken by the BBC leading its news with the fact that Whittard of Chelsea was talking to the receivers .
There are undoubtedly many indications that we are facing a testing new year , but sad though it is for Whittard 's employees , you wonder whether the possible demise of an upmarket tea merchant in hock to an Icelandic bank is necessarily one of them .
One of the most amusing - if that is the word - things to emerge from the current anxiety is the persistence of those analysts , commentators and politicians who say things like : " The recession will bottom out in October 2009 and we will start to see recovery in the housing market at the beginning of 2010 . "
Or : " Unemployment will rise by one million before it starts to fall . "
How , you ask yourself , having almost universally failed to call the most cataclysmic financial event of our lifetimes , do they suddenly know these things ?
Have they no shame ?
And why do they think we will believe them ?
If there is one lesson that should arise from the humiliation of the financial system , it is a version of William Goldman 's view of Hollywood : no one really knows anything .
It was blind faith that some people did know better than everyone else that got us into this position .
Successive prime ministers have been so in thrall to those who shout loudest - the CEOs , the City rainmakers - that they have not only allowed them to be effectively self - regulating but also self - rewarding .
John Major had been a PR for a bank before he became prime minister ; Tony Blair became one - at £ 2.5 m a year - after he left .
In times like these , everyone should have a book by their bedside to reach for at three in the morning .
If the Bible does n't work for you , Philip Tetlock 's nicely oxymoronic volume Expert Political Judgment might be an alternative .
Tetlock 's book is based on two decades of research into 284 people who made their living " commenting or offering advice on political and economic trends " .
He asked them simply to do what they apparently did best : predict what would happen in the world next in answer to specific questions .
Would oil prices rise or fall , would there be a boom or a bust , would we go to war ?
And so on .
When the study concluded , in 2003 , Tetlock 's experts had made 82,361 forecasts and the results were correlated with the facts as they had turned out .
The experts were less accurate in their forecasts than a control group of chimpanzees choosing entirely randomly would have been .
Even specialists in particular narrow fields were not significantly more successful than reasonably informed laymen .
" We reach the point of diminishing marginal predictive returns for knowledge disconcertingly quickly , " Tetlock suggested .
" In this age of academic hyperspecialisation , there is no reason for supposing that contributors to top journals - distinguished political scientists , area study specialists , economists and so on - are any better than attentive readers of the New York Times in ' reading ' emerging situations . "
Further , the more certain the forecaster was , the more likely his judgment would be awry , scientific proof that " the best lack all conviction , while the worst are full of a passionate intensity " .
It is , I guess , worth bearing Tetlock in mind when we look ahead to 2009 .
When we are told that we need to keep shopping for things we do n't need in order to save the things we have , for example .
Or when Robert Peston sing - songs the implications of the latest global apocalypse .
Or when attention cascades .
No one knows anything .
In some ways , it 's a comforting thought .
After that , as the man almost said , we have nothing to be anxious about but anxiety itself .

Shane came into rehearsal ‘ professionally late ’ , as he wittily put it , with that gnashing laugh he has , the first day of rehearsal .
I think he ’d had to be woken up , in his flat .
He was n’t as sartorial as I ’ ve seen him of late , though he still has his brothel - creepers that I became familiar with coming across on the dressing room floor when we were on tour at Christmas , as he felt the need to air his rather curious - looking feet ( and to air , with Joey , the top half of his body , at least one evening , where were we ?
Newcastle I think ) .
He staggered in at four in the afternoon wearing a tophat that looked as though someone had attempted to contain a firework inside it .

Special thanks to The Pogues for their generous help .
Like it or not , your mouth is home to a thriving community of microbial life .
More than 600 different species of bacteria reside in this " microbiome , " yet everyone hosts a unique set of bugs , and this could have important implications for health and disease .
In a study published online in Genome Research ( www.genome.org), scientists have performed the first global survey of salivary microbes , finding that the oral microbiome of your neighbor is just as different from yours as someone across the globe .
The human body harbors ten times more bacterial cells than human cells – a stunning figure that suggests a likely dynamic between ourselves and the bacteria we carry , both in healthy and disease states .
The National Institutes of Health recently launched an initiative to categorize the microbiomes of several regions of the body , with early studies focusing on the intestines and skin .
It is appreciated that the human mouth , a major entry point for bacteria into the body , also contains a diverse array of microbial species .
Yet microbiome diversity between individuals , and how this relates to diet , environment , health , and disease , remains unexplored .
In this study , scientists have conducted the first in - depth study of global diversity in a human microbiome , characterizing the microbial life in human saliva from regions around the world .
The researchers , led by Dr. Mark Stoneking of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig , Germany , have sequenced and analyzed variation in the bacterial gene encoding 16S rRNA , a component of the ribosome , in the salivary " metagenome " of 120 healthy subjects from six geographic areas .
Stoneking and colleagues then compared the sequences they found with a database of 16S rRNA sequences to categorize the types of bacteria present .
The group observed that there is considerable diversity of bacterial life in the saliva microbiome , both within and between individuals .
However , they made an unexpected finding when comparing samples from different geographic areas .
" The saliva microbiome does not vary substantially around the world , " Stoneking described .
" Which seems surprising given the large diversity in diet and other cultural factors that could influence the human salivary microbiome . "
Stoneking explained that this suggests the life inhabiting the mouth of your next - door neighbor is likely to be just as different from yours as someone on the other side of the world .
Stoneking noted that by studying sequences from an easily obtained saliva sample , their work has provided the foundation for future studies exploring the influence of diet , cultural factors , and disease on variation in the saliva microbiome .
In addition , the group 's findings could help analyze human migrations and populations .
While it may not be pleasant to think about the life teeming in your mouth , it is now evident that we will be able to learn a lot about oral health and disease by understanding what is living there .

Nada de campaña atea en los ómnibus de Génova .
La Unión Italia de Ateos y Racionalistas había contratado la publicidad en dos ómnibus , con frases que decían : " La mala noticia es que Dios no existe  La buena es que no tenés necesidad " .
O sea que proclamaban mas o menos lo mismo que en Londres , donde actualmente circulan unos 800 buses metropolitanos de esos rojos de dos pisos -- , negando la existencia de Dios .
También en el vasto subterráneo londinense hay vagones que llevan publicidad contra el Ser Supremo , sin que nadie se haya escandalizado .
Al contrario : los grupos evangélicos aprovecharon para lanzar una campaña al revés , en favor de la existencia de Dios .
Pero en Italia el poder de la Iglesia es enorme , mucho más porque en Roma se encuentra la Ciudad del Vaticano y la Santa Sede del Papa .
La concesionaria de publicidad de Génova dijo que había prohibido la campaña porque un grupo de choferes presentó una oposición de conciencia .
" Además el código municipal no permite los mensajes que puedan ofender la sensibilidad religiosa o moral de una persona " , dijo Fabrizio Duchene , responsable de la concesionaria de publicidad de los autobuses genoveses .
Arturo Sessarego , de la Unión de Ateos , se indigna : " ¿Pero donde está la ofensa ?
Con ese criterio cualquier aviso de la Iglesia en favor de Dios sería ofensivo .
Y no lo es " .
En el mundo católico la iniciativa ha caído mal pero se evita pronunciarse abiertamente , por temor a la acusación de que es la Iglesia la que está detrás de la prohibición en Génova , que de hecho pone problemas a los que quieren realizarla también en otras ciudades italianas .
En Europa la negación de Dios como publicidad en los medios públicos de transporte se está difundiendo sin problemas en Barcelona y Madrid .
También en Holanda y Francia han comenado a aparecer ómnibus con inscripciones parecidad .
Did the GOP shoot itself in the condom when it got the administration to drop the funding for birth control and sex education from the Stimulus Bill ?
Let ’s take all of the emotional issues out of this debate , and look at some facts .
I do n’t know how many total funding dollars were in the original plan , but let ’s just take a $ 1 million dollar slice of these funds and follow those dollars through the entire process on both sides of this issue .
Reality numbers !
The majority of condoms and sex education dollars go to poor and minority youth .
Over 90 % .
If you assume that each dollar spent would buy a condom or pay for sex education , then the GOP just ensured that a possible one million babies will be born to young poor or minority mothers for EACH million dollars cut from the bill , give or take some amount .
That ’s a lot of babies , born to poor and minority folks .
In 18 years , how will those folks vote ?
Most will vote Democratic .
Now multiply that million dollars by the MANY more millions , actually billions , cut from the package , and you see that the GOP just ensured it ’s demographical demise in the coming decades .
Now , what will be the cost of these babies born to young , mostly unwed , mothers ?
Well , let ’s see ….. no pre-natal care in many cases , infant mortality :
US , 2nd worst in the world , ( CNN - ’06 stats ) , at what cost ?
Emergency room treatments as young unwed mothers generally do n’t have healthcare .
Then , how many of these mothers will finish high school or wind up on some form of welfare and wo n’t hold jobs or pay taxes ?
Who pays for them …. we do , the American tax payer , you and I do .
What about the number of these babies who wind up in the foster care system ?
Who pays for them …. we do , you and I , the American taxpayers for at least 18 years .
What about that percentage of these poor children who wind up as criminals and are incarcerated ?
Who pays for this for years and years to come , and sometimes for their entire adult life ?
We , the American taxpayer will be footing those costs as well .
Yes , some percentage of these moms will finish school , have husbands and raise their babies .
But , what percentage will not want the child ?
Some may allow for adoption , but about 33 % will seek an abortion , that could be about 300,000 babies aborted .
Yes , you may say that we can outlaw abortions , but that will not end them .
You say , just say no , well young Bristol Palin said it very well , abstinence is unrealistic .
So let ’s see what the emotional , ideological GOP succeeded in doing by appealing to a media frenzy with their snippets of “ Billions for Condoms ” warfare on the Stimulus Plan ?

The study demonstrates that experiential purchases , such as a meal out or theater tickets , result in increased well - being because they satisfy higher order needs , specifically the need for social connectedness and vitality — a feeling of being alive .
“ These findings support an extension of basic need theory , where purchases that increase psychological need satisfaction will produce the greatest well - being , ” said Ryan Howell , assistant professor of psychology at San Francisco State University .
Participants in the study were asked to write reflections and answer questions about their recent purchases .
Participants indicated that experiential purchases represented money better spent and greater happiness for both themselves and others .
The results also indicate that experiences produce more happiness regardless of the amount spent or the income of the consumer .
Experiences also lead to longer - term satisfaction .
“ Purchased experiences provide memory capital , ” Howell said .
“ We do n’t tend to get bored of happy memories like we do with a material object .
“ People still believe that more money will make them happy , even though 35 years of research has suggested the opposite , ” Howell said .
“ Maybe this belief has held because money is making some people happy some of the time , at least when they spend it on life experiences . ”
“ The mediators of experiential purchases : Determining the impact of psychological need satisfaction ” was conducted by Ryan Howell , assistant professor of psychology at San Francisco State University and SF State graduate Graham Hill .

Fury over ' stitch - up ' as Jacqui Smith escapes sleaze investigation into £ 116,000 second home claim
Expenses row : Home Secretary Jacqui Smith leaves her sister 's home in Southwark , which she claims as her main residence
Jacqui Smith will not be investigated for claiming £ 116,000 of taxpayer - funded Commons expenses for her family home .
Parliamentary sleaze watchdog John Lyon said there was ' not sufficient evidence for an inquiry ' while the Home Secretary broke her silence to say she had ' played by the rules . '
But critics claimed taxpayers had been ' stitched up ' by the decision .
They pointed out that lax regulations meant she could exploit a loophole worth £ 24,000 a year in order to subsidise the West Midlands home she shares with her husband and two children .
Miss Smith was allowed to do this because she designated a room in her sister 's three - bedroom terrace house in South London as her main home , and pays a ' market rate ' for her lodgings .
MPs can claim expenses under the Commons Additional Costs Allowance to help cover the cost of a second home if their constituency is too far away to commute to Parliament each day .
It can cover interest payments on a mortgage , fuel bills , food , and furnishings including goods off the notorious ' John Lewis list ' such as kitchens , bathrooms , televisions and fridges .
Under the rules , the main residence is usually where the MP ' spends more nights than any other ' .
Critics find it hard to swallow Miss Smith 's claim that she considers a single room in her sister 's London home her main inhabitance , rather than the family home in her Redditch constituency .
She has also rejected the offer of a grace - and - favour flat in London that comes with her job .
However , Miss Smith told GMTV yesterday : ' I have always been open about my expenses .
' The thing with us MPs , if you are going to serve your constituents you have to have two houses .
' I took the decision which was best for my kids , to be where they grew up .
' But as Home Secretary you have to spend the bulk of your time in London .
I have always been open .
I have played by the rules here .'
Mr Lyon , the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards , confirmed he would not be pursuing two complaints he received over Miss Smith 's use of the expenses .
Miss Smith claimed the £ 116,000 between 2001 and 20007 , although until 2004 Commons rules said ministers could not designate their constituency home as their ' main ' one .
Shared house : Police outside the three - bedroom home in South London owned by Miss Smith 's sister
But campaigners said taxpayers had been shortchanged and accused the Home Secretary of playing ' fast and loose ' with the rules .
Landlady : Jacqui Smith stays with her sister Sara , above , several nights a week
Matthew Elliott , chief executive of the TaxPayers Alliance , said : ' The public will feel they are being stitched up by this situation .
' Jacqui Smith can hardly call a room in a shared house her " main " home so it looks like she is claiming additional costs allowance to subsidise and spruce up her proper home in her constituency .
' She should come clean because many hard - working taxpayers will look at her situation and feel she is bending the rules . '
The Lib Dems ' Norman Baker accused MPs of designating their ' second home ' as the one which would given them the greatest financial advantage .
He said : ' The test of appropriateness in terms of designation - must be what would appear to be fair and reasonable to an ordinary member of the public .
' To most people , the place where you and your family live and perhaps did so before your election , where you return to when you are not working , and which serves as a base for your children to go to school , is your main residence .
' A " pied - a - terre " in London , or a room in a relative 's house , cannot sensibly be regarded as a main residence .
It is clearly a second residence .
Yet this test seems not to be applied by all Members . '
A ruling by Mr Lyon last year said : ' If a Member has his or her family living permanently in their constituency home and has modest accommodation in London big enough only for themselves , and which they use only when Parliament is in session , then it would clearly seem to be a matter of fact that Member 's main home is in the constituency .

Officials said two people were killed when an F / A - 18 military jet about to land at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar slammed into a San Diego neighborhood today .
The pilot was able to eject safely .
Two in the house are dead and two are missing .
Neighbors said they heard sputtering , saw the jet wobbling , and then it crashed , creating a ball of fire .
Afterward , neighbors said they saw the pilot wandering around in a daze .
He had parachuted out of the jet and landed in the baseball field of nearby University City High School .
John Kreischer , 62 , was returning home from taking pictures at La Jolla Cove when he spotted the plane only 300 to 500 feet in the sky .
“ It was mushing through the air , ” Kreischer said .
“ It was chugging along with what seemed like one engine .
Then I heard a roar of engine and all of a sudden , woop , dead silence .
" This guy could have turned it around and put it in the ocean , " he continued .
" He was never going to make it to Miramar . ”
“ My heart goes out to the family of the victims and to the community of University City , ” said Mayor Jerry Sanders .
Marine officials told The Times the pilot was part of a training squadron and that he was trying to aim the plane at a deserted canyon to avoid slamming into homes or the nearby 805 Freeway .
He had taken off from the carrier Abraham Lincoln several miles off the coast .
His destination was the air station .
Marine Col. Chris O’Connor pledges an in - depth investigation and to see “ that the neighborhood is cleaned up as quickly as possible . ”
Jason Widmer , who was working in the neighborhood , talked to the pilot after he ejected and landed .
" He was pretty shook up , " Widmer said .
" And pretty concerned if he had killed anyone .
He had seen his bird go into a house . ”
Students at University City
High were eating lunch when they saw the F / A - 18 .
" It was coming in too low , ” said student Mike Scott .
“ It was like the plane hit a wall : it went straight down . "
Vanessa James , a neighbor , was taking out her trash when she heard a high - pitch boom .
" I heard the boom , came out , and saw a parachute coming out over a house into a canyon , ” she said .
Police and fire officials said one home was destroyed and another damaged in the crash that occurred just before noon .
Kerry blasts GOP for ignoring housing crisis a year ago Muriel Kane
Published : Friday February 6 , 2009
Print This Email This Congressional Republicans have been attacking President Obama 's stimulus proposal in any way they can , complaining in particular that it does not adequately address the housing crisis .
In remarks before the Senate on Friday , however , Senator John Kerry blasted the Republicans for only waking up to the housing problem now , when the time to have done something about it was almost a year ago .
Senate Minority
White John Kyl suggested last Sunday that the stimulus package ought to be completely rewritten to " start with housing first . "
Sen. Bob Corker ( R - TN ) echoed Kyl 's words , calling the plan " nothing short of a disaster " because " housing and credit are the foundations in this country . "
In responding to Corker and his fellow Republicans , Kerry recalled how " I sat in the White House a year ago with Secretary Paulson , President Bush , Vice President Cheney -- and I was the only person in the room who said , ' Mr. President , if you 're going to do a stimulus now , you ought to put housing into this package . ' "
Kerry explained that he had proposed that homeowners who were in danger of defaulting on their subprime mortgages be allowed to renegotiate them at a fixed rate .
In February 2008 , Kerry and Sen. Gordon Smith ( R - OR ) tried but failed to attach such a provision to the Bush administration 's economic stimulus bill .
They did manage to have it included in the the Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008 , which finally passed the Senate in July and was signed into law by George Bush .
" We put in a $ 15 billion provision in the Finance Committee . "
Kerry continued .
" It passed the Finance Committee , 20 to 1 .
It came to the floor of the Senate -- and guess what ?
The very people who are here on the floor now saying we 've got to do housing stripped it out of that provision .
The president and the administration opposed it .
And for nine months they sat there , while 10,000 homes a day were being foreclosed , and they allowed us to slide into where we are today . "
" They have created , because of their indifference a year ago , a situation where it's out of control , " Kerry concluded .

Doodling is often frowned upon in meetings and classrooms , but now scientists say it might help you remember details in an otherwise boring presentation .
The back - of - the - envelope speculation as to why ?
Doodlers do n't daydream as much .
Forty test subjects — all rather smart folks ( they are members of the research panel of the Medical Research Council 's Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit in Cambridge ) — were made to listen to a dull phone message .
It was 2.5 minutes long and contained names of people and places .
(( ImgTag||right|null|null|null|false ) )
The half who were asked to doodle during the message had 29 percent better recall than the non-doodlers .
Beforehand , they were all told to listen for names of people going to a party .
Afterward , they were asked to write eight party - goers names down , along with eight place names that had been on the message .
The doodlers recalled on average 7.5 names of people and places compared to only 5.8 by the non-doodlers .
" If someone is doing a boring task , like listening to a dull telephone conversation , they may start to daydream , " said University of Plymouth psychology professor Jackie Andrade .
" Daydreaming distracts them from the task , resulting in poorer performance .
A simple task , like doodling , may be sufficient to stop daydreaming without affecting performance on the main task . "
The findings are detailed in the journal Applied Cognitive Psychology .
" This study suggests that in everyday life doodling may be something we do because it helps to keep us on track with a boring task , rather than being an unnecessary distraction that we should try to resist doing , " Andrade said .

In his State of the State address last week , Gov. David Paterson reiterated his longtime support for reforming the state ’s Rockefeller drug laws , saying , “ I can not think of a criminal justice strategy that has been more unsuccessful than the Rockefeller drug laws . ”
Advocacy groups that support revamping the Rockefeller drug laws were encouraged by Paterson ’s remarks but also worried that his final proposals would n’t go far enough .
“ We ’re hopeful about getting reform , ” said Gabriel Sayegh , a policy director with the New York City - based Drug Policy Alliance .
“ This is not just about the Rockefeller drug laws but about changing the way New York approaches drug policy .
The Rockefeller drug laws are a set of bad policies . ”
Adopted in 1973 and 1974 , the Rockefeller drug laws set mandatory minimum prison sentences for drug offenses .
Critics say they are too harsh and have filled the state ’s prisons with non-violent addicts who would be better served by drug treatment .
The Drug Policy Alliance would like the state to approach drugs from a public health perspective and focus on expanding treatment options for non-violent offenders , Sayegh said .
The group would also like sentencing discretion restored to trial judges in all drug cases and the abolishment of mandatory minimum prison sentences .
“ We need a lot more sentencing reform , ” he said .
“ There are people doing 8 to 20 years on first - time drug offenses .
These sentences are ludicrous . ”
In addition , people already serving harsh sentences should be re-sentenced “ under a system that is more equitable , ” Sayegh said .
“ I ’m not suggesting that everybody should be let out of prison , but most of the people who have been sentenced [ under the Rockefeller drug laws ] have drug problems .
Why are those folks sitting in prison ? ”
deliberate approach
Saratoga County District Attorney James A. Murphy , who serves as chair of the board of directors for the New York State District Attorneys Association , said the group agrees that reform is needed but that it does n’t support an outright repeal of the Rockefeller drug laws .
Rather , the group would like to see a methodical approach , where the Sentencing Commission assesses the sentence for each drug crime and determines whether it is appropriate when compared with other drug crimes and other types of crime , such as burglary .
“ We want a really measured , meaningful approach , ” he said .
One of the New York State District Attorneys Association ’s main concerns is that Paterson ’s proposed budget eliminates funding — about $ 4 million — for the Road to Recovery program , a drug treatment court established in 2004 that provides an alternative to incarceration .
Today , there are Road to Recovery programs in every county ; the District Attorneys Association believes the program has been successful and that meaningful drug reform cannot exist without expanded treatment for addicts .
“ The alternative is to put addicts back in jail , and that costs money , ” Murphy said .
“ We should not be filling our jails with addicts .
Our association is very actively trying to fill beds in rehab centers .
. . .
We need more funding for drug treatment courts and alternatives to incarceration . ”
In Saratoga County , 63 people have graduated from the Road to Recovery program ; 86 percent of graduates are gainfully employed , and 82 percent have not been rearrested .
In contrast , only about 30 percent of the addicts who are sent to prison are not rearrested , Murphy said .
reform report due
Paterson has said he will wait for a report , due at the end of this month , from the New York State Commission on Sentencing Reform before determining how to proceed with Rockefeller drug law reform .
The Commission on Sentencing Reform was established in 2007 by former Gov. Eliot Spitzer and charged with revamping the state ’s sentencing structure ; a review of the Rockefeller drug laws is part of that process .
The commission ’s work represents the first time in more than 40 years that the state ’s sentencing laws have undergone a comprehensive review , according to the state Division of Criminal Justice Services .
Sayegh said true reform will not come from the Commission on Sentencing Reform .
“ We do n’t expect anything good to come out of the commission report , ” he said .
“ The commission has dodged this issue . ”
But he said that Paterson ’s commitment to reform — as a state senator from Harlem , Paterson was a strong advocate for change — and the Democratic takeover of the Senate make him optimistic .
Murphy said he believes Paterson will take the right approach .
“ I do n’t think he ’ll do anything too quickly , ” he said .
“ I ’m glad he ’s looking to the Sentencing Commission . ”
In 2004 , the state softened some of the Rockefeller drug laws , but advocates for reform were unsatisfied with the changes .
Under the new law , life sentences required for the highest level of drug crimes , Class A1 , were cut to 8 to 20 years .
The new law also doubled the weight of drugs an offender must be convicted of possessing to merit certain prison sentences .
Alice Green , executive director of the Center for Law and Justice in Albany , said she is n’t sure Paterson will be able to bring “ real reform ” to the state ’s drug laws .
“ We ’d like to scratch the drug laws and start all over , ” she said .
“ We ’d like to see sentencing discretion rest with judges , but I do n’t think that ’s going to happen . ”
Green predicted that there would be some modification to sentences but not the type of sweeping changes that she supports .
“ There ’s a lot of reluctance to go too far , ” she said .
“ Something really dramatic has to happen to make reform a reality . ”
focus on fairness
In late 2007 , the Sentencing Commission released preliminary recommendations calling for a more simplified and streamlined system focused on public safety , consistency and fairness .
Recommendations included :
Abandoning New York ’s indeterminate sentencing system and creating new determinate sentences for more than 200 non-violent felonies .
Modifying New York ’s sentencing statutes to expressly permit a court to sentence certain non-violent , drug - addicted felony offenders to community - based treatment in lieu of state prison when the judge , prosecutor and defendant all agree that this is a just outcome .
Examining the broader use of graduated sanctions — such as curfews , home confinement , electronic monitoring and re-entry courts — to end the revolving door of incarceration for certain offenders under parole supervision who violate one or more conditions of parole but commit no new crime .
Having touched briefly on FEMDOM I hope to expand slightly on this subject and maybe throw a bit more light on this particular section of BDSM
If ask people in a vanilla relationship about femdom , chances are they will say something along the lines of “ oohh that ’s wimpy men being bossed around by big butch women ” and if I am honest , while that can happen , in 85 % of the cases nothing could be further from the truth
If you search the term in a BDSM dictionary the meaning is as follows
FEMDOM : A power exchange relationship in which the dominant is female .
Often ( but not always ) used to refer to a relationship between a female dominant and a male submissive .
Just because a man wishes to cede power to a woman in certain areas of his life does not make him weak , in some ways he is stronger for accepting his desires and fulfilling them .
There is a certain element of excitement when a man is teased sexually , it heightens the desires , and if you ask a pain slut they will invariably say that the sweet snap of the crop / whip / flogger takes the pleasure that bit further , so why should it be different for a man ?
They too can enjoy the pain element of BDSM .
Whilst we know that the majority of BDSM relationships are Master / slave and Dom / sub , more and more men are turning to Femdom as a way to release the tension in their every day life , many are finding that with the pressure of their jobs they wish to have all decisions and control taken from them and to submit to another ’s will , indeed , looking at some of the past newspaper articles there have been some famous names associated with Dommes and Mistresses , they might have been paying for the services of a professional but had they taken the time to look around they would have seen that its not always necessary to do that , there are more and more sexy strong women coming into their own and many more men who are only too happy to serve them in what ever way they wish
“ My plane crashed today , I was n’t on it ”
Total Pro Sports -
“ My plane crashed today , I was n’t on it ” .
That was what was written on seven year old Paddon Smith ’s daily journal , and on his fathers mind February 13th .
The day before , February 12 , the plane that AHL referee Jeff Smith and his family were to board the plane headed from Newark to Buffalo crashed down killing 49 people on board and one on the ground .
Jeff , a resident of Palm Beach , Fla , usually takes his two children Paddon , 7 , and Tanner , 4 , with him to games in Toronto , Hamilton , and Buffalo , so that they can experience winters in the north .
The tickets were purchased but the family was informed that Continental Airlines Flight 3407 , the flight they were supposed to be on , was expecting strong turbulence so they took another flight .
Was it fate , luck , or just a huge and very fortunate coincidence ?
Jeff believes that “ it was just a fortunate chain of events ” .

How will Twitter make money ?
It 's the $ 500 - million question ( the amount , mostly in stock options , that Facebook reportedly offered to buy Twitter ) that has plagued the company since its rise to prominence .
Potential investors and technology analysts are notoriously cynical of Web start - ups that have n't yet established a business model .
YouTube and Facebook were pelted with those same criticisms in the past , and now , the skeptics are demanding the same from Twitter -- shake your money maker .
Twitter co-founder Biz Stone finally has an answer .
By charging for corporate accounts , Stone says , Twitter will earn revenue from such companies as JetBlue , Comcast and Dell , which already use the social networking tool to build brand awareness and grassroots advertising .
In exchange , Twitter will work with these companies to build corporate - exclusive features .
Stone described one such feature -- an identity verification tool that would allow anyone to discern easily whether a particular account is , indeed , owned by the person who the user claims to be .
" Like , users who want to know : is that the real Shaquille O'Neal or not ? "
Stone said .
" Maybe we could help users by saying , Yup , definitely the real Shaquille O'Neal .
That 's a real account .
We checked with them . "
This could have come in handy last month when technology bloggers wondered aloud whether @theRealAlGore was actually , well , the real Al Gore .
( It was n't .
But @algore is . )
Stone would n't go into detail about other features , but says the company has plenty of ideas kicking around .
However , he was clear about one thing : Advertising is not the route they 'll take .
At least , not any time soon .

California Republican and Democratic Party leaders , always at war , finally agree on a common enemy : the open primary .
A proposed constitutional amendment would go before voters in June 2010 instituting a " top - two " primary system , which would effectively eliminate party primary ballots , erase candidate party labels in primary elections and allow voters to choose the two candidates - of whatever party - who would compete in the general election .
An open primary would dissolve the current political primary system , and has the potential to seriously erode party power and change the entire landscape of state politics .
The measure was the work of Republican state Sen. Abel Maldonado of Santa Maria ( Santa Barbara County ) , the swing vote Democrats needed to push through state budget legislation Thursday morning .
That vote earned him the wrath of his party .
Maldonado heralded the passage of his SA4 - one of three constitutional amendments the moderate GOP legislator traded for his critically needed vote - as an important piece of legislation " that will allow us to come together and work more closely . "
" It becomes part of what the governor calls the fourth leg of his stool - which is systemic reform " in a state where gerrymandering has produced safe legislative districts with virtually no political turnover , noted Barbara O'Connor , professor of political communication at Cal State Sacramento .
" The theory is that it will produce more moderate candidates .
...
People generally like it .
And the parties hate it . "
Approval may be difficult
But it might not be easy to get a simple majority of the voters needed to put the amendment into the state Constitution .
In 1998 , California voters approved a " blanket " primary measure allowing them to vote in either primary ; it was ruled unconstitutional because it allowed members of one party to potentially decide the nominee of another party .
In 2004 , Prop. 62 - another " top two " primary proposal - was handily defeated by voters .
Maldonado has argued that erasing party labels in primary elections would give the voters of California , the fastest growing group of which decline to state a party affiliation , a choice they deserve in a state where hyper - partisanship is on the increase , as evidenced by the recent three - month budget battle .
But critics , including party officials on both sides , say Maldonado - who is being targeted by conservative Republicans as a sell - out for going along with Democratic legislators on the budget - is aiming to advance his own political career .
That 's because - with Republicans vowing to get revenge on Maldonado for aiding Democrats - his political future might rest on his ability to attract support from independents and Democrats .
Indeed , within hours of Maldonado 's success , GOP consultant Matt Cunningham of Orange County - angered about the Republican 's pivotal role in passing the primary measure and on the budget - set up a fast - growing Facebook group : " Never Elect Abel Maldonado to Anything , Ever Again . "
Maldonado 's proposed primary system is " purely self - interest on his part , " said Cunningham , whose Facebook page urges " eternal opposition " to any plans by Maldonado to run again for state office .
" He has no prayer of advancing ( the new primary ) , " so he is taking advantage of this crisis .
And the rest of the taxpayers are paying $ 13.5 billion for it in new taxes for it . "
Party officials also say the effort will not boost democracy but will shackle it .
" It 's a way to outlaw third parties , " said Bob Mulholland , campaign chair of the state Democratic Party , who said government should not be involved in an elective system that mandates that party labels be removed in primaries .
" It 's a terrible system , " one which Americans interested in promoting democracy would never recommend for , say , Iraq or Afghanistan , he said .
Tom Del Beccaro , the vice chairman of the state GOP - who disagrees with Mulholland on virtually every other issue facing the state - was equally incensed .
" The two - party system is as old as politics itself .
It 's human nature to have rivalries , politically , in sport , and you can't legislate around human nature , " he said .
" That 's called social experimentation - and it does n't work . "
Ron Nehring , chairman of the state GOP , said the measure will " lead to further polarization . "
Without a Republican or Democratic designated candidate on primary ballots , that means " in some areas , like San Francisco , you 'll never , never see a Republican candidate on the general election or November ballot - meaning the Republican perspective is missing from the dialogue , " he said .
" And in parts of Orange County , Inland Empire ... you will never have a Democrat on the ballot , " he said .
" Is that a healthy thing ?
No , it 's not . "
He said California Republicans will take up the matter at their state party convention in Sacramento this weekend , where they will debate - and vote - to support or reject Maldonado 's amendment .
But with California 's budget crisis fresh in voters ' minds , and 2010 gubernatorial contests already gearing up , political observers say voters may be in no mood to listen to partisans on what is best for their state .
Outcome unclear
Some suggest the introduction of a " top two " primary system could shake up a political system badly in need of an influx of new ideas and energy .
But whether the " top two " model , which is similar to one passed in Washington state in 2004 by 60 percent of the voters , is the answer is not clear , others say .
What is clear : " The battle lines are drawn , " said O'Connor .
Though party officials on both sides are eviscerating Maldonado , " He will have as many people saying what a statesman he was ... the only one who did n't ask for anything personally for his district " in the budget battle - " but who may appear to many to be looking for solutions for the divided state , " O'Connor said .
" With legislative approval ratings ( down ) and all the granular detail about what voters think of elected officials , it 's all about money and whether the voters will listen to the same old same old , " she said .
" I think voters will want things to work . "

DNA shows Scots and Irish should look to Spain for their ancestry
Historians have long believed the British Isles were invaded by Iron Age Celts from central Europe in about 500 BC .
But geneticists at Dublins Trinity College now claim the Scots and Irish have as much , if not more , in common with the people of north - western Spain .
Dr Daniel Bradley , genetics lecturer at Trinity College Dublin , said a study published in the American Journal of Human Genetics into Celtic origins revealed close affinities with the people of Galicia .
" It s well known that there are cultural relations between the areas but now this shows there is much more , " Dr Bradley said .
Historians believed that the Celts , who were originally from the Alpine regions of central Europe , invaded the Atlantic islands in a massive migration 2,500 years ago .
But Dr Bradley said that it was possible migrants moved from the Iberian peninsula as far back as 6,000 years ago and up until 3,000 years ago .
The study , using DNA samples from people living in Celtic nations and other parts of Europe , found
there are also close links between Scotland and Ireland dating back much further than the Plantations of the 1600s , when many Scots moved to northern Ireland in search of fertile farming land .

We are not Celts at all but Galicians

Celtic nations such as Scotland and Ireland have more in common with the Portuguese and Spanish than with the Celts of central Europe , according to a new academic report .
Historians have long believed that the British Isles were swamped by a massive invasion of Iron Age Celts from central Europe around 500BC .
However , geneticists at Trinity College in Dublin now claim that the Scots and Irish have more in common with the people of north - western Spain .
Dr Daniel Bradley , genetics lecturer at Trinity College , said a new study into Celtic origins revealed close affinities with the people of Galicia .
He said : " It 's well - known that there are cultural relations between the areas but now this shows there is much more .
We think the links are much older than that of the Iron Age because it also shows affinities with the Basque region , which is n't a Celtic region . "
He added : " The links point towards other Celtic nations , in particular Scotland , but they also point to Spain . "
Historians believed the Celts , originally Indo-European , invaded the Atlantic islands in a massive migration 2500 years ago .
But using DNA samples from people living in Celtic nations and other parts of Europe , geneticists at the university have drawn new parallels .
Dr Bradley said it was possible migrants moved from the Iberian peninsula to Ireland as far back as 6000 years ago up until 3000 years ago .
" I do n't agree with the idea of a massive Iron Age invasion that took over the Atlantic islands .
You can regard the ocean , rather than a barrier , as a communication route , " Dr Bradley said .
Archaeologists have also been questioning the links between the Celts of eastern France and southern Germany and the people of the British Isles and the new research appears to prove their theories .
The Dublin study found that people in areas traditionally known as Celtic , such as Ireland , Wales , Scotland , Brittany and Cornwall , had strong links with each other and had more in common with people from the Iberian peninsula .
It also found people in Ireland have more in common with Scots than any other nation .
" What we would propose is that this commonality among the Atlantic facade is much older , 6000 years ago or earlier , " Dr Bradley added .
There are also close links between Scotland and Ireland dating back much further than the plantations of the 1600s when many Scots moved to Northern Ireland in search of fertile farming lands , the research showed .
However , the researchers could not determine whether fair skin , freckles , red hair and fiery tempers truly are Celtic traits .
Stephen Oppenheimer , professor of clinical socio-medical sciences at Oxford , said that the Celts of western Scotland , Wales , Ireland and Cornwall were descended from an ancient people living on the Atlantic coast when Britain was still attached to mainland Europe , while the English were more closely related to the Germanic peoples of the interior .
He said : " The English are the odd ones out because they are the ones more linked to continental Europe .
The Scots , the Irish , the Welsh and the Cornish are all very similar in their genetic pattern to the Basque . "

The Irish and Scots may be as closely related to the people of Spain and Portugal as the Celts of central Europe .
Historians have long believed the British Isles were invaded by Iron Age Celts from central Europe in about 500 BC .
But geneticists at Dublins Trinity College now claim the Scots and Irish have as much , if not more , in common with the people of north - western Spain .
Dr Daniel Bradley , genetics lecturer at Trinity College Dublin , said a study published in the American Journal of Human Genetics into Celtic origins revealed close affinities with the people of Galicia .
" It s well known that there are cultural relations between the areas but now this shows there is much more , " Dr Bradley said .
Historians believed that the Celts , who were originally from the Alpine regions of central Europe , invaded the Atlantic islands in a massive migration 2,500 years ago .
But Dr Bradley said that it was possible migrants moved from the Iberian peninsula as far back as 6,000 years ago and up until 3,000 years ago .
The study , using DNA samples from people living in Celtic nations and other parts of Europe , foundthere are also close links between Scotland and Ireland dating back much further than the Plantations of the 1600s , when many Scots moved to northern Ireland in search of fertile farming land .
The public , therefore , among a democratic people , has a singular power , which aristocratic nations cannot conceive ; for it does not persuade others to its beliefs , but it imposes them and makes them permeate the thinking of everyone by a sort of enormous pressure of the mind of all upon the individual
Table 79 lists all the religions in the US and shows how many Americans consider themselves to be adherents , giving the figures for 1990 and 2001 .
The number of Americans who claimed to be Mormon in 1990 was 2,487,000 , increasing in 2001 to 2,787,000 , an increase of 300,000 , amounting to 12 % over the eleven years .
( The table lists 24 religions who had greater increases - often much greater - than 12 % ) .
Table 81 lists the number of members claimed by various religious organizations in 2001 , with the term " member " being defined by each organization .
The Mormon church reported that it had 5,311,000 members in the US .
( The church considers anyone a member whose name is on their membership records as having been baptized who has not officially resigned or been ex-communicated . )
Notice the difference : of the 5 million members claimed by the church ( and apparently listed on their membership records ) , only a scant half actually consider themselves Mormons .
The other 2,524,000 people apparently do NOT consider themselves Mormons , even though the church claims them as members .
Who are they ?
Obviously , they are ex-Mormons !
They were once Mormons , but no longer consider themselves Mormons , even though their names are still on the records .
But there are more ex-Mormons than that , because many people resign their membership and get their names removed from the church records when they stop believing , and in recent years that number has been estimated to be presently at 100,000 per year .
Between 1995 and 2002 approximately 595,000 names were removed by the church , according to an anonymous inside source ( until the mid-90s it was about 30,000 per year ) .
A fair estimate of how many people requested name removal ( or were excommunicated ) between 1990 and 2001 would be 640,000 .
Adding these two figures ( 640,000 who officially left , and 2,524,000 who do n't call themselves Mormons but are still on the records ) , gives us an estimate of about 3,164,000 ex-Mormons in the US in 2001 , compared to the 2,787,000 who consider themselves Mormon .
And notice that this estimate disregards those who may have had their names removed before 1990 , but who are still alive , which would make the number of ex-Mormons even higher .
The figures for some other countries show an even greater ratio of ex-Mormons to Mormons .
Some countries , as part of their official census , ask citizens to specify their religion .
Here , too , the Mormon church has on its records large numbers of people who apparently at one time were members , but no longer consider themselves Mormon .
They are , then , ex-Mormons .
Here are the numbers :
Mexico Members claimed by church ( 1999 ) : 846,931 Mormons in census ( 2000 ) : 205,229 Difference ( ex- Mormons ) : 641,702
This shows that in Mexico there are over three times as many ex-Mormons as Mormons
Chile Members claimed by church ( 2001 ) : 520,202 Mormons in census ( 2002 ) : 103,735 Difference ( ex- Mormons ) : 416,467
This shows that in Chile there are four times as many ex-Mormons as Mormons
These numbers are probably typical for many other third - world countries .
Armand Mauss ( Mormon sociologist ) has estimated that in third - world countries only 25 % of Mormon converts are still active one year after baptism .
That is , 75 % have become exmormon within a year .
Thus it appears that there are more ex-Mormons than there are Mormons !
( Not that this proves anything , but I find it interesting . )
July 2007
Update : 2015 - Bolivia
In 2012 , the church claimed there were 182,964 members in Bolivia .
According to the 2012 official Bolivian census , the population of Bolivia in 2012 was 10,027,254 , so Mormons made up 1.82 % of the population , according to the church .
However , in the census , only 0.3 % of the population , or 30,082 people , self - identified as Mormon .
That is only 16 % of the number of members the church claimed .
Subtract : 182,964 minus 30,082 gives a figure of 152,882 ex-Mormons in Bolivia , 84 % of those that once were baptized or born into the church .
That is , there are over five times as many ex-Mormons in Bolivia as there are Mormons .
Similar statistics for South American countries for the Watchtower Society ( Jehovah 's Witnesses ) show that the Society 's claimed membership fairly closely matches the self - identification numbers of the censuses .
The LDS church appears to be not as honest as the Watchtower .

During the past year or so , I have sometimes wondered exactly how toxic all those toxic assets really are .
It 's hard to tell , since they differ from one another , and are not traded that often .
However , the Financial Times ( h/t ) has some answers :
" In recent weeks , bankers at places such as JPMorgan Chase and Wachovia have been quietly sifting data trying to ascertain what has happened to those swathes of troubled CDO of ABS .
[ Ed. : collateralised debt obligations of asset - backed securities . ]
The conclusions are stunning .
From late 2005 to the middle of 2007 , around $ 450bn of CDO of ABS were issued , of which about one third were created from risky mortgage - backed bonds ( known as mezzanine CDO of ABS ) and much of the rest from safer tranches ( high grade CDO of ABS . )
Out of that pile , around $ 305bn of the CDOs are now in a formal state of default , with the CDOs underwritten by Merrill Lynch accounting for the biggest pile of defaulted assets , followed by UBS and Citi .
The real shocker , though , is what has happened after those defaults .
JPMorgan estimates that $ 102bn of CDOs has already been liquidated .
The average recovery rate for super - senior tranches of debt – or the stuff that was supposed to be so ultra safe that it always carried a triple A tag – has been 32 per cent for the high grade CDOs .
With mezzanine CDO ’s , though , recovery rates on those AAA assets have been a mere 5 per cent .
I dare say this might be an extreme case .
The subprime loans extended in 2006 and 2007 have suffered particularly high default rates and the CDOs that have already been liquidated are presumably the very worst of the pack .
Even so , I would hazard a guess that this is easily the worst outcome for any assets that have ever carried a “ triple A ” stamp .
No wonder so many investors are now so utterly cynical about anything that bankers or rating agencies might say these days . "
If I 'm reading this right , within four years of being issued , two thirds of these CDOs are in default , and their recovery rates are very , very low .
That 's just staggering .
It 's actually hard to understand how the banks managed to do this badly : you 'd think they could have done better hiring people off the street and paying them to put all those nice little loan documents into piles at random , or tossing mortgages down the stairs and bundling them based on how they landed .
They certainly did n't need to hire people with advanced math degrees and pay them seven - or eight - figure salaries to get these kinds of results .
And how about those ratings agencies ?
They would have done a better job using a Magic 8 - Ball to rate the CDOs .
( " Signs point to junk ! " )
I have been hearing for years and years about how the financial services sector pays such exorbitant wages because the people who work there are so immensely talented that they are cheap at $ 50 million a year .
I never particularly bought that line before .
But I never imagined that all those Masters of the Universe would do quite this badly .
If we had paid them $ 50 million a year to go far , far away and leave our financial system alone , it would have been a bargain .
The column ends with a very important observation :
" Those American officials who are implementing flashy new “ stress tests ” of banks would do well to take note . "

Linux code worth USD 10.8bn
The most recent version of Fedora would have cost a conventional software company USD 10.8bn to develop , according to the Linux Foundation .
Taking Linux as an example , this article highlights the economic impact and benefit of Open Source Software development model .
Based on an article by : VNUnet UK - October 2008
The act of simply writing the Linux kernel alone would run up to USD 1.4bn in development costs , the Foundation claimed .
The open source nature of the operating system has allowed some 1,000 developers at 100 different companies to contribute to every kernel update .
In the past two years alone , the Foundation estimates that 3,200 developers and 200 companies have contributed to the Linux kernel .
' Companies participating in the Linux economy share research and development costs with their partners and competitors , ' read the report .
' This spreading of development burden among individuals and companies has resulted in a large and efficient ecosystem and unheralded software innovation . '
The study is an update of a 2002 report which at the time placed the development costs of a Linux distribution at USD 1.2bn based on the per-line of code cost model .
The updated report calculated the cost for developing the 204,500,046 lines of code for Fedora 9 on the average US programmer 's salary of USD 75,662 .

State regulators rejected a compromise that would have closed four offshore oil platforms and allowed new drilling for the first time in forty years .
Last summer , when a compromise deal to shutter some platforms in exchange for opening new ones was first approved by Santa Barbara County , it was hailed by some as ‘ win - win ’ because it put an end - date on offshore oil and gas development in the area .
But over the last few months , public opposition galvanized against the proposed new wells .
The 2 - 1 vote on Thursday by the State Lands Commission to reject the Tranquillon Ridge lease was the culmination of that public opposition , opposition that began nearly forty years to the day earlier , when the Santa Barbara coast suffered from a major oil spill .
Lt. Governor John Garamendi , one of three members of the lands panel , said allowing any drilling in state waters would send the wrong message to oil companies , giving them the impression that California was opening up for business .
>> See also : Bush Lifts Ban on Offshore Drilling – Why It Matters and Why It Doesn’t
Before the vote , Garamendi said , “ I believe very strongly that we ’ve got to move away from oil , gas and other carbon - based fuels .
A new oil lease in my view will simply make it easier for us to stay with them . ”
Plains Exploration and Production Company had proposed drilling up to 17 new wells with extended reach drilling technology from federal Platform Irene and into the Tranquillon Ridge oil field , on state lands .
Even some environmentalists had praised the compromise because it created a sunset for the drilling activity , and as part of the agreement , all operations would have ceased on or before December 31 , 2022 .
But the State Lands Commission said there was no way to enforce the proposed shuttering date , because leases have historically been open - ended .
Without that agreement , some are concerned the currently operational ( and less productive ) platforms will never close .

The Association of Inclusionist Wikipedians is the international association of wikipedians who feel and own the principles of inclusionism .
It aims to provide a place for discussion and a reference point for the application and dissemination of these principles .
Principles [ edit ]
Sagrada Familia
An article , as this building does , needs time and the contribution of several people An article , as this building does , needs time and the contribution of several people
The Association of inclusionist wikipedians is based on the idea that Wikipedia is not paper : Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia , and thus has few size limits .
Because Wikipedia is not on paper , it can include organized and structured links , can be more timely , etc .
It also means that the style and length of writing appropriate for paper is not necessarily appropriate here .
Therefore , the main principle of AIW is inclusionism , a liberal wiki- philosopy according to which information and the articles on wikipedia should be liberally added and retained on Wikipedia .
Generally , the AIW members are close to other ideas like eventualism or incrementalism .
There is not a common indication regarding content structure or length ( although there is more consensus with splittist ideas ) .
Goals [ edit ]
The main goal of inclusionism is to build the world 's largest and most complete professional encyclopedia .
To continuously improve Wikipedia and make it the most comprehensive source of reliable encyclopedic information available on the planet .
Support Wikipedia 's premise to be comprised of the sum of all human knowledge , freely accessible to all humans , written with as much NPOV as possible .
Never use personal attacks , it 's topics we discuss here , not individual users !
When an article is deleted / merged or threatened with deletion / merging , it can cause the creator to call the one who deleted it names .
But we as an association shall only discuss over issues , and not attacking people and calling them names .
It will only give the deletionists and mergists advantages .
Membership [ edit ]
Membership is open to everyone and it does not oblige to be actively involved in the association life , even though it would be appreciated .
All you have to do to become a member is copy and paste :
{{inclusionist}} or { {User inclusionist}} to your user page .
Logo [ edit ]
The former logo
The logo , designed by Bruce The Deus in 2016 , encloses all the principles that drive inclusionist members of Wikipedia : it is round , the shape of completeness , with an open arrow , to let enter all the knowledge .
The arrow outline forms a stylized hug that embraces every argument , and an “ I ” , the initial letter of the “ inclusionism ” word .
It 's blue , representing the infinite sky , and white , the tint made by all the colors .
The former logo was the acronym of the association written in Linux Libertine font , framed by two black lines .
It is still used sometimes .
Motto [ edit ]
The motto of inclusionist is Conservata veritate , which translates to , " with truth preserved . "
This motto reflects a desire to change Wikipedia only when no knowledge would be lost as a result .
Insigna [ edit ]
The members of the association can award an user for meritorious behaviour .

History [ edit ]
Merovingian , founding act I want the inclusionist Wikipedians of the world to know that now there is a place to voice our opinions and further our agenda of a big , strong Wikipedia .
The Association of Inclusionist Wikipedians was established on the 19th of April 2005 by the American wikipedian Merovingian .
The following year Easyas12c created the Finnish section .
In February 2012 , Russian wikipedian Strannik27 founded the Russian section .
The Italian section was founded on the 3rd of june , 2016 by the Italian wikipedian Bruce The Deus , who discovered the association during a deletion discussion where a member of AIW , OppidumNissenae , declared his membership .

Ejaculation frequency , a measure of sexual activity , is not associated with a higher risk for prostate cancer , according to a study in the April 7 issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association ( JAMA ) .
However , a high ejaculation frequency may be linked to a decreased risk of prostate cancer .
Sexual activity has been hypothesized to play a role in the development of prostate cancer , according to background information in the article .
Given that sexual activity is common and that prostate cancer risk is high , any association between these factors would have clinical and public health relevance .
Michael F. Leitzmann , M.D. , of the National Cancer Institute , Bethesda , Md. , and colleagues examined the association between ejaculation frequency ( which includes sexual intercourse , nocturnal emission , and masturbation ) and risk of prostate cancer .
The study used follow - up data from the Health Professionals Follow - up Study ( February 1 , 1992 , through January 31 , 2000 ) of 29,342 men in the U.S. , aged 46 to 81 years , who provided information on history of ejaculation frequency on a self - administered questionnaire in 1992 and responded to follow - up questionnaires every 2 years to 2000 .
Ejaculation frequency was assessed by asking participants to report the average number of ejaculations they had per month during the ages of 20 to 29 years , 40 to 49 years , and during the past year ( 1991 ) .
Among the participants , there were 1,449 new cases of total prostate cancer , 953 organ - confined cases , and 147 advanced cases of prostate cancer .
" In this prospective cohort study among predominantly white men , higher ejaculation frequency was not related to increased risk of prostate cancer .
Our results suggest that high ejaculation frequency possibly may be associated with a lower risk of total and organ - confined prostate cancer .
These associations were not explained by potential risk factors for prostate cancer , such as age , family history of prostate cancer , history of syphilis or gonorrhea , smoking , and diet , " the authors write .

Did Palin abuse power again for future son - in - law ?
Andrew McLemore
Published : Saturday January 3 , 2009
Print This Email This A critic of Gov. Sarah Palin claimed the Alaska politician may have once again abused her power to obtain an apprenticeship for her soon - to - be son - in - law Levi Johnston .
Dan Fagan , who also publishes a Web site called the thealaskastandard.com , said federal regulations require all apprentices to have a high school diploma , which Johnston does not have .
" So how is it that the governor 's soon - to - be son - in - law is working in an apprentice program ? "
Fagan wrote in an column .
" Is this another case of the governor believing the rules do n't apply to her or her family ? "
Called " Troopergate " by the media , an investigation of Palin concluded in October that she abused her power as an Alaska governor in the firing of the state public safety commissioner .
Palin defended her daughter 's fiance from what she considers inaccurate descriptions of Johnston as a high school dropout .
Palin said he is working for his diploma through a correspondence program .
Palin said she is " over the moon " about her future son - in - law .
" You need to know that both Levi and Bristol are working their butts off to parent and going to school and working at the same time , " Palin said in her first public statement about the father of her grandchild .
But Fagan questioned how Johnston gained entrance to the apprenticeship program when similar programs have long waiting lists .
There are only three in the state , according to Fagan , and at least one of them has a waiting list of at least 100 people .
" I believe 2009 will be the year more and more Alaskans will come to realize Sarah Palin is in way over her head as governor , does n't always play by the rules , and is , at times , less than honest , " Fagan wrote .
Obama\ 's Rules Keep It Intact , and Could Even Accord With an Increase in US - Sponsored Torture Worldwide
If you ’re lying on the slab still breathing , with your torturer hanging over you , you do n’t much care if he is an American or a mere United States — sponsored trainee .
When President Obama declared flatly this week that “ the United States will not torture ” many people wrongly believed that he ’d shut the practice down , when in fact he ’d merely repositioned it .
Obama ’s Executive Order bans some — not all — US officials from torturing but it does not ban any of them , himself included , from sponsoring torture overseas .
Indeed , his policy change affects only a slight percentage of US - culpable tortures and could be completely consistent with an increase in US - backed torture worldwide .
The catch lies in the fact that since Vietnam , when US forces often tortured directly , the US has mainly seen its torture done for it by proxy — paying , arming , training and guiding foreigners doing it , but usually being careful to keep Americans at least one discreet step removed .
That is , the US tended to do it that way until Bush and Cheney changed protocol , and had many Americans laying on hands , and sometimes taking digital photos .
The result was a public relations fiasco that enraged the US establishment since by exposing US techniques to the world it diminished US power .
But despite the outrage , the fact of the matter was that the Bush / Cheney tortures being done by Americans were a negligible percentage of all of the tortures being done by US clients .
For every torment inflicted directly by Americans in Iraq , Afghanistan , Guantanamo and the secret prisons , there were many times more being meted out by US - sponsored foreign forces .
Those forces were and are operating with US military , intelligence , financial or other backing in Egypt , Israel , Saudi Arabia , Ethiopia , Pakistan , Jordan , Indonesia , Thailand , Uzbekistan , Colombia , Nigeria , and the Philippines , to name some places , not to mention the tortures sans - American - hands by the US - backed Iraqis and Afghans .
What the Obama dictum ostensibly knocks off is that small percentage of torture now done by Americans while retaining the overwhelming bulk of the system ’s torture , which is done by foreigners under US patronage .
Obama could stop backing foreign forces that torture , but he has chosen not to do so .
His Executive Order instead merely pertains to treatment of “ [ A ] n individual in the custody or under the effective control of an officer , employee , or other agent of the United States Government , or detained within a facility owned , operated , or controlled by a department or agency of the United States , in any armed conflict . . . ” which means that it does n’t even prohibit direct torture by Americans outside environments of “ armed conflict , ” which is where much torture happens anyway since many repressive regimes are n’t in armed conflict .
And even if , as Obama says , “ the United States will not torture , ” it can still pay , train , equip and guide foreign torturers , and see to it that they , and their US patrons , do n’t face local or international justice .
This is a return to the status quo ante , the torture regime of Ford through Clinton , which , year by year , often produced more US - backed strapped - down agony than was produced during the Bush / Cheney years .
Under the old — now new again — proxy regime Americans would , say , teach interrogation / torture , then stand in the next room as the victims screamed , feeding questions to their foreign pupils .
That ’s the way the US did it in El Salvador under JFK through Bush Sr. ( For details see my “ Behind the Death Squads :
An exclusive report on the U.S. role in El Salvador ’s official terror , ” The Progressive , May , 1984 ; the US Senate Intelligence Committee report that piece sparked is still classified , but the feeding of questions was confirmed to me by Intelligence Committee Senators .
See also my “ Confessions of a Death Squad Officer , ” The Progressive , March , 1986 , and my “ Comment , ” The New Yorker , Oct. 15 , 1990 [ regarding law , the US , and El Salvador ] ) .
In Guatemala under Bush Sr. and Clinton ( Obama ’s foreign policy mentors ) the US backed the army ’s G - 2 death squad , which kept comprehensive files on dissidents and then electroshocked them or cut off their hands .
( The file / surveillance system was launched for them in the ’60s and ’ 70s by CIA / State / AID / special forces ; for the history see “ Behind the Death Squads , ” cited above , and the books of Prof. Michael McClintock ) .
The Americans on the ground in the Guatemalan operation , some of whom I encountered and named , effectively helped to run the G - 2 but , themselves , tiptoed around its torture chambers .
( See my “ C.I.A. Death Squad , ” The Nation [ US ] , April 17 , 1995 , “ The Country Team , ” The Nation [ US ] , June 5 , 1995 , letter exchange with US Ambassador Stroock , The Nation [ US ] , May 29 , 1995 , and Allan Nairn and Jean - Marie Simon , “ Bureaucracy of Death , ” The New Republic , June 30 , 1986 ) .
It was a similar story in Bush Sr. and Clinton ’s Haiti — an operation run by today ’s Obama people — where the DIA ( Defense Intelligence Agency ) helped launch the terrorist group FRAPH , the CIA paid its leader , and FRAPH itsef laid the machetes on Haitian civilians , torturing and killing as US proxies .
( See my “ Behind Haiti ’s paramilitaries : our man in FRAPH , ” The Nation [ US ] , Oct 24 , 1994 , and “ He ’s our S.O.B. , ” The Nation [ US ] , Oct. 31 , 1994 ; the story was later confirmed on ABC TV’s This Week by US Secretary of State Warren Christopher ) .
In today ’s Thailand — a country that hardly comes to mind when most people think of torture — special police and militaries get US gear and training for things like “ target selection ” and then go out and torture Thai Malay Muslims in the rebel deep south , and also sometimes ( mainly Buddhist ) Burmese refugees and exploited northern and west coast workers .
Not long ago I visited a key Thai interrogator who spoke frankly about army / police / intel torture and then closed our discussion by saying “ Look at this , ” and invited me into his back room .
It was an up to date museum of plaques , photos and awards from US and Western intelligence , including commendations from the CIA counter - terrorism center ( then run by people now staffing Obama ) , one - on - one photos with high US figures , including George W. Bush , a medal from Bush , various US intel / FBI / military training certificates , a photo of him with an Israeli colleague beside a tank in the Occupied Territories , and Mossad , Shin Bet , Singaporean , and other interrogation implements and mementos .
On my way out , the Thai intel man remarked that he was due to re-visit Langley soon .
His role is typical .
There are thousands like him worldwide .
US proxy torture dwarfs that at Guantanamo .
Many Americans , to their credit , hate torture .
The Bush / Cheney escapade exposed that .
But to stop it they must get the facts and see that Obama ’s ban does not stop it , and indeed could even accord with an increase in US - sponsored torture crime .
In lieu of action , the system will grind on tonight .
More shocks , suffocations , deep burns .
And the convergence of thousands of complex minds on one simple thought : ‘ Please , let me die . ’
I 'm still bemused by the drop in gay support for Obama after Kerry .
I 'd put it down primarily to the fact that the gay political establishment , with its usual brilliance , fused itself with the Clinton campaign very early on , and there was a real slice of Clintonian anti-Obama hate that would n't go away .
For much of the campaign , I expressed surprise at how so many gay men and lesbians were indifferent or hostile to Obama .
Maybe there was a particular lesbian bond with Clinton , which may have led some lesbians to pick McCain ( they 're susceptible to a little Alaskan boobage as well ) .
Maybe that goes for some diva - worshipping gay men as well , men who so identified with Hillary that they could n't reconcile themselves to Obama .
But a reader suggests that racism may be more alive and well in the gay community than some of us want to believe :
I think you could do quite a bit more with that startling statistic - McCain 27 % vs. Bush 23 % among gays , Obama 70 % vs. Kerry 77 % .
As a married gay man I 'm upset about Prop 8 , but I 'm also upset about this blame - the - blacks line .
The black vote in California simply was n't large enough to make a difference , so why are people focusing on that ?
The eagerness to jump on the black vote for Prop 8 , together with the statistic above , points to a smoldering issue in the gay community .
Now , if there were any signals of reluctance from Obama on gay rights , that would be one thing , but here 's a candidate who made his debut on the national stage with a speech whose most electrifying passage contained the phrase " and we 've got gay friends in the red states . "
I remember being thunderstruck when he said that 
I 'd never heard a national candidate talk so matter - of - factly , so un - self - consciously , about gay people .
And a version of that line has been in every stump speech he 's given , probably more than a thousand times across the country .
So there 's no way you can argue that McCain is better than Obama on gay - political grounds .
McCain is admittedly more gay - friendly than a lot of Republicans , but his record is demonstrably worse than Obama's , and if you throw in Palin and the Supreme Court you have a pretty bleak picture .
So what is going on here ?
I have to say , anecdotally among gay friends I notice a certain amount of casual racism that shocks me , notwithstanding the dancing to black music and the supposedly affectionate impersonations of black voices .
People talk about the irony of blacks voting for Obama but against Prop 8 .
Well , let 's also talk seriously about the irony of gay people voting Republican in greater numbers than ever before -- in the year of Obama .
I take the point - although we should also note the overwhelming support for Obama as well .
But I think there 's something there as well .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

TPM Reader BM ’s lament …
I was @ home today , painting a room and writing a lecture , with MSNBC on for most of the day .
I do n’t know about the other cable nets , but there were almost no Dems from the Hill on during the day , at all .
Lots of Rs. Lots of re-rolling of Obama footage and the Gibbs briefing late in the afternoon .
What ’s up with that ?
Are the cable networks just not booking them , or are they staying quiet while Rs complain ?
The way the coverage was playing out , you ’d think the House Republicans had a zillion seat majority .
The spectacle of corporate magnates from Detroit pleading to be on Uncle Sam 's dole is a sordid one .
So why are n't more Americans appalled ?
One reason is widespread misunderstanding -- much of it sowed by these auto makers -- about the size of their firms .
The Big Three , we are told , are " too big to be allowed to fail . "
This myth begins with the idea that GM , Ford and Chrysler are so huge that if they go belly - up , the livelihoods of a disproportionately large number of workers and suppliers would be affected .

Faced with widening budget shortfalls , several states are rolling back support services for the elderly and disabled .
The move is making it tougher for them to continue living on their own , advocates say .
At least 15 states , including Alabama , Virginia and Massachusetts , are targeting such funding , mostly for programs that allow low - income shut-ins to receive personal care -- like cooking , cleaning and basic health services -- in their own homes , according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , a liberal - leaning Washington , ...
Simple aspirin may prevent liver damage in millions of people suffering from side effects of common drugs , alcohol abuse , and obesity - related liver disease , a new Yale University study suggests .
The study documents that in mice , aspirin reduced mortality caused by an overdose of acetaminophen , best known by the brand name Tylenol .
It further showed that a class of molecules known as TLR antagonists , which block receptors known to activate inflammation , have a similar effect as aspirin .
Since these agents seem to work by reducing injury - induced inflammation , the results suggest aspirin may help prevent and treat liver damage from a host of non-infectious causes , said Wajahat Mehal , M.D. , of the Section of Digestive Diseases and Department of Immunobiology at Yale School of Medicine .
" Many agents such as drugs and alcohol cause liver damage , and we have found two ways to block a central pathway responsible for such liver injury , " Mehal said .
" Our strategy is to use aspirin on a daily basis to prevent liver injury , but if it occurs , to use TLR antagonists to treat it . "
Promising drugs that have failed clinical trials because of liver toxicity might be resurrected if combined with aspirin , Mehal said .
" This offers the exciting possibility of reducing a lot of pain and suffering in patients with liver diseases , using a new and very practical approach , " Mehal said .
Other researchers from Yale who contributed to this study are Avlin Imaeda , Azuma Watanabe , Adnan Sohail , Shamail Mahmood , Mehdi Mohamadnejad , Fayyaz Sutterwala , and Richard Flavell .
The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases at the National Institutes of Health , the Ellison Foundation , and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute funded the study .

Normally I give blog posts detailing the fun , interesting or advanced stuff I do with Haskell .
But that is n't a real representation of my programming life !
Most of the time I am doing small scripts that do little tasks , so I thought I 'd describe one of those .
This post is written as Literate Haskell , which means you can save the whole contents as a .lhs file and run it in GHCi or Hugs .
The task I had to complete was to take a directory of files , and for each filegenerate the filesto , where each one file is a block of lines from the original delimited by a blank line .
i.e. given the file with the lines , the numberswould go inetc .
This blog post is n't how I actually wrote the original script - I did n't use literate Haskell ( since I find it ugly ) , I did n't give explicit import lists ( since they are needlessly verbose ) , I did n't give type signatures ( but I should have ) and I did n't split the IO and non-IO as well ( but again , I should have ) .
It is intended as a guide to the simple things you can easily do with Haskell .
Now on to the code ...
First , let 's import some useful modules .
To find more about a particular function just use Hoogle and search for it , but a quick summary : Every Haskell program starts with afunction , which is an IO action .
For this program , we are going to keep all the IO in main , and only use other pure functions .
With most file processing applications its best to read files from one directory , and write them to another .
That way , if anything goes wrong , its usually easy to recover .
In this case we read from " data " and write to " res " .
Or in some kind of pseudo - code : We can now move on to the pure bits left over .
We want a functionthat takes a file , and splits it in to three chunks for each of the blocks in the file .
When processing text , often there will be stray blank lines , and the term " blank lines " will also apply to lines consisting only of spaces .
The code is below :
And now presented more as a list of steps :
The tabify requirement was added after .
The person decided that all continuous runs of spaces should be converted to tabs , so the file could better be loaded in to a spread sheet .
Easy enough to add , just a simple bit of recursive programming :
And again in English : Haskell is a great language for writing short scripts , and as the libraries improve it just keeps getting better .
PARIS 
In an interview broadcast Tuesday on one of the Middle East ’s major news channels , President Obama struck a conciliatory tone toward the Islamic world , saying he wanted to persuade Muslims that “ the Americans are not your enemy . ”
He also said the moment was ripe for negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians .
The interview with Al Arabiya , an Arabic - language channel based in Dubai , United Arab Emirates , signaled a shift  in style and manner , at least  from the Bush administration , with Mr. Obama offering what he depicted as a new readiness to listen rather than to dictate .
It was Mr. Obama ’s first televised interview from the White House and the first with any foreign news outlet .
In the interview , which was taped on Monday night and broadcast throughout the Muslim world on Tuesday , Mr. Obama said it was his job “ to communicate to the Muslim world that the Americans are not your enemy . ”
PLEASANTVILLE , S.C. , Feb. 20 ( UPI ) --
A judge in South Carolina says five people caught playing poker in a private house must pay what they owe in fines for violating state gambling laws .
Pleasantville Municipal Judge Larry Duffy , in an order that seems almost certain to be appealed , said the law is unclear , which means the authorities must be given the benefit of the doubt , The Charleston ( S.C. ) Post and Courier reported .

" It is and appears to have been the public policy of the state of South Carolina to suppress gambling and that gambling in all forms is illegal in South Carolina , " he said .
The five men were given citations three years ago for a game of Texas Hold ' Em .
They could be fined as much as several hundred dollars each .
A move is under way to change the state law to exempt private poker games from the gambling ban .
This artist 's concept shows young , blue stars encircling a supermassive black hole at the core of a spiral galaxy like the Milky Way .
The background stars are the typical older , redder population of stars that inhabit the cores of most galaxies ( including our own ) .
CfA astronomers caught two stars in the act of forming within a few light - years of the Milky Way 's center .
Their find demonstrates that stars can form at our galaxy 's core despite the powerful gravitational tides generated by the black hole .
LONG BEACH , Calif . ?
Two embryonic stars discoveredjust a few light years away from the Milky Way ?s center show that stars canform in the potentially destructive reach of the powerful black hole at ourgalaxy 's center .
Astronomershave long known that young stars could be found near the centerof the galaxy , but they had no idea how the stars got there .
The regionwas n't thought to be conducive to starformation because of the powerful gravitational tides stirred up by the 4 million solar - mass blackhole at the galaxy 's center .
Scientists had figured that the tides wouldrip apart any gas clouds that could act as stellar nurseries .
Analternative explanation , that the stars fell in toward the galaxy 's centerafter forming elsewhere , was thought to be a rare event .
But the newdiscovery , presented here today at the 213th annual meeting of the AmericanAstronomical Society , shows that the stars did form in place .
? Weliterally caught these stars in the act of forming , ? said Elizabeth Humphreysof the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge , Mass .
Because thegas and dust between Earth and the galactic center blocks visible light fromgetting out , astronomers use infrared and radio wavelengths to peer into theregion .
Humphreysand her colleagues ( at the Harvard - Smithsonian Center and the Max PlanckInstitute for Radio Astronomy in Germany ) used the Very Large Array of radiotelescopes to search for water masers ?
radio signals that signal proto- starsstill embedded in their birth cocoons .
The teamfound the proto -stars at seven light - years and 10 light - years from the galacticcenter ( a light - year is the distance light will travel in a year , about 6 trillionmiles , or 10 trillion kilometers ) .
Combined with one previously identifiedproto - star , the objects show that star formation is taking place near the MilkyWay 's center .
The findingsuggests that the molecular gas at the center of the MilkyWay from which the stars form is denser than previously thought .
The higherdensity gas makes it easier for the self - gravity of the condensing cloud toovercome the strong pull of the black hole and to collapse to form new stars .
Thediscovery also supports recent supercomputer simulations that showed starformation within a few light years of the Milky Way ?s central black hole .
" Wedon ? t understand the environment at the galactic center very well yet , " Humphreys said .
" By combining observational studies like ours withtheoretical work , we hope to get a better handle on what 's happening at ourgalaxy 's core .
Then , we can extrapolate to more distant galaxies . "
Radio Address by the President to the Nation
Contact : White House , Office of the Press Secretary , 202-456-2580
WASHINGTON , Jan. 2 / Standard Newswire / --
The following text is a radio address by President Bush :
THE PRESIDENT : Good morning .
Over the past week , I have been monitoring the situation in the Middle East closely with the members of my national security team .
Secretary Rice is actively engaged in diplomacy .
And I 've been in contact with leaders throughout the region -- including the King of Saudi Arabia , the King of Jordan , the President of Egypt , the President and Prime Minister of the Palestinian Territories , and the Prime Minister of Israel .
This recent outburst of violence was instigated by Hamas -- a Palestinian terrorist group supported by Iran and Syria that calls for Israel 's destruction .
Eighteen months ago , Hamas took over the Gaza Strip in a coup , and since then has imported thousands of guns and rockets and mortars .
Egypt brokered a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel , but Hamas routinely violated that ceasefire by launching rockets into Israel .
On December 19th , Hamas announced an end to the ceasefire and soon unleashed a barrage of rockets and mortars that deliberately targeted innocent Israelis -- an act of terror that is opposed by the legitimate leader of the Palestinian people , President Abbas .
In response to these attacks on their people , the leaders of Israel have launched military operations on Hamas positions in Gaza .
As a part of their strategy , Hamas terrorists often hide within the civilian population , which puts innocent Palestinians at risk .
Regrettably , Palestinian civilians have been killed in recent days .
The United States is deeply concerned about the humanitarian situation facing the Palestinian people .
Since Hamas 's violent takeover in the summer of 2007 , living conditions have worsened for Palestinians in Gaza .
By spending its resources on rocket launchers instead of roads and schools , Hamas has demonstrated that it has no intention of serving the Palestinian people .
America has helped by providing tens of millions of dollars in humanitarian aid , and this week we contributed an additional $ 85 million through the United Nations .
We have consistently called on all in the region to ensure that assistance reaches those in need .
And as I told President Mubarak , America appreciates the role Egypt has played in facilitating the delivery of relief supplies in recent days .
In addition to reducing humanitarian suffering , all nations must work toward a lasting end to the violence in the Holy Land , and a return to the path of peace .
The United States is leading diplomatic efforts to achieve a meaningful ceasefire that is fully respected .
Another one - way ceasefire that leads to rocket attacks on Israel is not acceptable .
And promises from Hamas will not suffice -- there must be monitoring mechanisms in place to help ensure that smuggling of weapons to terrorist groups in Gaza comes to an end .
I urge all parties to pressure Hamas to turn away from terror , and to support legitimate Palestinian leaders working for peace .
In the days ahead , the United States will stay closely engaged with our partners in the region , in Europe , and in the international community .
My Administration will continue to keep the President - elect and his team informed .
And America 's objectives in the Middle East will remain clear :
We seek security and peace for our allies , the free people of Israel .
For the Palestinian people , we seek a peaceful and democratic Palestinian state that serves its citizens and respects its neighbors .
For all in the region , we seek an end to terror .
And we seek an enduring peace based on justice , dignity , and human rights for every person in every nation of the Middle East .
Thank you for listening .
With her modest earnings as a seamstress and her grown children out of work , Esperanza Jose is like thousands of Mexicans finding it harder to make ends meet .
And so she decided to take advantage of the city government ’s new soup kitchen , the first of 300 planned by March .
“ The truth is that there are a lot of people that now do n’t have jobs , and so if they ’re offering this , we should make the most of it , ” said Jose , 63 .
“ Many people are embarrassed to come ; but , well , we come with dignity . ”
As Mexico slips into the profound economic crisis circling the globe , unemployment is rising along with food prices .
Inflation is running about 8 % annually , but some basic “ family basket ” items such as cooking oil and rice are going up about 200 % a year , said Cesar Cravioto , head of the city ’s Institute of Social Assistance .
City officials hope to dish out 65,000 free or inexpensive meals a day at the soup kitchens , he said .
Advertisement
“ The crisis is hitting hard , and it worries us a lot , ” Cravioto said , noting that the number of people who receive unemployment payouts is expected to double this year in this city of 19 million .
The first soup kitchen , at a community center called Casa de la Luna ( House of the Moon ) , opened this month in the working - class Pedregal de Santa Ursula neighborhood in southern Mexico City .
It was packed , despite cold weather and rain .
Workers filled plastic plates with chicken , rice and beans , and handed out cups of sweet watermelon - flavored water .
Most of the beneficiaries were elderly people or single mothers with their children in tow .
While not homeless , they are unemployed or live on small incomes that are being stretched to the limit .
“ Many people suffer because food is so indispensable , ” said Laura Gonzales , a 37 - year - old homemaker who said she came to the canteen out of curiosity with her mother and small daughter .
“ So it ’s great that there are these places to eat because , in truth , there are those who do n’t have anything to eat . ”
Advertisement
The city says it plans to eventually spend about $ 14 million on the feeding network .
Some kitchens will provide food for free and others will ask for a small donation equivalent to about 70 cents to help subsidize electricity , cooking gas and other expenses .
Given Mexico ’s high level of endemic poverty , it is perhaps most surprising that the city government had not set up a feeding program before now .
Traditionally , in the capital at least , most Mexicans , no matter how poor , manage to eat , though the meal might consist of little more than tortillas and a gruel - like soup .
That may be changing , and organizers suggest the crisis will only deepen as food gets more expensive .
“ Around this neighborhood , there are a lot of highly marginalized zones and a lot of poverty , ” said Jabnely Maldonado Meza , 29 , who helps oversee the Casa de la Luna kitchen .
“ We serve everyone who wants to be fed .
. . .
Sometimes whole families come to eat here . ”

How Far from True North are the Avenues of Manhattan ?
by Charles Petzold
In 1811 , after four years of preparation , a plan was unveiled that mapped out the future development of the island of Manhattan .
Called the Commissioners ' Plan , this scheme imposed a rectangular grid of avenues and streets without regard for the existing topography of the island .
1,2
The result , of course , is the most consistent urban design in the world .
Other cities had been designed around grids before , but never so relentlessly .
The first rule that any visitor to Manhattan learns is that numbered avenues run north - south and numbered streets run east - west ( at least above Fourteenth Street and excluding Broadway ) .
The grid is so ubiquitous that New Yorkers tend to associate the layout of the streets with the points of the compass .
Uptown is synonymous with north ; downtown with south .
There 's a lower east side , an upper west side , the East Side Kids and a West Side Story .
When describing the location of homes or hot restaurants , we refer to the north and south sides of streets , the east and west sides of avenues , and corners that are northwest , northeast , southwest , and southeast .
However , the orientation of the city 's avenues was fixed to be parallel with the axis of Manhattan Island and has only a casual relationship to true north and south .
Maps that are oriented to true north ( like the one at the right ) show the island at a significant tilt .
In truth , avenues run closer to northeast and southwest than north and south .
Several years ago , a small garden was built on the southeast corner of 9th Street and 3rd Avenue that also highlighted the difference .
The garden lies on a triangle of land created by Stuyvesant Street , which cuts through the block from 9th Street and 3rd Avenue to 10th Street and 2nd Avenue .
This was the site of Peter Stuyvesant 's manor , and the street that remains was once part of a larger grid of streets oriented to truth north .
Most of these streets were destroyed to enforce the grid .
A structure in the garden shows the points of the compass lined up with Stuyvesant Street — not with 3rd Avenue .
What is the exact deviation of the city 's avenues from true north ?
This seems like the sort of information that every New Yorker should know , similar to the " twenty blocks to the mile " rule .
The truth is , however , that nobody I asked had ever heard of such a figure , or even thought about it , or even ( despite my inquisitiveness ) believed it to be of any importance whatsoever .
One way to determine the deviation is , of course , to take an actual compass out on the streets of Manhattan and try to find a place where it would n't be affected by the many metal structures in the city .
But that seemed too inaccurate , even after adjusting for the difference between true north and magnetic north .
Likewise , I wanted something more sophisticated than applying a protractor to a map .
I did n't want to read a figure from a dial : I wanted a number to pop out of a calculation .
As we all know , positions on the surface of the Earth can be specified with two numbers : longitude and latitude .
The latitude is the angular distance north or south of the equator .
The longitude is the angular distance east or west of the prime meridian , which passes through Greenwich , England .
Determination of one 's longitude and latitude was once a complex procedure involving careful observations of the stars and ( in the case of longitude ) an accurate clock .
Today , we can read the longitude and latitude from a hand - held GPS ( Global Positioning System ) device .
Or , we can make use of maps via the Internet .
The maps on this page are generated using the recent ( as of July 2005 ) Google Maps API , which defines several JavaScript classes .
These maps are interactive :
By clicking the little arrows , you can move in four directions , or zoom in and out .
You can also switch between Map view and Satellite view .
Whenever you see a little push - pin marker , you can click it to obtain the longitude and latitude at the marker .
In the paragraphs that follow , I 'll be describing a position as the number pair ( longitude , latitude ) .
I 've expressed longitude and latitude to five decimal places , equivalent to about four feet accuracy .
3
Here 's Stuyvesant Street in the East Village :
Suyvesant Street is supposed to run exactly east - west but the longitude and latitude at the two markers reveals that it 's not quite exact .
For the remaining calculations , I 've chosen to focus on 5th Avenue because it is traditionally considered to be the center of Manhattan and divides street addresses into east and west .
I found the longitude and latitude of 5th Avenue at two positions :
Where it begins at Washington Square Park ( specifically , Waverly Place , one block south of 8th Street ) :
and where it meets the corner of Central Park at 59th street :
Remember , you can click the push pins to see the longitude and latitude of these two points .
More severely graphically , the two points look something like this :
There are a couple different approaches to dealing with this information .
One approach is to assume that 5th Avenue occupies an area small enough to be approximated with plane trigonometry .
However , some simple spherical trigonometry is required as well .
In particular , in spherical trigonometry , a great circle is the equivalent of a straight line :
It represents the shortest distance between two points on the surface of the sphere .
Every great circle divides the sphere into two halves of equal size .
Because distances on a sphere are segments of a great circle , the distances can be expressed in angles measured from the center of the sphere .
To convert an angle expressed in radians to a linear distance , multiply the angle by the sphere 's radius .
To convert an angle expressed in degrees , multiply the angle by 2 πR ( the circumference ) and divide by 360° .
Let 's begin by constructing a right triangle where the hypotenuse is the stretch of 5th Avenue between the two parks :
The line labeled a is a line of latitude ; the line labeled b is a long of longitude ; we 're trying to find the angle α where :
tan(α ) = a / b
Of course , this formula is from plane trigonometry .
At some point we have to determine if this approximation is valid .
Because the endpoints of line b have the same longitude , line b is on a meridian , which means that it's on a great circle that passes through the North and South poles .
It 's fairly easy to calculate the physical distance between two points on a meridian because the difference in latitudes are easily converted to a distance .
If R is the radius of the Earth , then the total length of the meridian is the circumference of the Earth , which is 2 πR .
The length of a line on a meridian with endpoints at latitudes φ 1 and φ 2 is the total circumference of the Earth multiplied by the difference in latitudes divided by 360° :
b = 2 π R ( φ 2 − φ 1 ) / 360
Circles of equal latitude are in general not great circles .
As you go further north or south from the equator , circles of equal latitude become smaller and smaller .
However , it 's easy to demonstrate that the radius of these circles is the cosine of the latitude φ .
Thus , the length of a line on a circle of equal latitude with endpoints at longitudes λ 1 and λ 2 is :
a = 2 π R cos( φ ) ( λ 2 − λ 1 ) / 360
So , if the tangent of angle α is a divided by b , then :
α = tan -1 ( cos (φ 1 ) ( λ 2 − λ 1 ) / ( φ 2 − φ 1 ) )
or in this case :
α = tan -1 ( cos ( 40.73140 ) ( 73.99698 − 73.97303 ) / ( 40.76426 − 40.73140 ) )
And the answer is :
28.911°
Normally I 'd be happy rounding the result to 29 .
I 'm showing it to such precision to make a point .
You see , an alternative method of constructing a right triangle with the same hypotenuse is like so :
If you calculate the angle based on this triangle , then the answer is :
28.899°
That these numbers are so close is a good indication that our use of plane trigonometry is a satisfactory approximation .
But let 's see if we can do better .
In spherical geometry , a triangle is defined by the intersection of three great circles .
Triangles have three interior angles and three lengths .
As in plane geometry , if you know any three of these quantities , you can determine the other three using appropriate formulas .
In plane trigonometry , the interior angles of a triangle always sum to 180° .
In spherical trigonometry , the interior angles of a triangle always sum to greater than 180°
Let 's construct another triangle using that same stretch of Fifth Avenue , but this time using principles of spherical trigonometry .
The two constructed sides are arcs of great circles that meet at the North pole ( indicated by N ) :
Of course , this map is not to scale .
By assuming that Fifth Avenue is on a great circle , I 'm implying that the avenues of Manhattan get closer together as they get more northern , which may be a little disturbing .
Once again we 're trying to find angle α.
Of the three sides and three interior angles , we immediately know the lengths of two sides and one angle , which is theoretically sufficient information to get the other side and the other two angles ( although the math may be messy ) .
We know the lengths of the two constructed sides because the latitudes imply distances from the North pole .
Assuming a mean radius of the Earth of 3,960 miles , the distance from Washington Square Park to the North pole is :
2 π R ( 90 − 40.73140 ) / 360 = 3405.20 miles
The distance from the southeast corner of Central Park to the North pole is :
2 π R ( 90 − 40.76426 ) / 360 = 3402.93 miles
The angle at N between these two sides is equal to the difference of longitude between the two points : 0.02395° .
1
1
2
2
cos(d ) = sin(φ 1 ) sin(φ 2 ) + cos(φ 1 ) cos(φ 2 ) cos(λ 1 −λ 2 )
Solving for d , we get :
d = 0.000655125 radians = 0.0375359° = 2.594 miles
Because this distance along Fifth Avenue comprises 52 blocks , the 20 - blocks - to - a - mile rule looks pretty good .
In spherical trigonometry , the law of sines says that for any triangle , the ratio of the sine of any side of triangle to the sine of the opposite angle is constant .
That means we can determine α like this :
sin(α ) / sin( 90 − 40.76426 ) = sin( 0.02395 ) / sin( 0.0375359 )
Solving for alpha we get :
28.897°
The remaining angle — the angle at Central Park — is 151.088° , implying that Fifth Avenue deviates from true north at this point by 180° − 151.088° or :
28.912°
As a great circle , Fifth Avenue would deviate from true north the more north it got .
I 've been assuming that the Earth is a sphere , which it is not .
It is actually closer to an oblate ellipsoid .
A cross section of the Earth would look like an ellipse with the major axis along the equater and the minor axis between the poles .
A more accurate formula for calculating the distance between two points is available .5 , but the difference is small , and it 's not clear to me how these distances can be converted to angles for use in spherical trigonometry formulas .
I am thus satisfied with a figure rounded to the nearest degree .
The avenues of Manhattan deviate from true north by
29°
whether anybody else cares or not .

Obama to gun owners :
You have ' nothing to fear ' Agence France - Presse
Published : Sunday December 7 , 2008
Print This Email This CHICAGO ( AFP )  President - elect Barack Obama said Sunday that lawful gun owners have " nothing to fear " from his incoming administration so there is no reason for Americans to stock up on guns .
Gun shops across the country have reported increased sales amid fears that Obama intends to restrict gun sales after taking office on January 20 .
While Obama supports gun control , he has repeatedly denied any intention of " taking away folks ' guns . "
The right to bear arms is guaranteed in the second amendment of the US constitution and gun control is a hot - button political issue .
" I believe in common sense gun safety law , and I believe in the second amendment , " Obama said at a press conference Sunday .
" And so , lawful gun owners have nothing to fear .
" I 've said that throughout the campaign .
I have n't indicated anything different during the transition , and I think that people can take me at my word . "

Josh : QUESTION FOR EVERYONE ....
SecureXeC : IT 'S TO THE LEFT OF YOUR 'A ' KEY .
TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203 .T is likely to further cut its earnings forecasts and report an operating loss of about 100 billion yen ( $ 1 billion ) in the October - March period , Japanese media reported on Saturday .

Toyota is likely to further cut its earnings forecasts and report an operating loss of about 100 billion yen ( $ 1 billion ) in the October - March period , Japanese media reported on Saturday .

A company spokesman declined to comment .
But analysts say that with the yen soaring and global vehicle sales sliding more than expected , Toyota was well on its way to falling into the red in the second half .
The yen rose to a 13 - year high versus the dollar to 88.10 yen on Friday .
Toyota , the world ’s No.1 automaker , has set its currency assumptions at 100 yen to the dollar for the October - March second half , and the euro at 130 yen .
The European currency is trading at a more unfavorable 122 yen .
Goldman
Sachs this week lowered its full - year operating profit forecast for Toyota to 208 billion yen from 624 billion yen , expecting further production cuts .
The brokerage ’s forecast would signify a loss of 374 billion yen in the second half , much bigger than what was reported by Kyodo news agency on Saturday , which put the loss at 100 billion yen , citing “ informed sources . ”
The Asahi Shimbun daily carried a similar report without citing sources , saying the second - half loss would be over 100 billion yen if the yen did not weaken significantly .
It would mean Toyota ’s operating profit for the year to March 2009 would amount to 420 billion yen at best , more than 80 percent lower than the 2.27 trillion yen Toyota made in operating profit last year , Asahi added .
The expected loss in the second - half would be Toyota ’s first for a six - month period since it began reporting under U.S. accounting rules in 1999 .
Toyota last month slashed its operating profit forecast for the year to March 31 , 2009 , by 1 trillion yen ( $ 10.98 billion ) to 600 billion yen , citing weak global car sales amid tighter credit and a financial crisis .
That would signify a second - half profit of less than 20 billion yen .
Analysts expect other Japanese automakers to suffer also , as the value of their earnings made overseas erodes when converted back into yen .
A top Honda Motor Co 7267 .
T executive told Reuters recently that meeting its latest annual profit forecasts would be nearly impossible .
Many analysts have not officially revised their forecasts for Toyota , but three that have updated their figures this month have put the annual operating profit at 330 billion yen or less .
Toyota ’s share price ended Friday down 10 percent at 2,760 yen .

Our friend Mario Rizzo has been doing absolutely splendid work uncovering the " real " Keynes and his skepticism about the stimulus value of public works programs .
In preparing for this morning 's edition of my senior seminar , which covers the Hoover years , I was struck in re-reading Rothbard 's chapters on 1929 and 1930 how much support there was among mainstream economists of the era for public works programs as unemployment relievers .
I bring this up because this was all very much before Keynes wrote The General Theory .
We already know , of course , that Hoover enacted a number of such programs during his time as president .
The pre-GT support for public works gives further lie to the various myths of the Great Depression , especially the one that somehow thinks that Keynesian economics was " behind " the New Deal 's massive economic interventionism .
In fact , as many have shown , the New Deal was hardly constructed on the basis of a theory of any sort , and even if FDR had turned to Keynes , he would have found a much more ambiguous message ( as Mario points out ) .
And , given my morning 's reading , the idea of using public works to create employment did n't need Keynes anyway : plenty of big name economists believed it long before FDR became president and there was any such thing as Keynesian economics .
For all the good that economists did in opposing Smoot - Hawley , they did much to undermine it by supporting various public works boondoggles .
In this crappy economy there is no use waiting until the outcome of the BCS game to start selling merchandise reflecting your home team as the winner .

Luckily for us , an airport worker snapped these shots that will obviously go viral by lunch and put Florida fans into message board rage .
The gift shop at airport I work at ( Tulsa ) decided to put this sign out today 01/06/09 .
Its amusing considering that the time the game wo n’t be played until 01/08/09 .
Amusing ?
Yeah , now Tebow is going to rip out your hearts and serve them to his defensive line .
In a battle of merchandising wits it seems that the slow people from Oklahoma have out smarted the even slower people of Florida .
Kudos to Sooners ’ Nation .
I 'M MORE AND MORE CONVINCED that the difference between the values of the average conservative and average liberal are not so great as we are led to believe .
The example that comes to hand is yet another propaganda email .
This one contains a quote from the late Adrian Rogers , a Baptist pastor and leader of the religious right :
You cannot legislate the poor into freedom
by legislating the wealthy out of freedom .
What one person receives without working for ,
another person must work for without receiving .
The government cannot give to anybody anything
that the government does not first take from somebody else .
When half of the people get the idea that
they do not have to work
because the other half is going to take care of them ,
and when the other half gets the idea that
it does no good to work
because somebody else is going to get what they work for ,
that my dear friend , is about the end of any nation .
You cannot multiply wealth
by dividing it .
On the surface this may just appear to be standard right - wing propaganda , but on a deeper level it resonates with all of the most cherished liberal values .
Let 's unpack it one line at a time .
You cannot legislate the poor into freedom
by legislating the wealthy out of freedom .
I do n't think anyone , conservative or liberal , would disagree with that .
In fact , it 's a very liberal sentiment .
Freedom must be universal , or it does n't exist for anyone .
That 's why the ACLU defends Nazis and KKK members and Rush Limbaugh as readily as it defends liberals and Sunday school teachers .
Freedom must be protected for all , rich and poor alike , or it 's protected for no one .
What one person receives without working for ,
another person must work for without receiving .
This , too , seems to be true .
Most of what we have comes from someone 's labor , and so either we have worked for it or someone else has .
The author has actually put his finger on one of the great injustices of our society — people who live well at the cost of other 's labor .
Rogers is speaking , of course , of the very wealthy .
He was , after all , a Baptist pastor , and was well aware of the attitude that Jesus took toward wealth .
You do n't obtain great wealth through your own labor .
You either inherit it or you get it by arranging to profit from the labor of others .
Does anyone really believe that Bill Gates , or Warren Buffet , have , by their own labor , produced the kind of wealth they control ?
Of course not .
They , and all the other wealthy people in this country , have prospered from the labor of the poor and middle class .
They have made billions by building , and investing in , businesses which hold back profits from thousands of other people 's hard work and creativity , and give that wealth to the owners , who often do n't lift a finger , except to purchase stock .
Some argue , of course , that without the owners there would be no work .
Perhaps .
But is that an excuse for the owners to take more than the share of the profits which can be justified by their actual labor ?
Rogers ( and Jesus ) are quite right .
The wealthy are parasites — feeding on the labors of the working poor and middle class .
That does n't mean they should n't have the same rights as anyone else , though .
As Rogers said above , rights should be equal for all .
Next line :
The government cannot give to anybody anything
that the government does not first take from somebody else .
Again , I find myself in complete agreement .
On the one hand , we need to provide health care for people who can't afford it — because the wealthy are not paying them what their work is worth , or have drained all the money out of their communities .
We need to take care of widows , and of children whose parents can't get work because of the recession , and of veterans who can't work because of damage sustained defending the rights of both the rich and the poor .
Once again , conservative , Christian , and liberal values are in agreement .
But on the other hand , money does n't grow on trees .
So where are we going to get this money ?
From all those middle - class and poor people who have already been robbed of the money their work earned ?
Or from the extremely wealthy , who have tons of money they never earned at all ?
Rogers ' conclusion is obvious .
When half of the people get the idea that they do not have to work
because the other half is going to take care of them ,
and when the other half gets the idea that it does no good to work
because somebody else is going to get what they work for ...
What liberal could paint a more accurate picture of the growing gap between the wealthy and the middle class in this county , or the psychological results of that gap ?
True , Rogers exaggerates the number of wealthy people who are living off the work of the rest — perhaps he 's thinking more of the division of the money .
A relatively small number of wealthy people in this country do have more than half the wealth .
In any case , his broader point is absolutely true .
The ordinary working person does begin to feel that there 's hardly any point working day in and day out , just to make the owner richer .
... that my dear friend , is about the end of any nation .
Again , dead on .
It 's particularly the end of any democracy , since wealth is also power , and the money the rich have stolen from the rest of us gives them the political clout to control the government .
It 's hard to see any division between Rogers and almost any liberal on this point .
And , finally :
You cannot multiply wealth by dividing it .
How true , especially when our current tax laws make the division so completely unfair .
The richest 5 % of the populace own half of all the wealth , while those who created the wealth struggle to make ends meet every day .
This quote is probably one of the most concise and compelling arguments for increased government services and a steeply progressive tax system I 've ever read .
And it comes from a former leader of the religious right .
It just goes to show ...
We 're not as far apart as we think .
JERUSALEM–The Israeli government closed a rift among its top leaders last night and rededicated itself to continued war in Gaza , amid reports Hamas may be willing to end the fight .
" Israel is not interested in a temporary solution which will just allow Hamas to regroup and rearm , " Mark Regev , spokesperson for Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert , told the Star .
He was speaking after Olmert met with Defence Minister Ehud Barak and Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni , in a bid to iron out their differences over a possible ceasefire deal .
The trio reaffirmed Israel 's two key conditions for agreeing to a ceasefire – an end to hostile rocket fire from Gaza and " effective " guarantees there will be no more smuggling of weapons into the territory .
" Until this is done , the military pressure will keep up , " Regev said .
" This is what came out of the meeting of the trio . "
Earlier in the day , aides to Olmert and Barak traded barbs in the Israeli news media , after the defence minister publicly expressed his support for a week - long humanitarian ceasefire to allow Gaza 's 1.5 million people a respite from the fighting after 19 days of war .
Livni is also said to want to end the fighting sooner rather than later .
The sniping among Israel 's leadership coincided with reports from Cairo late yesterday that a Hamas delegation had agreed to an Egyptian - brokered ceasefire proposal that would stop the armed conflict .
The delegation reportedly was flying from Cairo to Damascus last night to hold talks on the issue with top Hamas officials based in the Syrian capital .
The deal calls for 10 days of quiet to work out the contentious issues of a longer truce , according to Egyptian and Palestinian officials close to the talks .
During that time , Egyptian and other international mediators would try to negotiate an arrangement for policing Gaza 's borders , Associated Press reports .
Israeli officials were expected in Cairo today to hold talks with Egyptian intelligence officials .
If Hamas has truly accepted Israel 's terms , then " this can be over quickly , " Regev said .
" If this is game - playing and stalling , then the pressure will go on . "
But a senior Hamas representative in Lebanon , Osama Hamdan , told reporters there that the group still objects to some provisions of the Egyptian proposal and was not ready to sign it yet .
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon was in Egypt yesterday and was scheduled to visit Israel today .
At a press conference , he reiterated his call for an immediate end to hostilities , in keeping with a Security Council resolution issued last week and so far ignored by both Israel and Hamas .
" It is intolerable that civilians bear the brunt of this conflict , " he said .
Israel showed no signs of slowing its bruising offensive as fighting raged early today north and south of Gaza City , where explosions and gunfire could be heard .
Hospital officials said seven people were killed – four militants shortly after midnight in southern Gaza and three people an hour later in Gaza City .
The offensive has killed at least 1,018 Palestinians , about half of them civilians , including 300 children and teenagers , said Dr. Moaiya Hassanain of the Gaza Health Ministry .
The toll included 68 Palestinians who were killed or died of wounds yesterday .
Israel has suffered 13 fatalities , four of them soldiers .
One Israeli soldier was seriously wounded yesterday after his unit was hit by an anti-tank missile .
Palestinian militants fired at least 17 rockets or mortar shells at Israel yesterday , down from as many as 80 a day earlier in the fighting that began Dec. 27 .
The projectiles hit Ashkelon , Sderot , Beersheba and other communities in southern Israel , but there were no reports of damage or personal injury .
Three Katyusha rockets crashed in northern Israel yesterday without causing harm , after being launched from southern Lebanon .
It was the second such incident in less than a week , and Israel responded with artillery fire .
Lebanese militant group Hezbollah , which fought a month - long war against Israel in 2006 , denied responsibility for a similar attack last weekend .
There was no word last night on who might have had responsibility for yesterday 's barrage .
The Israeli Air Force continued flying sorties over Gaza yesterday , attacking about 60 targets , according to the Israel Defense Forces .
Israel 's fierce assault on Gaza 's Hamas rulers has destroyed at least $ 1.4 billion worth of buildings , roads , pipes , power lines and other infrastructure in already impoverished territory , Palestinian surveyors estimate .
Arab and Western countries will be called on to foot much of the bill to rebuild – which Palestinian economists say could take five years or more .
The foreign ministers of France , Norway and the European Union external relations commissioner are meeting in Paris today to discuss Gaza 's reconstruction and the possibility of holding a new donors ' conference .
Sad Hominid Arguments
Via “ Tyler Cowen ” : http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2004/04/evolutionary_th.html , a rather wonderful example of the absurdities of gung - ho evolutionary psychology .
Edward H. Hagen , Paul J. Watson and J. Anderson Thomson Jr. “ propose ” : http://itb.biologie.hu-berlin.de/~hagen/HWT.pdf that severe depression is adaptive – it serves a functional purpose .
It compels others to help the victim and thus redounds to his or her long term advantage .
In short , depression is “ an unconsciously calculated gamble to gain greater long - term benefits . ”
This is a near - perfect example of what might be dubbed ( with no apologies whatsoever to “ Cosmides and Tooby ” : http://www.psych.ucsb.edu/research/cep/primer.html) the Standard Evolutionary Psychology Model .
First , take some human trait or behaviour .
Bonus points if it ’s something weird like “ slash fiction ” : https://www.crookedtimber.org/archives/000398.html that ’s likely to attract the interest of the Sunday supplement editors .
Second , construct an “ ad hominid argument ” : http://homepage.mac.com/jholbo/homepage/pages/blog/blog19.html#201
claiming that this trait or behaviour served some functional need for hunter - gatherers on the veldt .
Third , use your findings to justify some right - wing shibboleth or another , showing that hunter - gatherer societies hardwire us for perfectly competitive markets or the like ( in fairness , Hagen , Watson and Thomson jr. do n’t do this ) .
Fourth , write article .
Repeat as often as necessary to get tenure and / or the attention of the popular press .
Of course , at no stage of the process need you deign to provide convincing empirical evidence that might sully the clarity and vigour of your argument .
It ’s wretched stuff , that does n’t do any favors to Darwinian theory .
That our minds are undeniably the product of evolutionary forces does n’t and should n’t provide a license for half - baked functionalist explanations of the psychology of everyday life .

10 . House Republican accidentally tells truth about Solyndra investigation
Wow .
Ca n’t really explain this one .
I mean , this was actually news — at least inasmuch as a story about non-news can be news .
( You ’ll recall that the Solyndra investigation was cooked up by Republicans to tar renewable energy and President Obama ’s economic recovery efforts in general . )
But the web - surfing public went for it , big time .
Go figure .
9 . Woman arrested for burning down 3,500 - year - old tree
Pro tip :
If you ’re going to do meth inside a giant tree and then light the thing on fire , do n’t take pictures of the conflagration and leave them lying around where the cops can find them .
There may be a happy ending to this story , however : The Orlando Sentinel reports that University of Florida foresters produced clones of the tree , called the Senator , 15 years before it burned .
Plans are afoot to plant one of the clones in the park where the Senator once stood .
If all goes well , everything will be back to normal in about 3,485 years .
8 . Watch rescued ducks discover the water for the first time in this heartwarming video
Here ’s another gem from the messed - up - people - vs. - the - planet department — this time a story about 160 ducks rescued from a hoarder who kept them in some pretty horrid conditions .
Turns out that not all ducks take to water like , well … oh , just watch it .
You ’ll laugh , you ’ll cry , etc. , etc .
7 . Here is a shark swallowing another shark
Nuf said .
6 . If you ’re 27 or younger , you ’ve never experienced a colder - than - average month
This little statistic apparently left the interwebs agog : According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , “ This is the 332nd consecutive month with an above - average temperature . ”
In other words , if you were born in or after April 1985 , you have never lived through a month that was colder than average .
Um , is it getting hot in here ?
5. $ 28 cabbage , $ 65 chicken , and other insane food prices in Northern Canada
Another sign of how completely super cool Canada is : The Inuit have their own freaking province .
Now if they could only afford food .
This story may only be the fifth most clicked story of 2012 , but it contains , hands down , the best ( worst ) pun of the year .
4. 9 - year - old ’s lunch blog shames school into making changes
Yeah , so some 9 - year - old decides to start a blog about the crap she ’s served in the school cafeteria , and she gets all kinds of international attention , including from celebrity chef Jamie Oliver , and as a result , the school starts feeding the kids actual food .
Big whoop !
We have a blog , too .
Where ’s the love ?
3 . The most brutal ad you ’ll see this election
It stands to reason that the shortest post Grist ’s staff writer , David Roberts , wrote all year got the most traffic .
His subject : a bruiser of an ad that features scenes of superstorm Sandy ravaging the Eastern Seaboard , set to Mitt Romney ’s wisecrack about climate change at the Republican National Convention and the raucous applause that followed .
The sum total of Roberts ’ commentary : “ Ouch . ”
2. America has 40 million McMansions that no one wants
OK , we ’ll admit it .
That ’s a hell of a headline .
1. Giant , awesome tree lobster survived 80 years in hiding
The f*& % ^ing tree lobster !
This thing is the bane of our existence .
You let down your guard for like FIVE MINUTES and the tree lobster is back at the top of the traffic charts — and indeed , it ’s tops for 2012 .
But wait , oh god , that thing is AMAZING , really .
Here ’s how Sarah Laskow sums up its story :
A giant , awesome bug that looks like an alien almost did n’t survive because people are idiots ( and rats are jerks ) .
But it did , because sometimes people are n’t total idiots and are a little bit brave .
And now you can watch how awesome this bug is on the internet .
So OK , we ’ll let this pass just once , tree lobster .
But mark our words :
We wo n’t let you do this to us again next year .
Next year it ’s gonna be , well … would somebody pass the whiskey ?
A man who faked his qualifications to perform maintenance checks on Qantas 747s and then falsified the character references he was relying on to get a lighter prison term has been sentenced to three years and five months behind bars .

It had to happen eventually .
Hollywood is making a reboot of a previously produced movie based on a board game .
According to Variety , Gore Verbinski , director the the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise and The Ring , is attached to produce … and direct … a big - screen version of the classic board game Clue .
But … did n’t this happen once before ?
Was n’t there a little 1985 movie starring Christopher Lloyd and Tim Currie ?
Yes , there was .
It was critically panned , but the critics were wrong .
The original Clue is one of the best farces ever put to celluloid .
It builds from a dry humor to absolute absurdity .
And the alternate endings prove that absolutely anyone could have performed the murders and paints the whole murder mystery in a new and fun light .
I love that movie .
So , Gore , here is my suggestion .
Make this as remake of the original movie .
Do it shot for shot , Psycho style .
And when people give you crap about it , flip them off and set fire to some of your Pirates money .
Seriously , though , it does beg the question …
“ Mr. Verbinski , you just completed one of the most successful adventure franchises of all time .
The world is your oyster .
What ’s next ? ”
Now we know the answer .
Clue .
The movie .
The victims of Israel ’s latest attempt to empty and depopulate historic Palestine .
( Hatem Omar / MaanImages )
In Summer 2006 , after months of Israeli hints that it was going to move into Lebanon and “ finish off ” Hizballah , world leaders were also too busy and quite shocked ; to be precise , they were “ shocked ” for a whole month , a month of wanton destruction and killing , exactly until Israel needed a ceasefire urgently , as things were not going according to plan .
Then , all of a sudden , western nations moved overnight to impose a cease - fire .
Even so , they failed to help Israel in its mission of destroying Hizballah .
So , while only people with no easy access to their moral fiber can go on claiming that Israel is right in its murderous , barbaric and illogical revenge mission to hell , the real question is , how are they allowed to do it , and always get away with it ?
After 40 years of brutal occupation , with every item of countless UN resolutions and the Geneva Conventions violated , with tens of thousands dead in countries surrounding Palestine , not to mention in Palestine itself , after numerous peace agreements , initiatives , drives , road maps and Nobel Prizes , we are still where we were 40 years ago , but in a much worse scenario .
Surely this could not be happening , yet it is , and it will continue to happen , dragging more and more of world politics into the quagmire of the Israeli - Palestinian conflict , which has now turned into the World vs.
Palestine conflict , it seems .
Now this could never happen , unless world leaders were closing their eyes to it — staunchly , continuously , devotedly and methodically , and for decades .
So what are they doing now , when Israel moves , again , against one and a half million Palestinians , after having starved them for almost two months ?
After having denied them any chance of work , food , medicine , fuel , electricity or water ?
What are the leaders of the “ democratic world , ” Bush , Brown , Berlusconi or Sarkozy — all sworn supporters of Israel — doing now ?
What have they learned from the last hundred or so Israeli incursions into Gaza ?
From the continued cyclical destruction of Lebanon , every time an Israeli prime minister feels he needs to boost his standing ?
One might well ask , when thinking about those leaders of the Free World , what they have learnt from Vietnam , or Nicaragua , or Iran , Iraq , Afghanistan or Pakistan conflicts , in which they were involved , ever - so - carefully ?
The truth is that the west has never managed to learn from either its colonial and imperial past , or from its ongoing blunders and war crimes in the present .
The only variable seems to be the amount of force — one always can resolve the conflict , it is just a matter of applying enough force , is n’t it ?
The Soviets also believed that given enough force , they could defeat Afghanistan , and so do some western politicians , though it seems that many are now wise to the fact that it is not going very well recently .
Israel has been using this retarded policy for six decades — if you fight everyone around , and make sure you are the strongest military force in the Middle East , then you can do what you wish ; this was supposed to lead somehow to peace and quiet , yet it always fails .
Yes , Israel can destroy the whole Middle East and much more , but , and this is curious , it cannot have peace of any kind with the Palestinians .
How are we to understand this contradiction ?
Well , to begin with , Israel has never looked for peace with the Palestinians ; it only looked for means to depopulate and empty the country , ever since its founding in May 1948 .
It exiled 750,000 Palestinians from their land , made them refugees , and then systematically refused them and their descendants entry despite UN resolutions , while destroying their villages and towns , or building Israeli Jewish towns on top of them .
Since 1967 it has done all any country could do , to make a political solution impossible , by illegally settling in the occupied territories , and by refusing to go back to the pre-1967 ceasefire lines , by building the Apartheid wall , and by generally making life impossible for most Palestinians .
This is not an effort for peace — more likely , this is an effort for continuous and systematic ethnic cleansing of Palestine .
So , if peace is a problem , as it will by definition mean losing the mini-empire built by Israel , then one does what one can to avoid it , even it is offered on a plate , like in the Saudi Peace Initiative , which Israel ’s leaders , supposedly in waiting for exactly such an offer , scorned and refused .
This denial of the potential for peace has been going on for so long , most Israelis have failed to notice it as it turned into second nature .
But the more terrifying reason why no peace initiative has ever had the slightest chance has indeed to do with us in the west .
Israel has been supported by the western democracies as their bulwark in the Arab East , more dependable than client regimes such as the Saudis or Iraq ’s Saddam until 1990 .
As a strong proponent of the Huntingtonian thesis of the Clash of Civilizations , Israel is still , on a covert if not an overt level , the bastion of the Judeo - Christian world against the Arabs and Islam .
This was true some decades ago , but has never been truer than in the last decade , with the New World Order of continued crisis , of the Shock Doctrine , of Shock and Awe , of repeated storms in the deserts of Asia , always Islamic .
Israel , not Iran , possesses nuclear weapons , and is also capable of using them , and threatens to do so , yet it is Iran who is the culprit .
The proponents of attacking that country are the same merchants of doom who have sold us the war in Iraq .
Imagine for a moment what a Muslim in Britain might feel , if he stopped to think about a world in which the main culprits , “ terrorists , ” extremists and insurgents are always said to be Muslims , and are everywhere being hunted by the great forces of international “ law and order , ” mainly led by the so - called Free World ?
Is it so surprising that a tiny number of British born and bred Muslims found it acceptable to explode bombs in the capital ?
Is the solution to this loaded and explosive situation to kill more Muslims , to alienate more Muslims ?
One thousand years after the beginning of the Crusades , one is tempted to ask if it is not time to close the book , to call it a day , to bury the hatchet and start talking ?
And , to be sure , there can be no talking as long as the Free World sticks with the Israeli method of conflict resolution — bomb them to smithereens , then you do n’t need to talk to them , and if you need to talk to them , they will talk differently when bombed out of existence .
How long will we support destruction as a platform for dialogue ?
Has it ever worked anywhere ?

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- President - elect Barack Obama on Saturday offered the most detailed statement yet of his economic recovery plan , sketching out broad - based spending proposals and tax incentives aimed at reviving an economy mired in recession .
In his weekly radio and video address describing what he called the American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan , Obama spelled out five main goals .
He said his plan proposes to :
double renewable energy production and make public buildings more energy efficient ;
rebuild crumbling roads , bridges and schools ;
computerize the health care system
modernize classrooms , labs and libraries ;
and provide tax breaks to American workers .
" Economists from across the political spectrum agree that if we do n't act swiftly and boldly , we could see a much deeper economic downturn , " Obama said .
" That 's why we need an American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan that not only creates jobs in the short - term but spurs economic growth and competitiveness in the long - term . "
The main goal of his plan : to create 3 million new jobs .
Most would come from the private sector , he said .
As Obama prepares to take office on Jan. 20 , the country faces a series of severe economic and political challenges .
Nearly 2 million jobs were lost in the first 11 months of 2008 - the final government reading on the employment picture will be released on Friday - and the economy has stagnated .
Investors suffered the worst year in stocks since the Great Depression , and foreclosures are rising while housing values are declining at record paces .
Virtually every state is facing a budget shortfall , forcing many to make plans to cut back on critical services and raise taxes .
To that end , Obama 's advisers and lawmakers have said they expect his legislation to provide increased aid to states to pay for Medicaid , as well as a boost to unemployment benefits and food stamps .
However , he did n't mention it in his address on Saturday .
Obama 's video address did not attach an estimated price tag to his proposal , but his advisers have said publicly they expect the size of the spending package to range between $ 675 billion and $ 775 billion .
Many economists have called for stimulus spending to approach or even exceed $ 1 trillion if the government expects to successfully beat back one of the deepest downturns in more than two generations .
Next step : Making the pitch to Congress
On Saturday , the president - elect confirmed that he will meet with Democratic and Republican congressional leaders next week to sell them on the plan .
While his aides have been in talks with Capitol Hill staffers , Democratic and Republican lawmakers have been calling on him to present details for what could be the most expensive spending bill in U.S. history .
Some Democrats and Republicans have already raised red flags about the proposed plan 's potential scope and the prospect of a rushed attempt to pass the bill in time for Obama to take office on Jan. 20 .
A sharp debate is likely over several crucial questions .
Will the proposed measures in fact boost the economy ?
What 's the right balance between seeding short - term stimulus versus funding long - term projects ?
Will money intended to yield long - term dividends for the economy as a whole end up merely serving politically motivated agendas or pet projects ?
Obama attempted to assuage some of those concerns on Saturday when he called for " vigorous oversight and strict accountability for achieving results . "
He stressed that his plan is not an attempt to " throw money " at the economy 's problems .
" I am optimistic that if we come together to seek solutions that advance not the interests of any party , or the agenda of any one group , but the aspirations of all Americans , then we will meet the challenges of our time just as previous generations have met the challenges of theirs , " Obama said .
White people spend a lot of time of worrying about poor people .
It takes up a pretty significant portion of their day .
They feel guilty and sad that poor people shop at Wal * Mart instead of Whole Foods , that they vote Republican instead of Democratic , that they go to Community College / get a job instead of studying art at a University .
It is a poorly guarded secret that , deep down , white people believe if given money and education that all poor people would be EXACTLY like them .
In fact , the only reason that poor people make the choices they do is because they have not been given the means to make the right choices and care about the right things .
A great way to make white people feel good is to tell them about situations where poor people changed how they were doing things because they were given the ‘ whiter ’ option .
“ Back in my old town , people used to shop at Wal * Mart and then this non-profit organization came in and set up a special farmers co-op so that we could buy more local produce , and within two weeks the Wal * Mart shut down and we elected our first Democratic representative in 40 years . ”
White people will first ask which non-profit and are they hiring ?
After that , they will be filled with euphoria and will invite you to more parties to tell this story to their friends , so that they can feel great .
But it is ESSENTIAL that you reassert that poor people do not make decisions based on free will .
That news could crush white people and their hope for the future .
Infinity is a fascinating idea and it is behind some of the most beautiful results in mathematics .
Much of this beauty is accessible to everyone , brought to us by the brilliant Georg Cantor using simple arguments that require little math .
I hope to show some of this goodness to people who have n't seen it before .
Here we go .
Imagine a shepherd tending a flock of a few dozen sheep .
In the morning , the sheep get out of the farm to do sheepish things .
In the evening , the shepherd wants to make sure he got all his sheep back .
One problem : he can't count .
What 's a shepherd to do ?
One solution would be to keep track of the sheep as they go out .
For example , he could throw a pebble into a bucket for each sheep leaving the farm .
In the evening , a pebble goes out for each returned sheep .
At any given time , the number of pebbles in the bucket is exactly equal to that of outstanding sheep .
You can picture the sets of sheep and pebbles like so :
Each sheep is paired with a distinct pebble and there are no left overs on either side .
In set theory this is a bijection .
Even though the sheep have not been counted , we know the sets have the same number of elements .
They are equivalent in a way , not because you eat pebbles or throw sheep , though I suppose you could , but because of the bijection .
If you accept this premise , which is reasonable enough , then you 're in for some fun .
Interesting things happen when we use bijections to compare sets nobody can count : the infinite sets .
For example , let 's compare the natural numbers ( 1 , 2 , 3 ... ) to the even natural numbers ( 2 , 4 , 6 ... ) .
It sounds like we should have less even numbers , but lo and behold , we get this :
Every natural number has been paired with a distinct even number .
No left overs .
Strangely , these sets are equivalent .
It turns out many sets are equivalent to the natural numbers ; we call these sets denumerable .
For example , the set of Turing Machines is denumerable because there are infinitely many machines and they can each be fully described by a distinct natural number .
The integers are yet another example :
Some people see these results as trivial : their intuitive notion is that any " infinity " must be the same .
Others see a paradox .
How can a part of something be equivalent to the whole ?
Let 's try to give everyone a paradox by finding a set that is not denumerable .
How about the rationals ?
Surely there must be more fractions than natural numbers !
Right ?
Cantor probably thought so , until he discovered a procedure to enumerate the rationals :
Starting at the top and following the pattern , this procedure hits each rational number once .
As it moves along , we can associate successive natural numbers with each hit .
Here are the first few pairings :
It is pretty clear that the arrangement above covers all of the rationals , but the crucial point is that Cantor 's pattern will reach any given rational in a finite number of steps .
The zigzag is important : if we go off in a single direction ( say , across the first row to the right ) then we get stuck in the infinitude of that row alone , and there would be rationals left over .
The zigzag delivers us from that evil .
This argument does not produce an equation for a bijection , but since it builds a listing that contains every rational number , it shows they are denumerable .
Conversely , if a set is denumerable its elements can be put into a listing where each element is paired with a natural number .
( As an aside , the 1999 paper Recounting the rationals establishes a precise bijection by using a tree to generate all fractions in reduced form .
The tree has all sorts of magical properties , cool stuff .
It 's an accessible paper , plus Brent Yorgey wrote a great walk through of it . )
All of our sets so far have been denumerable , except for the sheep who were finite .
At this point , Cantor might have wondered if maybe there is only one infinity .
But then again , if you build a number line using the sets we have seen so far , you end up with holes .
The naturals are mere dots on the number line , most fractions fall in a hole :
The rationals , on the other hand , are dense .
Between any two given rationals , there is another rational ( an infinite number of them actually ) .
Yet the rational number line also has holes , which are the irrational numbers .
Below is a famous irrational number , on whose account its discoverer was allegedly drowned at sea , shown along the rational number line :
Irrational numbers cannot be expressed as a fraction ; moreover , when written out as numbers using positional notation ( say , as decimal numbers ) their digits never settle into any kind of periodic pattern .
Fractions , by contrast , eventually settle into a pattern when written out ( e.g. , 0.333 ... , 0.25000 ... ) .
All of the rationals plus all of the irrational numbers make up the real numbers .
And those guys form a number line free of holes .
Any point in the number line is a real number , any crazy sequence of digits you come up with is a real number .
It 's the continuum .
You might get the impression that irrational numbers are rare , oddballs among the familiar rationals , but that 's not the case at all .
The sparse number line above is an attempt at visualizing that fact , in addition to showcasing my superior preschool MS Paint skillz .
The reals are a vast ocean of irrationals pointed here and there by a fraction , and we 'll see why .
So now Cantor pits the real numbers against the naturals .
He shows that even a section of the reals - the interval between 0 and 1 - is not denumerable .
He uses a proof by contradiction , which is a common way to show that something cannot be true .
It goes like this : suppose there is a way to enumerate the reals between 0 and 1 .
Then there is a listing containing every real number in that interval , each one associated with a different natural number .
It might look like this :
The actual numbers shown above are not important , since the complete list is infinite and has every real number in the interval .
Some of the reals up there are clearly rationals and have settled into a periodic pattern ( 0.250 ... and 0.500 ... ) .
The others look pretty random , they could be irrational or maybe they have n't settled into their periodic patterns yet .
Either way , for each number the digits go on indefinitely , rationals in a pattern ( possibly of zeros ) and irrationals randomly .
Notice how the numbers in red form a diagonal , which is itself infinite .
Let 's build a number using that diagonal .
Going down the list , for each row we pick a digit that is different than the digit in red .
For example , we could add 1 to each digit ( 9 becomes 0 , no carry ) .
You can use any rule as long as the digit is different .
Here are the first few digits we get by adding 1 to the red diagonal digits :
The digits of this number p are random and go on infinitely ; it is a real number .
But due to how we have defined p , it is different from every other number in the list .
It differs in at least one digit .
Even though the list is infinite , this number is not in it !
But then , this list was supposed to have all real numbers so we have a contradiction .
Hence our initial assumption must be false ; the reals are not denumerable .
The notion of different infinities was a revolutionary one in mathematics .
It is a stunning result which ignited the mother of all mathematician flame wars .
This was actually the second proof Cantor offered for the non-denumerability of the continuum .
The first proof is also valid , but slightly more technical .
Cantor 's diagonal argument however is amazingly simple and highly original , as brilliant as its conclusion .
It went on to feature prominently in other intellectual landmarks .
Alan Turing used it while proving that a Turing Machine cannot predict the behavior of other machines ( specifically , predict whether another machine is " cycle - free " , which is now known as the Halting Problem ) .
Gödel used it in his Incompleteness Theorem discussed in Gödel , Escher , Bach .
Diagonalization is crucial in recursion theory and complexity theory .
In order to capture these new concepts , Cantor proposed cardinality as a measure of how numerous a set is .
A finite set 's cardinality is simply how many elements it has , say 49 for our set of sheep .
But the cardinality of an infinite set is expressed by a transfinite number .
To make them more esoteric , Cantor used the Hebrew letter aleph for these numbers .
By definition , the naturals took aleph zero , , for their cardinality .
Every denumerable set has cardinality .
The cardinality of the reals was defined as c , and Cantor spent years trying to discover whether c = , that is , whether the cardinality of the reals is the ' next bigger one ' after the naturals .
So that explains the name in Mona Lisa Overdrive and also the handle for Aleph One , who wrote the classic paper on stack buffer overflows during the Phrack renaissance .
This concludes our first foray into the infinities .
There 's way too much to talk about .
If there 's interest I 'll write a follow up to see where else infinity leads us .
Iterative rather than upfront blogging :)
Meanwhile , Journey Through Genius is a great book that does for many theorems , including Cantor 's , what I did on this post .
Only much better .
Thanks for reading !

NATO spokesman James Appathurai condemned a report by the International Council on Security and Development ( ICOS ) as not credible today , after it concluded that the Taliban has a “ permanent presence ” in 72 percent of Afghanistan .
The Afghan government likewise criticized the report for a “ questionable methodology . ”
The ICOS defines a permanent presence as an average of at least one insurgent attack per week over the entire year .
The Afghan government feels this unfairly includes “ sporadic , terrorizing activities ” by the Taliban .
NATO insists “ the Taliban are only present in the south and east which is already less than 50 percent of the country . ”
Exactly how NATO reached this determination is unclear , but the US air strike in Herat Province was ostensibly targeted at the Taliban , and Herat Province is in the northwestern corner of the nation .
Likewise , reports of police defections to the Taliban also place Taliban forces in the area along the Iranian border of Herat .
The ICOS report also says that the Taliban are “ closing a noose ” around the Afghan capital of Kabul .
The report says that Kabul was virtually Taliban - free a year ago , but the well - documented growth of Taliban influence in the area is leading to an increase in attacks .
The US is reportedly planning to deploy much of a combat brigade into the region in an attempt to regain control of the area .
A $ 7 bil­lion mis­sile - defense sys­tem for the Unit­ed Arab Emi­rates .
An esti­mat­ed $ 15 bil­lion poten­tial sale of Lock­heed Martin ’s brand - new fight­er plane to Israel .
Bil­lions of dol­lars in weapon­ry for Tai­wan and Turkey .
These and oth­er recent deals helped make the Unit­ed States the world ’s lead­ing arms - export­ing nation .
In 2007 , U.S. for­eign mil­i­tary sales agree­ments totaled more than $ 32 bil­lion – near­ly triple the amount dur­ing Pres­i­dent Bush ’s first full year in office .
The Pen­ta­gon rou­tine­ly jus­ti­fies weapons sales as ​ “ pro­mot­ing region­al sta­bil­i­ty , ” but many of these arms end up in the world ’s war zones .
In 2006 and 2007 , the five biggest recip­i­ents of U.S. weapons were Pak­istan ( $ 3.5 bil­lion ) , Iraq ( $ 2.2 bil­lion ) , Israel ( $ 2.2 bil­lion ) , Afghanistan ( $ 1.9 bil­lion ) and Colom­bia ( $ 580 mil­lion ) – all coun­tries where con­flict rages .
In Pak­istan , the fight­ing ranges from com­mu­nal vio­lence and state repres­sion , to attacks against India , to dead­ly bat­tles between Pak­istani mil­i­tary and al Qae­da forces in the north­west provinces .
Israel has used U.S. - supplied weapons in the West Bank and Gaza , as well as in the 2006 inva­sion of Lebanon .
Colom­bia uses U.S. weapon­ry to fight the drug war .
Of the 27 major con­flicts dur­ing 2006 and 2007 , 19 of them involved U.S‑supplied weapons .
While full data is not yet avail­able for 2008 , the Unit­ed States con­tin­ues to flood war­zones with more desta­bi­liz­ing weapons .
In 2008 , the Pen­ta­gon bro­kered more than $ 12.5 bil­lion in pos­si­ble for­eign mil­i­tary sales to Iraq , includ­ing guns , ammu­ni­tion , tanks and attack helicopters .
Raed Jar­rar , an Iraqi ana­lyst with Amer­i­can Friends Ser­vice Com­mit­tee , notes the chance that this weapon­ry will pro­mote peace and democ­ra­cy in Iraq is slim .
“ The cur­rent Iraqi armed forces are the same forces and mili­tias that have been com­mit­ting eth­nic and sec­tar­i­an cleans­ing dur­ing the last years and they have a vio­lent record full of human rights vio­la­tions , tor­ture and assas­si­na­tions , ” says Jarrar .
What ’s more , the Unit­ed States can­not suc­cess­ful­ly track its weapons .
Hun­dreds of thou­sands of U.S. - supplied pis­tols and auto­mat­ic weapons des­tined for Iraqi secu­ri­ty forces between 2004 and 2005 remain lost , accord­ing to the Gov­ern­ment Account­abil­i­ty Office .
The Pen­ta­gon has ​ “ no idea where they are , ” Rachel Stohl , a senior ana­lyst at the Cen­ter for Defense Infor­ma­tion , a nation­al - secu­ri­ty think tank , told the Wash­ing­ton Post in 2007 .
​ “ It like­ly means that the Unit­ed States is unin­ten­tion­al­ly pro­vid­ing weapons to bad actors . ”
U.S. law curbs weapons sales to coun­tries engaged in a ​ “ gross and con­sis­tent ” pat­tern of human rights abus­es or to coun­tries using U.S. weapons for aggres­sive pur­pos­es .
But these require­ments are often set aside in favor of short - term objectives .
Michael Klare , direc­tor of the Amherst , Mass . - based Five Col­lege Pro­gram in Peace and World Secu­ri­ty Stud­ies , has fol­lowed the arms trade for decades .
He dis­counts offi­cial claims that the deliv­ery of arms can help pro­mote stability .
“ The more we help one side , the more that régime ’s oppo­nents are dri­ven to seek arms from anoth­er sup­pli­er , lead­ing to an inevitable spi­ral of arms buy­ing , provo­ca­tion and con­flict , ” Klare says .
Accord­ing to Stohl , ​“ The Bush admin­is­tra­tion has demon­strat­ed a will­ing­ness to pro­vide weapons and mil­i­tary train­ing to weak and fail­ing states and coun­tries that have been repeat­ed­ly crit­i­cized by the U.S. State Depart­ment for human rights vio­la­tions , lack of democ­ra­cy and even sup­port of terrorism . ”
The Oba­ma admin­is­tra­tion could mark a new era in arms trade .
On the cam­paign trail , Oba­ma expressed open­ness to sign­ing the glob­al clus­ter muni­tions ban , but he has yet to speak about a glob­al Arms Trade Treaty – which would estab­lish more rig­or­ous con­di­tions for weapons exports – or about curb­ing weapons sales , in general .
“ The arms trade is nev­er a panacea for insta­bil­i­ty , ” Klare says .
​ “ It can only enflame region­al ten­sions and height­en the risk of war . ”

Weapons at War : Beyond the Bush Lega­cy
Protesters ' willing to risk jail ' to urge Bush , Cheney indictment RAW STORY
Published : Thursday November 6 , 2008
Print This Email This Anti-war protesters plan to gather outside the Department of Justice next week to urge Attorney General Michael Mukasey to indict President Bush and Vice President Cheney on war crimes charges .
The protesters , being organized by The National Campaign for Nonviolent Resistance say they are willing to risk going to jail to urge Bush and Cheney 's indictment .
The campaign is gathering signatures for a petition to urge Mukasey to meet with them .
The group has worked closely with Code Pink , Iraq Veterans Against the War and others to protest US involvement in Iraq and urge President Bush 's impeachment at myriad demonstrations over the last several years .
The protest at the Justice Department is scheduled for Monday at noon at the department 's headquarters in downtown Washington .
A copy of the group 's petition is reprinted below .
I am writing on behalf of the National Campaign for Nonviolent Resistance ( NCNR ) , concerned citizens who tried to prevent the illegal invasion of Iraq .
NCNR members would like to meet with you to discuss the indictment of George W. Bush and Richard Cheney for crimes including the fraudulent case for war , warrantless spying , torture , and denial of due process to prisoners .
U.S. Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson , appointed by President Truman to be the Chief Prosecutor at the Nuremberg Tribunals following World War II , stated , " let me make clear that while this law is first applied against German aggressors , the law includes , and if it is to serve a useful purpose it must condemn aggression by any other nations , including those which sit here now in judgment . "
There is a well - established law in our jurisprudence which places an affirmative duty on all of us to expose any treasonous or criminal act which comes to our attention .
Failure to do so is defined as " misprision . "
As good citizens , we are writing to you out of duty , knowing that if felonies have been committed we are to inform a magistrate .
Silently to observe the commission of a felony , without endeavoring to apprehend the offender , is a misprision .
Please schedule a meeting with NCNR at your earliest convenience .
On his way out , President Bush unintentionally dropped a bomb on President Obama : a " Google bomb . "
Along with an economic crisis and a host of national challenges , Obama inherited a link to an embarrassing Google term , as reported our friends at the Times Technology blog .
Remember that prank the blogosphere pulled on Bush a few years ago that skyrocketed the former president 's White House profile page to the top spot for a Google search for " miserable failure ? "
From the Tech post :
As Search Engine Land points out , a search for " failure " on Google delivers " President Barack Obama " as the top result , linking to the WhiteHouse.gov biography page .
And if you search Yahoo for " miserable failure , " Obama 's bio page comes in No.
2 . Just behind George W. Bush's .
This is more amusing than it is significant , of course .
The Google bombs wired to the White House website have been in place for years , and all that really changed were the names attached to the site .
A Google spokesperson had this to say : " By improving our analysis of the link structure of the Web , Google has begun minimizing the impact of many Google bombs .
Of course , no system is bulletproof , and we 're working every day to make our systems even better . "
While Google does n't manually edit search results , it regularly tweaks the algorithm that powers the search engine , which could eliminate such O - bombs .

Loyal Geekologie Reader Sheniferous decided to share his Beer Burrito with me .
And , since caring means sharing , I decided to pass along the coronary infarction to you .
No need to thank me folks , just dig in .
We start off with the secret filling ( Geekologie Writer 's note : appears to be a rice and vegetable mixture -- Sheniferious , I 'm thinking sausage and pepperoni next time ) , that 's swimming in an All - Malt Porter .
Then we bake porter - marinated bacon and not only chop it up in to bits for the beerito filling , but then lay two strips in the beerito .
The beerito is then wrapped in porter - soaked tortillas , wrapped with two thicker porter - marinated strips of bacon .
It 's then dipped in beer batter and deep fried .
Mmmm ...mmm delicious !!!
My goodness , that sounds delectable .
I 've been living off Kid Cuisines and gin for the better part of a year now , and I 've got to admit : marathon runs .

Thanks Sheniferous , now send me one .
Seriously , overnight that joint .
After a generation of increasingly relaxed regulation of the financial services sector , the very concept seems stunning : Nationalization of banks in Europe and the United States .
But with many global banks still teetering on the brink of insolvency — even after rescue efforts that have included multi-billion dollar infusions of capital and other forms of assistance — a growing number of economists now argues that government takeovers of the most deeply troubled institutions , at least temporarily , may be the only remaining solution .
In the U.S. , former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan has unexpectedly joined a list of notable financial experts who believe some banks may have to be nationalized temporarily .
Additional surprising converts include prominent Republican politicians such as Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and former presidential candidate John McCain .
Many Wharton faculty also agree .
Among them is Wharton finance professor Franklin Allen , who argues that a temporary nationalization of the affected banks is the only way to remove the top executives who helped trigger the financial crisis , while ensuring that the interests of taxpayers are valued over those of stockholders and bondholders .
“ This is not something the government should be doing in the long run , ” says Allen .
The banks should be nationalized “ for however long it takes for things to get back to normal .
I would imagine that would be less than three to five years . ”
Like other advocates of bank nationalization under the current circumstances , he points to the example of Sweden , which nationalized its banks during a crisis in the early 1990s and for the most part privatized them again once they had been stabilized .
The U.S. is not the only Western economic power in which recent talk of bank nationalization abounds .
Ireland nationalized Anglo Irish Bank in January and has spent some $ 9 billion to recapitalize Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks .
In Berlin this week , the government said it would prefer to take a majority stake in Germany ’s struggling Hypo Real Estate Holding rather than nationalize the property lender .
“ Nationalization is only an option after attempts to take a majority stake have failed , ” a government spokesman said .
“ Everybody agrees that nationalization can only be a measure of last resort if it ’s necessary for the stabilization of financial markets and other , less severe solutions ” have been exhausted .
There has also been speculation — frequently denied by U.K. Prime Minister Gordon Brown — that the British government aims to nationalize Lloyds Banking Group or Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS ) , in which it holds stakes of 43 % and 70 % respectively .
Just a year ago , the U.K. nationalized Northern Rock , one of the first banks to suffer catastrophic losses from its exposure to securitized subprime mortgages in the U.S .
European experiments with bank nationalization have essentially treated it as a temporary measure , to be reversed when the financial system returns to normal .
In contrast , Asian countries such as India and China have adopted a different nationalization model — which has had results that are often negative .
As governments in the U.S. and Europe ponder their own rescue strategies for banks , these experiences could serve as cautionary tales of the risks involved in nationalization .
Fear of Bureaucracies
One reason that bank nationalization has been the subject of more talk than action is the central role that banks play in free - market economies .
Critics say that nationalized banks can quickly devolve into inept bureaucracies , prone to politics and other pitfalls .
“ Nationalized banks do not generally perform as well as privatized banks because they have much more complex objectives — employment , subsidies to a particular sector or politician — and because they generally have much looser corporate governance , ” says Wharton finance professor Richard J. Herring , co-director of the Wharton Financial Institutions Center .
“ Employees are generally civil servants and the board is generally packed with political appointees . ”
Even so , Herring agrees that the current crisis in the American banking system is so severe that a temporary nationalization of some banks — serving as a kind of a bridge until new buyers can be located — is probably necessary .
Such a framework “ provides officials and potential buyers with the time and opportunity to undertake due diligence to make an optimal disposition of a failed bank .
I am puzzled about why the Treasury is so reluctant to use it . ”
The reason may lie in politics , and the aversion even among more liberal public officials to take steps that could be criticized as appearing “ socialist . ”
One of those hesitant politicians appears to be President Barack Obama , who recently told ABC News he is wary of the Swedish model of bank nationalization because of the sheer size of America ’s banking industry .
“ The scale of the U.S. economy and the capital markets [ is ] so vast , and … the problems in terms of managing and overseeing anything of that scale , ” would be so complex , Obama said , “ that it would not make sense .
And we also have different traditions in this country . ”
But many experts predict that the current crisis may trump tradition .
Two large American banks are especially at risk : Citigroup , which received a $ 300 billion federal aid package — mostly in the form of loan guarantees late last year — and Bank of America , the beneficiary of a similar $ 120 billion program earlier this year .
Many experts believe the two bailouts , despite the massive amounts of money involved , did little to take the banks away from the edge of insolvency , and the federal government can take little further action without becoming the majority stakeholder .
They note that Washington is already seeking to impose strict controls without ownership , such as the limits on executive pay that Congress included in the recent economic stimulus bill .
A leading advocate of bank nationalization is New York University ( NYU ) economist Nouriel Roubini , who recently co-authored a Washington Post op - ed on the topic with NYU colleague Matthew Richardson .
They wrote that it may sound “ somewhat blasphemous ” for economists who believe in a free - market system to advocate a bank takeover by Washington , but they saw no alternative after they estimated that looming losses by U.S. banks amounted to a staggering $ 1.8 trillion , which is more than their $ 1.4 trillion net worth .
It ’s critical , they wrote , that the Treasury Department determine which banks are actually insolvent , take them over , and separate out the so - called “ toxic assets ” so that the remaining healthy assets can be sold quickly to private investors while the bad loans are disposed of in due time .
“ We have used all our bullets , and the boogeyman is still coming , ” they write .
“ Let ’s pull out the bazooka and be done with it . ”
That once - radical position is finding some support .
According to Allen , the biggest problem with the current bank rescue plans is that they have not removed the executives who caused the crisis , and have allowed them to continue to collect large salaries , bonuses and other perks despite taxpayer outrage .
“ We ’ve got all this money invested and no control over what they ’re doing at all , ” Allen notes .
“ The classic example is what happened with the bonuses at Merrill Lynch , which gets dealt to Bank of America and says that they need $ 20 billion .
The government says ‘ yes , ’ and then they turn around and hand out $ 4 billion in bonuses . ”
Cleaning House
Like other proponents of bank nationalization , Allen argues that the successful experience of Sweden in the early 1990s should be an example to American officials .
At that time , the Scandinavian nation faced a crisis that was strikingly similar to our own :
Banks that had been largely unregulated by the government over the prior decade suffered large losses in the collapse of a real estate bubble .
Swedish officials insisted that the banks write down their losses , which wiped out shareholder value .
The government then recapitalized some banks in return for an ownership stake .
It also created an agency to sell the bad loans .
The spending involved was significant — more than $ 18 billion in today ’s dollars in a nation much smaller than the United States — but Sweden earned a significant portion of that money back through the sale of the assets , and even today it still owns nearly 20 % of the Scandinavian banking giant Nordea .
“ In Sweden they went in and fired all the senior management , ” Allen notes .
“ The shareholders got nothing , but [ the government ] put the banks back in good shape — it was a better way to proceed . ”
Allen and other experts note that Sweden ’s comprehensive approach was much more successful than Japan ’s woeful performance during its so - called “ Lost Decade ” of the 1990s , when the government ’s intervention to help out banks was seen as too piecemeal and not dramatic enough to end a prolonged slump .
Wharton finance professor Itay Goldstein has concerns about bank nationalization in the U.S. Still , he adds , the initial stage of the federal rescue plan showed how hard it is to attack the problems at U.S. banks without the kind of large - scale coordination that comes from a central government .
He said that individual banks are reluctant to make loans during the current crisis — even after the initial cash infusion from Washington — because they worry that borrowers will default as the economy drifts deeper in recession .
“ There ’s also a coordination problem , ” he says .
“ If you feel that banks are not seeing the full picture of their impact on the economy as a whole … taking over the banks could be justified .
The costs are huge — it is almost impossible for the government to take over so many big banks and actually control them .
I do n’t know if the government has the personnel for that . ”
“ While we ’re not happy with the CEOs of the banks , I do n’t think many people want the government and a bureaucracy running the banks , ” says Wharton finance professor Jeremy J. Siegel .
“ You could get rid of all these CEOs and say that you ’re going to get a new board , but there ’s a feeling that you want to keep [ the banks ] in the private sector . ”
Siegel believes the Obama administration should continue along its current path , which aims to separate the banks ’ good assets from their toxic holdings , even though he acknowledges that developing such a plan is difficult .
He also argues that any additional infusions of taxpayer money should ensure that the banks ’ bondholders “ take a haircut ” in addition to the losses already felt by stockholders who have watched the value of their shares plummet .
Allen says the current response to the economic crisis has been characterized partly by the amount of coordination involving Western governments .
He notes that the U.K. has been reluctant to go the full nationalization route because of lessons that it learned during the 1970s , but he expects that stance to change soon .
“ They were reluctant , ” he says , ” but now they already own 70 % of RBS , so I think they ’ll do it . ”
From the late 1960s through the early 1980s , the British government nationalized nearly a dozen industries , including auto manufacturers , utilities , transportation and aerospace firms .
Many of them have since returned to private control .
Mexico also managed what is generally viewed as a successful , temporary nationalization of much of its banking system following the peso crisis of the 1990s .
But critics of bank nationalization contend that while this radical solution may look like a speedy panacea for the financial crisis in the U.S. , history has not been kind to most efforts — especially a wave of such efforts by socialist - leaning governments in Europe and elsewhere in the generation following World War II .
Many of these efforts failed for the same reasons — lack of competition led to inefficient bureaucracies as well as corruption and bad decisions based more upon politics than upon sound business practices .
A Cautionary Tale from India
Bank nationalization has had a long history in India , though it was more a matter of political ideology at first as India pursued socialist - leaning policies after gaining independence from Britain in 1947 .
This bank nationalization was intended to be permanent — not part of a temporary rescue — thus there are limited parallels to what occurred in India and what is now being contemplated in the U.S. Still , it ’s worth noting the effects of bank nationalization on another large country .
In 1955 , India created the State Bank of India ( SBI ) to take over the Imperial Bank of India , which accounted for some 25 % of the Indian banking system .
Large - scale nationalization took place in 1969 , when 14 major commercial banks were taken over by the Congress government led by Indira Gandhi .
Another seven were nationalized in 1980 .
This increased the share of public sector banks in total deposits to 92 % .
Several reasons accounted for these takeovers .
Many of the banks had been set up by large industrial houses and functioned as appendages of these groups .
Discretionary norms were ignored while lending to their parents and a very real danger existed that some of them would collapse .
In 1993 , when the Reserve Bank of India permitted private banks to be launched , it noted that “ the new bank should not be promoted by a large industrial house . ”
In addition , with its socialist inclinations , the government believed that the best way to help the farmers and the poor was through directed lending .
A “ priority sector ” was created for such loans .
Ministers organized loan melas ( or fairs ) in which money was distributed without the necessary security or expectations of repayment .
Not surprisingly , the banking system was soon reeling under bad loans .
Several banks nearly went under and had to be rescued through capital infusions by the government .
Since the reform process started in India in 1991 , there have been no new nationalizations .
There have been some rescues , however .
New private bank Global Trust fudged figures and ended with a negative net worth .
It was taken over by Oriental Bank of Commerce in an RBI - orchestrated shotgun marriage .
What has nationalization achieved in India ?
It has prevented some bank collapses , and it has created a secure and trusted institution :
In the current crisis , depositors have pulled out of Citibank and ICICI Bank to put their money into state - owned banks .
It has helped bank penetration in rural areas : India has a Composite Index of Financial Inclusion of 48 , versus 42 for China .
These banks — particularly the largest , SBI — have bucked global industry trends in the current slowdown .
Yet there has been a downside to nationalization .
Some banks have had to be recapitalized for their populist lending .
The World Bank has been asked for a loan of $ 4.2 billion for this purpose .
State ownership has created lethargic organizations , where creativity and innovation is frowned upon and customer service suffers .
Several of these banks are now publicly listed — a fallout of liberalization .
But the government still holds majority stakes and it is only recently that the culture in these organizations has started changing .
Competition does not exist , in effect .
Chinese Banks : The Opposite Direction
China , where so many companies , including banks , have been government owned , is now leaning in the opposite direction — partial privatization is now a goal .
Since the current administration came to power in China in 2003 , policy towards state - owned banks has changed drastically , and reform of their shareholder structure ( or privatization ) has begun .
The first step was a massive injection of state funds :
The banks ’ non-performing ( NPL ) loan ratio was widely believed to have stood at 40 % or more , but the central government had written off almost all of their bad loans by the end of 2003 .
A sell - off to “ foreign strategic investors ” ( mainly international financial institutions ) followed , with a 20 % cap placed on single foreign ownership and a 25 % ceiling on cumulative foreign ownership of individual banks introduced before the banks were floated at home and abroad .
But banking privatization remains highly controversial in China .
Fierce debates have raged among academics , particularly regarding pricing of shares sold to foreign investors , and the favoritism shown them over domestic investors .
However , China ’s authorities have pushed forward resolutely with reform .
By the end of 2007 , China had 24 banks with more than 30 foreign strategic investors sitting on their boards .
Over one - sixth of the Chinese banking system is now foreign controlled .
Despite the debate on valuation and fairness in the privatization process , an improvement in China ’s banking industry appears evident .
Following their partial privatization , banks have introduced governance structures to transform themselves into modern financial institutions , and the NPL ratio has fallen from 30 % a few years ago to single digits today .
Some observers also comment that the banking environment in China has changed radically over the past 10 years , with better regulation and supervision , better macroeconomic policy making , better internal controls and better borrowers .
Due to its limited exposure to the international capital market , Chinese banks have not been impacted severely by the recent global crisis .
In early February China ’s big commercial banks , the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China , China Construction Bank , and Bank of China ( ICBC , CCB and BOC ) ranked as the top three banks globally by market share .
On June 17 , 2005 , the announcement that Bank of America ( BoA ) would purchase a 9 % stake in China Construction Bank for $ 3 billion — the most expensive banking acquisition in China ’s history — made headlines throughout the global financial media .
Jonathan Anderson , chief economist at UBS Asia , commented at the time that it was a win - win strategy for both parties .
He was right .
On January 7 of this year , Bank of America , under financial strain , sold 5.6 billion Hong Kong - listed shares in CCB at a fixed price of HK$ 3.92 , reducing its stake in the Chinese bank from 19.1 % to 16.6 % .
BoA made a profit of around US $ 1.1 billion from the sale based on the price of the shares at the time of CCB ’s IPO , according to the Financial Times .
On the other hand , although Chinese banks have performed strongly in recent years , their ability to manage risk has not been tested , notes Qian Jun , a finance professor at Boston College .
“ Most of the Chinese banks have n’t really experienced any true financial crisis , so they have not been tested in the areas of risk management and balancing between financial innovations and generating profits , ” he says .
As the experiences of these countries indicate , bank nationalization is hardly a silver bullet that can solve banking problems forever .
As consensus grows among U.S. and European economists in favor of nationalization , it may help them to keep these risks in mind .
If you ’ve ever found yourself right - clicking on something and wondering where all that junk came from , you ’re not alone .
Want to get rid of the cruft you do n’t use , and add some actually useful items to the context menu ?
You can .
Windows includes a bunch of options in that context menu by default , and that list grows as you install more apps .
It sometimes seems like every app is fighting for a piece of your context menu and most of us do n’t even use half of them .
We ’re going to show you how you can remove items by editing your Registry , as well as an easier cleanup method using a couple of free third - party apps .
We ’ll also point you toward how to add some more useful commands .
Without too much effort , you can take your context menu from being cluttered and only mostly useful …
… to being streamlined and efficient .
Let ’s get started .
The Hard Way : Remove Items from the Context Menu by Editing the Registry
If you want to clean things up the truly geeky way , you can do from Registry Editor without the need for third - party software .
We ’ll get to the easier tools a bit later , but we think it helps when using those tools to understand how this stuff is handled in the Registry .
Standard warning : Registry Editor is a powerful tool and misusing it can render your system unstable or even inoperable .
If you ’ve never worked with it before , consider reading about how to use the Registry Editor before you get started .
And definitely back up the Registry ( and your computer ! ) before making changes .
This is especially true when following the guidelines in this article , because you ’ll end up having to do a little hunting around to find the context menu entries that mean something to you .
RELATED : Learning to Use the Registry Editor Like a Pro
Open the Registry Editor by hitting Start and typing “ regedit . ”
Press Enter to open Registry Editor and then give it permission to make changes to your PC .
Unfortunately , the items populating your context menu are not all located in the same place in the Registry .
You can find most of the context menu items used for both files and folders by drilling down to one of the following keys in the navigation pane on the left :
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT
\*\shell
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shellex\ContextMenuHandlers
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\AllFileSystemObjects\ShellEx
You ’ll find context menu items specific to just folders in one of these keys instead :
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT
\Directory \shell
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory\shellex\ContextMenuHandlers
RELATED : How to Bookmark Locations in the Windows Registry
You ’ll need to handle the context menu items found in these locations a bit differently , so keep reading and we ’ll explain how .
For now , you might find it handy to locate each of those locations in the Registry and add them to your favorites list so that they ’re easier to browse through later .
Remove “ Shell ” Items
Let ’s take a look at one item as an example .
I use the VLC video player .
When I installed it , VLC added a context menu item named “ Add to VLC media player ’s Playlist . ”
I never use that and would rather it not be on my context menu .
Here ’s how we get rid of that menu item .
In Registry Editor , drill down to the following key :
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory \shell \AddtoPlaylistVLC
I spotted the AddtoPlaylistVLC key while browsing through the shell key looking for items to remove .
Items under the regular shell key are usually really easy to spot and deal with .
We have a few options on how to handle this .
We could just delete that AddToPlaylistVLC key entirely , and that would remove the item from the context menu .
However , unless you back up your Registry — or export the key first and keep up with the REG file — it wo n’t be easy to get back if you change your mind .
The second option is to disable the key instead of deleting it .
To do that , just right - click the AddToPlaylistVLC key — or whatever key you ’re working with — and choose New > String Value .
Name the new string value “ LegacyDisable . ”
As soon as you create the LegacyDisable value , the change should be immediate .
Right - click a file or folder in File Explorer and we can see that the “ Add to VLC media player ’s Playlist ” item has been removed from the context menu .
You also have a third option .
If you occasionally use a menu item , but do n’t want it cluttering up your regular context menu , you can hide it away on the extended context menu you see only when you hold Shift while right - clicking a file or folder .
To do this , right - click the AddToPlaylistVLC key — or whatever key you ’re working with — and choose New > String Value .
Name the new string value “ Extended . ”
Now , it will only appear if you right - click on a folder while holding Shift .
Remove “ Shellex ” Items
You probably noticed that some of the common Registry keys we listed at the top of this section have “ shellex ” ( Shell Extension ) in the name instead of just “ shell ” .
You ’ll need to handle those types of keys just a bit differently .
As our example , we ’ll head down to one of those keys we mentioned :
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory\shellex\ContextMenuHandlers
The shellex items will be a little tougher to decipher , but you can usually figure out an item by the key name on the left .
Here , we ’re going to be working with the DropboxExt key inside the ContextMenuHandlers key .
When Dropbox is installed , it adds a “ Move to Dropbox ” command to the context menu .
Because I ’m more of a drag and dropper , I ’ve never once used that command , and I ’m going to get rid of it .
You ca n’t use the tricks with the LegacyDisable and Extended string values we described above with shellex items .
You could still delete the whole DropboxExt key to remove it from the context menu ( and be sure to back the key up if you do ) , but there is a simple way to disable it .
Just select the key on the left and then double - click the ( Default ) value inside that key to open its properties window .
On the properties window , in the “ Value data ” box , just modify the value that ’s already there by putting a few dashes in front of it , being careful not to delete any of the existing value .
That way , if you change your mind , you can just go back in and remove the dashes .
When you ’re done , click “ OK . ”
The change will be immediate , so go right - click something in File Explorer and make sure the command is gone .
Unfortunately , when it comes to shellex items , there ’s no way to hide them on the Extended context menu the way you can with shell items .
You can only delete or disable them .
Explore Other Locations by File Type
If you want to remove context menu items that you only see when you right - click specific types of files , you can do that , too .
These items are stored elswhere than the common locations we ’ve already looked at .
To find them , you ’ll need to first locate the file extension key by looking under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT for that extension , which in turn will tell you the name of the key that you need to look for .
Just as an example , say you wanted to remove the menu item for opening an Excel document ( XLSX ) in Excel when you right - click on it .
Why would you want to do this ?
Well , you probably would n’t , but it ’s an easy example to look at here .
Other applications may add different types of commands you do n’t need .
You ’d start by taking a look at the following Registry key for the XLSX extension :
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.xlsx
The data column for the ( Default ) shell key lets you know that the actual type of file is “ Excel . Sheet .12 . ”
Now , you can browse to that extensions key :
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT
\Excel.Sheet.12\shell
And now that you ’ve located the correct shell key , you can use the same techniques we described in the previous section on “ shell ” items to delete , disable , or hide the item on the Extended context menu .
Remember the LegacyDisable and Extended string values ?
Yep , those work here , too .
The Easy Way : Remove Items from the Context Menu with NirSoft Utilities
So , now that you know how to do things the hard way , let ’s take a look at the easy way .
Instead of editing the Registry , you can download two tools from NirSoft to clean up your context menu .
Why two tools ?
Because one of them handles regular shell items and one handles shellex items .
They are both much easier to use than editing the Registry , but the behind - the - scenes understanding of how these things are handled in the Registry will give you a leg up in sorting through all the items these tools display .
RELATED : How Do I Know if I ’m Running 32 - bit or 64 - bit Windows ?
Start by downloading both the tools .
The first tool is ShellMenuView , which handles regular shell items .
The second tool is ShellExView , which handles shellex items .
Scroll down toward the bottom of both those pages to find the download links .
The tools both work with pretty much any version of Windows from 98 all the way through 10 .
You will need to grab either the 32 - bit or 64 - bit version , depending on whether you ’re running a 32 - bit or 64 - bit edition of Windows .
The first tool we ’ll check out is ShellMenuView , which allows us to manage all of those regular shell items with an easy to use interface .
After downloading and extracting the tool , double - click the EXE file to run it .
It ’s a portable tool , so there ’s no installation .
In the ShellMenuView window , just browse down the list until you find the item you want to disable .
You can only disable items with these tools — not delete them or hide them on the Extended context menu .
And by the way , these tools disable items by creating a LegacyDisable string value inside the appropriate key — just like we did when we edited the Registry manually .
When you find the item you ’re looking for , click the “ Disable ” button on the toolbar ( the red light ) .
Another benefit of using these tools is that you can select multiple items and then disable them all at once .
In our example , we ’re disabling the “ Add to VLC media player ’s Playlist ” item only when you right - click a folder ( the same example we used in the Registry section previously ) , but we could easily select all of the “ Add to VLC media player ’s Playlist ” items and then click “ Disable ” to remove that command from the context menu of all supported file types as well .
When you ’re done removing shell items , the next step is to fire up the ShellExView tool and remove shellex items .
This one works the exactly the same way as the first tool .
Just select one or more items and then click the “ Disable ” button to remove the items from your context menu .
How to Remove Additional Items from the Context Menu
There are a couple of context menu items you may have noticed that neither the NirSoft tools nor the regular Registry methods we covered address : namely , the items you find on the “ Open With ” and “ Send To ” submenus .
RELATED : How to Remove Programs from the " Open With " Context Menu in Windows
The “ Open With ” menu is a handy feature when you open files with multiple programs .
Whenever you open a file with a particular program , that program gets added to the “ Open With ” menu for that type of file .
If you ’ve ever accidentally opened a file with the wrong program or with a program you do n’t use any more , though , you ’ve probably seen that menu get cluttered over time .
Fortunately , we have a complete set of instructions to guide you through removing programs from the “ Open With ” menu .
The “ Send To ” menu is one of those features that people tend to either love and use all the time or just never even bother with .
When you install Windows , some items are added to the “ Send To ” menu by default .
Others get added over time as you install different apps .
If you ’ve ever wished you could declutter that menu , it ’s your lucky day !
We ’ve got one guide for customizing the items on the “ Send To ” menu and another guide if you ’d like to remove the “ Send To ” menu from your context menu altogether .

How to Add Some Useful Items to the Context Menu
Now that you ’ve spent some time removing items you do n’t need from your context menu , you can turn your attention to adding some items you might actually use .
To start with , you can actually add just about any application or shortcut you want to the context menu .
Since you ’ve now read all about what Registry keys to look through when you ’re removing stuff , you wo n’t be suprised that adding things involves a lot of those same keys .
RELATED : How to Add Any Application to the Windows Desktop Right - Click Menu
Of course , we would n’t leave you without any specific suggestions for fun things to add to your context menu .
And we ’ve covered a bunch of them .
For example , you could add any of the following to your menu :
So , have fun and get creative !
We admit , it ’s a good amount of information to absorb just to change a menu that you ’ve probably grown used to , but you might be surprised at how much more pleasant it is using a nice , clean context menu that has commands you ’ll actually use .
So what are you waiting for ?
Time to get started making those context menus more useful !
The first government collapse of the global economic crisis is about to yield the world 's first openly - gay leader .
Johanna Sigurdardottir , a former air hostess , is expected to be sworn in as Iceland 's Prime Minister by the end of the week .
Her moment in the international spotlight comes at the most horrendous moment in her nation 's recent history .
As the global meltdown began , the collapse of Iceland 's grossly over - leveraged economy was followed smartly by the implosion of its banks and currency .
Now its government has gone the same way , the first to succumb to the backwash from the crisis .
Ms Sigurdardottir 's party , the Social Democrat Alliance , was asked to form a new government but its leader is taking a leave of absence to recover from treatment for a benign tumour .
And so , " Saint Johanna " , as she has come to be known , has been propelled from the social affairs ministry – which she has presided over for a decade – to take centre stage in a choice hailed as " unexpected but brilliant " .
The 66 - year - old politician lives with her partner , Jonina Leosdottir , a journalist and playwright .
The couple were joined in a civil ceremony in 2002 .
Do n't expect them to show up togetherfor photocalls , however – that 's not the Icelandic way .
Though she is famous across the island , having been a top politician for years , her lesbian union was no big deal in this calmly progressive nation of only 300,000 people .
" Johanna is a very private person , " said an Icelandic government source .
" A lot of people did n't even know she was gay .
When they learn about it people tend to shrug and say , ' Oh ' .
That 's not to say they are not interested ; they are interested in who she 's living with – but no more so than if she was a man living with a woman . "
Ms Sigurdardottir has two grown - up sons .
She entered politics via the labour movement , was first elected to parliament in 1978 and was given her first ministerial office in 1987 .
She will be Prime Minister of a minority caretaker government composed of her Social Democratic Alliance and the Left - Greens , with outside support .
It is only expected to hold office for two or three months , until fresh elections are called .
" In opinion polls Johanna has repeatedly been chosen as the most popular politician in Iceland , " said the government source .
" She is a good choice , because one of the problems the government is facing is lack of trust .
Getting Johanna to become Prime Minister was a way of saying trust is an issue .
Politicians want a fresh mandate from the electorate and , before they get it , they need to rebuild trust .
Choosing Johanna is a way of saying , ' Let 's bridge this gap , let 's have peace to be able to implement the emergency measures ' . "
Geir Haarde , the former prime minister , endured months of angry protests over his poor handling of the economy ; demonstrators pelted his car with eggs and police were forced to use tear gas on the streets for the first time in 50 years .
Compare that to a poll in November that gave Ms Sigurdardottir a 73 per cent approval rating , she was the only minister to improve on the previous year 's score .
" She is often described as the only politician who really cares about the little guy , " wrote Icelandic journalist Iris Erlingsdottir in a blog this week .
She did stand for the leadership of her party back in 1994 and lost badly , but in her concession speech she predicted " my time will come " .
And some 15 years later , it truly has .

GRAND JUNCTION — John Faulkner and his wife , Brenda , thought Wednesday was a good day to buy a handgun .
“ I ’m 37 years old , and this is the first time in my life that I am really scared for our future , ” said Faulkner , an oil field worker , as he perused the collection of weaponry in A Pawn Shop here .
At Aurora ’s Firing Line gun shop , Steve Wickham was also purchasing .
“ Anything I can get my hands on , ” he said as he cradled a $ 699 9 mm handgun .
Same thing in Lakewood : “ I was selling guns before I even opened the door , ” said George Horne , owner of The Gun Room .
“ It ’s gone completely mad .
Everyone is buying everything I ’ve got on the shelves .
Sales have been crazy . ”
By midday Wednesday , the Colorado Bureau of Investigation ’s “ Insta - Check ” background check — required for the sale of a firearm and typically about 8 minutes long — was jammed with waits lasting more than two hours .
Gun -shop owners and buyers said the urgency was fueled by Barack Obama ’s presidential win and Democrats ’ increasing their majority in Congress .
“ I ’m here because of Obama , ” Wickham said .
“ I think he ’s misinterpreted the Second Amendment .
It ’s not about the right to hunt .
It ’s about the right to defend yourself . ”
The Grand Junction pawnshop is decorated with bumper stickers : “ Obama 08 ” with hammers and sickles on each end , “ Obama for President of Afghanistan ” and “ Do n’t Be a Victim .
Buy a Gun . ”
Potential threats outlined
Buyers , who were mostly going for assault rifles and handguns , were sighting them on the bumper stickers .
Behind the cash register , a list issued by the National Rifle Association outlines the potential threats a President Obama would have on Second Amendment gun rights : prohibitive excise taxes on guns and ammunition , bans on sales and transfers of all semiautomatic weapons , bans on right - to - carry permits and more .
One customer left with two new assault rifles and said he had already bought 30 weapons since Obama began his campaign for president .
“ And look at this , ” he said , unwrapping a black rifle from a plastic cover .
“ I ’m not talking BB guns . ”
Across Colorado , gun shops reported brisk business Wednesday as hunters and gun enthusiasts began to stockpile in anticipation of a Democratic president and Congress whittling away Second Amendment gun rights .
The FBI is reporting that gun sales have increased 10 percent over purchases at this point last year .
Jerry Stehman told an endless wave of customers at his Jerry ’s Outdoor Sports store in Grand Junction to come back in two hours to pick up their firearm purchases .
For the past 10 days , Stehman said , customers have been gathering cases of ammunition and multiple guns .
“ We do n’t know where this character is coming from or what he ’s gonna do to us , ” Stehman said of Obama .
“ But I can tell you it ’s been good for business . ”
The crush of business shows no signs of subsiding .
“ It will be extremely busy until Obama decides to do anything , ” said Richard Taylor , manager of Firing Line , which bills itself as Colorado ’s largest gun shop and has seen its stock of assault rifles dwindle from several dozen to a mere few in recent weeks .
“ And that ’s the real problem , the uncertainty of what he is going to do . ”
Obama , who reportedly has never fired a gun , has followed Democratic Party lines in his Senate and Illinois statehouse votes regarding gun control .
He supported the controversial handgun ban in Washington , D.C. , which the Supreme Court shot down earlier this year .
He has voted in favor of several gun-control measures and increasing taxes on ammunition and firearms .
“ A deep - rooted hatred ”
The 4 million - member NRA dedicated $ 15 million of its $ 40 million campaign this year to painting Obama as a threat to the Second Amendment .
In a mass fundraising letter sent to members this summer , NRA president Wayne LaPierre wrote , “ Never in NRA ’s history have we faced a presidential candidate — and hundreds of candidates running for other offices — with such a deep - rooted hatred of firearm freedoms . ”
Obama ’s campaign , in a statement labeled “ Supporting the rights and traditions of sportsmen , ” said he “ will protect the rights of hunters and other law - abiding Americans to purchase , own , transport and use guns . ”
Gun owners worry that a Democratic administration and Congress would support a return to President Clinton ’s gun ban , which lasted 10 years before sunsetting in 2004 .
That ban prohibited magazines capable of holding more than 10 rounds and certain semiautomatic assault rifles with cosmetic features such as lugs for attaching a bayonet .
“ Not only are they likely to revisit the Clinton ban , they will possibly make it more restrictive by banning more types of firearms altogether , ” said Tony Fabian , a Castle Rock attorney and president of the Colorado State Shooting Association , which is the state ’s division of the NRA .
Several gun-shop owners contacted by The Denver Post on Wednesday said sales had been exceptionally brisk in the past two months .
“ The avid gun owners are picking up items that were part of earlier bans or things the Democrats typically talk about when they talk about gun control .
Anything semiautomatic .
Magazines for more than 30 ( rounds ) .
Assault - type guns , ” said Tim Brough , owner of Rocky Mountain Shooters Supply in Fort Collins .
“ I think it ’s a legitimate concern .
Democrats typically want to pass more gun legislation , and now you ’ve got a House , Senate and Democratic president , so it seems likely we will see more gun regulation . ”

The Royal family found themselves caught up in a new race row today after it emerged the Prince of Wales has been calling an Asian friend by the nickname " Sooty " .
Charles has been referring to Kolin Dhillon by the moniker for years whenever they meet at Cirencester Polo club where they are both members , according to a source .
Princes William and Harry also play at the club , which is close to their father 's Highgrove estate in Gloucestershire , but the source was not aware of the young royals using the nickname .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The development comes a few days after Harry was widely condemned for calling a former Army colleague " Paki " .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown branded the comment unacceptable and the Prince , an officer in the Household Cavalry Regiment , faces a dressing down from his commanding officer .
The source said Mr Dhillon was " comfortable " with the nickname which Charles uses but when William and Harry were boys they referred to the player by his surname and Christian name .
The use of the word is at odds with Charles ' interest in Britain 's wide ranging ethnic minority community and his championing of inter - faith dialogue .
Graham Smith , campaign manager for the organisation Republic , said : " I think it goes to show the royal family are not a symbol of unity , it 's not something we can rally around , they 're quite divisive .
" People are saying they are not racist but on the evidence in the public domain I think that 's to the contrary .
" It also shows how hugely out of touch they are and that they live in a very isolated world , only mixing with a certain kind of person . "

A St James ' Palace spokesman said the 24 - year - old Prince was " extremely sorry " for the comment and stressed that he had been speaking to a friend without malice .
But the soldier 's father , Muhammad Yaqoob Khan Abbasi , has accused Harry , who is third in line to the throne , of using a " hate word " against his son .
The Sun newspaper reported that the Prince had personally apologised to his former Army colleague but St James ' Palace would not comment on the article .
When asked about Charles ' use of the nickname Sooty both Clarence House and Cirencester Polo Club declined to comment .
The Telegraph newspaper 's Mandrake column first reported that Charles had been calling Mr Dhillon Sooty , but it also quoted an anonymous Cirencester polo club member as saying William and Harry also used the nickname .
Clarence House later issued a statement which said : " We are not going to comment about a nickname which allegedly is used in a particular club .
" To imply the Princes are racist is ridiculous .
Through their charity work all three of them are committed to helping people both in the UK and abroad regardless of who they are . "
The United Nations said today that cluster bombs had hit the last functioning hospital in Sri Lanka ’s northern war zone and that 52 civilians had been killed in the region in the previous 24 hours .
On Tuesday , the United States , European Union , Japan and Norway urged the Tamil Tiger rebels to consider surrendering to avoid more deaths .
It was the first time cluster bombs were known to have been used in the government ’s push to defeat the rebels since the collapse of a cease - fire in 2006 .
The Tigers have been routed from all major towns and now control just a jungle area .
U.N. spokesman Gordon Weiss said the hospital was being hit by cluster munitions in recent days when it was also hit by artillery barrages .
He said the hospital is now nearly empty and “ we hold the gravest fears for the safety of our staff and their families . ”

The call for the separatist Tigers to discuss a surrender came as the International Committee of the Red Cross said civilians were fleeing the hospital .
The ICRC says at least 12 people have been killed in the facility in Puthukkudiyiruppu , inside the 115 square miles of jungle in the island ’s north where the guerrillas are cornered .
“ There remains probably only a short period of time before the [ rebel group ] loses control of all areas in the north , ” the joint statement from the United States and other nations said .
“ The [ Tigers ] and the government of Sri Lanka should recognize that further loss of life -- of civilians and combatants -- will serve no cause . ”

Aid agencies say 250,000 people are trapped in Tiger - held areas ; the government says the number is about half that .
The military and rebels again traded blame for shelling that has killed civilians .
Information from the war zone is impossible to verify , since journalists and most aid groups have been barred from the area .
Sri Lanka ’s military said Tuesday that it had captured the last remaining rebel airstrip .
The takeover of the seventh airstrip was a largely psychological blow .
The Tigers are believed to have only a few light aircraft .
Marijuana Re-Legalization Coming in 1st in 2nd Obama Poll
Note :
The following statistics were collected 12/30/2008 at 3:00 PM EST .
This is important to know as the polling is continuing till at least 12/31/2008 .
At that time 44,298 people have submitted 36,864 questions and cast 1,962,040 votes .
I visited Obama 's www.change.gov website to see if Marijuana Re-Legalization was leading again , as it came in first in during the first poll .
At first I was disappointed because the first Re-Legalization question was ranked 26th of 36,864 questions .
Still not bad .
And the leading scoring question was a good one at that :
" I 'm concerned about the banks who received tax payers money and have had no
accountability .
Will this be corrected after President elect Obama is in
office ? "
The leading question ( above ) below got 9,862 Yes and 600 no votes
But I then typed " marijuana " in " Search questions " field and clicked to find that 1,071 questions had been submitted regarding Marijuana Legalization .
In other words a little less than 3 percent of the questions were focused on Re-Legalizing Marijuana .
And as I went down the list of " Marijuana " questions I noticed that many had overwhelming percentages in favor of Re-Legalization and many had " yes " responses of over 2,000 .
So there is little doubt that , in aggregate , Marijuana Re-Legalization is destined to come in first place in the second Obama poll .
In fact I believe there is more support for Legalization in the 2nd poll than in the first .
But Obama 's website does not have the tools available to quantify this .
The only unfortunate aspect of the Marijuana questions is that they invariably insist on taxing and regulating it , which I believe to be a very bad idea .
This " legalize and tax " model appears to be an instilled " Pavlovian " response of far too many Marijuana Re-Legalization advocates .
Still , it is great to see such support for Marijuana Re-Legalization .
Perhaps this second poll will convince Obama that saying " No " to Re-Legalization is just going to seriously " piss off " the American People ?
I would highly recommend that my readers consider the MERP Model for Re-Legalization over any " legalize and tax " model .
The following links will provide all the background you need to understand the MERP Model that I had authored around 2000 .

All the Channel Islands are peculiar in their own ways , but Sark is particularly peculiar .
Considered a crown dependency , though by and large independent of Britain , Sark has no cars , income tax , unemployment or social security .
There is one jail cell , rarely occupied .
The only way to get here is by boat , weather permitting .
People travel on the alternately dusty and muddy roads by bicycle and in horse - drawn carts , goods are transported by tractor , and every year the seigneur pays the queen a sum equal to one - twentieth of a knight ’s service fee : £ 1.79 , or about $ 2.65 .
Until now , the legislature , known as Chief Pleas , has been made up mostly of the owners of the island ’s 40 plots of land , called tenements ( pronounced tai - ne - MONT , in a vaguely Norman French way ) .
This year , however , the legislature voted to replace itself with a fully elected 28 - seat body .
Wednesday ’s election will decide its makeup .
But the happy shift to democracy has been marred by extraordinary amounts of bad blood and ill will , reflected in the candidates running for Chief Pleas .
On one side are the people who feel that Sark , in all its sleepy friendliness , should be left to make its own decisions as it always has , albeit now with democracy .
The other side supports the development plans of a pair of reclusive identical - twin British billionaires who have bought up more than one - fifth of Sark in the last few years and feel its future should include paved roads , cars and a helicopter landing pad .
The pair , David and Frederick Barclay , also own the Ritz Hotel in London and The Daily Telegraph newspaper , among other things .
In 1993 , they bought Brecqhou , a 200 - acre island next to Sark , from Sark for a reported £ 2.33 million , or about $ 3.5 million .
( They had to pay a 13th of the price , known as a treizième , to the seigneur , a practice they found irksome ; the custom has since been abolished . )
Append slashes to URLs in Django
Quick Django pop quiz .
Can anyone spot the deliberate mistake in the following url definition ?
We ’re trying to define a view called log_viewer and instructing a specific url pattern to render it .
pre. urlpatterns = patterns ( “ , ( r ’^log / ? $ ‘ , log_viewer ) , )
In this case our regex matches / log or / log / using the /? optional pattern .
This is because even if we only link to one format we know people will probably visit both , either by entering the URL manually or by linking from an external source .
As far as HTTP is concerned though / log and / log / are separate URLs , even if they display the same content .
The main reason this matters for public facing websites is that our friendly search engine spiders are likely to index both separately , leading to splitting the page rank as well as accusations of duplicate content which might see further erosion of rankings .
The solution is generally to issue a 301 redirect from one format to the other .
This tells search engines and people alike that the canonical location for the requested content is elsewhere .
You could specify the redirect manually , but this is going to get irritating quickly once you have a few more definitions .
pre. urlpatterns = patterns ( “ , ( r’ ^log $ ‘ , redirect_to , {‘url ’ : ‘/ log / ’} ) , ( r ’^log / $ ‘ , log_viewer ) , )
Handily Django provides a mechanism to do exactly what we want to do by setting APPEND_SLASH to True in your settings file .
Even better it ’s switched on by default .
So if you do n’t know much about the intricacies of HTTP you still get the correct behavior .
That is unless you specify your URL patterns in the format above .
You see APPEND_SLASH only works if the URL does n’t match a specified pattern .
If no pattern match is found it appends a trailing slash and checks for a match again .
Because the above pattern matches the pattern without the trailing slash ( / log ) the desired behavior is never triggered , and the view is rendered at both URLs .
So although we want to catch / log and / log / on the front end , our urls .
py definition should actually be :
pre. urlpatterns = patterns ( “ , ( r ’ ^log / $ ‘ , log_viewer ) , )
Django has lots of useful bits of magic for doing the right thing , but unless you know what they actually do you either end up recreating functionality yourself , or find features do n’t work in quite the way you thought .
It ’s a good argument for keeping frameworks small whenever possible , and for developers to at least know their way around the code of their respective framework .
I 'm a couple of weeks late , but I just finished reviewing Rails 2.3 Nested Object Forms .
While a very nice and " magical " feature , I 've got to admit that I 'm really not that crazy about how it works .
Let me be the first to admit that there 's no one right way to do things .
In fact , I 'm writing this post particularly because I have a few objections to how this functionality is ultimately exposed , and I 'd like to hear arguments from those who disagree .
In other words , let me acknowledge the possibility that I am the misguided one .
Review of Nested Object Forms
As a quick review , we can now prepare our models for nested object mass assignment :
class Person < ActiveRecord :: Base validates_presence_of : name has_many : children accepts_nested_attributes_for : children # can also be used on has_one etc.. associations end class Child < ActiveRecord :: Base belongs_to : person end
We specify which nested relationships can be passed in via mass assignment using the accepts_nested_attributes_for ( ) function .
Continuing the example , we can now execute the following to actually save a person and two children at the same time :
person = Person.create !( : name => ' George ' , :children_attributes => { " new_1 " => {: name =>
' Amy'} , " new_2 " => {:name => ' Stephanie'}} )
For full disclosure , my console session from start to finish :
john - mbp : playground john $ rails -v Rails 2.3.0 john - mbp: playground john$ rails anewapp ... ... john - mbp : playground john$ cd anewapp / john - mbp : anewapp john$ ruby script / generate model person name : string ... john - mbp:anewapp john$ ruby script / generate model child name : string person_id : integer ... # edit app / models / person.rb as above # edit app/models.child.rb as above john - mbp : anewapp john $ rake db:migrate ( in / Users/john/playground/anewapp ) == CreatePeople : migrating =================================================== -- create_table ( : people ) -> 0.0044s == CreatePeople : migrated ( 0.0046s ) ========================================== == CreateChildren : migrating ================================================= -- create_table ( : children ) -> 0.0041s == CreateChildren : migrated ( 0.0045s ) ========================================

Pretty cool , huh ?
I agree .
I think this is fantastic , and with the integration with fields_for , it will really ease a lot of the pain that previously existed with multi- model forms .
This said , I 've got a few major bones to pick with how it 's implemented .
So What 's Wrong ?
The primary issue is the fact that this functionality is statically defined ( in that you ca n't turn it on / off in specific scenarios ) .
Why is this an issue ?
Well , this is a potentially dangerous functionality to expose everywhere .
Let 's say that you wanted to take advantage of this new feature to allow administrators to create new accounts that came pre-loaded with a complementary $ X credit to their accounts .
So you built a form for admins to fill out that included a fields_for : credits to achieve this single - form implementation of an account with credits .
Now , in order to avail of this , I need to turn on the nested mass assignment .
class Person < ActiveRecord :: Base has_many : credits accepts_nested_attributes_for :credits end class Credit < ActiveRecord :: Base belongs_to : person end
Wait .... I 've just turned this feature on globally ..... I ca n't just make it available at the controller level ?
But is n't the controller where I define authorization , who can edit / update / create what ?
Precisely .
So .... unless I want to go old school and rewrite this all by hand , anytime I want to render a person form ( e.g. on an " Edit My Profile " link for authenticated users ) , I need to recall that I 've exposed myself to a possible POST data hack ( anyone who understands this feature in rails will know how to handcraft the POST data ) .
This is a fairly ridiculous thing to expect on a project of any nontrivial size .
However , there 's another way around this issue .
Rather than rewriting all of the multi - model form stuff by hand , I could simply ward off the extra parameters at the controller level , e.g .
class ProfileController < ApplicationController before_filter :remove_nested_params def update @user = User.find( current_user.id ) @user.update_attributes !( params [ : user ] ) redirect_to profile_path rescue render : action => ' edit ' end protected def remove_nested_params params [ : user ] .
delete( : credits ) end end
This works fine in isolation or for a one - off , but again , this is a piece of information that is going to be lost as the project trudges along .
Your team will forget this , and someone is going to forget to " close the hole " when adding that new " quick edit profile " form that only shows their email address and display name .
Counter Suggestions
I would advocate any solution where this behavior was pushed out to controllers .
That said , I do n't have an airtight procedure planned out .
I will , however , leave you with a few suggestions .
We could implement it around_filter style where the feature is enabled / disabled in an around_filter .
The primary benefit of this approach would be that the majority of the code could probably stay put in ActiveRecord .
We 'd just need to expose hooks to turn it on / off .
Then we could define a controller - level meta-function ( e.g. filter_parameter_logging ) that could set which actions to apply the behavior on , or which models can be nested .
The syntax could look like :
class ProfileController < ApplicationController allow_nested_assignment_for
User , [ : children ] , :only => [ : update ]
end
I 'll be perfectly honest in that I do n't love this suggestion .
It incorrectly scopes this authorization tweak to the whole action and any before / after filters that execute in between it ( still leaving holes , albeit smaller ) as opposed to scoping it directly to the single save !
action that we really want to special - case .
If we perhaps exposed a separate save_with_nested ( ) function , then we could isolate the scope down to the specific call .
Needless to say , I doubt this is a course of action rails would take , and it's not one I would advocate .
Another alternative would be to keep the functionality as is , but then allow you to override or extend it at the controller level ( a la my initial suggestion ) .
This would allow developers to avail of the benefits in the less - risky areas , and then conditionally avail of them in more risky areas by simply turning it on for specific controller / action combos .
In this case , we 'd define a basic harmless nested assignment baseline in the model , and the more risky nested assignment in those controllers where we wanted to isolate it , e.g .
class Person < ActiveRecord :: Base has_many : children has_many : credits accepts_nested_attributes_for : children end class Admin:: PeopleController < ActiveRecord :: Base allow_nested_assignment_for
User , : credits , :only => [ : create , : update ]
end
The primary benefit of an approach like this is that it aligns properly to a developer 's train of thought .
When you go to add a trivial feature , you do n't think " I need to close that gap my unrelated nontrivial feature added for me . "
However , when you go to add a nontrival feature ( like allowing an admin to auto - create credits in their new account form ) , you do think " what do I need to differently ? "
In the former case , the developer thinks his new feature is trivial , and does n't expect to have do anything exceptional for it .
In the latter case , the developer thinks his new feature is nontrivial , and will think about it from a " what extra work does that mean for me ? " standpoint .
Closing Thoughts
One of the biggest things that worries me is that no one is talking about this .
The whole community requested this feature , and at this point it has received quite a bit of fanfare .
But there are some clear ways to accidentally screw yourself that just are n't being mentioned as caveats .
To be entirely blunt , I just feel like this is plugin material at this point .
Though I commend rails for opening up its feature set to a community vote , I fear that we may have misstepped with this feature in particular .
I 'm very curious to hear what others think .

He obviously had n’t talked to any Texas Republicans .
The GOP ’s Houston - area lawmakers emerged from their closed - door session with Obama impressed with his sincerity and his outreach attempt but uniformly unimpressed with the costly plan designed to jump - start the stalled American economy .
“ Redistributing hard - earned tax dollars will do far more to expand the power of the federal government than it will to stimulate the economy , ” said Rep. John Culberson , R- Houston .
“ This legislation is a Trojan horse that liberals are using to ultimately turn America into France , because it contains massive expansion of multiple federal programs that are utterly unrelated to stimulating the economy . ”
During a generally convivial hour - long session with House Republicans , several Texans , including Dallas Rep. Jeb Hensarling , bluntly told the president why they could n’t support his plan .
Hensarling , the Number 2 Republican on the House Budget Committee , said he told Obama that the “ debt we incur today will eventually be paid by my 6 - year - old daughter , my 5 - year - old son and ( the president ’s ) two daughters . ”
Rep. Pete Olson , R - Sugar Land , gave Obama credit for “ a nice gesture ” in coming to Capitol Hill but said the president ’s visit did little to persuade skeptical Republicans .
“ In the end , you still cannot borrow or spend your way to prosperity , ” the newly elected Republican said .
Rep .
Ted Poe assailed “ a mind set in Washington that the bureaucrats know how to better spend our money than the people do , ” while Rep. Kevin Brady , R - The Woodlands , said spending on programs such as education , health care and museums “ do not boost the economy . ”
“ I ca n’t find an economist anywhere who will admit that contraceptives , zoo exhibits and repairs to the Jefferson Memorial are serious economic boosts , ” Brady said .
He predicted that support for the stimulus package would not reach double - digit strength among the 178 House Republicans .
All three Houston - area House Democrats — Sheila Jackson Lee , Gene Green and Al Green — support the Obama economic package .

See also DSStore . pm repository and formatted copy of the documentation
Mark Mentovai reverse - engineered the .DS_Store file format .
Here 's his notes on it :
The first 88 ( 0x58 ) bytes of the .DS_Store file seem to be its fixed header , including its signature / magic number .
At 0x14 [ 4 ] or 0x16 [ 2 ] , there is a value that contains the seek_set offset of some actual interesting data .
If this offset does not end in 0xa , bump it up so that it ends in 0xa ?
At this offset , read a 2 - byte value that indicates how many data structures follow .
This count also appears in the file in the header at 0x4e [ 2 ] .
Each structure contains the following six bytes of lead - in :
0x 00 00 00 01 00 2e ( 0x2e is '. ')
That is followed by a four - byte structure ID and that , by a four - byte structure type .
The structure type either implies the length of the structure or , in the case of type " blob " , contains the length within .
In the event of a blob , the next 4 bytes ( or the next 2 bytes , having skipped 2 ) gives the length , in bytes , of the blob structure , including only the following data , not the lead - in .
If type bool , only one byte follows .
If type long or shor , four bytes of data follow .
In the event of a shor , the first two bytes are zero ?
ignored ?
reserved ?
Immediately following the structure 's data is another structure if there are more structures .
Note the structure count above .
Instead of one of these structures , there might be a lead - in 00 00 00 0b .
This seems to indicate that a file name follows , and that the file name will apply to future structs .
0b is the length of the filename to follow , the file name is in Unicode UTF - 16 so each character is a 2 - byte value .
So with this in mind , it 's evident that each structure as described above actually contains at its beginning [ length : 4 ] [ filename : length ] before the structure type , and the 00 00 00 01 00 2e just means that the structure applies to the current directory / folder ( '.' ) .
Cool .
Beginning at 0x1400 , through 0x14ff , is a fixed trailer ?
Except it 's not fixed .
The values at 0x1444 ...0x1457 seem to be variable .
The file 's end position is 0x1800 .
Structure fwi0 type blob is Finder window information .
Known length is 0x10 ( 16 ) .
The data is first four two - byte values representing the top , left , bottom , and right edges of the rect defining the content area of the window .
The next four bytes represent the view of the window , " icnv " is icon view .
The next four bytes are unknown .
Structure fwvh type shor is Finder window vertical height .
If present , it overrides the height defined by the rect in fwi0 .
The Finder seems to create these ( at least on 10.4 ) even though it will do the right thing for window height with only an fwi0 around , perhaps this is because the stored height is weird when accounting for toolbars and status bars .
Structure icvt type shor is icon view text label ( filename ) size .
Structure icvo type blob is icon view options .
Known length 0x12 ( 18 ) , first 4 bytes " icvo " , then 8 unknown bytes ( flags ? ) , then 2 bytes corresponding to the selected icon view size , then 4 unknown bytes ( 0x6 e 6 f 6 e 65 ) ( the text " none " , guess that this is the " keep arranged by " setting ? )
Structure Iloc type blob is icon location for the last - identified file .
Length is 0x10 ( 16 ) , two 4 - byte values representing the horizontal and vertical positions of the icon 's center ( not top - left ) .
( Then , 6 bytes 0xff and 2 bytes 0 ? )
For the purposes of the center , the icon only is taken into account , not any label .
The icon 's size comes from the icvo blob .
Structure BKGD type blob known length 0x0c ( 12 ) is for the background .
It contains a reference to another strucutre , the first four bytes are PctB , followed by four bytes indicating the length of the referenced pict structure ( same as the pict 's length ) , then 00 00 00 13 ( always the same ? )
Structure pict type blob , length dependent on contents .
This is for the background , along with BKGD .
The contents : first , two empty bytes ( 00 00 ) followed by 4 bytes giving the length of the entire structure again , same as the length following " pictblob " in the header .
Then , 4 bytes , 00 02 00 00 .
Then , 1 byte giving the length of the volume name .
Then , 31 bytes to hold the volume name , unused bytes are 00 ...
The Finder seems to think it 's free to do whatever it wants when encountering unknown struct types .
A lot of stuff in the file seems to be junk .
It seems that the system creates the file and writes to unused locations in it , leaving garbage elsewhere .
Follow the structure of the file , not all of its contents are significant .

Preface :
To those who believe that all 9/11 conspiracy claims are crazy , please listen to what the actual intelligence officers , military leaders , legal experts , and others in the know have to say .
On the other hand , to those who believe that 9/11 was an inside job - so that talk of mere " negligence " is a cop-out , please read to the end before making up your mind about strategy .
As David Ray Griffin has pointed out , nearly everyone who looks at the evidence regarding 9/11 with an open mind ends up being convinced that it was an inside job .
Any prosecution related to 9/11 will force people to look at the evidence .
Gangsters have been jailed for life based on convictions for tax fraud .
Investigations into small misdeeds often turn up evidence of major crimes .
And covering up the crime is itself a crime .
Even if the prosecutor is n't sure how you did it , if he can prove you covered up the crime , destroyed evidence , committed perjury , etc. , you 'll end up in the big house .
So if government agencies are too spineless to prosecute for anything else , prosecuting those complicit in 9/11 for criminal negligence and / or cover - up is worthwhile .
Is there strong evidence of criminal negligence with regard to the 9/11 attacks ?
Definitely .
Is there strong evidence for a cover - up and destruction of evidence ?
Without doubt .
See this and this .
Now is the perfect time to prosecute criminal behavior .
9/11 is no exception .
If the only politically feasible way to do it is to start with a prosecution solely for criminal negligence or cover - up , then start there .
For 18 months my people in Gaza have been under siege , incarcerated inside the world 's biggest prison , sealed off from land , air and sea , caged and starved , denied even medication for our sick .
After the slow death policy came the bombardment .
In this most densely populated of places , nothing has been spared Israel 's warplanes , from government buildings to homes , mosques , hospitals , schools and markets .
More than 540 have been killed and thousands permanently maimed .
A third are women and children .
Whole families have been massacred , some while they slept .
This river of blood is being shed under lies and false pretexts .
For six months we in Hamas observed the ceasefire .
Israel broke it repeatedly from the start .
Israel was required to open crossings to Gaza , and extend the truce to the West Bank .
It proceeded to tighten its deadly siege of Gaza , repeatedly cutting electricity and water supplies .
The collective punishment did not halt , but accelerated - as did the assassinations and killings .
Thirty Gazans were killed by Israeli fire and hundreds of patients died as a direct effect of the siege during the so - called ceasefire .
Israel enjoyed a period of calm .
Our people did not .
When this broken truce neared its end , we expressed our readiness for a new comprehensive truce in return for lifting the blockade and opening all Gaza border crossings , including Rafah .
Our calls fell on deaf ears .
Yet still we would be willing to begin a new truce on these terms following the complete withdrawal of the invading forces from Gaza .
No rockets have ever been fired from the West Bank .
But 50 died and hundreds more were injured there last year at Israel 's hands , while its expansionism proceeded relentlessly .
We are meant to be content with shrinking scraps of territory , a handful of cantons at Israel 's mercy , enclosed by it from all sides .
The truth is Israel seeks a one - sided ceasefire , observed by my people alone , in return for siege , starvation , bombardment , assassinations , incursions and colonial settlement .
What Israel wants is a gratuitous ceasefire .
The logic of those who demand that we stop our resistance is absurd .
They absolve the aggressor and occupier - armed with the deadliest weapons of death and destruction - of responsibility , while blaming the victim , prisoner and occupied .
Our modest , home - made rockets are our cry of protest to the world .
Israel and its American and European sponsors want us to be killed in silence .
But die in silence we will not .
What is being visited on Gaza today was visited on Yasser Arafat before .
When he refused to bow to Israel 's dictates , he was imprisoned in his Ramallah headquarters , surrounded by tanks for two years .
When this failed to break his resolve , he was murdered by poisoning .
Gaza enters 2009 just as it did 2008 : under Israeli fire .
Between January and February of last year 140 Gazans died in air strikes .
And just before it embarked on its failed military assault on Lebanon in July 2006 , Israel rained thousands of shells on Gaza , killing 240 .
From Deir Yassin in 1948 to Gaza today , the list of Israel 's crimes is long .
The justifications change , but the reality is the same : colonial occupation , oppression , and never - ending injustice .
If this is the " free world " whose " values " Israel is defending , as its foreign minister Tzipi Livni alleges , then we want nothing to do with it .
Israel 's leaders remain in the grip of confusion , unable to set clear goals for the attacks - from ousting the legitimately elected Hamas government and destroying its infrastructure , to stopping the rockets .
As they fail to break Gaza 's resistance the benchmark has been lowered .
Now they speak of weakening Hamas and limiting the resistance .
But they will achieve neither .
Gaza 's people are more united than ever , determined not to be terrorised into submission .
Our fighters , armed with the justice of their cause , have already caused many casualties among the occupation army and will fight on to defend their land and people .
Nothing can defeat our will to be free .
Once again , Washington and Europe have opted to aid and abet the jailer , occupier and aggressor , and to condemn its victims .
We hoped Barack Obama would break with George Bush 's disastrous legacy but his start is not encouraging .
While he swiftly moved to denounce the Mumbai attacks , he remains tongue - tied after 10 days of slaughter in Gaza .
But my people are not alone .
Millions of freedom - loving men and women stand by its struggle for justice and liberation - witness daily protests against Israeli aggression , not only in the Arab and Islamic region , but worldwide .
Israel will no doubt wreak untold destruction , death and suffering in Gaza .
But it will meet the same fate in Gaza as it did in Lebanon .
We will not be broken by siege and bombardment , and will never surrender to occupation .

Whenever I do these classes and start posting about food security , we come up against what I would call “ the zombie issue ” – the idea that marauding hordes of some sort will immediately emerge if we ever need our food storage , and promptly take it away from us .
There are a host of reasons I do n’t buy this , one of them being that I think the “ 0 to Zombie in 30 seconds model skips over the fact that a whole lot of grey areas exist in between 0 and zombie , and most of the middle territory is far more likely to be enacted than the most apocalyptic anxieties / fantasies .
But for the purpose of the discussion , let ’s imagine that there ’s been some major disruption in food supplies and the undead are getting hungry .
Now I ’m still somewhat skeptical of the “ zombie theory ” for a number of reasons .
They include :
1 . The assumption is often made that the zombies all come from cities , and by implication are often one of those “ thems ” - which to me suggests that underneath our zombie worries are some older and uglier assumptions about who we ’re really worried about .
We saw how this played out in New Orleans , where reports and assumptions about violence were far greater than the reality – most of the violence that actually occurred was caused by people who thought they knew that bad guys were coming for them – even though they were n’t .
Our fears of the other from the city are complicated , and not always rational .
Sometimes , they create the situation they fear .
2 . The zombie theory tends to assume a well organized , armed populace of people who have guns and maybe gas ( or maybe walk in an organized fashion ) , but no food , descending on a population of unarmed , pacifist agrarians .
This is seriously messed up for a host of reasons .
a . The trip out of the cities is longer than most people think .
Let ’s say that a mass of angry , hungry zombies plan to march out to the countryside to get food , say , from New York City .
Well , before the zombies get to me , they ’ve got to cover 200 miles of suburbia , not filled with food .
Then , they have to be able to recognize and obtain food from the farms – that is , they have to be able to look at the oats and say “ yum , let ’s take those … and thresh and hull them and roll them into oatmeal and eat them ! ”
If they are on foot ( and let ’s assume this is n’t winter ) , they are going to run out of steam somewhere in White Plains , long before they hit my neighborhood .
If they might make it here , and run into the harsh reality – most rural areas do n’t have a lot of gardens , and the things they produce often are the components of food , rather than food as most people who do n’t cook recognize it .
b. Rural people are armed and work together well .
Guns are usually among the tools of ordinary work out here – people hunt , they run off predators , they butcher livestock and use their weapons .
Is it possible that zombies could overrun things ?
Sure , but it would take a fair number of zombies .
How did they get trained ?
Where did they master the territory ?
3 . For the most part , and there are historical exceptions , zombie hordes are not what you have to worry about most in difficult times .
That is , if people are truly hungry , what people will worry about most is not the “ random evil folk from far away ” but their near neighbors who compete with them for resources .
This is much more likely to be expressed as a rise in the crime rate – less zombieism , much more “ I beat you up and took your cash and food on hand . ”
Now that ’s not good either – but preparation for dealing with those basic crime security issues is rather different than for preparing to fight off the local zombie warlords .
In that case , your community is needed and essential .
Crime rates against people did n’t rise much in the great Depression , although light theft of food or small amounts of money did .
For people who wandered about looking for work or food , they were more likely to be victims than the perpetrators – in many towns the homeless during the Depression were thrown in jail , and used in forced labor , simply for the crime of being poor .
They were victims of crime quite often .
Crime rates did rise in places like Russia after the Soviet collapse , but the zombie reality never kicked in .
More crime has its tough parts , I do n’t diminish this , but people who live now in extremely high crime areas find strategies for dealing with it .
I ’ve lived in such areas myself .
My point is n’t that no one will take your food away – maybe someone will .
Or maybe you ’ll lose it to fire , flood , or having to evacuate .
Life does n’t really come with certainties .
But I think we have a disproportionate fear of being targeted , in part based on the idea that we ’re all going to experience things equally .
Now if everyone stops getting food all at once , it may be pretty obvious who has the food .
But how often does that happen ?
There will be some rich folks and poor folks in most likelihood .
We probably wo n’t know what our neighbors have – some will still have a job and maybe some food coming in , some may be relying on stores , some may have virtually nothing .
I do n’t find myself compelled by the idea that your stores will make you a target – or rather , any more than having a job or any other thing most of us do n’t plan to give up unless we have to makes us a target .
In fact , most of the victims of rising crime are poor people in poor neighborhoods – that is , right now , the targets are n’t the fortunate , but the unfortunate .
And that tends to get played out over and over again – it is the refugees and those without anything who lose the most .
Not always .
But history stands against the “ your stores will mark you ” analysis .
But most importantly , all of this assumes that your stores exist entirely in isolation – that you in your house sit there with your food and eat when others are suffering .
But I think that ’s very much unlikely for most of us – I ’m sure if things get really bad , we ’ll develop some kind of insulation against suffering , simply because we can’t help everyone .
But at the same time , those we ’re in relationship with are n’t going to disappear , either .
And we are very much unlikely to live in a world where we know now , today , that this is the last crust of bread , and there will never be any more , and thus , sharing will starve our children .
That happens in novels , and not much in real life .
In real life , what happens is that you share , and the next day , perhaps your neighbor shares the food he found with you .
Indeed , in most poor cultures , the obligation to share is taken far more seriously than it is here .
In poorer times the fairy tales about the widow who gave the last crust of bread to a poor stranger , and about greedy rich people taught the cultural message that you shared because it was right , and also because what you shared returned to you .
Joetta Handrich Schlabach , writing in _ Extending the Table : A World Community Cookbook_ ( a wonderful book ) writes of a story a friend of hers who was visiting Lesotho .
She visited a friend ‘ Me Malebohang .
They discussed the bad pumpkin harvest , and how ‘ Me Malebohang had only 8 pumpkins for the whole winter .
As the friend got up to leave , ‘ Me Malebohang offered her guest the largest of the pumpkins .
When the guest refused , saying she could n’t take one of her pumpkins , ‘ Me Malabohang answered , “ We Basotho know that this is the way to do it .
Next year I may have nothing in my field , and if I do n’t share with you now , who will share with me then ? ”
And even if you imagine that the worst case scenarios came true , the “ last crust of bread ” scenario becomes a reality , there is this – for some of us , how we live our lives matters as much as the lives themselves .
In the end , if , G - d forbid , we are confronted with that choice , I at least have to believe that those harshest and most uncertain moments are the ones that you most need your own moral underpinnings – doing right may be more important than one more day .
But realistically , I do n’t expect that most of us will face anything like that particular set of tragedies .
That does n’t mean life wo n’t be harder , and that some people wo n’t go hungry – indeed , America has plenty of hungry right now .
But not because we ’re all fighting over one last crust of bread .

Forget the two - state solution : start thinking about the four - state problem .
The phrase comes from Palestinian negotiator and analyst Ahmad Khalidi , who has toiled for decades to see two states side by side , one for Palestinians , the other for Israelis .
Now , though , he sees one strong state , Israel , surrounded by three statelets .
The first is the West Bank , ruled by the secular nationalists of Fatah .
The second is Gaza , for nearly two years the fiefdom of Islamist Hamas .
The third is the surprise : still in embryo , we got a glimpse of its future earlier this month .
Militant Jewish settlers in Hebron resisted their eviction from a disputed house by not only hurling stones and debris at Palestinians nearby - and daubing black stars of David on Muslim gravestones in what Israel 's prime minister Ehud Olmert called a " pogrom " - but also by turning their fire on the soldiers of the Israel Defence Forces .
These images were a shock to the Israeli system , confirmation that a hard core of Jewish settlers now exists that has next to no loyalty to the state of Israel , and that indeed regards the state as godless and illegitimate - and which is prepared to raise its hand to the teenage men and women who comprise the bulk of Israel 's conscript army .
Soon we might speak of Israel , the West Bank , Gaza and a new , zealous , rebel entity : call it Judea .
We are not quite at that point yet .
But add it to the long list of developments causing veterans of the Middle East peace process - a saga so long - running that it's the Mousetrap of international negotiations - to lose faith in the two - state solution , even as that model enjoys near global support among the world 's governments , restated again yesterday , whether at the United Nations security council or at Olmert 's meeting in London with Gordon Brown .
The causes for despair are numerous , starting with that fragmentation cited by Khalidi .
Palestinians who once believed the split between Fatah and Hamas was transient and reparable now worry the division is hardening , that there is no figure on the horizon capable of putting this sundered people back together .
They ask why Hamas would come back under the authority of Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas .
What would be in it for them ?
And yet so long as the Palestinians remain divided , Abbas is too weak to do a meaningful deal with Israel , one that would bind all Palestinians .
Indeed , conversations with those on both sides in the last week have told a remarkably similar story : neither Israelis nor Palestinians believe they are capable of reaching an agreement .
The mood is hardly conducive .
A month - long blockade of Gaza , with Palestinians there denied access to fuel , medical equipment and much else , may not have garnered a great deal of attention here but the rising human cost , of sick patients and darkened schools , is a staple of the nightly news on television around the Arab world .
The anger is directed mostly at Israel , for enforcing the sanctions , imposed in response to the discovery of secret tunnels into Israel from Gaza .
But Egypt is blamed too , for failing to open its border , thereby bringing respite to those in desperate need - as are the European Union and the US , both of which are party to the embargo of Hamas .
On Friday , Hamas 's six month - long ceasefire , which has mainly held , will expire .
Few would bet on it being extended .
Meanwhile , Abbas faces an expiration date of his own : his presidential term runs out on 9 January .
He is hinting that he will step aside , allowing elections for a new leader .
Even those unimpressed by Abbas - by his remoteness , his inability to act as a unifying , national figure - see his departure as an invitation for more division and paralysis .
The stalemate has roots on the other side , too .
Olmert 's time is also running out ; Israel will have new elections on 10 February .
Polls predict a return to power for Binyamin Netanyahu and Likud , whose defining trait is a nationalistic scepticism about the peace process .
Even if that were to be overcome , Israel has its own inbuilt divisions , expressed in coalitions perennially too fragmented to make the concessions that have to be made .
Besides , there are plenty in Israel 's policy establishment who think the status quo is bearable , that Palestinians pose nothing like the existential threat of , say , a nuclear Iran .
They 're happy enough to have a process but are not really serious about peace .
As I heard one senior Israeli official put it recently : " Negotiations are good , results are bad . "
Some respond to this bleak landscape by focusing on individual elements within it and imagining how they might be improved .
Maybe new Palestinian elections would produce a useful outcome .
After all , the latest survey from pollster Khalil Shikaki has Fatah leading Hamas by 42 % to 28 % - with Fatah polling especially strongly on Hamas 's turf in Gaza .
Or perhaps Netanyahu will follow the Nixon - to - China principle and , as a man of the right , do the deal .
After all , when he last served as PM a decade ago , he proved to be more pragmatic than his reputation had suggested .
Or there will be a miracle and the new , dovish party founded by former Camp David negotiator Gilead Sher , and backed by literary giants Amos Oz and David Grossman , will sweep to unexpected victory .
Dream on .
Rather than hoping the factors thwarting a two - state solution might change , it is surely more rational to step back and rethink the entire approach .
Britain 's foreign secretary , David Miliband , is fond of quoting Eisenhower 's maxim that , when faced with an intractable problem , the first move is to make it bigger .
Frustrated by the impossibility of making peace between two peoples , why not up the ante and seek to make peace between Israel and the entire region ?
A comprehensive peace or , as Miliband put it in a speech last month , " a 23 - state solution - 22 members of the Arab League plus Israel " .
This is not as fanciful as it might seem .
The Arab peace initiative of 2002 , which offered full normalisation of relations in return for Israel 's withdrawal to its 1967 borders , is still on the table .
Indeed the Arab League wrote to Barack Obama just last week , urging him to work for Middle East peace , with their initiative as the basis .
There are problems with the Arab plan .
For one thing , there has been no public diplomacy for it , no public face for it - no equivalent of Anwar Sadat 's breakthrough visit to Israel , proving the sincerity of his desire for peace .
And how would it work in practice ?
Khalidi wonders how on earth 22 Arab countries are meant to reach " simultaneous orgasm " , coming to an agreement with Israel all at the same time .
And yet the logic behind it is compelling .
Right now , the Palestinians do n't have enough to offer Israel to make the sacrifices required for a peace deal worthwhile .
But an accord with the entire Arab world , that would be a prize worth bending for .
And , while today 's Palestinian leadership is too weak to make compromises on , for instance , Jerusalem , united Arab support would give the Palestinians all the cover they need .
Fear of Iran might motivate the Arabs to come together .
A falling oil price could concentrate the mind too .
And as always , the sine qua non is the active intervention of the US .
Some Israeli officials believe that , after the Bush era , the US is no longer capable of imposing its will on the Middle East .
Starting next month , President Obama will have a chance to prove them wrong - and solve one of the world 's most persistent problems into the bargain .

Several dozen students occupied a cafeteria at New York University on Wednesday night , barricading themselves inside with tables and chairs and chanting a list of demands .
The protest began shortly before 10 p.m. when about 70 students , most of them members of a student - run group called the Take Back N.Y.U. Campaign , gathered on the third floor of the Kimmel Student Center at Washington Square South and La Guardia Place .
The students pushed tables and chairs against the doors , and a woman with a megaphone outlined the group ’s demands .
They included a full and annual reporting of the university ’s operating budget , expenditures and endowment .
The students also demanded that N.Y.U. provide 13 scholarships annually to students from the Gaza Strip and give surplus supplies to the Islamic University of Gaza .
On the group ’s Web site , it also asked that all participants in the protest be granted amnesty from punishment .
To accomplish microTetris , we use the technique of optical trapping ( explained elsewhere on our group 's webpage ) to hold the glass beads in place .
In short , an optical trap is a laser beam which is focused to a very tiny spot ( 1 micrometer = about 1/1000th of a millimeter ) by a strong lens , usually a microscope 's objective lens .
This focus appears to act as an attractor point , in which small particles like our 1 - micrometer glass beads ( but also cells or bacteria ) can be sucked and from which they cannot escape .
This tool , also more figuratively referred to as ' optical tweezers ' is nowadays indispensable in biophysical research .
It is being used to push cells together to monitor their elastic properties , or to stretch single molecules of DNA until the DNA helix unwinds or breaks , or to measure the forces of the ' motor ' that propells bacteria through their surroundings .
In fact , we could add a lot more things to this list without being complete .
In our Tetris case , a device called an acousto - optic deflector ( AOD ) was used to computer - steer the trapping laser light very swiftly across the 42 bead positions as seen in the video — pretty much like the way a monitor steers its electron beam across the pixels on the screen .
This was done fast enough for a bead to stay at its location while the laser was scanning the other positions .
( At the end of the video , you can observe what happens if we suddenly switch off the laser light : the beads are no longer confined to their traps and can diffuse away easily . )
Just so you can appreciate what is going on in the video here , you have glass beads which are one million times smaller than a meter ( micro- spheres ) which are being manipulated using ' optical tweezers ' to play a game of Tetris in a real physical field under a f-ing microscope !
I pay homage to thee , powerful geek overlords !
Now how the hell am I going to make an AOD ?
Experiments begin soon at ' the lab ' under an old microscope , a few laser pointers and ..... well , microsound ?
FEBRUARY 26 -- A trio of Louisiana nitwits agreed to swap two young children for a $ 1500 cockatoo and $ 175 , police charge .
The deranged exchange was hatched after Donna Greenwell , a 51 - year - old trucker , learned that the bird was being offered for sale by Brandy Romero , 27 , and Paul Romero , 46 .
According to Evangeline Parish Sheriff 's Office investigators , Brandy Romero told cops that Greenwell contacted her and said that while she could not afford the cockatoo's price tag , she did have children to trade ( in a bid to sell the bird , the Romeros posted a flyer at a barn , where Greenwell spotted the notice , which included a photo of the cockatoo ) .
Investigators have determined that Greenwell is not the mother of the children , a four - year - old girl and a five - year - old boy .
It appears as if the children , whose mother is a criminal fugitive , have resided with various families over the past several years , and have spent the past year in the custody of Greenwell , a convicted pedophile with a lengthy rap sheet .
Greenwell and the Romeros , pictured in photos released by the Evangeline sheriff , have each been charged with aggravated kidnapping .
The children swapped for the bird are now living with a temporary foster family , according to investigator Keith Dupre , who added that the cockatoo was recovered from Greenwell 's home , where two other birds resided .
When confronted by deputies , Greenwell denied trading the children for the bird , which she claimed was simply given to her by the Romeros .

* TSX sinks 9.3 pct ; erases Friday ’s 5.9 rise
* Energy shares fall as oil falls below $ 50 barrel
* Grim U.S. manufacturing data stirs concern about Canada ( Adds details , comment )
TORONTO , Dec 1 ( Reuters ) - Toronto ’s main stock index tumbled 864 points on Monday , its deepest net drop ever , as sliding commodity prices , gloomy U.S. economic news and the urge to take profits after six straight days of gains prompted a sell - off that hit every market sector .
Resource issues led the market lower as OPEC ’s deferral of any new oil supply cuts stung energy shares .
U.S. crude sank $ 5.15 to $ 49.28 a barrel , its lowest settlement since May 2005 .
Materials stocks were undercut by falling gold prices and in increasingly gloomy economic view .
Data showing Canada ’s economy grew at a faster - than - expected 1.3 percent in the third quarter was ignored in the face of a report showing falling U.S. factory activity .
Even more disturbing was a declaration from the U.S. National Bureau of Economic Research that the United States has been in recession since December 2007 .
“ We were coming off a pretty decent run last week , but no such luck ( today ) , ” said Elvis Picardo , analyst and strategist at Global Securities in Vancouver .
“ There ’s so much concern about what the global economy ’s doing , and there this big massive sell - off in commodity prices . ”
The S&P / TSX composite index .
GSPTSE fell 864.41 points , or 9.3 percent , to 8406.21 .
The drop eclipsed an 840.93 point drop on Sept. 29 , 2008 .
The percentage decline was the second biggest ever .
All 10 TSX subgroups fell , with materials issues dropping 13.7 percent , and energy stocks falling 13.3 percent .
Among energy stocks , Talisman Energy TLM .
TO dropped C$ 2.14 , or 17.2 percent , to C$ 10.27 , while Suncor Energy SU.TO retreated C$ 4.65 , or 16.3 percent , to C$ 23.90 .
In the materials sector , Goldcorp G.TO plunged C$ 5.85 , or 16.7 percent , to C$ 29.15 , while Teck Cominco TCKb .
TO fell C$ 1.04 , or 17.3 percent , to C$ 4.96 .
Financial services , which along with the resource sectors make up the bulk of listed stocks , fell 8.4 percent , hurt by the economic news -- which included data showing falling U.S. factory activity -- and concerns about more losses for U.S. bank Citigroup C.N .
Among financial issues , Manulife Financial MFC.TO dropped C$ 3.54 , or 14.8 percent , to C$ 20.46 , while Royal Bank of Canada RY .TO fell C$ 3.74 , or 8.7 percent , to C$ 39.44 .
“ It ’s an ugly day today , ” said John Ing , president of investment dealer Maison Placements in Toronto .
“ The lack of consensus as far as OPEC was concerned , the continuation of the talk about CITIbank , all of these contributed to a lousy market . ”
The decline followed six straight days of gains that had taken the index up by 20 percent from a five - year low hit on Nov. 20 .
“ Every time you have a mini-rally in , the selling comes back in again , ” said Picardo .
U.S. stocks also fell hard .
The Dow Jones industrial average .
DJI retreated 679.95 points , or 7.7 percent , to 8,149,09 , while the Nasdaq composite .IXIC sank 137.50 , or 8.95 percent , to 1,398.07 .
Just when you thought it was safe to dip your toe back in the waters of internet smut , along comes a bunch of vigilantes who could be about to make life a great deal more worrying .
Or perhaps not - read on and make your own mind up .
This week , the new law on extreme porn went live throughout the UK ( except Scotland ) .
Hopes in some quarters that this law would prove a panacea to the nastier end of internet kinkiness were dashed last week when ACPO announced that they would not be actively policing it .
All change , however , as an organisation calling itself extremeporn mails
The Register to announce that if the government wo n’t do it , they will .
A slightly topsy - turvy argument on its homepage states :
We believe that the law should be enforced ; not doing so breeds laziness and impreciseness in the legislature , lack of inspection of the law outside of the legislature , increased power of the executive due to selective enforcement and permits many people guilty - of a crime , if nothing else - to get away Scot - free …
This is bad for everyone .
Some more explanation of what it plans to do is contained a little further into the site .
They claim that they will primarily categorise and monitor torrents .
Once a torrent has been added to their system , they will periodically poll the tracker for peer IPs and then use GeoIP technology to identify UK - based IPs .
Where a match is found , the system will , in principle , email the abuse contact for that IP .
( This is where extremeporn ’s claims become a little vague : they seem to be agreeing , however , that there are practical issues with this stage of the process . )
Despite this , they claim already to have filed more abuse reports than the Government planned to prosecute in an entire year .
So what is going on ?
Is this spoof or net vigilantism ?
A quick trace suggests that the domain name is registered to an individual going by the name of Adam Gleave .
This may or may not be accurate .
In a further email sent to El Reg this afternoon , the site owner confessed that although the overall aim sounded a little grandiose , the project currently consists of " little more than 255 lines of Python code , a hastily assembled website , and a few , loose - knit members " .
They add : " The government would have have spent at least £ 1 million to have achieved a similar feat , though . "
Nonetheless , they do appear to be serious in their intent to out individuals caught downloading potentially illegal torrent content , arguing that they would only need a positive response from a very small proportion of ISPs for this action to have a significant effect .
Ambivalence as to their eventual aims is given by their suggestion that they would be willing to discuss ways in which people can evade our and others detection and censorship attempts on the internet , and censorship and policing attempts of the internet in general .
Technical experts have suggested that the process described by extremeporn is feasible , especially if supported by the Police , but they expressed some scepticism that it would work very well .
Beyond that , the site ’s selection of stories and imagery to make its points are slightly more suggestive of an organisation that dislikes the government ’s world view than one that buys into it .
A link for " watchful eyes " takes readers to a disturbingly Orwellian poster produced by Transport for London , whilst a second link to an internet competency centre links to what appears to be a rather portly ( and possibly German ) euro - cop staring at his laptop .
There is also a fairly telling link to a story about an individual killed as a result of vigilantism .
Ultimate irony or sharp political point ?
The argument put forward by extremeporn to justify their actions is subtle , but probably more anti-censorship than first appears .
Critics of the new law have argued that it is little more than a figleaf , and that the last thing government wishes to happen is for anyone to take it seriously .
They ’ve ticked the extreme porn box and can now concentrate on important things – like prostitution .
The authorities have traditionally been a little sniffy when it comes to freelance efforts and satirical websites .
One only has to look at the Met ’s reaction to thinkofthechildren – or the wider condemnation of possible freelance action to take down al - Qaeda websites from the US – to realise that independent action is not welcome .
So no surprise that we have had no comment from the IWF ( a slight degree of jealousy , perhaps , that extremeporn appear to be venturing into territory they themselves cannot ? ) and from ACPO a fairly bland assurance that " the police service will use this new legislation as part of the toolkit that police officers have to combat pornographic crime .
Wherever we encounter possession of extreme pornographic material we will investigate it further and take the necessary action .
" If there is a member of the public who is concerned that they have an illegal image in their possession , they should seek legal advice , " the ACPO concludes .
Although if this site is genuine , it could be that the police will already have their hands full . ®
DULUTH - Shirley Graham was astonished to learn that a lawyer from Norm Coleman 's campaign on Tuesday blocked her absentee ballot from being added to the U.S. Senate recount .
" I'm an election judge , " said Graham , of Duluth .
" I expected to be the last person whose ballot would n't be counted . "
Her sealed ballot was among 60 from St. Louis County that were blocked by representatives of Coleman and Al Franken during the first day of a statewide review of absentee ballots that may have been wrongly rejected in last month 's election .
Under a state Supreme Court ruling , local election officials and the two campaigns must all agree that a ballot was wrongly rejected for it to be sent along to St. Paul for inclusion in the recount .
Coleman 's camp , which rejected 59 of the 60 ballots set aside Tuesday in St. Louis County ( out of 161 total ballots ) , objected to Graham 's ballot on the grounds that the date next to her signature did not match the date next to the signature of her witness , Jack Armstrong .
That 's dumbfounding , Graham said .
" Both of us are former educators , and he used to work in the secretary of state 's office , " she said .
" As he sat across the table from me , he actually said , ' Shirley , this date has to be the same . '
I do n't understand how it could be different . "
Graham said that because she works each Election Day in a neighboring precinct , she votes absentee .
She did n't have any idea that her ballot had been rejected , reconsidered and rerejected until receiving a reporter 's call .
" I want to see my ballot , " said Graham , who added that she 'd consider going to court , if she must , to get her vote counted .
A final irony : She voted for Coleman .

Setting Up A High - Availability Load Balancer ( With Failover and Session Support ) With HAProxy / Wackamole / Spread On Debian Etch
Version 1.0
Author : Falko Timme
This article explains how to set up a two - node load balancer in an active / passive configuration with HAProxy , Wackamole , and Spread on Debian Etch .
The load balancer sits between the user and two ( or more ) backend Apache web servers that hold the same content .
Not only does the load balancer distribute the requests to the two backend Apache servers , it also checks the health of the backend servers .
If one of them is down , all requests will automatically be redirected to the remaining backend server .
In addition to that , the two load balancer nodes monitor each other using Wackamole and Spread , and if the master fails , the slave becomes the master , which means the users will not notice any disruption of the service .
HAProxy is session - aware , which means you can use it with any web application that makes use of sessions ( such as forums , shopping carts , etc. ) .
From the HAProxy web site : " HAProxy is a free , very fast and reliable solution offering high availability , load balancing , and proxying for TCP and HTTP - based applications .
It is particularly suited for web sites crawling under very high loads while needing persistence or Layer7 processing .
Supporting tens of thousands of connections is clearly realistic with todays hardware .
Its mode of operation makes its integration into existing architectures very easy and riskless , while still offering the possibility not to expose fragile web servers to the Net . "
I do not issue any guarantee that this will work for you !
1 Preliminary Note
In this tutorial I will use the following hosts :
Load Balancer 1 : lb1.example.com , IP address : 192.168.0.100
, IP address : Load Balancer 2 : lb2.example.com , IP address : 192.168.0.101
, IP address : Web Server 1 : http1.example.com , IP address : 192.168.0.102
, IP address : Web Server 2 : http2.example.com , IP address : 192.168.0.103
, IP address :
We also need a virtual IP address that floats between lb1 and lb2 : 192.168.0.99
Here 's a little diagram that shows our setup :
shared IP=192.168.0.99
192.168.0.100 192.168.0.101 192.168.0.102 192.168.0.103

Wackamole Wackamole
Spread Spread
The shared ( virtual ) IP address is no problem as long as you 're in your own LAN where you can assign IP addresses as you like .
However , if you want to use this setup with public IP addresses , you need to find a hoster where you can rent two servers ( the load balancer nodes ) in the same subnet ; you can then use a free IP address in this subnet for the virtual IP address .
http1 and http2 are standard Debian Etch Apache setups with the document root / var / www ( the configuration of this default vhost is stored in /etc / apache2/ sites - available / default ) .
If your document root differs , you might have to adjust this guide a bit .
To make HAProxy session - aware , I 'm assuming that the web application that is installed on http1 and http2 uses the session id JSESSIONID .
2 Preparing The Backend Web Servers
We will configure HAProxy as a transparent proxy , i.e. , it will pass on the original user 's IP address in a field called X - Forwarded - For to the backend web servers .
Of course , the backend web servers should log the original user 's IP address in their access logs instead of the IP addresses of our load balancers .
Therefore we must modify the LogFormat line in /etc / apache2/apache2.conf and replace %h with % {X - Forwarded - For}i :
http1/http2 :
vi /etc/ apache2/apache2.conf
[...]
# LogFormat " %h %l %u %t \ " %r\ " %>s %b \ " %{ Referer}i\ " \ " %{ User - Agent}i\ " " combined LogFormat " % {X - Forwarded - For}i %l %u %t \ " %r\ " %>s %b \ " %{ Referer}i\ " \ " %{ User - Agent}i\ " " combined [...]
Also , we will configure HAProxy to check the backend servers ' health by continuously requesting the file check .
txt ( translates to /var/www/check.txt if / var / www is your document root ) from the backend servers .
Of course , these requests would totally bloat the access logs and mess up your page view statistics ( if you use a tool like Webalizer or AWstats that generates statistics based on the access logs ) .
Therefore we open our vhost configuration ( in this example it's in /etc / apache2/ sites - available / default ) and put these two lines into it ( comment out all other CustomLog directives in your vhost configuration ) :
vi /etc/apache2/sites-available / default
[...]
SetEnvIf Request_URI " ^/check\.txt $ " dontlog CustomLog /var/log/apache2/access.log combined env=!dontlog [...]
This configuration prevents that requests to check .
txt get logged in Apache 's access log .
Afterwards we restart Apache :
/etc/init.d/apache2 restart
... and create the file check .
txt ( this can be an empty file ) :
touch /var/www/check.txt
We are finished already with the backend servers ; the rest of the configuration happens on the two load balancer nodes .

3 Installing HAProxy
Unfortunately HAProxy is available as a Debian package for Debian Lenny ( testing ) and Sid ( unstable ) , but not for Etch .
Therefore we will install the HAProxy package from Lenny .
To do this , open /etc/apt/sources.list and add the line deb
http://ftp2.de.debian.org/debian/
lenny main ; your /etc/apt/sources.list could then look like this :
lb1/lb2 :
vi /etc/apt/sources.list
deb http://ftp2.de.debian.org/debian/ etch main deb-src
http://ftp2.de.debian.org/debian/ etch main deb
http://ftp2.de.debian.org/debian/
lenny main deb
http://security.debian.org/
etch/updates main contrib deb-src
http://security.debian.org/
etch /updates main contrib
Of course ( in order not to mess up our system ) , we want to install packages from Lenny only if there 's no appropriate package from Etch - if there are packages from Etch and Lenny , we want to install the one from Etch .
To do this , we give packages from Etch a higher priority in / etc / apt / preferences :
vi /etc/apt/ preferences
Package : * Pin : release a=etch Pin-Priority : 700 Package : * Pin : release a=lenny Pin-Priority : 650
( The terms etch and lenny refer to the appropriate terms in /etc/apt/sources.list ; if you 're using stable and testing there , you must use stable and testing instead of etch and lenny in /etc / apt / preferences as well . )

Afterwards , we update our packages database :
apt - get update
( If you get an error like this one :
E : Dynamic MMap ran out of room
then open
/etc/apt/apt.conf ...
vi /etc/apt/apt.conf
... and add a line for APT :: Cache - Limit with a very high value , e.g. like this :
APT :: Cache - Limit " 100000000 " ;
Then run
apt - get update
again . )
Upgrade the installed packages :
apt - get upgrade
... and install HAProxy :
apt - get install haproxy
4 Configuring The Load Balancers
The HAProxy configuration is stored in /etc / haproxy / haproxy.cfg and is pretty straight - forward .
I wo n't explain all the directives here ; to learn more about all options , please read http://haproxy.1wt.eu/download/1.3/doc/haproxy-en.txt and http://haproxy.1wt.eu/download/1.2/doc/architecture.txt.Advertisement
We back up the original /etc / haproxy / haproxy.cfg and create a new one like this :
lb1/lb2 :
cp /etc/haproxy /haproxy.cfg
/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg_orig
cat / dev/null >
/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
vi /etc / haproxy / haproxy.cfg
global log 127.0.0.1 local0 log 127.0.0.1 local1 notice #log loghost local0 info maxconn 4096 # debug #quiet user haproxy group haproxy defaults log global mode http option httplog option dontlognull retries 3 redispatch maxconn 2000 contimeout 5000 clitimeout 50000 srvtimeout 50000 listen webfarm 192.168.0.99:80 mode http stats enable stats auth someuser : somepassword balance roundrobin cookie JSESSIONID prefix option httpclose option forwardfor option httpchk HEAD / check.txt HTTP /1.0 server webA 192.168.0.102:80 cookie
A check server webB 192.168.0.103:80 cookie B check
Afterwards , we set ENABLED to 1 in /etc / default / haproxy :
vi /etc / default / haproxy
WASHINGTON 
To rally support for his administration ’s economic recovery bill recently , President Obama invited about a dozen chief executives , seven of them from technology and energy companies , to the Oval Office .
Some of their industries ’ top lobbyists , meanwhile , gathered in another office where Jason Furman , a top White House economic adviser , delivered a private briefing for groups expected to benefit most from the stimulus bill .
While much of the sprawling $ 800 billion legislation consists of tax cuts and broad spending increases for existing programs , like $ 27 billion on highways and $ 8.4 billion on public transit , the biggest outlay on initiatives is essentially a technology industry wish list : in the Senate version , about $ 7 billion for expanding high - speed Internet access , some $ 20 billion for building a so - called smart grid power network and $ 20 billion for digitizing health records .
To many on K Street , the stimulus bill was the clearest guide to the new administration ’s closest friends in the business world .
What oil was to President Bush , some say , clean energy and technology are to the Obama White House .
It is thought the government may crack down on city bonuses
The leader of the Commons has asked the Equality Commission to examine City bonuses and rule whether they discriminate against women .
Harriet Harman told a Labour regional conference in Sheffield that men working in the finance sector are paid over 40 % more than women .
In her speech , Ms Harman described the bonus system as a " licence for unfairness and discrimination " .
She believes action must go beyond existing bans on board - level payouts .
Ms Harman said : " We do n't have to choose between a strong economy and fairness - we must have both .
And that includes fairness in the financial services sector .
" There is something rotten in the remuneration system of the banks and finance companies .
Men paying themselves millions of pounds of bonuses each - and then saying that they did n't know what was going on . "
She denounced what she called an " old - boys ' network " paying itself millions amid financial turmoil .
' Unfairness and discrimination ' " Half the employees in the finance sector are women .
Yet the men are paid 40 % more than the women employees .
There will be no board level bonuses in the banks where the public purse has stepped in to secure their future
Harriet Harman , leader of the Commons Announcing the inquiry , she added : " The discretionary bonus system is a licence for unfairness and discrimination .
" And is anyone any more going to justify a system which allows for the old boys ' network to fall back on a financial cushion of millions of pounds while helping cause the problems which make others struggle ? "
She added : " The Financial Services Authority ( FSA ) ... is also conducting a review into bonuses .
Because they will need to stop the bonus system encouraging those at the top taking risks with everyone else 's money .
" It 's right that those who 've left the RBS have done so without ' severance pay ' and that there will be no board level bonuses in the banks where the public purse has stepped in to secure their future . "
Payments cap
There is speculation banks are attempting to rush through bonuses for thousands of high - earning staff before an expected government crackdown .
This week Prime Minister Gordon Brown said any payments at Royal Bank of Scotland , which is now 68 % taxpayer - owned , must reflect the economic conditions and the bank 's performance .
US president Barack Obama has proposed a $ 500,000 ( £ 346,450 ) cap on payments to American bank executives who participated in the US bailout .
This has sparked speculation that a similar deal may be pending in the UK .

Needed : anti-Obi gestures
Today at tennis , after I made a hard point , my partner offered the Obama fist bump .
" I do n't do that , " I said , and I gave her a stern look .
It 's not the first time I 've run into Obamabots on the courts ; the game attracts argumentative , competitive types ( of which I may be one ) .
I did n't stop and lecture the O'Bot , because Wasting Indoor Court Time is a Sin .
I just high - fived her with my racquet , and went on playing .
I 'm into civil disobedience these days , now that we Right - Thinkers are in the minority , living in fear of Obamification .
In small ways , I resist .
1 ) I refuse to do the fist bump .
We Right Thinkers need our own hand jive , a nonverbal way to say , ‘ I'm Anti-Obi ' .
I 'm open to suggestions .
2 ) I turn His face around .
Whenever I 'm standing in line in a store , and find coverboy Obambi staring at me , I turn the offensive magazines around to face backwards .
During Inaugural week , there was commemorative ideoporn everywhere .
Obama market penetration has receded somewhat , but it 's still hard to visit a Target or a grocery store without having to look at The One .
By hiding His image , I may be slightly interfering with commerce , but if I can prevent one more person from being suckered into socialism , I 'll do it .
3 ) I send e-mails to mainstream media , urging them to wake up from their Kool - Aid stupor and report what 's going on .
Sometimes , I link AT essays , the ones where Larrey gets really wound up .
Living in the bluest of blue states , e-mailing my Congresspersons seems like a waste of time .
4 ) I have my talking points ready .
The best AT essays I collect in a Rhetorical Ammunition file .
If someone needs to hear what 's wrong with the deficit or with federalizing healthcare or with failing to support Israel , I can tell them .
The O'Bot I played tennis with today seemed like a Nice Person Who Just Does n't Get It .
There 's a lot of those types running around , a fact I believe is cause for Hope , because , while there 's no point in trying to talk politics with hard - cord left - wingers , Nice Person types will listen , and perhaps can be swayed .
If the Fist Bumper shows up next Monday , and asks why I do n't do the crypto - fascist hand jive , I 'll give her an earful .
5 ) I send my kids out armed with ideas .
They and some friends are co-founders of the Conservative Club at their high school , a public school of over three thousand students , most of them future O'voters .
The faculty is overwhelmingly liberal , to the extent the Conservative Club had trouble finding a sponsor .
A social studies teacher finally agreed to sign on as sponsor , although he said he does not share their views .
6 ) If there was a mass protest against the Porkulus bill about to be foisted upon us , I 'd go .
Even if it snowed .
What else can I do ?
BELMONT , Calif . —
During her 50 years of smoking , Edith Frederickson says , she has lit up in restaurants and bars , airplanes and trains , and indoors and out , all as part of a two - pack - a - day habit that she regrets not a bit .
But as of two weeks ago , Ms. Frederickson can no longer smoke in the one place she loves the most : her home .
Ms. Frederickson lives in an apartment in Belmont , Calif. , a quiet Silicon Valley city that is now home to perhaps the nation ’s strictest antismoking law , effectively outlawing lighting up in all apartment buildings .
“ I ’m absolutely outraged , ” said Ms. Frederickson , 72 , pulling on a Winston as she sat on a concrete slab outside her single - room apartment .
“ They ’re telling you how to live and what to do , and they ’re doing it right here in America . ”
And that the ban should have originated in her very building — a sleepy government - subsidized retirement complex called Bonnie Brae Terrace — is even more galling .
Indeed , according to city officials , a driving force behind the passage of the law was a group of retirees from the complex who lobbied the city to stop secondhand smoke from drifting into their apartments from the neighbors ’ places .
Fungi came on to land from the sea because their tiny light spores were so easily blown about by the wind .
They arrived at about the same time as the earliest plants started to grow on the shores .
Since then fungi have developed into a huge variety of life - forms , ranging from the smallest to the largest living things on Earth .
Small fungi are just one cell .
Yeast is an example , used in cooking all over the world to make bread .
It grows by using a process called fermentation , which converts sugar into alcohol and carbon dioxide .
Most fungi live underground .
They have elaborate networks of hairs , called hyphae , that gather together in clumps called mycelia .
A mushroom or toadstool , which most people think of as a fungus , is simply the fruit of the mycelium which occasionally pops up above the ground to spread spores so that it can reproduce .
Fungi can have massive mycelia .
In fact , the largest living thing on Earth today is a fungus .
Found recently in the American state of Michigan , this hairy beast stretches underground for over 5 km , and is estimated to weigh more than 10 tons .
It is also one of the Earth 's longest survivors , having lived for well over 1,500 years .

Fungi are the world 's ecological dustmen .
They process and digest dead and decaying matter , from the leaves on the ground to the dead skin in between your toes .
When human dustmen take away rubbish it is often just burned or thrown into a deep pit in the ground .
Nature 's dustmen , the fungi , not only rot away the dead rubbish of life , but turn it into materials rich in nutrients that fertilise plants and trees to help them grow .
Fungi are vital links in the Earth 's ongoing cycle of renewal – of life and death .
As so often in nature , different groups of living things team up to mutual benefit .
The fungus passes on some of the nutrients and water it gathers to the tree and in return the tree feeds the fungus with sugars produced by its leaves .
In this way the tree 's capacity for gathering water and nutrients is dramatically increased , and the fungus gets fed .
Sometimes a single fungus lives underground and attaches itself to many trees – so in this way the trees are actually connected together , linked up in a chain as if poised for a medieval dance .
This relationship is called mychorriza .
It has been estimated that 80 per cent of all flowering plants today have some sort of mutually beneficial relationship with underground fungi .
Scripting languages have been around pretty much since operating systems were built to stay resident — back to DOS JCL , and no I do n't mean that DOS .
I mean the Disk Operating System for the IBM 360 .
OS / 360 JCL , Digital 's various command line interpreters , UNIX shell scripts and awk all allowed more - or - less complicated programming to perform repetitive tasks .
Later , scripting languages like Rexx , Tcl and Perl gave script programmers more flexibility .
Still , the general assumption was that even a program that could be prototyped using a scripting language would need to be rewritten into a compiled language .
This assumption started breaking down in Web - based applications .
Many important , high - capacity Web systems were built with Perl or Tcl .
At the same time , scripting languages languages like Python and Ruby began to violate long - held prejudices .
Python and Ruby were clear , powerful , and new implementation techniques were making them increasingly efficient .
The result is that scripting languages occupy a greater and greater part of the programming landscape ; the potential for high productivity overcame many objections .
Still , scripting languages were n't used in two areas of programming : systems programming and commercial , installable , " shrink - wrapped " products .
Now those barriers have been broken as well .
Recently , I needed to build some new semantics around the Sun ZFS file system in order to prototype some new ideas .
Traditionally , I might have done this with C .
The existence of FUSE file systems in user space would simplify that .
With a FUSE file system , I could write those new components in C in a user application , at least .
At about the same time , though , I ran into a lovely Mac product called ExpanDrive .
ExpanDrive allows any remote system that is accessible through FTP or SFTP to be mounted on a Mac as if it were a native file system .
It 's a nice step up from most FTP tools .
With ExpanDrive , I simply remotely mount one of my websites as a file system ; I can copy , paste , edit and rename exactly as if it were my own local disk .
This led to reading Jeff Mancuso 's blog , he being one of the primary developers of ExpanDrive .
It turns out that ExpanDrive is very largely written in Python .
As Mancuso describes it :
We rewrote SftpDrive [ their windows product ] from top to bottom in Python , with a GUI in Objective - C .
It 's called ExpanDrive , and it took one third the time that SftpDrive took to develop .
We greatly leverage Python and and many open source projects — just like a web developer .
To minimize conflicts and to have the necessary control over the runtime environment , our build process extracts only the necessary bits from the full Python distribution and packages it into the .app .
...
We 're pushing out weekly updates which include more than just bug fixes .
ExpanDrive has been a breeze to maintain and extend and the core remains perfectly cross platform .
With this as inspiration , I tried the same thing myself .
By preference , I work on a Mac , and conveniently ZFS for Mac is a reasonably stable product .
MacFUSE , from some folks at Google , is easily available , and there exists a good Python binding to FUSE .
It took about a day 's effort to get them all installed and working together .
It then took only about another eight hours to have a full new file system , built on top of FUSE and ZFS , working on my desktop .
Two days later , I was demoing the system for CTOs and vice presidents .
This was n't a finished product ; in fact , I 'm still adding new features and exploring the possibilities .
This is made tremendously much easier because the important code is in Python : I edit the source , save the Python file , restart , and it 's running .
No compile , no complicated build ; as with writing a normal script , it 's nearly instant gratification .
What 's best is that the result is perfectly usable .
It 's not a " prototype " in any limiting sense ; it has all the functions I build and appears to the rest of the system as a normal component .
As with ExpanDrive , there is nothing about it to reveal that it 's really a " Python script . "
It 's just another way of building a system component — just one that happens to be dramatically more productive , more flexible and ( as a nice side effect ) most of it is platform independent .
This wo n't be the death of compiled languages .
Just as we still need to write assembly language programs sometimes , concerns about complexity , performance and security will still lead to writing programs in compiled languages for years to come .
But , with the ability to use Python to build custom programs , performing as operating system components , with all the advantages Python offers , it 's clear that Python — and by extension , other scripting languages — are not just for scripting any longer .
ROSE VALLEY , Sask .
–Native elders are recommending a Saskatchewan father serve a life sentence of spiritual guidance and healing instead of time behind bars for the freezing deaths of his two young girls .
During five hours of emotional discussion , most of the two dozen participants in a sentencing circle for Christopher Pauchay spoke of forgiveness and helping each other to move on .
" How can we begin a community healing if we are apart from one another – if he's not here with us ? " asked elder Howard Walker .
Walker said he has worked in jails across the country and believes Pauchay can only be rehabilitated at home .
" Every day you must think of your little girls – that 's punishment enough , " said elder Evelyn Burns .
A barely audible Pauchay tried several times to address the circle being held in the Rose Valley town hall close to his home on the Yellow Quill First Nation .
At first , the 25 - year - old managed to speak only briefly between sobs about how much he loved his girls and cared for them when they were sick .
" I 'll say sorry every day of my life , " he told the circle .
Later , raising his voice , he spoke about his third daughter , born a few months after the tragedy .
Social Services has since put her into foster care .
" That 's all I had left and you took her away .
My rights did n't matter , " Pauchay said .
His common - law wife , Tracey Jimmy , also spoke with anger about losing her new baby , named Miracle .
Jimmy said she 's also upset she can't see or talk to Pauchay because of a court restraining order .
Pauchay faces a further charge of domestic assault against her .
" He was just such a good dad .
I just love him and you guys are taking him away from me – the only person who can actually feel what I 'm feeling , " Jimmy said through tears , sitting across the circle from Pauchay .
" What kind of society is that ? "
It was January 2008 when Pauchay and Jimmy had an argument .
Jimmy went off drinking , and Pauchay was left at home to care for their two children .
In the middle of the night , during a freezing blizzard , he left home with his daughters and got lost as he stumbled drunk in the snow .
Kaydance , 3 , and Santana , 15 months , were found hours later buried under snowdrifts .
They were wearing only diapers and T - shirts .
Pauchay pleaded guilty in November to criminal negligence causing death .
His lawyer told the court he does n't remember much of what happened that night .
Provincial court Judge Barry Morgan , who also sat in the circle , said he can't promise he will follow the recommendations but will consider them closely .
" What I have to do is balance a number of things , " Morgan said .
``I promise I will do my best with that . "
Morgan said he will give his final sentencing decision on March 6 .
The Crown , comparing the case to child abuse , has already indicated it wants Pauchay to serve 2 1 / 2 to five years in prison .
The defence believes he has suffered enough and should receive a conditional sentence .
" Regardless of what happens as a result of this process , the community of Yellow Quill will continue to support Chris and Tracey , " Chief Larry Cachene later told reporters .
He would n't say whether he supports a community sentence but said aboriginal people regularly fail when they enter the justice system .

" Rarely do they find healing and rehabilitation . "
Raj Hartharamini , a mental health worker on the reserve , outlined a plan for a community sentence that would see both Pauchay and Jimmy enter rehabilitation programs for their drinking problems .
He said a team of volunteers would also be on - call 24 - hours a day to help support Pauchay , and the reserve would offer programs for parenting and life skills .
Pauchay 's stepmother , Jo Anne Machiskinic , said she 's angry that the two girls had to die before people started to face their drinking problems on the reserve .
" I felt at the time why does it always take something this bad to make people open their eyes . "
But Machiskinic said she 's not mad at Pauchay because he never intended such a horrible thing to happen .
In fact , she added , the community is very worried about his depression .
Court has heard Pauchay was trying to stay sober after the death of his girls , but last month he was arrested for allegedly breaching conditions of his bail by drinking .
Because he is still in custody , he was taken to the circle by RCMP officers , who continued to sit behind him through the process .
Another 60 observers sat listening to the circle 's discussion , often sniffling and passing around boxes of tissues .
Several elders said if anything good can come from the tragedy , they hope it is a wake - up call for people to quit drinking .
Walker told the circle he stopped drinking years ago because he could never guarantee the outcome of his behaviour .
He said Pauchay must do the same .
Pauchay 's uncle , elder Francis Nippi , said jail should only be used for animals .
He suggested Pauchay can get more help in his community .
" Release him to these elders and have him serve these elders , " Nippi said .
The sentencing circle is a traditional form of restorative justice designed to help aboriginals heal and feel more connected to the courts .
After everyone has had a say , participants recommend punishment .
The judge may agree or impose a sentence of his own .
Pauchay 's case is one of the most high - profile in the country to be given such treatment .
Seeing crash reports can worsen flying phobia Story Highlights
10 percent to 25 percent of the U.S. population experiences the phobia of flying
Fear can be exacerbated by watching reports of other crashes
Average age of onset of such phobias is 27
Relaxation , meditation , breathing skills can improve the chances of beating fear
( CNN ) --
When she heard news of the Continental Airlines plane that plunged into a house in suburban Buffalo , New York , on Thursday night , killing 50 people , Jenny Gomez experienced a familiar feeling creep deep within her psyche .
" It definitely sparked those old feelings of anxiety , " she said .
Gomez , 31 and a mother of two , was never afraid to fly during her childhood and early adolescence .
" I had flown all my life since I was very small , getting on a plane to visit my grandparents at least a couple of times a year , and I was fine , " she remembered .
Then , in her late adolescence , the panicky feelings began , slowly at first , but then the anxiety and nervousness started to snowball .
" Every bump , every shake of the plane would set me off . "
Finally , during a college psychology class , she realized she fit the classic criteria for someone with a fear of flying , also known as aviophobia or aviatophobia .
For five years , Gomez avoided flying altogether .
" I missed out on some really cool things in my life back then because I would n't get on an airplane , " she said .
An estimated 10 percent to 25 percent of the U.S. population experiences the phobia of flying , according to the American Psychological Association .
View a timeline of recent notable crashes »
In contrast , the risk of dying in a domestic jet crash has been estimated to be one in 70 million , according to MIT statistician Arnold Barnett , who has performed statistical analyses for the Federal Aviation Administration .
Among the causes for aviatophobia is what many will experience as a result of seeing reports about the crash near Buffalo : vicarious trauma .
This is trauma that one observes and subsequently develops within based on that observation .
" They see it , and they imagine what would that be like if it happened to me , " said anxiety disorder psychologist R. Reid Wilson .
By focusing on the possibility instead of the actual probability of the plane crashing , someone who 's vulnerable to such fears can grow even more anxious about flying , he said .
The fear of flying constitutes one of the two most common fears humans grapple with ( the other one being fear of public speaking ) , said Wilson , who served as lead psychologist for American Airlines ' first national program for fear of flying .
Gomez 's development of the phobia later in life is not unusual either , Wilson said ; the average age of onset is 27 , which is relatively old compared with when most other phobias begin .
Some people who are subject to vicarious trauma actually see the crash scene in the media and actively put themselves in the scenario .
Wilson has seen patients who fixate on visualizing themselves in the plane and who go so far as to seek out information such as how long the plane fell through the sky so they can intensify the reality of the experience in their minds .
" They get wrapped up in what is actually happening .
Your body reacts to what you 're seeing , " he said .
Another cause of the condition is the perception of a non-dangerous event -- such as turbulence or normal sounds that planes make -- as being an actual threat to one 's safety .
Many people afraid to fly actually have panic disorder , which is an anxiety disorder characterized by unexpected and repeated episodes of intense fear accompanied by physical symptoms .
Having what Wilson refers to as a " constellation of other fears " could also contribute to the phobia of flying ; claustrophobia , fear of death and being afraid of turning control over to the pilot could all contribute to the ultimate fear of the not - so - friendly skies .
Visit CNNhealth.com , your connection for better living Overcoming the fear of flying begins with a solid trust in the aviation industry and the ability of the plane , the pilot and everyone involved in the safety of the flight to be competent .
" If it 's about someone else , then you have no control , but if you shift your feelings of fear to yourself , then you can do something about it , " Wilson said .
Relaxation , meditation and breathing skills can improve the chances of surmounting one 's distress .
Distractions , such as having someone to talk to on the plane or focusing on an engrossing book , can also work to ease the tension .
However , changing one 's mind about the extreme unlikelihood that something would go wrong is key ; relaxation and distractions serve as additional support systems .
A licensed mental health professional can aid individuals seeking help to beat the fear of flying .
Hypnotism can work too , especially when administered by someone trained in anxiety disorders .
Virtual reality therapy , wherein a helmet is worn to simulate the experience of flying , has also been proved an effective technique , but the institutions providing virtual reality therapies are few and far between .
In 2005 , Gomez reached a crossroads .
Her new job description would require her to travel frequently .
A licensed counselor herself , she knew she could avail the services of a specialist to help her get past her fears .
Perhaps the most useful part of her course of therapy , she reveals , was developing an understanding of the science behind aviation .
" If I was sitting in the cockpit , I would have had no problems at all .
It 's the lack of control , sitting in the back of the plane , that would get to me , so when I learned what all the sounds were and how unlikely it would be that the plane would actually fall out of the sky , that 's what really helped me . "
Another aid that worked for Gomez was Xanax , a drug often prescribed by doctors to provide temporary relief from the stress of flying .
Working as a mild tranquilizer , Xanax , Valium and other benzodiazepine class drugs do not remove the underlying fear but instead work to dull the sensations .
When Gomez finally started to fly again , she began with Xanax , a glass of wine and a meditation CD that she would listen to during the entire flight .
Her anxiety progressively subsided over the course of a year and a half of regular flying for work .
" With each successful flight , I would need less and less help from the pills or the wine , " she said .
Finally , she let go of the medication and alcohol altogether and allowed her sense of trust to keep her calm .
All AboutStress
( Charles Platt is a guest blogger )
To what extent do we feel overcrowded , as a species ?
I 'm not talking about resources ; just psychological factors .
To create this chart I turned to the CIA Factbook , where I looked up the populations of various nations and then divided this number into their land area ( excluding lakes and rivers ) to get the number of square feet available per person .
I represented the results in squares that are all drawn to the same scale .
Of course if you are in Australia , where each resident has almost 4 million square feet to play with , you wo n't make full use of your land ration , if only because most of it is desert .
On the other hand , when I was in Australia I did feel intuitively aware that the country was , so to speak , empty .
As soon as I drove out of an urban area , the emptiness was right there .
Conversely , in Hong Kong , where citizens have barely more than 1,600 square feet each , everyone is intensely aware of being crammed into a very crowded place .
Personally I enjoy wilderness areas , but I would n't claim that open spaces are essential for my mental health .
I do , after all , still have an apartment in New York City containing just 350 square feet .
The apartment next to mine , identical in size , used to be a home not only to a married couple , but also their young child .
I suspect that our romantic yearnings for “ freedom to roam ” may be just that : Romantic yearnings .
“ One of the ordinary modes , by which tyrants accomplish their purposes without resistance , is , by disarming the people , and making it an offense to keep arms . ”
~ Constitutional scholar and Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story
I was somewhat surprised in the email responses to my article here at the number of inquiries from would be first - time gun purchasers asking for advice on firearm selection , training and concealed carry permits .
Obviously there are many in the freedom crowd out there who has yet to arm themselves .
I believe that many first - time gun buyers have a tendency to put the cart before the horse .
Many long - time gun owners fit in the same category .
Before one purchases a firearm for defense of life and property , it is imperative they realize one must first possess the courage to use this tool of liberty , up to and including deadly force .
The firearm should never be the source of that courage .
An inanimate object is a poor substitute for character .
True courage is in short supply in this nation ’s gun culture .
Supposed strong advocates of the Second Amendment routinely vote for politicians with anti-gun voting records because they are members of their chosen political party .
Authors of books on the rights of citizens to keep and bear arms routinely vote for the same anti-gun politicians .
One in particular emailed me that he could not support Ron Paul in the 2008 election because he was " unelectable . "
This author then spoke of having to " hold his nose " when he voted for John McCain .
Great courage , this one !
The majority of gun magazines routinely carry many more articles on firearms for " military and police " than they do for Joe Citizen .
An editor for one of these magazines chastised me in an email for having the audacity to suggest his publication support Ron Paul for president because he too saw him as " unelectable . "
He opined that those who would vote for Ron Paul were actually helping the greater of two evils get elected .
When I asked him whom he would vote for if his choices were Stalin or Hitler , he replied that it would never come to that in America .
I promptly cancelled my subscription to his magazine .
Cowardice and ignorance in the same package is hard to support .
Then there are those bastions of liberty in the pro-gun crowd who question why anyone would want to own an AK - 47 or any other of those dastardly assault weapons .
They contend there is no " legitimate " reason to own one .
Let me make this as simple as I can : I own a legal AK - 47 and several other assault weapons so I can assault the tyrant who seeks to deprive me of my rights granted by my creator , or any other criminal who attempts to take that which is mine , or harm me and those I love .
Simple enough ?
From past experience I know I am going to catch a lot of flak for my opinion of concealed carry laws , because I believe them to be another form of registration .
Gun owners who claim they are totally against " registration " of firearms have no problem in registering themselves as gun owners .
Most egregious is their paying the state to bestow on them the rights they already possess as free men .
If the true purpose of the Second Amendment is to provide the means to resist a tyrannical government , where is the logic in begging and paying that same government to allow us to possess the weapons to protect ourselves from their tyrannical pursuits ?
Groveling at the feet of tyrants is no reflection of courage .
Not only do concealed carry permit holders place themselves in a database available to all bureaucrats whose goal is to disarm everyone , they place themselves in the database of all law enforcement agencies .
How convenient it must be for the cop who runs your drivers or vehicle license number to immediately know you are armed , what you drive , where you live , and in some cases , what type firearm you have .
Next on my list of things to anger the average gun guy is my total disdain for the organization that presents itself as the true champion of the right to keep and bear arms : the NRA , better known as the National Republican Association — Oops , sorry , National Rifle Association .
Author and American Patriot L. Neil Smith , eloquently states his reasons for not trusting the NRA here .
If you are a potential owner of a new firearm , or possess several , please reexamine your commitment to liberty or give your weapons to a true patriot now rather than the tyrant when he comes for them .
Guard with jealous attention the public liberty .
Suspect everyone who comes near that precious jewel .
Unfortunately , nothing will preserve it but downright force .
When you give up that force , you are ruined .

I think the case actually could be made that this is a
patent of a valid type , as it does meet the transformative
requirement of a software patent ( specifically it makes a
file or directory normally only accessible by 32 bit
systems also accessible by 16 bit ones . )
However , I think Microsoft is going to lose this claim for
a completely different reason : prior art .
Now , my old
Macintosh is not running , but when you used it to format PC
floppy disks , it was capable of doing it in a way that
allowed the Mac to see the original Macintosh file names
and resource fork , and provided an 8 and 3 stub name to a
PC .
They released this in 1992 .

One of the patents , the " Method and system for generating driving directions " is described at
www.google .com/patents?id=Xzt4AAAAEBAJ&dq=7,054,745 .
That patent sounds very basic , an algorithm which tells a driver where to drive :
A method and system for generating driving directions composes computer - based instructions that emulate a human driving perspective .
Language - based instructions guide a driver along a route that encompasses a sequence of roads and intersections .
An algorithm applies rules based on human perception to route components .
The algorithm diagnoses road name changes so that instructions are clear and concise .
The algorithm analyzes road and intersection geometry at confusing areas , such as road forks , roundabouts , ferry crossings , cloverleaf interchanges , and ramps , to generate instructions that conform to a driver 's natural perspective .
The algorithm analyzes the configuration of an intersection with respect to a driver 's field of view to compose a clear and concise instruction .
When appropriate , the algorithm produces compound instructions for adjacent intersections .
I do n't know how relevant prior art may be or if the example below is that .
Anyhow , the service Map24 has been online for more than eight years , i.e. three years prior to the Microsoft filing date
Patent number : 7054745
Filing date : Sep 3 , 2003
Issue date : May 30 , 2006

Microsoft is not interested in acting legally or illegally .
They are just
interested in dominating the market .
If you look at their past pattern from the ' 80s on , they run a fowl of the law ,
get sued and frequently loose the legal case .
But by the time the courts have
finished , who cares about loosing the legal battle .
The competition has
effectively withered and died .
Now a slight twist .
Base your product on Linux and get sued by Microsoft for
patten infringement .
They do n't care if they win .
By the time the courts have
finished , your business is gone .
Do this enough times , and new products are
very unlikely to be based on Linux .
No one wants to risk being sued for patten
infringement .
So what if a few pattens get invalidated .
They have lots .
They can sue 10
companies per month for many years and still not run out of pattens , although I
suspect they will only start actions against a few a year .

Microsoft has been known in the past to have smart lawyers .
I 'm less sure about
management 's willingness to listen , but that 's another issue .
I do n't have the background to make an informed opinion on the merits of the
claims here .
My suspicion is that MS has chosen what they think may be a strong
case with the intention of limiting the damage done by Bilski .
I do n't see this
a a prime case in itself but as a means to shore up other patents in the
portfolio [ Reply to This | # ]

It 's surprising to me that MS was able to patent the concept of installing a
computer into the dashboard of a car , and networking it to other car systems .
Perhaps the particular * application * is novel , but the concept of distributed
computing was well known at the time ( 1999 ) , as was embedded computing ( since
other processors in the car are mentioned in the patent ) .
The patent for a wireless connected car computer in 1999 is also surprising .
Since it 's pretty clear that the wireless connectivity they were talking about
is an add - on , and since wireless cards for PCs were generally available at the
time , how does combining a PC ( installed in a car ) and a wireless interface
become " novel and not obvious " ?
Are n't these patents too obvious ?
Except for the cost involved , it would have
been easy to disassemble a laptop and remount it in a car in 1999 .
The only
other novel idea was running all the car systems off the same computer ... again ,
the issue that kept people from doing that was not that they did n't think of
it , . the processors and operating systems at the time were n't up to the task
( but they 're patenting the * idea * of a car computer , not its actual design ) ...
... and , saving the best for last : the patent actually suggests ( the real - time
version of ? )
Win95 or WinNT as the OS to run the whole show ; security , audio ,
speed control , climate control , etc .
Maybe NT could have handled it on a 500
MHz P3 , but I shudder to think about using Win95 and getting a blue screen when
I try to shut off cruise control ! [ Reply to This | # ]

Well , I 'd like to share references to VFAT ( FAT32 ) in the Linux kernel .
First , about naming conventions :
It seems to me that what is called FAT32 in the DOS / Windows world is called VFAT in the Linux world .
I believe there is a slight technical difference that does not matter in practice .
FAT32 technically describes the size of the FS , and VFAT describes the ' virtual ' long file naming capability .
In practice both capabilities are assumed whether one says ' VFAT ' or ' FAT32 ' .
( I hope and expect others to correct this post where I 'm incorrect and to expand on it . )
In the 2.6.26 kernel ( current in Debian Sid/ Unstable ) , the VFAT in Linux is documented at /usr / src/ linux / Documentation / filesystems / vfat.txt
The document can be found online for example at vfat.
txt .
If I 'm understanding my research correctly , the source code to VFAT has been moved in the kernel tree very recently in the 2.6.28 kernel .
It was at linux / fs / vfat / namei.c ( under /usr / src ) prior to November 2008 , now it is at linux / fs/ fat/namei_vfat .c .
The file can be seen as a patch ( because the whole file was removed from one place an added to another ) at namei_vfat .c .
Note that much of Linux is documented in the source code , and that is why I post this .
For those unaware comments in C source start with /* and end with */.
In particular , this comment is in the source ( from 2.6.26 ) ( e- mail addresses redacted by me ) : /*
* linux / fs/vfat/namei.c
*
* Written 1992,1993 by Werner Almesberger
*
* Windows95 / Windows NT compatible extended MSDOS filesystem
* by Gordon Chaffee Copyright ( C ) 1995 .
Send bug reports for the
* VFAT filesystem to [ redacted ] .
Specify
* what file operation caused you trouble and if you can duplicate
* the problem , send a script that demonstrates it .
*
* Short name translation 1999 , 2001 by Wolfram Pienkoss [ redacted ]
*
* Support Multibyte characters and cleanup by
* OGAWA Hirofumi [ redacted ]
*/
Linux ' " DOS FAT " support is implemented as a module stack , that I know of these modules are involved : vfat , fat , msdos , nls_base , nls_utf8 , nls_cp437 and probably nls_* ( everything nls ) .
Note NLS is just a naming system , it stands for National ( or Native ) Language Support .
In my experience , vfat is not compiled into the kernel but instead as a kernel module .
The reason for this as I understand it , is that it is not native to Linux and not needed early in the typical boot .
I think this might be different in embedded systems ; they are not my specialty though .
Note that the source code file for VFAT ( namei.c in kernel 2.6.26 ) is just 24,341 bytes long .
The actual vfat module occupies 14,976 bytes of memory in Debian Sid kernel 2.6.26-1-amd64 and 13,377 bytes of memory in Fedora 8 kernel 2.6.26.8-57.fc8 .
This is a very tiny amount of code , in my opinion .
I also noted that Debian seems to load the vfat module by default , making it part of their typical default install .
Not sure about Fedora though , it was loaded when I checked , but I 've been messing with SD cards and USB sticks on that system , so it may have gotten loaded then .

Just a quick look through and about the only one I can't think of prior art or
obviousness for might be claim 8 . I have not dug in to the exact patents but the
names all cover obvious old ideas , as 70s , 80s old .

The patent " 7,117,286 :  Portable Computing Device - integrated Appliance  is described at :
www.google .com/patents?id=K_N6AAAAEBAJ&dq=7,117,286
and reads :
In accordance with one aspect , a portable computing device determines a type of an appliance in which the portable computing device is docked .
The portable computing device identifies , based on the type of the appliance , a user interface configuration for the portable computing device , and configures the user interface of the portable computing device in accordance with the identified user interface configuration .
In accordance with another aspect , a car stereo includes a docking station into which an off - the - shelf handheld computer can be docked .
The car stereo also includes an input / output ( I/O ) component that allows the car stereo to communicate with the handheld computer when the handheld computer is docked in the docking station of the car stereo .
In accordance with another aspect , an appliance in which a portable computing device can be docked is an integrated vehicle stereo and portable computing device docking station .
As I interpret it , it is about a changing GUI interface when you move the display from one gadget to another .
Patent number : 7117286
Filing date : Oct 11 , 2005
Issue date : Oct 3 , 2006
I am not sure if prior art applies here , but to me it sounds very much like the FlukeView interface which changes depending on gadget connected .
FlukeView is developed by Fluke and is an adaptable GUI for multimeter tools .
The FlueView has been around since 1999 , according to
us.fluke.com/usen/produc ts/FVFHistory.htm
If I understood it correctly , the FlukeView is used on a portable computing device , e.g. a laptop , together with a multimeter .
Here are some features :
Expand the power of the world 's most rugged , accurate handheld test tools with FlukeView® Forms Documenting Software .
To address the increasing demands for reporting and documentation , Fluke presents FlukeView Forms documenting software .
FlukeView Forms increases the power of your Fluke tool by enabling you to document , store and analyze individual readings or series of measurements , then convert them into professional - looking documents .
Several versions of the product are available , depending upon the type of cable needed to download data from your instrument and depending upon the data reporting capability you need .
FlukeView Forms offers two levels of capability : FlukeView Forms Basic , and FlukeView Forms plus Designer .
FlukeView Forms Basic can be used alone to download measurement data and create reports that can be saved and printed .
FlukeView Forms plus Designer allows a user to edit an existing form or create a new form to customize the report to individual needs .
A common edit might add a company logo and title .
See the [ Features ] tab on this page for more information .

This line from the ITC complaint sounds so familiar .
15 . Microsoft 's continued success depends largely on its ability to establisch , maintain ,
and protecht uts proprietary technology through , inter alia , enforcement of its patent rights .
As we all know 99 % of microsofts patents are on software ,
looks and feel written down as business practices and hot air .
So after Bilski we can read this line as : 15 .
Microsoft 's can not continue its success because it depends largely on its ability to establisch , maintain ,
and protecht its proprietary technology through , inter alia , enforcement of its patent rights .

linux umsdos also did long to short filename mapping .
It was in the Linux kernel from 1992 to 2008 .
Also Wordperfect 5.1 for DOS did this in 1989 ( and perhaps in earlier

Patent 6,704,032 :  Methods and Arrangements for Interacting with Controllable Objects within a Graphical User Interface Environment Using Various Input Mechanisms  can be read at :
www.google .com/patents?id=zb0QAAAAEBAJ&dq=6,704,032
and reads :
Improved methods and arrangements provide user interface platforms that are capable of meeting the unique requirements of manufacturers , while also advantageously supporting the development of independently designed software applications .
In accordance with certain aspects of the present invention , methods and arrangements are provided whereby certain key events are defined and operatively associated with the hardware suite .
These key events , which are essentially virtual events , can be invoked or otherwise implemented by the manufacturers and independent software vendor ( ISV ) applications .
These key events are categorized as being either determinate events or indeterminate events , and their functionality can be based on different behavior models .
The behavior models consider the notion that the user interface will most likely include various focusing ( e.g. , function selection ) and / or editing ( e.g. , parameter modifying ) capabilities .
As such , the methods and arrangements can ...
As I interpret that patent , it is in part about how to simulate " real buttons " with " virtual buttons " yet controlled by " real buttons " .
Some basic facts of the patent are :
Filing date : Oct 27 , 2000
Issue date : Mar 9 , 2004
One group of software which commonly simulate various types of buttons is music programs .
Here one can mention CakeWalk as example , as it has been around for a long time :
web.archive.org/web/*/www.c akewalk.com
where the oldest version is from 1996 .
Cubase is another program which use a zillion virtual buttons and developed by Steinberg :
http://web.archive.org/web/*/www.steinberg.net
At first sight , I think both these programs are prior art regarding the patent described above .

I get the impression from the article by By Erika Morphy that the attack is from a slightly different angle .
Take a couple of quotes : Microsoft is seeking " to obtain an exclusionary order barring the importation of TomTom devices at our border , " he said .
Microsoft 's Gutierrez , for his part , has told reporters that the filings are not targeting Linux technology per se , but rather the manner in which TomTom has used it .
Considering the Bilkski decision has a requirement to have a patent " tied to a particular device " , it seems to me , the focus of MS ' target is not Linux ( although I 'm sure they 'd love to target that ) , but the TomTom device itself .
I wonder if MS would have even bothered if TomTom created the device , modified an appropriate version ( or simply put together the correct packages ) and made it available for download .
In short : Instead of TomTom creating the device and importing it into the US with all the software installed !
They : Created the device importing it into the US without software .
Then the software was added in the US by the customer .
MS would n't be able to target the device anymore , they 'd have to target Linux directly .
Second hunch : it 's the combination of software on the device Microsoft does n't like .
Whether it's the combination or specific software , Microsoft seems to be directly targeting the device to indirectly target Linux .
I wonder if TomTom can use the fact that MS ' patents are not actually attached to a device to have themselves declared safe .
Either way , with the angle of the attack being trade , it does n't appear TomTom has that much time unless they can get a Judge to have anything else put on hold while s/he makes a ruling on the validity of the Microsoft patents .

Vehicle computer system with wireless internet connectivity ...
A computer is mounted within the housing and executes an open platform , multi-tasking , operating system .
Since when has Microsoft ever had an " open platform " of any kind .
In my opinion those words are custom tailored for Linux .
Why would they ever say " open " when dealing with a profit motivation with a proprietary software operating system as their core business model ?
I do n't know a whole lot about the patent business but I notice a little " B1 " right after the patent number , which I might suspect is some kind of revision number .
What are the odds that the word " open " was added in the last revision ?

Patent 6202008 vs M$ - Authored by : Anonymous on Thursday , February 26 2009 @ 09:33 PM

Authored by : Anonymous on Thursday , February 26 2009 @ 09:59 PM EST
I 'm sure that M$ weighed the issue of Bliski when this complaint was filed .
I
personally think that this is the first many nuisance suits that M$ will file
against Linux and Open Source applications .
Though , the M$ complaint will
provide some FUD value it also provides a distraction from other M$ more
immediate plans to roll out Win7 and Silverlight .
What a coincidence that the timing is mere hours after M$ 's announcement to
provide computer training - using the M$ Silverlight web presentation algorithm
- to federal and several state governments .
Ah , state sanctioned support of a
proprietary non-standard web presentation algorithm , what a sweet plum that
would be .

Again , with working link .... ( sorry , but the comment editor is not really good )
It might have been posted already , but even then , one can not mention it too often : MS ' claims with regard to FAT are a toothless tiger at least here in Europe as they already fell flat on their stomach when they tried to intimidate German competitors with this .
Here is a more detailed explanation that might be convenient for American lawyers , and the full text of the verdict .
Please spread this to other places as this might be helpful in this and the other cases that will follow and might convince als American judges outside Texas ... [ Reply to This | # ]

From the Heise link : Federal Patent Court declares FAT patent of Microsoft null and void Since December 2003 the software heavyweight has been offering FAT file system licenses , which range in price from 25 US cents per unit to a maximum one - off payment of 250,000 US dollars per manufacturer / vendor .
By purchasing the license the licensees acquire permission to format storage media such as flash memory systems with the file system and apply the protected technology .
This patent must be a real cash cow !
This means that MS controls much of the Flash memory market as every producer of a controller active in the USA must get an MS license .
A license that could , eg , have conditions to harm competitors .

These are the claims from the 5,579,517 Microsoft long file name patent , which
is only 1 of 8 patents involved in the TomTom suit .
Most of the others are
related to computers in cars .
As you can plainly see , the claims are tightly tied to a machine .
Accordingly , they clearly meet the requirements of the MACHINE OR Transformation
test decreed in Bilski .
If you look at enough Microsoft claims , you 'll soon see that they are all tied
to machine .
It 's as if they have been anticipating Bilski for 20 years ....

The US patent " 6,202,008 - Vehicle computer system with wireless internet connectivity " is described at :
www.google .com/patents?id=crt7AAAAEBAJ&dq=6,202,008
and is summarized as :
A vehicle computer system has a housing sized to be mounted in a vehicle dashboard or other appropriate location .
A computer is mounted within the housing and executes an open platform , multi-tasking operating system .
The computer runs multiple applications on the operating system , including both vehicle - related applications ( e.g. , vehicle security application , vehicle diagnostics application , communications application , etc. ) and non-vehicle - related applications ( e.g. , entertainment application , word processing , etc. ) .
The computer system has an Internet wireless link to provide access to the Internet .
One or more of the applications may utilize the link to access content on the Internet .
some facts about the patent :
Patent number : 6202008
Filing date : Sep 10 , 1999
Issue date : Mar 13 , 2001
There are many prophets in the world , and the submitters are not necessarily among them .
But George Gilder may be one of them .
The quote below is from a web page at :
www.seas.upenn.edu/~gaj1/in ventgg.html
and titled " INVENTING THE INTERNET AGAIN " .
The page is described as follows :
This series of articles by George Gilder provides some interesting technological and cultural background that helps prepare readers to better understand and place in proper perspective the events relative to the National Data Super Highway , which are unfolding almost daily in the national press .
I contacted the author and Forbes and as the preface below indicates obtained permission to post on the Internet .
Please note that the preface to this article and all footnotes must be included when cross posting or uploading this article .
The following article , INVENTING THE INTERNET AGAIN , was first published in Forbes ASAP , June 2 , 1997 .
It is a portion of George Gilder 's book , Telecosm , which will be published in 1997 by Simon & Schuster , as a sequel to Microcosm , published in 1989 and Life After Television published by Norton in 1992 .
Subsequent chapters of Telecosm will be serialized in Forbes ASAP .
According to Web - Counter , this article has been accessed times since June 23,1997 .
While I have n't seen the book Telecosm , the web page itself predates any filing dates of the patent .
And , what I find most interesting is a paragraph in the middle of the article , where I have underlined the most intriguing part in an excerpt :
Going over the cliff of costs , the industry can introduce radically new products .
We have just undergone the epoch of the personal computer , climaxing in 1996 with PCs outselling TVs in units for the first time .
We are now entering a new era when a new form of PC will be dominant .
It may not do Windows , but it will do doors .
Tetherlessly transcending most of the limitations of the current PC era , the most common PC will be a digital cellular phone .
It will be a dataphone , as faithful readers of these pages will know .
It will be as portable as your watch and as personal as your wallet .
It will recognize speech and convert it to text .
It will plug into a slot in your car and help you navigate streets .
It will consult electronic yellow pages and give directions to the nearest gas station , restaurant , police headquarters , or hotel .
It will collect your news and your mail and , if you wish , it will read them to you .
It will conduct transactions and load credit into a credit chip on a smart card , which can be used like cash .
It can pay your taxes , or help you avoid them , or soothe you with soft music as you do your calculus homework .
It will take digital pictures and project them onto a wall or screen , or dispatch them to any other dataphone or computer .
It will have an Internet address and a Java run-time engine that allows it to execute any applet or program written in that increasingly universal language .
Or it will dock in a more powerful machine to perform more demanding functions .
It will link to any compatible display , monitor , keyboard , storage device , or other peripheral through infrared pulses or radio frequencies .
And , oh yes , it will unlock your front door or car door , open your garage door , or even play Jim Morrison songs , if you are old enough to care for those swinging Doors of the 1960s ( amazingly enough , my teenage daughters do ) .
Sorry , though , Nokia , your model 9000 , which comes closest today to this new machine , will not cut it , at least in the United States , because it is based on Europe 's increasingly obsolescent GSM standard .
Also offering the right form factor but the wrong access standard is the IBM - BellSouth Simon , which is based on the U.S. analog cellular system ( AMPS ) or CDPD ( cellular digital packet data ) .
The most common PC will not be a GSM or CDPD device , because it will soon need to provide bandwidth on demand while draining the lowest possible power , whenever it is not plugged in .
Thus the first PC of the new paradigm will probably have to be CDMA , built from the bottom up to provide bandwidth on demand , according to TCP / IP Internet standards , at a handful of milliwatts of communications power .
While I have n't yet read all of it , I think this as close to a blueprint you can come .
And , above all , it predates the filing of the patent with at least two years .
There are numerous versions of the webpage as listed by www.archive.org.
The oldest archived is from 31 July 1997 .

Just an idea .
Before I start , I do n't have a TomTom or Garmin ( although I have used / borrowed one ) so take this with a pinch of salt .
Why not format the flash as EXT2 ?
I have done this myself ( for embedded applications ) as this gets around the stupid 2GB limit of FAT32 .
This would allow TomTom to get around the need to use FAT32 within their own code .
They would ( of course ) have to provide a little utility for reading / writing EXT2 / 3 to / from FLASH under Windows but with code like EXT2IFS and Explore2FS around , it cannot be that hard ( and I have written Windows device drivers in the past ) .
Having done that , they can concentrate on defeating Microsoft without having to worry about being taken to court over FAT32 ( which I view as viral MS technology much as the NTFS - 3G driver and Mono /. NET is ) .
Having said all that , hopefully this stupidity should be thrown out with reference to the Bilski case and Microsoft exposed as the toothless ' patent bully ' that they appear to be .

I think it is pretty simple ...
Microsoft want to have the patents against Linux
have a piggyback ride so that patents , that on themselves are doomed to not
stand post -Bliski world , will get more FUD value if TomTom is forced to pay for
Microsoft IP .
If they are successful I think we will see many more patent suits when Microsoft
add some Linux related patents to patents they think can be enforced .

NOT a software method , they actually have just about NOTHING to do with each
other .
To say they are even close to the same thing shows how little you know about
what you 're talking about .
About what i would expect from PARAlegal or ex-para .
Learn the law and what your talking about .
SO when are you going after the FSF for taking Cisco to court regarding

Bilski or not , the lesson of the VFAT patents is that it 's perfectly legal to
file for a patent of an ugly kludge .
Unix implemented long file names right ,
while MS copied CP /M , which in turn had copied other older file systems .
They
had to patch it to accept long file names without breaking compatibility .
I
sympathize with the poor souls who were assigned to make that work !
Wasting
multiple directory entries to emulate a long file name in an 8.3 file - name
system is nothing I 'd want my name associated with for all posterity to see .

Microsoft publicly claims that their disagreement with Tom Tom is not about
Linux .
Had that been true , they would never have included patents against Linux in
their complaint .
There are two issues here .
Did Tom
Tom illegally use one of Microsoft's
non-Linux related patents ?
If Tom Tom loses , will Microsoft claim they have won
a Linux related patent trial ?
Maybe not in public , but you can be sure they
will use it in their marketing strategy .
My conclusion :
We should do everything we possibly can to make sure Tom Tom
does n't suffer because of Microsoft bully tactics .
So every patent they are
claiming in this case should be re-examined and if possible declared invalid !
Disclaimer .
I own a Tom Tom , and like it , except I wish it would quit trying to
find a route from here in the states to the hotel we stayed at when we visited
Maui .
Maybe I just need to remove those favorites .
But they have fond
memories .

after you get past the commercials this video talks about challenges TomTom has been experiencing .
Perhaps Microsoft is looking to go after what TomTom would loose if they cause the company to loose value hence loose investments .

Dear Mr. Ballmer ,
It was with some surprise that I learned that your company has filed a lawsuit
against TomTom , alleging , among other things , that TomTom is in violation of
certain of your patents by making use of functionality in the Linux operating
system necessary to interoperate with the Microsoft ( MS ) Windows operating
system .
As you are undoubtedly aware , Linux is licensed in a way such that
either ALL users are able to benefit from it or NONE .
If you believe that
TomTom 's use of Linux in this fashion infringes your patents , then ALL ,
including myself , would also be liable for infringement .
You are certainly entitled to protect your Intellectual Property rights and ask
for relief if you believe they are being infringed by Linux .
In fact , in order
to make sure that your rights are protected , I have taken steps to eliminate ANY
need to interoperate between my Linux and MS Windows systems .
I have deleted
ALL copies of MS Windows from ALL of my computers .
You need not be concerned
about having to seek relief here .
In the future I will avoid the use of ANY and
ALL of your company 's products , and , insofar as I am empowered , will ensure that
no purchases over which I have authority involve ANY of your company 's products .
In such a way I believe that ALL of your company 's Intellectual Property rights
will be maximally protected .
Your shareholders should be pleased .
It is disappointing to see that a great company such as yours has decided to
compete with Linux in the Courtroom rather than in the Marketplace , pursuing a
direction dictated by CFOs and Legal Counsel rather than Chief Executives with
vision and imagination .
However , that is your choice .
Oh yes ,
The SCO Group , another company that decided to pursue Linux over alleged
infringement of its Intellectual Property rights , is now listed on the epiq.com
website .
Under Bankruptcy , Chapter 11 .
Best regards ,
Former Microsoft Customer

Prosecutors at the Victorian County Court have called for jail terms for five men who set fire to a mentally ill man last year .
The five Mornington Peninsula men threw petrol on Rosebud man Irving Plotkin and set fire to him .
The court heard Mr Plotkin 's injuries were shocking , with more than half of his body badly burnt , and he would be disfigured and severely scarred for the rest of his life .
He was critically injured and more than half of his body was burnt .
The court heard his house was destroyed .
The prosecution told the court the offences were so serious that an immediate jail term in an adult 's prison was warranted .
The court heard Mr Plotkin was extremely frightened by the unprovoked attack .
The five men in their late teens and early twenties pleaded guilty to charges including arson and reckless conduct endangering life .
One of the defendants lawyers told the court the attack was a combination of naiveity , boredom , immaturity and stupidity , and there was no desire to cause physical harm .
The court heard one of the men involved in the attack , 20 - year - old Adam Taylor of Rosebud , was mortified by his own conduct .
Taylor 's lawyer told the court , his client said it was the stupidest thing he had ever done .
The court was told he had at times been friendly with his victim , who could not understand why he had been attacked .
The plea hearing continues .
How much does a dog really cost ?
Let 's find out ! by Marshall Brain Introduction Irena is my daughter and she is 8 .
For half of her life she has been lobbying her mother Leigh and I for a dog .
I will admit that I resisted , and so did her mother .
But finally , in late 2008 , her parents buckled to unrelenting pressure .
A dog would be Irena 's Christmas present .
This is not a bad thing , because Leigh and I are " dog people " .
Way in the past - it seems like several lifetimes ago now - we lived on a farm and we always had several dogs .
There was one point where we had eight dogs .
Their names were Fluff , Roo , Fort , Bobby , Mamma Dog , Ginger , Barney and Yellow , and they formed a well - behaved little dog society .
Through the normal aging - out process , our eight dwindled to two .
And when we moved into town the two came to live with Leigh 's parents .
It was when the last two finally aged out ( at age 16 ) that Irena saw her chance .
She upped her lobbying , and it worked .
So , over the long Thanksgiving weekend of 2008 , the Brain family explored the world of animal shelters .
We visited three shelters ( the local SPCA , the Wake County animal shelter , and a shelter that sets up in PetSmart on Saturdays ) .
We picked out a nice mutt , about six months old , that Irena and her mother both loved .
We went back to the Wake County Animal Shelter on Sunday evening and made a commitment .
We put down a $ 50 deposit on our new family member , who would soon be known as Trixie .
Leigh and I have four kids , and I have always wondered in the back of my mind , " If I had actually recorded every penny we spent on the kids , how big would that number be ? "
But that is hard to do , because kids change everything in your life .
If we did n't have the kids , we would n't live in the house we live in .
But how do you account for that ?
The same thing happens with cars , vacations , food , restaurants , etc .
It would be hard to tease out the fractional parts of all the decisions and changes you make as a parent .
But what about a dog ?
Here it is much easier .
There is only one reason you buy dog food or a chew toy .
It should be very easy to track the cost of a dog over time .
I have no idea how much a dog costs , but I bet it will be a surprising number .
So here I present you ( and me ) with a complete accounting for Trixie in her first year with us .
November 30 , 2008
We made the commitment to Trixie today .
We had to put down a $ 50 deposit and sign the paperwork .
But we could not pick her up , because she needed to be spayed .
Here we see a huge cost benefit in getting a dog from the county animal shelter .
We will spend a total of $ 70 to adopt Trixie , and for that $ 70 we get : Free spaying Free microchip implant Free first vet visit Free stitches removal Free first round of shots ( at the shelter ) , plus free second round of shots ( at the vet )
Free 5 pounds of Science Diet food along with a bunch of samples of other products
Free leash
We also got a free DVD ( produced by Animal Planet ) to prepare us for Trixie 's arrival .
One of the things stressed in the video is the need for a " crate " to keep the dog in so she does n't chew up your house .
So Sunday night Leigh got on CraigsList.com and found someone nearby selling a used crate of the proper size for $ 35 ( about half price ) .
We picked it up Sunday night .
So , on day 1 , Trixie cost us $ 50 ( adoption deposit ) + $ 35 ( crate ) = $ 85 .
If we had gone to a pet store and purchased a pure - bred puppy , we would have spent $ 500 to $ 1,000 , and all of the above - mentioned items would not have been free .
We saved a lot of money by getting a pound puppy .
December 1 , 2008
On Monday night we made the obligatory trip to PetSmart to buy a few accessories .
We bought two chew toys and an engraved ID tag ( they have a machine in the store that engraves it while you watch ) .
The prices in this store are startling .
Example : A rubber chew toy .
Probable cost to manufacture : 20 cents .
Cost on the shelf $ 10.99 .
We spent $ 28 at PetSmart .
Trixie 's Total cost : $ 113 Had we not been prior dog owners , we would also need to be buying a food bowl and a water bowl , a brush , etc .
But we had these already .
Grandma also made a pillow and a cover for Trixie 's crate and donated them to the cause .
December 4 , 2008
The happy day has arrived !
We go to the animal shelter and pick up Trixie .
We pay the reminder of the adoption fee ( $ 20 ) and $ 8 for a harness , because Irena thinks that Trixie will like it better than a collar .
Trixie 's Total cost : $ 141 Both Irena and Trixie are ecstatic , and the whole family has a glow .
Value of all that happiness ?
Definitely more than the $ 141 spent so far .
We take Trixie home and let her get acquainted with her new address .
She takes many walks .
I replace a couple of loose boards in the fence so we can let her loose in the backyard .
Which brings up a good point : the fence came with the house .
This would be a major expense otherwise .
The neighbor across the street opted for an " invisible fence " that he installed himself when he got a puppy earlier in the year .
That 's the cheapest option possible and probably cost about $ 150 .
If we had had to pay for it , our fence would have cost several thousand dollars .
Somehow we end up at PetSmart again that evening and spend another $ 25 on a " beautiful collar " ( do n't ask ) , pig ears , treats and several other necessities .
Trixie 's Total cost : $ 166 December 5 , 2008 Trixie has her first vet visit .
The way this works is that we take Trixie to the vet and the animal shelter reimburses the vet for a shot , de-worming medicine and a check up .
The vet applies a lot of upsell pressure for additional tests ( at $ 50 a pop ) that Leigh resists .
Total cost of vet visit : $ 0 .
[ If you want to be a stickler , we had to drive about 15 miles back and forth to get to a vet that would take the animal shelter 's voucher . ]
The vet tells us that Trixie is probably 8 months old rather than 6 ( based on her teeth ) .
The vet speculates that she is a beagle ( tail / body ) + terrier ( body / head ) + sharpei ( skin / coat ) mix , but who knows .
What we notice after reviewing the first 24 hours of Trixie 's life with the Brain family is that :
She loves the crate .
She will happily go in and lay down .
She sleeps through the night in the crate no problem .
Does n't make a sound .
She does n't bark at all in the house
She is really good on a leash
She is as sweet as she can be with the kids .
No biting , nipping , scratching , etc . Very playful and happy However ...
She likes to jump up on people
She immediately starts barking at any stranger and especially at any other dog while she is walking She seems to be reverse potty trained .
She will wait to go inside the house !
We have had four or five accidents .
Perhaps this is because she lived for several months in a small pen at the shelter , and all the dogs go in their pens .
She totally ignores the Science Diet dog food they gave us at the pound .
Any item left on the floor ( shoes , slippers , toys , even Christmas ornaments on low - hanging branches , anything ) has a high probability of being carried back to the crate and chewed .
No damage yet because we are watching her like a hawk .
But the damage potential is high .
There is probably a cost to the accidents as well , but the carpet is old ( and has already weathered the spills of 4 small children for years ) and is scheduled to be replaced after she is fully house trained .
Trixie 's Total cost : $ 166 as of Dec 5 , 2008 December 8 , 2008 A tragedy today - Trixie ate her beautiful harness .
She had it on , and she was able to reach around and chew through part of it and get it off .
So when Leigh and the kids were at Wal - mart today they bought three chew toys for $ 12 .
Once she got settled in after a couple of days , she started eating the Science Diet food without any problem .
We feed her twice a day .
We received a 10 pound bag of dog food in early December from Grandma .
It was Purina Pro brand for " senior " dogs , but Trixie liked it just fine .
Trixie 's Total cost : $ 178 as of Dec 8 , 2008 December 21 , 2008 A friend at HowStuffWorks suggested that we check out Big Lots for dog paraphernalia .
Boy , was she right .
We sent Leigh and Irena into the local Big Lots on Sunday and 20 minutes later they came out with a big bag of dog stuff for $ 12 .
One of the things they found was a stake that you screw into the ground ( $ 1.50 ) to hold a line that would let you have the dog out in the front yard while you are doing yard work .
So on Monday Leigh and Irena went to Target and bought a steel cable ( 20 ft long ) to attach to the stake .
That was $ 8 .
They also went to PetSmart and bought a new harness ( $ 9 ) and a bottle of dog shampoo ( $ 5 ) .
Trixie 's Total cost : $ 210 as of Dec 22 , 2008 December 22 , 2008 Trixie went to the vet and got her stitches out .
This was free through the animal shelter .
December 26 , 2008 Trixie got her first bath today .
She did n't particularly like it , but she stoically bore her burden and smelled much better when she got done .
December 27 , 2008
Time to buy more dog food .
We went to Wal - Mart and , after reading a bunch of labels , picked out Purina One Puppy Food ( lamb and rice blend ) at $ 10.83 for a 10 pound bag .
Why this brand ?
Because Leigh has been reading , and supposedly you want to find a dog food that has a meat as its first ingredient , rather than corn .
And you want something other than corn to be the main filler ( after the meat ) .
And you want " crude protein " to be as close to 30 % as you can get .
It was a toss up between the Purina and Rachael Ray 's Nutrish dog food , and the Purina stuff had more protein .
( Note that you can buy 50 pounds of Old Roy dog food for $ 17 at Wal - Mart , so there definitely are cheaper options when it comes to dog food .
But Old Roy 's main ingredient is corn . )
Trixie 's Total cost : $ 221 as of Dec 27 , 2008 January 1 , 2009 January 1 came cold , crisp and beautiful in Raleigh .
To ring in the new year , we went for a 3 - mile family walk at Lake Johnson .
Here is a self - timer family portrait we took on the dam .
Trixie is a full family member at this point .
She loves taking walks and does really well in public settings .
You just have to hold her back if another dog comes along .
Today did n't cost a thing .
It was a lot of fun .
January 2 , 2009
Time for another vet visit , this time for another round of vaccinations .
These things can get so expensive that vets now produce a preliminary estimate , just like they do at the car repair place .
It looked like this :
There is nothing you can do about the top two items .
The DHLPP and Bordetella lines are the actual shots she needs .
The rest is proposed tests .
For example , the Fecal line is a proposed test for worms , even though at the last visit Trixie was given de-worming medicine .
Leigh took the four required lines and declined the rest .
She also bought a 12 - month supply of heartworm medicine .
The proposed price was $ 75 .
But Leigh had taken a printout showing the online price to be $ 47.50 , so the vet sold it to her for $ 47.50 instead .
Total vet bill for the day : $ 132.55 Trixie 's Total cost : $ 354 as of January 2 , 2009 January 4 , 2009 Another trip to Good Will today to dump a load of stuff there , and since Good Will is next to Big Lots and Trixie needs more chew toys , another trip to Big Lots .
We bought a 17.5 pound bag of Iams Healthy Naturals dog food ( $ 15 ) plus 4 chew toys and a one - pound bag of rawhide strips ( $ 5 ) .
The total bill was $ 29 .
Trixie 's Total cost : $ 383 as of January 4 , 2009 January 5 , 2009 Trixie totally rejected the Big Lots rawhide strips .
At BJ 's today Leigh bought a 2.5 pound bag of premium pig ears for $ 18 .
That should last awhile , we hope .
( You might be asking why this dog needs so many things like chew toys and pig ears .
It 's because she wants to chew CONSTANTLY , and buying this stuff is cheaper than having her start devouring shoes , toys and furniture . )
Trixie 's Total cost : $ 401 as of January 5 , 2009 January 12 , 2009 Today Trixie got tangled up in the power cord of my laptop and knocked it to the floor .
In the process she shattered the screen .
As described in the following three blog posts , I initially thought she might have doubled her cost : Part 1
Part 2
Part 3
But , thanks to some advice from friends who read the blog , the screen was replaced for $ 72 .
It was replaced on January 24 .
Trixie 's Total cost : $ 473 as of January 12 , 2009 January 22 , 2009 Trixie pulled way too hard on her leash and broke the clasp of her collar ( made of black nylon plastic , the male part of it snapped right off ) .
So we went to Big Lots and got a replacement for $ 2 .
We also picked up five new chew toys , for a total of $ 13 .
Trixie 's Total cost : $ 486 as of January 22 , 2009 January 23 , 2009 Purchased a little mat to put under Trixie 's food and water bowl to keep spills from getting on the floor .
The mat was $ 2.99 .
Trixie 's Total cost : $ 489 as of January 23 , 2009 January 29 , 2009
It 's getting to be time to buy more food for Trixie .
Leigh is convinced that Trixie prefers Science Diet dog food , and she is also convinced that Trixie 's fur looks glossier when eating Science Diet .
The problem is that Science Diet dog food is expensive .
You can't buy it at Wal - Mart or BJs .
The only place we have found it locally is PetSmart .
The 35 pound bag is $ 53 , or $ 1.51 per pound .
[ Keep in mind that if you go on the right day , you can catch BJs selling premium de-boned chicken breast fillets for $ 1.50 per pound ( they put them on half price sale when there is one day left to expiration ) .
Mix that chicken with rice and stewed vegetables and you have some pretty swanky dog food that costs less than Science Diet . ]
So Leigh has been waiting for a sale , and that day came on Friday .
The sale price was $ 9 off , or $ 44 .
Then she had found a Science Diet coupon for $ 4 off .
And we had a PetSmart " buy $ 40 or more and get $ 5 off " coupon that came in the mail .
So the 35 pound bag was $ 35 .
Tax was $ 2.63 .
For the record , the official name of this dog food is : " Science Diet Puppy Lamb Meal & Rice Recipe . "
Trixie loves it .
But I bet she would love " Marshall 's Chicken Breast Fillet , Rice and Vegetable Recipe " even more .
Maybe I 'll try making some up this weekend and see how it goes .
Hell , now that I think about it , * I * would eat " Marshall 's Chicken Breast Fillet , Rice and Vegetable Recipe . "
[ I will mention again that you can get 50 pounds of Old Roy dog food at Wal - Mart for $ 17 if you are n't picky .
See December 27 , 2008 . ]
Trixie 's Total cost : $ 527 as of January 29 , 2009 February 9 , 2009 PetSmart is still running the $ 9 off sale on Science Diet dog food ( see January 29 ) , and Leigh found another $ 4 off coupon from Science Diet .
So the $ 53 bag is reduced to $ 40 + $ ~3 tax , so $ 43 for a 35 pound bag of dog food .
$ 13 off is a 25 % discount , so we are stocking up .
BTW , Amazon has this same dog food for $ 54 a bag .
It is not easy to find discounts on this stuff .
Trixie 's Total cost : $ 570 as of February 9 , 2009 February 17 , 2009
We had a warm spell last week and saw ( horrors ! ) a flea on fair Trixie .
Which means we need to buy Frontline .
Remember up in the introduction I said we once had 8 dogs on a farm ?
Before Frontline , these dogs would get an unbelievable number of ticks ( and thousands of fleas ) in the summer .
After Frontline was invented , ticks and fleas were TOTALLY eliminated .
It is amazing .
We are big fans of Frontline .
The vet would like to sell us three doses of Frontline Plus for about $ 60 .
Each dose lasts a month , so that would run $ 240 for a year .
That becomes a major expense .
So Leigh set out to find cheaper Frontline .
The first thing to note is that Frontline Plus is the latest version of the product .
You can get the older version , called Frontline Topspot , for less .
The only difference seems to be that Plus claims to kill flea eggs as well as fleas .
But if you have ever used Frontline Top spot , you know that it totally eliminates fleas , so we see no need for the Plus version .
Looking on the Web , Amazon actually has some good prices .
Leigh discovered that , for whatever reason , the version for 89 to 132 pound dogs was cheaper than the version for smaller dogs .
So she bought 12 doses for $ 67.36 .
Note that Amazon prices fluctuate daily , and it pays to watch them for a week and catch a low price .
I just pulled up the prices today - Look how crazy the price difference is between the 12 month and the 6 month package :
Prices on Amazon fluctuate every day .
Notice how crazy the price difference is here - you save $ 45 by buying two 6 - month packages instead of one 12 - month package .
It pays to watch it for a few days and catch a low price .
One day when Leigh looked , the price for a 3 month package for 89 - 132 pound dogs was $ 16.84 .
So she bought four packages .
Since we have bought the kind for 100 pound dogs , and Trixie only weights 35 pounds , the obvious question is , " can we use half , seal the vial , and then use the other half the next month ? "
If we could , that would cut the price in half again .
We will try this experiment and report back .
[ Thanks for your email Wendy , and your concern .
We do have some experience with splitting doses like this , and no , Trixie will not OD on Frontline .
For years our " country vet " at the farm sold us the Frontline dosage for larger dogs and told us to split it across two or three of our smaller dogs .
It effectively cuts the cost of Frontline in half , and if you have a lot of dogs it is a big savings .
It also works fine ( all fleas and ticks are eradicated ) , and our dogs lived to ripe old ages .
But you do want to keep the dogs separated for a couple of hours after applying Frontline so they do n't lick each other .
Frontline ingested orally is not good for dogs . ]
[ By the way , this same vet would sell us a liquid cow wormer medicine called Ivomec , which contains the same chemical found in Heartguard heartworm pills but costs a fraction of the price .
If you have several dogs , you can save hundreds of dollars a year by using Ivomec .
This page explains the idea . ]
Trixie 's Total cost : $ 638 as of February 17 , 2009 March 8 , 2009 Another trip to Big Lots , another $ 12 in chew toys .
We also had to fix the fence today .
A couple of boards had come loose , and Trixie had learned how to exploit the hole and get in the neighbor 's yard .
Or maybe Trixie loosened them .
Who knows .
Cost of repair was $ 20 plus an hour or so of time .
Trixie 's Total cost : $ 670 as of March 8 , 2009 March 13 , 2009 Trixie has one of those retractable leashes .
It can be up to 16 feet long , or two feet long , and the 14 feet of cord stores on a spring - loaded spool in the handle .
Like this .
We had inherited it from Grandma , and it was many years old .
It snapped for the fourth time on Friday , so we replaced it .
Target had them on sale for $ 11.99 , and it came with a $ 3 rebate .
Trixie 's Total cost : $ 678 as of March 13 , 2009 March 27 , 2009
It 's been cold and rainy , so Trixie is inside more and needs more chew toys .
$ 12 at Big Lots .
Trixie 's Total cost : $ 690 as of March 27 , 2009 April 4 , 2009 Spring Break is here and we need to move our base of operations for a week .
Trixie can't go with us , so she needs to stay somewhere .
Normally we would leave her with the grandparents , but they are out of town too .
Leigh called up the local PetSmart , which offers the PetsHotel .
Note that their web site says not a word about rates .
When Leigh asked , they quoted $ 24 per day for a 4 ' x 4 ' pen .
That comes with two five - minute indoor walks a day .
Or you can go the deluxe route at additional cost , which offers a bigger pen with a TV .
Adding $ 12 per day gives you doggy day camp , which means your dog gets to spend 9 AM to 5 PM in a big room playing with other dogs .
There are other add - ons as well .
You could easily spend $ 50 / day at PetSmart .
What 's interesting is that you can get a motel room at Motel 6 in many areas for about the same price as the PetSmart deluxe pen .
It is n't a little pen ...
Motel 6 gives you a whole full - size room with a bed , a TV , a phone , a window and a bathroom .
So PetSmart is making out like bandits on this .
Or Motel 6 could make some extra cash by renting its empty rooms to dogs .
Leigh called around looking for other options .
Vets who offered kennel services were about the same price , but they used smaller cages rather than pens .
Another option :
If you get on CraigsList.com , it is possible to find people who board dogs in their homes .
Most have fenced - in backyards and some will even let the dog sleep in a bed .
These people charge between $ 25 and $ 35 per day .
Leigh found a nice women with good references who promised to take Trixie to a dog park and for a run every day .
The cost was $ 150 for the week .
Trixie 's Total cost : $ 840 as of April 4 , 2009 April 8 , 2009 BJ's had a close - out sale on a big bag of Milk Bone chew toys .
$ 10 .
Trixie 's Total cost : $ 850 as of April 8 , 2009 April 28 , 2009
We have n't spent any money on Trixie for several weeks .
We stocked up when they had a sale on dog food earlier in the year , so we have n't had to buy food .
It 's been beautiful springtime weather for the last several weeks , so Trixie spends a lot more time outside with the kids .
That means she can chew sticks and burn off extra energy .
There have been no vet visits in April .
But today she did get a bath .
We went fishing with the kids at a nearby lake at sunset .
Trixie ended up jumping in , swimming around , squishing through the mud , etc .
Trixie has been spending less and less time in her crate , and you can't have a smelly dog covered in lake scum hanging around the house .
Trixie 's Total cost : $ 850 as of April 28 , 2009 May 15 , 2009 More Science Diet dog food at $ 43 per 35 pound bag .
Trixie 's Total cost : $ 893 as of May 15 , 2009 May 25 , 2009 Bought a bag of rawhide chew things at BJ's for $ 10 Trixie 's Total cost : $ 903 as of May 25 , 2009 June 5 , 2009
There was a big sale on Iams dog food .
$ 35 for 35 pounds .
It turned out Trixie did n't like it as much , but by mixing it with the Science Diet stuff she ate it Trixie 's Total cost : $ 938 as of June 5 , 2009 July 4 , 2009
Once again we moved our base of operations for a week and left Trixie with the same woman we left her with on April 4 .
It worked out well for Trixie .
We spent $ 175 .
Trixie 's Total cost : $ 1,113 as of June 5uly 4 , 2009 July 15 , 2009 More Science Diet dog food at $ 43 per 35 pound bag .
Trixie 's Total cost : $ 1,156 as of July 15 , 2009 July 21 , 2009 Went to Big Lots and bought $ 12 in chew toys .
Which brings up a good point .
This dog LOVES to chew things constantly .
Over the last couple of weeks we have had to watch her more and more .
She has gotten into Legos , she has destroyed a Barbie and a plastic Turtle , she shredded a book , etc .
If we were to add up the retail cost of these transgressions , it is probably $ 40 or $ 50 .
Let 's call it $ 20 .
Trixie 's Total cost : $ 1,188 as of July 21 , 2009 August 22 , 2009
We purchased one of the " invisible fence " kits at PetSmart .
This is the one we bought : Petsafe PIG00 - 10777 Stubborn Dog In - Ground Radio Fence System .
It was $ 185 at Amazon , $ 189 at PetSmart ( on sale ) and $ 199 at Lowes .
We picked this one because : a ) the collar has a vibrate mode , b ) the collar uses a normal 9 - volt battery , and c )
It was relatively inexpensive but could handle a pretty big area ( up to 10 acres ) .
It took about 6 hours to install it .
That includes getting the wire into the grass as well as across the driveway .
Once it was installed , we tested the collar and it seems to work exactly as advertised .
The kit comes with a DVD that describes a two - week training process for Trixie .
We have n't started that yet .
The kit itself was $ 200 once you add tax .
We spent $ 50 for additional wire .
We bought an extension cord and surge protector so we could plug it in in the garage for $ 20 .
Total cost : $ 270 , not counting our time to install it .
After we train Trixie I will report back on how that went .
Trixie 's Total cost : $ 1,458 as of August 22 , 2009 August 30 , 2009 Grandma brought by a 1.5 pound free bag of Purina Chef Michael 's Canine Creations dog food today .
It is filet mignon flavor .
Trixie gulped this down like nothing we 've ever seen before .
But it seemed to give her gas .
We 'll see if the gas persists after a couple more feedings .
Trixie 's Total cost : $ 1,458 as of August 30 , 2009 September 25 , 2009
We took a weekend trip and Trixie could not come .
The woman we had been using was no longer keeping dogs , but she recommended another woman and we left Trixie with her .
The total cost was $ 90 .
Trixie had a good time .
Trixie 's Total cost : $ 1,548 as of September 25 , 2009 October 5 , 2009
We were at a store called Ollie's , and they were selling big smoked bones wrapped in plastic for $ 7 .
Irena thought this would be a nice treat for Trixie , so we bought one .
Trixie absolutely LOVED this bone , gnawing on it for a couple of hours , completely consuming the knuckles at both ends , etc .
Unfortunately , this thing also made Trixie sick to her stomach and worse .
She threw up several times outside , then in the house , and on the screen porch .
She had diarrhea for days afterwards .
It was a real mess .
In retrospect , this bone was not a good idea .
If you were to count the cost of all the cleanup , it would be expensive .
Trixie 's Total cost : $ 1,555 as of October 5 , 2009 October 31 , 2009 No , we did not buy Trixie a Halloween costume .
But we did consider it .
Trixie 's Total cost : $ 1,555 as of October 31 , 2009 November 8 , 2009 Back in August we bought one of those invisible underground fences for Trixie at PetSmart .
Here is a report on how that went .
We have heard both good stories and horror stories about these fences .
There are many people in the neighborhood that use them .
In most cases they appear to work well .
We have heard from one small dog owner that the dog was completely traumatized from the shock delivered by the collar and will not move when the collar is on .
So we did not want to traumatize Trixie .
We wanted this to be a pain - free experience for her .
The collar we have has a " beep / vibrate with no shock " setting .
So to train Trixie , we used that setting for two weeks with Trixie on a leash .
We would let Trixie walk around the yard , and inevitably she would get to the property line where the wire is installed .
Whenever this happened and the collar beeped , we would reprimand Trixie verbally and pull her back away from the line with the leash .
We did this over and over again , several times a day for two weeks .
The kids would do it , Leigh and I would do it , etc .
By the end of two weeks , Trixie knew where all the property lines were without a doubt .
She had even started to respect them to some extent , simply from the training we did .
Keep in mind that for these two weeks , there was no shocking used at all - just the beep .
The collar has 4 shock level settings .
So we set it on the lowest shock level .
I tried it on my finger .
It is an unpleasant sensation , but certainly nothing deadly .
After they saw me try it , the kids also wanted to try it , so they tried it on their fingers .
None of them found it to be oppressive .
So we put the collar on Trixie , with her on a leash .
The first time Trixie got shocked , she jumped .
Irena was not so keen on that , so we stopped for the day .
For about a week we kept Trixie on the leash so she would get the idea .
In that week she might have gotten shocked three times .
She learned very quickly that she did not want to go near the property line .
She would stay about 10 feet back from it .
Then we took her off the leash and let her have her freedom in the yard .
We had three cases where Trixie saw a cat or another dog and she ran right through the fence .
So we would bring her home , and purposefully retrain her at the point where she ran through .
Over the course of about a month the running - through completely stopped happening .
Trixie will now stay 10 feet back from the property line no matter what .
Even with a cat in the street , Trixie will simply stand there and watch .
And you know what ?
It is nice .
Trixie has complete freedom to roam in the front yard , the back yard and the driveway .
She will run , play , fetch balls and sticks for the kids , etc .
She seems completely happy and at ease .
There has been no " trauma " .
She simply stays 10 feet away from the property line at all times .
It has been a big positive for both the dog and for us .
We can put Trixie out and we do n't have to worry if we forgot to close the gate .
We do n't have to hold her back when we open the front door or the garage door .
She no longer " gets out " and starts running around the neighborhood .
And Trixie has a lot more room because she has access to both the front and back yards now .
We had been using a chain when we had her out in the front yard .
We got rid of the chain and it is much better .
The only change we 've had to make is when we want to take Trixie for a walk in the neighborhood .
We take off the collar , but Trixie insists that we pick her up and carry her over the line .
She absolutely will not get near it otherwise .
Trixie 's Total cost : $ 1,555 as of November 8 , 2009 November 12 , 2009
We bought a lot of dog food earlier in the year , using sales and coupons to cut the cost .
And as mentioned on August 30 , Grandma had been able to get Chef Michael 's dog food for free using the power of double coupons .
She has brought us several free bags of it over the last two months .
Trixie loves Chef Michael's , and after getting used to it her gas disappeared .
Apparently the promotional period has ended , and today we actually bought some Chef Michael 's dog food at BJ's .
It was $ 14 for 11 pounds .
The sales tax brought it to $ 15 .
Trixie 's Total cost : $ 1,570 as of November 12 , 2009 November 27 , 2009 PetSmart had a big " black friday " sale on dog food today .
We picked up two 40 - pound bags of Iams dog food for $ 29.99 each .
They also had chew toys on sale and we bought one for $ 1.99 .
With tax the total was $ 63.77 Trixie 's Total cost : $ 1,634 as of November 27 , 2009 [ PS - someone wrote in to ask , " How much does Trixie eat ? "
Trixie eats about 3 cups of food per day .
3 cups weighs about 12 ounces .
So the 80 pounds of food we bought today should last about 100 days . ]
December 4 , 2009
So , we have owned Trixie for one year .
How much does a dog really cost in the first year ?
In Trixie 's case , the cost was $ 1,634 .
If you break it down into some big categories : - The biggest expense , surprisingly , was kenneling at $ 415 .
That was about a quarter of Trixie 's cost in the first year .
If we never went out of town , of if she could have stayed with friends / relatives , or if we could have taken her with us , this expense would disappear .
- Next was equipment at $ 348 .
A big part of that was the $ 270 spent on an underground electronic fence that we installed ourselves .
On the other hand , that was a lot cheaper than a " real " fence .
Another part was the $ 35 crate .
- Next was food at $ 305 .
We bought 273.5 pounds of dry dog food in year one .
- Next was the vet at $ 201 .
Trixie did not get sick or injured in year one and the animal shelter covered some vet expenses , so vet costs ( which includes the cost of heart worm medicine and flea medicine ) was very low .
-
Next was toys at $ 187 - chew toys , rawhide , pig ears , etc. to keep her from chewing more valuable things in the house .
- Next was repairs at $ 112 .
The biggest repair was a broken laptop screen which I replaced myself for $ 72 .
- And finally there was the $ 70 adoption fee .
We have tried to be cost - conscious and to save money where we could .
We adopted rather than spending $ 500 or $ 1,000 on a pet store puppy .
We were lucky to avoid any additional vet fees .
We did buy " premium " dog food as opposed to the cheapest stuff on the shelf , but feel like that was the right thing to do .
And overall , she worked out to $ 1,634 or about $ 4.50 per day .
Is she worth it ?
I think the Brain family would unanimously say YES to that .
But it is not an small amount of money to own a dog .
And the wild card is the dog 's health .
If a dog gets sick or injured , vet bills can add up fast .
We look forward to our second year with Trixie !
Postscript , November 2011
As we have continued to own Trixie , the expenses recorded in her first year have been representative of the following years .
There were several first - year expenses ( like the crate and the fence ) that we have never seen again , but things like food , boarding , chew toys , etc. have not really changed at all .
We have been very lucky with the vet bills , because Trixie has not had any health problems ... except for one .
We took her to the vet one day and were told that she has heart worms .
This , you would think , is impossible since she takes medicine to prevent heart worms .
Nonetheless an x-ray revealed that she has a small number of adult worms in her heart .
The theory is that she got the worms during the period when we did not own her and she was not getting the medicine .
Getting rid of adult heartworms costs about $ 1,000 at the two vets that we talked to .
The company that makes the medicine has a " guarantee " and agreed to chip in $ 300 , which would lower the treatment cost to $ 700 .
The treatment has risks , and requires that you crate the dog and keep her quite for 30 days - something that would be nearly impossible in this case because Trixie is one hyperactive dog .
Because she is on the medicine , Trixie will not get any more adult heartworms in her heart and the current number is small .
Therefore , we decided ( with the vet 's blessing ) not to treat her .
The theory is that the adult heartworms eventually die of old age .
So far we have seen zero ill effects from the heartworms she is carrying .
From outward appearances she appears to be a normal , strong , happy , healthy , hyperactive dog .

The Guardian ,
Saturday 3 January 2009
Happy New Year and everything , but know this : nothing has changed , people continue to have stupid ideas , newspapers continue to laud them , and lives will be lost .
Here is just one :
What if everything you thought you knew about Aids was wrong ?
That was the title of a book by Christine Maggiore , an HIV / Aids - denialist lauded in the American media .
She is now dead .
Maggiore decided that HIV does not cause Aids , and that antiretroviral drugs do not treat it .
She was HIV positive , which the media loved .
She declined to take ARV drugs and specifically decided not to take HIV drugs during her pregnancy , despite the strong evidence that they massively lower the risk of maternal transmission .
She insisted on breastfeeding her children , even though it has been shown that this increases the risk of maternal transmission .
She also refused to have her children tested for HIV .
Her daughter , Eliza Jane Scovill , died three years ago .
The coroner attributed the death to Aids and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia .
She was three years old .
Last Saturday , two days after Christmas , Maggiore died of pneumonia , aged 52 .
She was an extremely effective advocate .
She set up successful campaigning organisations and counselled HIV - positive pregnant women on how to avoid pressure from medics to use azidothymidine ( AZT ) during pregnancy to prevent maternal transmission of the virus .
She appeared on the cover of Mothering magazine , with a “ No AZT ” sign painted on her pregnant tummy .
However , as always , this is about far more than one person .
Maggiore ’s views on HIV were driven by the work of Peter Duesberg , a well - known Aids denier .
He was unable to persuade other scientists that his views on HIV were correct , but he did very well with journalists , most notably Neville Hodgkinson , former science correspondent of the Sunday Times .
Over two years in the early 1990s the paper published a series of lengthy articles rejecting the role of HIV in causing Aids , calling the African Aids epidemic a myth .
It was all a scam to make money and defend reputations , they said .
Things got so bad that Nature , probably the world ’s most important academic journal , published an editorial describing the Sunday Times coverage as “ seriously mistaken , and probably disastrous ” .
Duesberg went on to great things , including South Africa ’s president Thabo Mbeki ’s disastrous presidential advisory panel on Aids .
It was here that the country ’s Aids - denialist policies were set into play , with tragic consequences .
One demographic modelling study estimates that if the South African government had used antiretroviral drugs for prevention and treatment at the same rate as the Western Cape , around 171,000 new HIV infections and 343,000 deaths could have been prevented between 1999 and 2007 .
Aids is the opposite of anecdote : three million people died of it last year .
Hundreds of thousands of lives , perhaps millions , have been lost because of a stupid idea , promoted by stupid people .
To the best of my knowledge , not one has either apologised or clarified their stance .
Just do n’t let anyone tell you pseudoscience is harmless .

NIN ’s Creative Commons licensed Ghosts I - IV has been making lots of headlines these days .
First , there ’s the critical acclaim and two Grammy nominations , which testify to the work ’s strength as a musical piece .
But what has got us really excited is how well the album has done with music fans .
Aside from generating over $ 1.6 million in revenue for NIN in its first week , and hitting # 1 on Billboard ’s Electronic charts , Last.fm has the album ranked as the 4th - most - listened to album of the year , with over 5,222,525 scrobbles .
Even more exciting , however , is that Ghosts I - IV is ranked the best selling MP3 album of 2008 on Amazon ’s MP3 store .
Take a moment and think about that .
NIN fans could have gone to any file sharing network to download the entire CC - BY - NC - SA album legally .
Many did , and thousands will continue to do so .
So why would fans bother buying files that were identical to the ones on the file sharing networks ?
One explanation is the convenience and ease of use of NIN and Amazon ’s MP3 stores .
But another is that fans understood that purchasing MP3s would directly support the music and career of a musician they liked .
The next time someone tries to convince you that releasing music under CC will cannibalize digital sales , remember that Ghosts I - IV broke that rule , and point them here .
Update ( 2009-02-11 , 00:32 ) :
New video at YouTube , see below .
This time the police was in better shape to handle the arabic mob that once again attacked our peacful pro-israeli demonstration in Malmö .
The police had sealed off the entire square , Stortorget , which I found odd , see below for my comments on that .
We were about 400 - 500 persons that showed up to show our support to Israel and its struggle against terrorism and arabic hate .
The arabs , that numbered about 100 , where shouting ” allah ahkbar ” as they normally do and showed their hate towards Israel and the Jews with different slogans .
It didnt take long until they started attacking us , this time with homemade pipebombs and fireworks .
The home made bombs were pretty powerful , as I stood not to far away when one of them exploded .
According to what I heard , the police managed to arrest the ones that threw the bombs .
However , they did not disperse the arab crowd which they should have done according to me .
In total there were two pipebombs , two rockets and some glass bottles .
The bombs didnt reach into our crowd since the distance between us was larger than last time , but the rockets exploded over the heads of the peaceful pro-israel demonstration .
According to the commander of the police operation , the organizers of the manifestation wanted to seal the square off for security reasons .
I , however , think that the point of the manifestation was lost whem no ” outsiders ” could see or hear what we had to say .
When you show support for something in public , you do that for a reason – for others to see and hear .
This was not possible due to that the area was completely sealed of and the only ones that could hear us were the police and the hateful arab mob .
The point of a public manifestation was lost in my opinion .
In any case , the manifestation could be completed due to a large police force were there to deal with the violent arabs .
The largest newspaper in the south , Sydsvenskan , did what the usually do and distort and bend the truth .
The article title was ” Several arrested during Israel manifestation ” .
Thats pretty odd .
The only ones arrested was the arabs , so the titel should have been ” Counterdemonstrators arrested during Israel manifestation ” or something like that .
They continue and write that
The expected violence did not occur
Was the reporters from Sydsvenskan not there when two rockets exploded and two bombs ?
If that ’s not violence , what is ?
The paper also first reported that the pro-israelis numbered at 200 and the arabs about 400 , which is a lie .
They than later changed those number to 400 pro-israelis and 200-300 pro-arabs .
Here is my video where you can see the bombs and rockets :
Another video where one of the rockets can be seen :
All herbals for you .

When attached to a Mac Miniesque Virtual Module A/V pass - through ( pictured below ) , the self - explanatory base unit can sync to specially encoded DVDs for a more ... interactive experience .
When hooked to a computer , that Virtual Module can connect a touch - sensitive dildo to the Hole over the internet .

I braved sticking my hand into the same sleeve you 'll find inside the Hole .
As a middle aged Japanese man massaged the attached dildo , I felt a slightly corresponding localized vibration up and down my palm .
I know what you 're thinking :
Some guy I did n't even know was here massaging my hand in public — how awkward !
Well , it was awkward .
But the fun does n't stop there , friends .
I adorned a pair of active shutter glasses to watch a 3D video stream of the AVN show floor ( not as sexy as it sounds - basically more middle aged dudes , many of them with mutton chops and sucked in beer bellies ) while my hand was getting a half - assed once over .
Boy oh boy is the future going to be awesome .

HOLLYWOOD , Jan. 9 ( UPI ) --
The Hollywood Foreign Press Association says a Golden Globe nominee was accidentally marked as a winner on its Web site days before the Globes presentation .
" In the process of preparing for Sunday 's Golden Globe Awards , the Hollywood Foreign Press Association Web team inadvertently marked a nominee as a winner , " the HFPA said in a statement on its Web site Thursday .
" The mistake was immediately corrected . "

The organizers of the Globes did not specify who the posting mentioned , but media reports said Anne Hathaway was indicated as the winner in the lead actress in a drama film category for her work in " Rachel Getting Married . "
Hathaway shared the Critics ' Choice award for lead actress in a film Thursday night with " Doubt " star Meryl Streep .
The winners of the 66th annual Golden Globe Awards are to be announced Sunday at The Beverly Hilton with a live telecast airing on NBC .

It seems to me that the stunning success of the atheist bus campaign has gone to Richard Dawkins 's head , for I can't imagine what else can have made him think that it was a good decision for him to now set his sights on to taking down another cultural scourge that threatens the well - being of innocent children : fiction .
According to the Daily Telegraph , Dawkins 's next piece of important work will be aimed at helping children differentiate between mythic thinking and science .
While Dawkins claims to love Philip Pullman , he also expresses concern that " … looking back to my own childhood , the fact that so many of the stories I read allowed the possibility of frogs turning into princes , whether that has a sort of insidious affect on rationality , I 'm not sure .
Perhaps it 's something for research . "
Research ?
I do find the idea of conducting a longitudinal study in which a group of children are isolated from anything imaginative rather amusing .
But in his apparent conviction that children are incapable of separating what they read about in stories from reality , Dawkins sounds to me not unlike the fundamentalist Christian mums who tried to get Roald Dahl 's The Witches banned from my primary school for fear that it would undermine what their kids had learned at Sunday school rather than acknowledging that sometimes , stories are just stories .
Though they are admittedly not as smart as adults , kids are remarkably good at separating truth from fiction when it comes to what they read or hear .
In fact , I believe ( from my limited knowledge of developmental psychology ) that getting a grasp on narrative and understanding the separations between fiction and fact is an important part of the development of the parts of the brain that one day can be devoted to good rational , atheist thoughts .
Dawkins wants to tell kids to " always look for evidence " , which is fine – of course , one might argue that the ancient myth - makers who drafted sacred texts that some people still ( unfortunately ) regard as important were doing that themselves in a crude way and should be considered important in the context of learning about how to think .
Dawkins cites his childhood exposure to fairy tales as influencing his views on the issues , so I feel justified in citing mine : as the progeny of a mixed - faith union between a physicist and a psychologist , my siblings and I grew up being indoctrinated with firm belief in the power of science to explain everything .
A fun Sunday afternoon would see us all gathered round the kitchen table doing double - blind experiments to see if we could taste the difference between brand - name and generic breakfast cereals , watching a documentary about Richard Feynmann , maybe reading a bit of James Randi .
Sometimes it all felt , I daresay , a bit insidiously rational .
But being aware of the need for balance , my parents also made sure we got healthy doses of fiction , including one of my perennial favourites , a children 's edition of the Bible that cut out all of the boring litanies of offspring and just focused on the exciting , slightly ludicrous , stories .
Most non-believing parents would testify , I believe , that it is perfectly possible to bring kids up to be sceptical , inquisitive and rational while also allowing them to freely engage in the flights of fancy that fanciful stories prompt them to take .
Any little girl who has actually gone out and smooched a frog , as Dawkins seems to fear might be the outcome of too much exposure to fairy tales , should n't be regarded as a victim of child abuse or deprivation from rationality ; she should be congratulated for her precocious aptitude for the trial - and - error approach to scientific experimentation .
SNOWBOUND workers across Britain are today expected to encounter the Jeremy Kyle Show for the very first time .
As blizzards paralyse the nation 's transport network experts say that by 1 pm millions will find themselves inexorably drawn towards the ITV2 mutant horror cavalcade .
Tom Logan , a solicitor from Kent , said : " Not me , I 'll be using my laptop to get on with some important work .
Probably .
" And not that I 'm remotely interested , but apparently today 's show is about this bloke who 's married to three sisters , two of them are his and four of the children are married to their own mothers .
They 're calling it ' Help !
I Think My Mum is My Wife 's Brother 's Wife ! '. "
Professor Henry Brubaker , of the Institute for Studies , said : " Many people are about to have their first glimpse at the grotesque , monkey - man hybrid that lurks in the dark heart of British society
" There will be two distinct effects .
There will be those who watch it and are haunted by it every day for the rest of their lives but are somehow still able to function .
" And then there will be those who become instantly and catastrophically addicted and who will then give up their jobs and find themselves trapped in a chaotic downward spiral that will ultimately lead to an appearance on the Jeremy Kyle Show . "
He added : " If you ask many of the failed monkey experiments that appear on the Jeremy Kyle Show where their lives started to go wrong , more than half say it was when they first started watching the Jeremy Kyle Show . "

Feature Overview
It 's hard to know how to say farewell to an administration as awful as George Bush's .
Do you boo its members as they leave Washington ?
Do you cheer their exit and do a little dance of glee that they wo n't be around to spin gold into excrement anymore ?
Or do you sit down and quietly try to work out the scale of the damage they left in their wake ?
I guess I will be doing a little of all three .
And as a journalist , I 'll also be slightly rueful .
After all , for someone interested in social justice issues , there was never a shortage of topics to write about these past several years .
Chief among Bush 's peculiarly twisted domestic legacy is an unprecedented collapse in the earning power of ordinary Americans – not just the poorest of the poor but huge swathes of the country 's working and even middle classes .
After 9/11 , the economy contracted for a year .
And after the housing collapse , which ruined the economic stability of millions of households , the economy began shrinking again .
At first the shrinkage was slow – slow enough that there was considerable debate for the better part of a year as to whether the country was actually in a recession or not .
Then the shrinkage assumed a galloping pace once Wall Street collapsed this past summer and autumn .
In the last months of Bush 's presidency the economy contracted by a magnitude not seen since the Great Depression .
Many economists are now predicting at least 9 % unemployment by the end of 2009 , with additional millions not included in the unemployment data because they have given up looking for jobs .
With the decline in tax revenues and the government bail - out of Wall Street and Main Street , President - elect Barack Obama acknowledged that the federal deficit will balloon to over $ 1tn this year as fallout from the Bush years .
That 's an unfathomable level of borrowing , and one that could exceed – as a percentage of the GDP ( 7 % ) – the debt carried by the US government during the second world war .
But even during the brief boom years sandwiched in between the two recessions , real median income in America declined even as productivity and company profits soared until last year 's financial collapse .
That has never happened for as long as income has been tracked by the government .
In addition to decreasing wages , health benefits and pension guarantees were slashed for many workers .
In small towns like Longview , Washington , thousands of people who thought they had pensions coming their way lost their pensions and health insurance when companies declared bankruptcy .
They did so largely with the support of the administration in Washington , which encouraged companies – from Bethlehem Steel to major airlines like Delta and United – to restructure through declaring bankruptcy and then shedding their pension and healthcare obligations .
Although the Pension Benefits Guarantee Corporation partially covered the lost pensions , the healthcare guarantees went the way of the dodo .
In town after town , old men and women returned to work , usually in low - paying jobs , just so they could cobble together money for their medicines .
Partly this has to do with globalising trends that would have hit certain sectors of the economy hard no matter who was in charge .
The newly deregulated , interconnected world is increasingly modelled as a winner - take - all game .
America 's steel industry , for example , would have probably been in trouble no matter who was in the White House .
The same goes for the inefficient car manufacturers , with their ill - thought - out business models and vast pension and healthcare bills .
But these trends have been magnified by deliberate policy choices .
Such choices include Bush 's anti-union policies .
Thousands of workers have been fired under his watch for trying to organise , even though such dismissals are , in theory , illegal .
Bush refused to countenance a minimum wage increase for the first six years of his presidency .
He opposed workplace regulation , and his administration lauded mega-companies like Wal - Mart that were spectacularly successful in large part because they kept their employees ' wages and benefits scandalously low .
By contrast , wealthy Americans did extraordinarily well under Bush until the financial implosion .
The tax cuts he pushed through handed vast sums of money to the very wealthiest people on earth .
The campaign to end the estate tax would have solidified a hereditary moneyed class in much the same way the legal structures protected the old aristocracies of Europe in centuries past .
And as many commentators have noticed , so much money flowed up to the very richest Americans that the country attained a level of inequality not experienced since the giddy 1920s .
Bush knew well whom his policies benefited .
In fact , at a gathering of the rich and famous , he joked – with a startling demonstration of tin-ear rhetoric – that these people were " my base " .
What can you say about a president who stands by while millions of people see their livelihoods destroyed and their old age security shredded , yet abases himself in front of the most affluent and privileged of citizens ?
Dubya 's presidency was more than a blot on American history .
It was an ugly , vicious chapter .
More than Harding , with his crony politics and his corruption ; more than Hoover , with his incompetent response to economic crisis ; and more than Nixon , with his cavalier disregard for the rule of law , Bush damaged America 's social fabric .
An epitaph for Bush 's years in office ?
He took what worked and broke it .
He took what did n't work and made it worse .

More than fifteen years in the making , more than 5 1/ 2 million words , this monumental task of scholarship called on the best brains in Judaism and won the approval of the world 's top rabbis .
Yet few Christians today even know it exists , and you will probably not find it in your local public library .
The Come and Hear™ hypertext version , currently on line at this web site , represents approximately 1431 folios ( produced as accurately as possible ) .
We hope this presentation will provide the necessary context for understanding ancient and modern rabbinical teachings .
We hope the larger context will also enable you to evaluate how fairly various commentators interpret the text .
Passages censored in previous editions of the Talmud were restored , and the translators amplified the text with extensive footnotes that form a running commentary .
The publication was completed as a 35 - volume set in 1952 , and republished in 18 volumes in 1961 .
Each tractate was accompanied by a glossary , a table of abbreviations , an index of Biblical references , and a general subject index .
In 1952 , Soncino published a comprehensive Index volume collating the indices from all tractates , and included an index to the statements of each of the Sages .
The Jew's College / Soncino English translation of the Babylonian Talmud has remained the gold standard of English Talmuds for six decades .
A former garda sergeant tried to pay prostitutes to get children as young as five for him to have sex with just a year after he had been released for a similar offence .
Kieran O'Halloran ( 48 ) offered two prostitutes up to € 10,000 to source the children and asked one to organise " three or four children in a hotel room " for him to have sex with .
A court heard that he also asked a prostitute to get him a picture of a new - born baby with their genitals on view .
O'Halloran pleaded guilty at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court to inciting the women " to organise or knowingly facilitate the use of a child for the purpose of sexual exploitation " in October 2005 and April 2006 .
Gardai had begun investigating him after one of the prostitutes tipped them off because she was disgusted by the requests .
O'Halloran , of Liffey Court , Clane , Co Kildare , and Westminister Park in Foxrock , Dublin , was jailed for three years on 2003 for an almost identical offence and a 20 - year post - release supervision order was also imposed .
Detective Sergeant Kevin Daly told prosecutor Fergal Foley that O'Halloran went to a brothel on Wolfe Tone Street , Dublin , in October 2005 .
He got a prostitute and asked her to get him an eight or nine - year - old girl .
He told her he wanted to " f*** " the children and offered her € 1,000 for every one she could get him .
He also asked her what was the youngest girl she could get and said he'd like to get three or four children in a hotel room .
He also told her he had downloaded child pornography from the internet .
Before he left he claimed he was n't serious about the request , but later phoned the woman a number of times repeating it .
The woman was " disgusted " and saved O'Halloran 's phone number under " pervert " before giving it to gardai .
She made a detailed statement and a identification parade was organised but she was unable to pick him out .
Gardai were forced to release him but continued monitoring his mobile phone .
In March 2006 , O'Halloran visited another prostitute in a flat in Harold 's Cross after reading her advertisement in a magazine .
He asked her to get him girls from eight - years - old but " no older than 11 " because he wanted an " innocent face " .
He said that when she got the girls he wanted the prostitute to show them how to give him oral sex before leaving him alone with them .
He asked her if she had any friends with young children and said he liked to watch girls as they leave school .
He also suggested he had visited other countries such a Thailand to abuse children .
He later sent her several text messages repeating his request but this time offering her € 10,000 for a " five or six - year - old child . "
O'Halloran visited her again in April and this time brought a child pornography DVD with him which he showed to the prostitute and her partner .
It featured an Asian girl , about 12 - years - old , performing oral sex on man .
He visited her a third time that month and again requested a girl under 13 to have sex with .
Since the first incident in October gardai had been monitoring his phone traffic and were able to track down the prostitute who made a full statement .
Gardai arrested O'Halloran in June 2006 and searched his Co Kildare home but found nothing of relevance .
Det Sgt Daly said he was very co-operative and admitted visiting the women but said he never intended to harm any children and that it was part of a " sexual fantasy " .
O'Halloran had been in the gardai for 22 years and held a command post for 12 months in Croatia while working for the United Nations .
Gardai said he had been " exemplary " in his role but resigned when the initial charges came to light in 2001 .
Defence counsel Luan O'Braonain denied his client ever travelled abroad for child abuse and said gardai could find no evidence of such travel .
He said O'Halloran was a recovering alcoholic who had been abused as a child .
Referring to the 20 - year post - release supervision , Mr O'Braonain said : " Whether the regime was sufficient in its monitoring are questions I do n't have the answer to . "
He noted his probation report stated he was at a " huge risk of reoffending " .
Detective Inspector Paul Mulloy gave evidence that O'Halloran had some contact with the probation service following his release in 2004 but he did n't know how much .
Judge Katherine Delahunt demanded to know how much interaction he had with the probation service following his original release .
She said : " I want to know exactly what the engagement was .
He says he engaged with them , I want to know if they engaged with him . "
The judge adjourned sentencing until March so gardai could interview probation officers about their supervision of O'Halloran and she remanded him in custody until then .

So why did n't the police go for David Davis ?
This is one of the questions hanging in the air after the arrests of the Tory immigration spokesman , Damian Green , and Christopher Galley , his Home Office source .
After all , Davis was Green 's boss when Galley first made contact in 2006 .
The former shadow home secretary and Tory leadership candidate has written : " Damian is among the most straightforward and honourable of people .
He worked for me when I was shadow home secretary .
Everything he did as shadow immigration minister he did with my implicit or explicit support . "
Is it conceivable that Galley made direct contact with Green ?
Far more likely that he would have approached tough - talking Davis , who had a long - standing reputation as a ministerial scalp - taker and had already made use of leaked information to embarrass Beverley Hughes and David Blunkett .
Peter Mandelson is almost certainly right when he suggests such a sensitive whistleblower relationship would have been cleared at the highest level of the Conservative Party , possibly by David Cameron himself .
At the time of writing , Davis had not been questioned by the police , though they are said to be interested in what the MP for Haltemprice and Howden might have to say .
But the Metropolitan Police is in difficulty here .
If officers invite Davis for a polite chat it will be hard to explain why this approach was not used with Galley and Green .
The police have displayed a grave ( if understandable ) failure to grasp how politics works .
This , rather than a political decision to target a member of the opposition , is likely to have been behind the raid on Green 's offices .
The Home Secretary , Jacqui Smith , has talked repeatedly of the importance of respecting the " operational independence " of the police , but there is a clear conflict when this interferes with the operational independence of a member of parliament .
The shadow immigration spokesman is an unlikely martyr .
A former president of the Oxford Union with a reputation while a student as something of a Tory " wet " , he has done nothing more radical in his life than support Davis in the 2006 leadership election .
Even then , he was backing the favourite .
A former party official who knows him well said : " He drives a Volvo , for God 's sake .
He wears Marks & Spencer suits which are shiny at the arse and the elbows . "
Tory sources suggest Green was given the Home Office mole to " handle " , much as an intelligence officer would be given an agent to run by someone further up the hierarchy .
MPs and commentators have been rightly appalled at the treatment of Green , who is said to be particularly furious that his child 's bedroom was searched by police .
There is also concern , which stretches to cabinet level , about the way officers of the Met were allowed to enter the precincts of parliament to search Green 's office .
Jacqui Smith and Gordon Brown have emphasised the importance of MPs not being seen to be above the law .
The inquiry by Ian Johnston , head of British Transport Police , will have to examine whether the response was proportionate , considering the nature of the alleged crimes .
Several questions remain unanswered in this most singular of cases .
Why was the Home Office so exercised by such minor disclosures ?
They were good scoops for the right - wing press , but by no means huge breaches of national security .
Indeed , the arrests were not made under the Official Secrets Act .
The police would certainly have used the OSA if they could , because its terms are sweeping and offer no room for a public - interest defence .
It is worth looking at the stories that emerged from this allegedly criminal relationship .
The first revealed details of Home Secretary Smith 's attempts in July 2007 to manage the story that thousands of illegal immigrants had been allowed to work in security - related posts .
Ultimately Smith was forced to admit that as many as 11,000 illegal immigrants had been cleared by the Security Industry Authority .
The second involved a memo to the Home Office minister Liam Byrne in January 2008 , admitting that an illegal immigrant had been employed as a cleaner at the House of Commons .
In August , a third leak revealed that Smith had written a draft letter to Downing Street warning that the economic downturn might lead to a rise in crime .
In addition , names of Labour MPs likely to rebel against the proposal to extend detention without trial to 42 days for terror suspects may also have been leaked .
Can the government argue the release of such information was damaging to anything except its own reputation for competence ?
Could this information not have been placed in the public domain ?
Ministers themselves concede the draft letter to Downing Street , for example , only stated the obvious .
A genuine worry for ministers is that the slow drip - feed of confidential information to the opposition or the press makes the work of government impossible .
Ministers and civil servants need to know that their deliberations will go no further than the walls of their offices .
But this risk is hugely overstated .
Considering its size and the number of controversial decisions made daily , Whitehall is remarkably unleaky .
This was a point once made forcibly to me by America 's most famous whistleblower , Daniel Ellsberg : " You journalists naively believe ' the truth will out ' .
You do n't know the half of it .
In fact , you know less than a fraction of 1 per cent .
Almost nothing leaks . "
Thus the man who leaked the Pentagon Papers , a detailed history of America 's involvement in Vietnam from 1945 - 67 , enlightened me to a harsh reality : most government secrets remain secret .
Even the best - informed journalists just scratch the surface of what is going on .
It is often not necessarily the most important and almost never the most outrageous acts of government that are leaked .
The publication of the Pentagon Papers in 1971 by the New York Times wholly undermined the US government 's case for war .
Christopher Galley is no Daniel Ellsberg , but he says he acted from the same principle : a government was attempting to hide information that should be in the public domain .
Green 's arrest and the breach of the conventions of parliamentary privilege that the search of his office entailed are shocking events .
Yet something positive may come from this .
As a serial disseminator of leaked information myself , it has been my experience that the authorities tend to go for the weakest individual in the chain of disclosure .
This is occasionally the journalist , but more often the " mole " .
This government has a record of shooting the messenger .
In the two high - profile cases I have been involved with , the GCHQ whistleblower Katharine Gun and the Foreign Office mole Derek Pasquill , the individuals had their lives held in suspension for months while waiting to be charged .
Both lost their jobs .
The mental toll of fighting the government can be heavy , as the former MI5 officer David Shayler discovered .
Finding work afterwards is very difficult .
At least , with the arrest of a senior politician , we can have a full discussion in parliament about the uses and abuses of government secrecy .
The Green case will have implications for government and for journalists .
There are MPs across Westminster to whom I have shown leaked documents - including one leader of an opposition party .
How else would they be able to judge whether it was appropriate to discuss their contents under the protection of parliamentary privilege ?
I will think twice about showing them such material in future and I am sure they will be wary of handling it .
As it turns out , I have more protection under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act from disclosing my files as a journalist than MPs derive from convention laid down over the centuries .
The government has oscillated between attacking the Tories for condoning alleged criminal activity and recognising that MPs are worried about the implications of allowing police officers into parliament .
But when the dust clears , people should take a long look at the alleged offence for which Green and Galley were arrested .
According to the law manuals , the offence of misfeasance in public office is designed to target the " deliberate and dishonest abuse of power " .
In effect , this criminalises a relationship that has always existed between opposition politicians and their government sources .
The government must tread carefully , because for most people looking at the extraordinary events of recent days Damian Green was the victim , not the perpetrator , of an abuse of power .
Ted Ciamillo ’s pedal - powered submarine may seem like a stunt , but marine biologists are paying serious attention ( Image : Subhuman Project )
Read our related editorial : A crazy adventure that inspires us all
SOME men mark their 40th birthday by buying a flashy new car , changing jobs or finally getting started on that novel .
Ted Ciamillo decided he would pedal across the Atlantic in a one - man submarine he has designed and built himself .
It may sound like a crazy stunt dreamed up by an adrenalin junkie , but the plan , dubbed the “ Subhuman project ” , has attracted serious attention from marine biologists .
That ’s because the sub , when it takes to the seas later this year , could for the first time allow them to explore the upper layers of the ocean silently and unobtrusively , revealing marine life as it has never been seen before .
Ciamillo , a machinist by training and an inventor by trade , does have a track record in underwater exploration .
In 1997 he made his name designing a James Bond - style underwater propulsion vehicle called the Hydrospeeder , which looks something like an underwater motorbike .
Although the company that sold the Hydrospeeder later folded , Ciamillo remained keen to speed up underwater exploration .
“ I found myself frustrated by how slowly you move under water , especially with a bunch of dive gear on your back , ” he says .
“ It ’s like dropping someone in the middle of the forest in a wheelchair . ”
So , in collaboration with marine biologist Frank Fish of West Chester University in Pennsylvania , who specialises in the biomechanics of cetacean swimming , Ciamillo designed a carbon - fibre “ tail ” for divers , called the Lunocet .
Modelled on Fish ’s CAT scans …

ParameterisedMonad
The state monad gives an elegant way to thread state information through Haskell code .
Unfortunately it has an annoying limitation : the state must have the same type throughout the monadic expression .
In this post I want to look at how to fix this .
Unfortunately , fixingmeans it's no longer a monad , but we 'll discover a new abstraction that replaces monads .
And then we can look at what else this abstraction is good for .
The cool bit is that we have to write virtually no new code , and we 'll even coax the compiler into doing the hard work of figuring out what the new abstraction should be .
This is all based on an idea that has been invented by a bunch of people independently , although in slightly different forms .
I 'm being chiefly guided by the paper Parameterized Notions of Computation
The problem with the state monad is that it is defined by The state going into and out of one of these values is the same , .
We can't vary the type of the state as we pass through our code .
But that 's really easy to fix , just define : I can now just copy and paste the definitions ( with name changes to avoid clashes ) out of the ghc prelude source codeWe do n't have to change a thing !
The old code exactly matches the new type .
We can now write code using the newBut we 're now also able to write code like :
The state starts of as anbut ends up as aProblem solved !
Except that this definition ofdoes n't give us a monad and so we lose the benefits of having an interface shared by many monads .
Is there a new more appropriate abstraction we can use ?
Rather than scratch our heads over it , we can just ask ghci to tell us what 's going on .
This immediately suggests a new abstraction :
It 's a lot like the usualclass except that we 're now parameterising uses of this class with a pair of types .
Our newoperator also has a compatibility condition on it .
We can think of an element ofas having a ' tail ' and ' head ' living inandrespectively .
In order to usewe require the head of the first argument to match the tail given by the second argument .
Anyway , we have :
We did n't really design this class , we just used what ghci told us .
Will it turn out to be a useful abstraction ?
First a category theoretical aside : in this post I talked about how monads were really a kind of abstract monoid .
Wellis a kind of abstract category .
If we were to implementfor this class it would play a role analogous to composition of arrows in a category .
In a monoid you can multiply any old elements together to get a new element .
In a category , you can't multiply two arrows together unless the tail of the second matches the head of the first .
Now we can generalise the writer monad to a .
But there 's a twist : every monoid gives rise to a writer .
This time we 'll find that every category gives rise to a .
Here 's the definition .
Again , it was lifted straight out of the source for the usualmonad .
The main change is replacingandwithand
It 's just like the usualmonad except that the type of the ' written ' data may change .
I 'll borrow an example ( modified a bit ) from the paper .
Define some type safe stack machine operations that are guaranteed not to blow your stack :
We can now ' write ' the composition of a bunch of these operations as a ' side effect ' : I guess there 's one last thing I have to find .
The mother of all parameterised monads .
Again , we lift code from the ghc libraries , this time from Control .
Monad .
Cont .
I just tweak the definition ever so slightly .
Normally when you hand a continuation to an element of thetype it gives you back an element of the continuation 's range .
We allow the return of any type .
This time the implementations ofandremain completely unchanged :
So what 's going on here ?
The implementations of these instances require almost trivial changes to the original monads , or in two cases no changes at all apart from the type signature .
I have my opinion : Haskell programmers have been using the wrong type class all along .
In each case the type signature forandwas too strict and so the functionality was being unnecessarily shackled .
By writing the code without a signature , ghci tells us what the correct signature should have been all along .
I think it might just possibly be time to consider makingas important asto Haskell programming .
At the very least , do - notation needs to be adapted to supportUpdate :
You * can * use do - notation with Parameterised Monad if you use the NoImplicitPrelude flag .

In that setting , teenagers often say they “ fool around , ” and in a reversal of the old pattern , such an encounter may or may not lead to regular dating .
The shift began around the late 1960s , said Dr. Bogle , who explored the trend in her book “ Hooking Up : Sex , Dating and Relationships on Campus ” ( N.Y.U. Press , 2008 ) .
The latest rise in teenage pregnancy rates is cause for concern .
But it very likely reflects changing patterns in contraceptive use rather than a major change in sexual behavior .
The reality is that the rate of teenage childbearing has fallen steeply since the late 1950s .
The declines are n’t explained by the increasing availability of abortions : teenage abortion rates have also dropped .
“ There is a group of kids who engage in sexual behavior , but it ’s not really significantly different than previous generations , ” said Maria Kefalas , an associate professor of sociology at St. Joseph ’s University in Philadelphia and co-author of “ Promises I Can Keep : Why Poor Women Put Motherhood Before Marriage ” ( University of California Press , 2005 ) .
“ This creeping up of teen pregnancy is not because so many more kids are having sex , but most likely because more kids are n’t using contraception . ”
As for that supposed epidemic of oral sex , especially among younger teenagers : national statistics on the behavior have only recently been collected , and they are not as alarming as some reports would have you believe .
About 16 percent of teenagers say they have had oral sex but have n’t yet had intercourse .
Researchers say children ’s more relaxed attitude about oral sex probably reflects a similar change among adults since the 1950s .
In addition , some teenagers may view oral sex as “ safer , ” since unplanned pregnancy is not an issue .
Health researchers say parents who fret about teenage sex often fail to focus on the important lessons they can learn from the kids who are n’t having sex .
Teenagers with more parental supervision , who come from two - parent households and who are doing well in school are more likely to delay sex until their late teens or beyond .
“ For teens , sex requires time and lack of supervision , ” Dr. Kefalas said .
“ What ’s really important for us to pay attention to , as researchers and as parents , are the characteristics of the kids who become pregnant and those who get sexually transmitted diseases .
Users of all current versions of Microsoft 's Internet Explorer browser might be vulnerable to having their computers hijacked because of a serious security hole in the software that is still not fixed .
The flaw lets criminals commandeer victims ' machines merely by tricking them into visiting websites tainted with malicious programming code .
As many as 10,000 sites have been compromised since last week to exploit the browser flaw , according to antivirus software maker Trend Micro .
The sites are mostly Chinese and have been serving up programs that steal passwords for computer games , which can be sold for money on the black market .
However , the hole is such that it could be " adopted by more financially motivated criminals for more serious mayhem - that 's a big fear right now , " Paul Ferguson , a Trend Micro security researcher , said .

Tips & Warnings
At least one color of food coloring , 3 to 4 works best .
A drop of dish soap .
A plate or bowl that has 1/4 inch of milk on it .
A q-tip .
Take the food coloring and drop two - three drops of each color into seprate corners .
Take care that the colors do not mix .
Put a drop of dish soap on one end of the q-tip .
Gently tap the soapy end of the q-tip into the center of your dish .
Enjoy the magic !
The milk should create a crater - like motion in the milk .
The food coloring allows you to view the chemical changes in the milk .
To keep the fun going add more soap and gently dip in the milk again .
You can use this small experiment to enjoy hours of fun with small kids on a rainy day .
You can even use the soap to create a master piece .
A sample test :
Health insurer WellPoint Inc. has been barred from adding customers to Medicare plans after it denied prescription drugs to the elderly , endangering their lives , the government said Monday .
The sanctions , outlined in a letter to WellPoint from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , followed a “ sharp ” increase in consumer complaints , the agency said .
Elderly customers were stopped from receiving essential prescription drugs , and some were overcharged because of computer mistakes , the government said .
“ Well Point ’s conduct poses a serious threat to the health and safety of both its prospective and current Medicare beneficiaries , ” the agency said in the letter .
The number of complaints jumped in the last 12 days , Medicare said .

A mentor serves as an adviser to a new employee or intern .
Working with a mentor often has a positive effect on the mentee 's career and life , as a good mentor not only helps to foster insight , but also helps to identify and expand the mentee 's growth opportunities .
Serving as a mentor is a big responsibility , but it can allow you to help someone new to your field as you pay it forward .
Give Encouragement but Demand Accountability
Bob Buford , cable - TV pioneer and venture philanthropist , talks about the importance of accountability in his book , “ Drucker & Me . ” Buford relates how before every consulting session , his mentor , Peter Drucker , had him write a synopsis which detailed everything Buford had done since their previous session .
This exercise not only demonstrated to Drucker how his mentee had followed up on his advice , but also helped to keep Buford accountable for his actions .
Follow up with the details from your last meeting to ensure your mentee is staying accountable .
Invest in the Relationship
Becoming a good mentor is a commitment of both time and resources .
You have the right to expect certain things from the mentee , such as accountability and the willingness to take action .
You must also invest time in the relationship and follow through by being there when she needs you as well .
Schedule regular appointments for a designated time to meet each week or month .
If you must postpone your meeting , reschedule the appointment with your mentee as soon as possible to help keep her on track .
Focus on the Big Picture
As a mentor , it is easy to get caught up in your mentee 's day - to - day problems or small concerns .
Instead of focusing on these types of problems , however , direct his attention to the bigger picture and focus on the overall direction of his career .
Encourage your protege to develop the skills to help him reach his full potential while assisting him in building the tools needed to achieve his long - term career goals .
Stop Talking and Listen
Sometimes a mentee does n't really need to hear great words of wisdom .
Instead , she simply needs someone to listen to her as she talks out the problem and reaches her own conclusions .
David Parnell , a legal consultant , communication coach and author , tells " Forbes " that good mentors spend considerably more time listening than they do actually speaking .
This not only lets mentees say what is on their mind -- it also helps the mentor to better understand the situation .
Patience , Patience , Patience
Sometimes you will have to give a bit of constructive criticism that your mentee may find hard to take , so be patient as you gauge how to respond on these occasions and work to meet your mentee 's needs .
Realizing this in advance gives you the opportunity to temper your responses , allowing you a chance to offer an appropriate strategy and more support instead of immediately jumping in to give direct advice .
As Parnell notes , " It is vital that a mentor be a patient soul , because tempers may flare , and quick fixes are few and far between . ”
A tiny startup that was threatened by a massive law firm over nothing more than a humble hyperlink has been forced to settle and change its linking policies , handing Goliath the win in this gratuitous trademark case .
Under the agreement , real estate startup BlockShopper can no longer include hyperlinks anywhere on its website to Jones Day , a massive Chicago law firm , except explicitly on URL text .
Essentially , jonesday.com is okay , but not blah blah blah .
During the summer of 2008 , BlockShopper linked to the Web profile of a prominent real estate lawyer in a posting that highlighted his purchase of a condo , and noted that Jones Day had purchased homes / condos / apartments on Chicago 's North Side .
The information on these sales is public record , and BlockShopper did nothing more than follow standard Web linking procedure that practically every website on earth follows .
For reasons still unbeknownst to the world , however , Jones Day was very displeased by these links and filed a lawsuit against BlockShopper in September of 2008 , leveling the odd charge of trademark dilution .
The complaint cites the issue as " confusion " — the claim was that people visiting BlockShopper and seeing the links in question might assume that it was somehow officially related to Jones Day .
This , of course , was a ridiculous claim , but BlockShopper tried to play nice and consented to a temporary restraining order that required the site to remove the links .
Soon thereafter , the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Public Citizen jointly filed an amici curiae brief on behalf of BlockShopper , pointing out the obvious : " linking is what web sites do — that is , after all , why it is called the ' World Wide Web ' . "
Unfortunately , the judge in the case refused to even look at the brief after Jones Day said the brief sided with one party ( as most amicus briefs do ) ; he also refused to dismiss the case at the request of BlockShopper .
According to TechDirt , the judge even allegedly put pressure on BlockShopper to back down by saying , " Do you know , young man , how much money it 's going to cost you to defend yourselves against Jones Day ? "
BlockShopper did , in fact , realize how much money it would cost .
Faced with crippling legal fees and an unsympathetic judge , the company was forced to settle the case out of court by agreeing not to use embedded links to Jones Day on any words or names .
If BlockShopper wants to link to a specific attorney 's profile at Jones Day 's website , BlockShopper must state that the person in question is employed by Jones Day along with the text " more information about [ so - and - so ] can be obtained at Jones Day 's website at www.jonesday.com/[remainder of URL here ] " with a link encompassing only the URL .
If you ask us , this almost sounds more like a bad Internet marketing scheme than a lawsuit settlement .
As pointed out by Slate , the conclusion of this lawsuit does n't seem to solve any of Jones Day 's alleged trademark concerns , and does n't even prohibit the posting of attorneys ' home purchases ( presumably the information that Jones Day did n't like in the first place ) .
The links still exist , just in a somewhat different , slightly awkward structure that is not clearly better than the original .
In essence , Jones Day won by simply bullying BlockShopper until it was forced to give in and craft its links in the way that the law firm would prefer .
Turning the Web into a permissions - based linking system would be , at worst , catastrophic , and at best , annoying .
We can only hope that future cases like this one will have outcomes that make more sense .

ISTANBUL , Turkey ( CNN ) -- Turkey 's Foreign Ministry summoned Israel 's ambassador to the Turkish capital of Ankara on Saturday to issue a formal complaint over a top Israeli commander 's reported remarks criticizing Turkey .
Recep Tayyip Erdogan leaves the stage at a conference last month as Shimon Peres sits , left .
The complaint is part of the escalating war of words between the two regional allies , stemming from Turkey 's outspoken criticism of the recent conflict in Gaza .
The Turkish Foreign Ministry said Saturday that it had requested an " urgent explanation " from Ambassador Gabby Levy for recent remarks reportedly made by a top Israeli military commander .
According to the Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz , Maj. Gen. Avi Mizrahi told an international conference that Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan should " look in the mirror " before criticizing Israel .
Mizrahi pointed to Turkey 's treatment of its long - oppressed Kurdish minority and the ongoing Turkish military occupation in northern Cyprus , Ha'aretz reported .
And , in a separate statement issued Saturday , the Turkish military called the Israeli general 's comments " unacceptable , " adding , " We expect the Israeli General Staff , which we think gives importance to relations with the Turkish Armed Forces , to clarify the issue . "
Tensions have increased between Turkey and Israel since last month , when Erdogan stormed off stage at a conference in Davos , Switzerland .
Erdogan objected to Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres ' passionate defense of Israel 's 22 - day military operation in Gaza , which left more than 1,300 Palestinians dead .
Thirteen Israelis , including 10 soldiers , were killed .
For the past decade , Turkey and Israel have enjoyed close military and economic ties .
The Israeli military often conducts exercises around the Turkish city of Konya .
Israeli tourists flock to Turkey 's Mediterranean Sea resorts , and bilateral trade has increased dramatically since Erdogan 's ruling AK Party first won national elections in 2002 .
As a result , audience members were shocked last month when Erdogan lost his temper while participating in a panel discussion of the recent Gaza conflict in Davos .
Before storming off stage , Erdogan told the Israeli president , " When it comes to killing , you know killing very well .
I know how you hit , kill children on the beaches . "
Erdogan has been unapologetic about his outburst .
While campaigning for municipal elections to be held in Turkey next month , the prime minister told reporters that the results of Israel 's recent elections " painted a very dark picture " for the future of the region , Reuters reported .

Advertisement A surprise visit by US President George Bush to Iraq has been overshadowed by an incident in which two shoes were thrown at him during a news conference .
An Iraqi journalist was wrestled to the floor by security guards after he called Mr Bush " a dog " and threw his footwear , just missing the president .
The US president has now continued to Afghanistan to inspect troops there .
He arrived before dawn at Bagram air force base , and is due to hold talks with President Hamid Karzai .
Earlier in Baghdad , Mr Bush and Iraqi PM Nouri Maliki signed the new security agreement between their countries .
The pact calls for US troops to leave Iraq in 2011 - eight years after the 2003 invasion that has in part defined the Bush presidency .
If you want the facts , it 's a size 10 shoe that he threw
US President George W Bush
Bush shoe-ing worst Arab insult Speaking just over five weeks before he hands over power to Barack Obama , Mr Bush also said the war in Iraq was not over and more work remained to be done .
His previously unannounced visit came a day after Defence Secretary Robert Gates told US troops the Iraq mission was in its " endgame " .
' Size 10 '
In the middle of the news conference with Mr Maliki , Iraqi television journalist Muntadar al - Zaidi stood up and shouted " this is a goodbye kiss from the Iraqi people , dog , " before hurling a shoe at Mr Bush which narrowly missed him .
Showing the soles of shoes to someone is a sign of contempt in Arab culture .
Muntadar al - Zaidi was quickly wrestled to the ground and hauled away With his second shoe , which the president also managed to dodge , Mr Zaidi said : " This is for the widows and orphans and all those killed in Iraq . "
Mr Zaidi , a correspondent for Cairo - based al - Baghdadiya TV , was then wrestled to the ground by security personnel and hauled away .
" If you want the facts , it 's a size 10 shoe that he threw , " Mr Bush joked afterwards .
Al - Baghdadiya 's bureau chief told the Associated Press that he had no idea what prompted Mr Zaidi to attack President Bush , although reports say he was once kidnapped by a militia and beaten up .
" I am trying to reach Muntadar since the incident , but in vain , " said Fityan Mohammed .
" His phone is switched off . "
Correspondents said the attack was symbolic .
Iraqis threw shoes and used them to beat Saddam Hussein 's statue after his overthrow .

Mr Bush 's first stop upon arriving in Baghdad was the Iraqi presidential palace in the heavily - fortified Green Zone , where he held talks with President Jalal Talabani .
PREVIOUS BUSH VISITS TO IRAQ Nov 2003 : Serves Thanksgiving dinner to troops in Baghdad June 2006 : Meets new Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki Sept 2007 : Visits Anbar province - former stronghold of Saddam Hussein " The work has n't been easy but it 's been necessary for American security , Iraqi hope and world peace , " Mr Bush said during his talks with Mr Talabani .
The Iraqi president called Mr Bush " a great friend for the Iraqi people , who helped us liberate our country " .
The BBC's Humphrey Hawksley , in Baghdad , says the key issue at present is exactly how American troops will withdraw within the next three years and what sort of Iraq they will leave behind .

The US media has just published details of a US government report saying that post invasion reconstruction of Iraq was crippled by bureaucratic turf wars and an ignorance of the basic elements of Iraqi society .
The report is circulating among US officials in draft form , says the New York Times .
It reveals details of a reconstruction effort that cost more than $ 100bn ( £ 67bn ) and only succeeded in restoring what was destroyed in the invasion and the widespread looting that followed it , the newspaper said .

US troops are first to withdraw from Iraqi cities , including Baghdad , by June next year .
Defence Secretary Gates said on Saturday that " the process of the drawdown " had begun .
" We are , I believe , in terms of the American commitment , in the endgame here in Iraq , " he told US troops at an airbase near Baghdad .
Mr Gates has been picked to stay on as defence secretary by President - elect Barack Obama .
The end in sight for US troops in Iraq ?
President Bush leaves the White House in less than six weeks .
He said in a recent interview with ABC News that the biggest regret of his presidency was the false intelligence that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction .
Finding these was one of the key justifications for the invasion .
None were ever found .
Mr Obama has promised to bring home US combat troops from Iraq in a little over a year from when he takes office in January .
More than 4,200 US troops and tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians and security personnel have been killed since the invasion in 2003 .
There are currently about 149,000 US soldiers in Iraq , down from last year 's peak of 170,000 after extra troops were poured in to deal with a worsening security situation .
As Mr Bush arrived in Baghdad , Gen David Petraeus , the head of the US Central Command , which includes Iraq , said attacks in the country had dropped from 180 a day in June 2007 to 10 a day now .
In a sign of modest security gains in Iraq , Mr Bush was welcomed with a formal arrival ceremony - a flourish that was not part of his previous three visits .
He arrived in the country on Air Force One , which landed at Baghdad International Airport in the afternoon , after a secretive Saturday night departure from Washington on an 11 - hour flight .

STOCKTON , California ( AP )  A California couple has been charged with kidnapping and torturing a 17 - year - old boy police say they sometimes kept shackled in their home .
The boy 's one - time guardian , who also stayed in the couple 's home with the teenager , was also charged with similar abuse allegations .
Kelly Layne Lau and her husband , Michael Schumacher , both of Tracy , are charged with 13 counts related to the alleged abuse .
The former guardian , Caren Ramirez , is charged with 10 counts .
Court documents allege the boy was beaten with a baseball bat and belt and cut with a knife .
The boy escaped from the couple 's home Monday by jumping over a fence in the backyard and seeking help at a nearby gym .

If people knew how much electricity they were using every time they turned on the lights , fired up the oven or lowered the thermostat on their air - conditioner , they would make smarter decisions about their energy use , and presumably , conserve more .
That ’s the idea behind a prototype service that Google unveiled Tuesday , which my colleague Matthew Wald and I wrote about in Tuesday ’s paper .
The service , which will be called Google PowerMeter , will allow users to measure their energy use in real time .
It one of many new consumer products that would be enabled by “ smart grid ” technologies , and it is one of Google ’s many initiatives in the energy area .
As a way to attract partners to its endeavor , Google is unveiling the prototype for PowerMeter well before it has a functioning product available .
The company also hopes that the announcement will bolster its own advocacy efforts at the state and federal levels in support of policies and investments that will promote the development of a smart grid .
“ We are in conversations with a number of device makers and utilities , ” said Kirsten Olsen Cahill , a program manager at Google.org , the company ’s corporate philanthropy .
“ We ’d love to talk to more people and build out this ecosystem . ”
For now , Google developed its prototype using an electricity measuring device that clamps onto a house ’s main circuit breaker and sends the information back to Google ’s servers , where it is charted .
Google plans to enhance PowerMeter with “ social ” tools that will allow users to compare their electricity consumption with that of their neighbors or friends .
And it plans to allow third parties to develop their own applications that would enhance its usefulness .
A programmer , for instance , could create a tool that normalizes the data for variations in weather .
About 30 Google employees , including co-founder Sergey Brin , are currently using PowerMeter in their homes .
Ms. Olsen Cahill said that on a recent morning she checked the tool on her computer when she woke up and noticed that her usage was about 600 watts , or triple her typical consumption level .
That sent her looking around the house for answers .
“ It turns out my husband had used the toaster oven the night before and the dial got stuck , ” Ms. Olsen Cahill said .
“ It had been on all evening . ”
Google said PowerMeter had helped sharply reduce energy use at one Googler ’s house : power savings were down by 44 percent and energy bills were cut by 56 percent over the past year .
( In an recent experiment in Oklahoma , which used technology from a company called Silver Spring Networks , homeowners who had real - time information about their power consumption and the price of electricity at that moment saved an average of 15 percent on their bills . )
PowerMeter was developed jointly between Google.org and a small team of engineers working at Google itself .
Google said that it developed PowerMeter because it fitted with both its goal to organize the world ’s information and its environmentally oriented philosophy and philanthropic goals .
The company said it had no plans to generate revenue from the service at this time , either through a fee or through advertisements .
Then again , Google often releases products free and later decides to place advertisements on them .
And of course , Google , which excels at making money from the data it collects about users ’ online activities , could probably figure out novel ways to make money based on detailed information about their energy use .
Google also hopes that the PowerMeter announcement will raise the profile of its advocacy efforts .
PowerMeter ’s success depends on the deployment of so - called smart meters that measure energy consumption in real time .
While some state regulators have ordered utilities to deploy smart meters , their focus has been on their use by utilities and grid managers , said Michael Terrell , a program manager at Google.org , who works on the company ’s energy policy initiatives .
“ There is not much in the mandates about how the information should flow to consumers , ” Mr. Terrell said .
He said that he hoped PowerMeter , and similar tools for consumers being developed by other companies , would help showcase the importance of getting information into consumers ’ hands .
“ Ultimately when you get people engaged you will see demand pull from people to get these services , ” he said .
“ We are at the moment where we have the potential to revolutionize the way people use energy . ”
Mr. Terrell , who also has PowerMeter installed in his San Francisco apartment , said the tool could be an eye - opener : turning on his kitchen halogen lights , for instance , raised his baseline energy use by a startling 100 percent , he said .
“ It changes the way you think about electricity , ” he said .
Officers reported " an unusual smell " coming from the car
Police officers rushed to hospital after a suspicious substance was thrown through a car window were released when it was identified as HP sauce .
The Metropolitan Police said officers responded to reports of an " unusual smell " coming from a car with a smashed window in Enfield , north London .
They saw an unknown brown substance inside and those who came into contact with it were taken to hospital .
No arrests have been made over the incident in the early hours of Friday .
The spokesman said : " Officers who came into contact with the substance were taken to hospital as a precautionary measure .
" The substance was eventually identified as a harmless food substance . "
Humans have been historically eager to kill each other .
Throughout history , we 've thought up all sorts of nutty reasons to slaughter our fellow man that had nothing to do with immediate survival of the fittest .
We tend to chalk all these wars up to cultural differences fed by a species - wide need to be ideologically right ( and impose that right - ness on others ) , along with a knack for weapons discovery culminating in a technology boom that 's constantly supplying bigger and better ways to off each other .
Add governments to the mix , and you 've got a big steaming pile of questionably necessary interspecies violence .
So it 's a little — but not a lot — surprising that the growing scientific consensus is that war not only dates back to the origins of humankind , but has also played " an integral role " in or species ' evolution .
According to this theory , which emerged during a recent conference at the University of Oregon , the war " instinct " was present in our common ancestor with chimps , and has been a " significant selection pressure on the human species , " as evolutionary psychologist Mark Van Vugt put it .
His and his colleagues ' reasoning goes something like this :
Evidence exists to show that war and humans have been friends since the beginning ( fossils of early humans show wounds consistent with combat injuries ) .
As such , we would have evolved " psychological adaptations to a warlike lifestyle . "
To this end , researchers have presented " the strongest evidence yet that males — whose larger and more muscular bodies make them better suited for fighting — have evolved a tendency towards aggression outside the group but cooperation within it . "
In other words , men have evolved to be team players within their own clans , and be warriors with everyone else — much like the behavior observed in chimpanzees , who regularly engage in short bursts of intergroup violence to weaken neighboring groups of males .
So should we resign ourselves to a future of ever - escalating violence due to our Darwinist predisposition for war ?
Not necessarily , says John Tooby , an evolutionary psychologist at the University of California at Santa Barbara , who insists on looking at the bright side :
" The interesting thing about war is we 're focused on the harm it does ...
But it requires a super - high level of cooperation [ within military organizations ] . "
Fair enough .
Now if we could just figure out how to apply that trait to government .

Children born in areas of heavy traffic areas could be at greater risk of developing asthma due to genetic changes brought on by pollution and acquired in the womb , a new study suggests .
In a study of umbilical cord blood from New York City children , researchers found a change in a gene called ACSL3 that is associated with prenatal exposure to chemical pollutants called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) , which are byproducts of incomplete combustion from carbon - containing fuels , resulting in high levels in heavy - traffic areas .
Exposure to PAHs has previously been linked to diseases such as cancer and childhood asthma .
Researchers say this finding provides a potential clue for predicting environmentally related asthma in children — particularly those born to mothers who live in high - traffic areas like Northern Manhattan and South Bronx when pregnant .
The genetic alterations are called epigenetic changes , which may disrupt the normal functioning of genes by affecting their expression but do not cause structural changes or mutations in the genes .
" Our data support the concept that environmental exposures can interact with genes during key developmental periods to trigger disease onset later in life , and that tissues are being reprogrammed to become abnormal later , " said Shuk - mei Ho , University of Cincinnati researcher and lead author of a paper on the results published in the Feb. 16 issue of the journal PLoS ONE .
{{ video = " 040907Staying_clean " title= " Too Clean ? " caption = " Just to confuse things , scientists also say a super - clean lifestyle can lead to more allergies in children . "
}}
The researchers analyzed umbilical cord white blood cell samples from 56 children for epigenetic alterations related to prenatal PAH exposure in Northern Manhattan and the South Bronx .
The mothers ' exposure to PAHs was monitored during pregnancy using backpack air monitors .
The researchers found a significant association between changes in ACSL3 methylation — a gene expressed in the lung — and maternal PAH exposure .
ACSL3 also was associated with a parental report of asthma symptoms in the children prior to age 5 .
" This research is aimed at detecting early signs of asthma risk so that we can better prevent this chronic disease that affects as many as 25 percent of children in Northern Manhattan and elsewhere , " said Frederica Perera , co-author on the paper from Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health .
More research is needed to confirm the findings , the scientists said .
If the study is confirmed , changes in the ACSL3 gene could serve as a novel biomarker for early diagnosis of pollution - related asthma .
" Understanding early predictors of asthma is an important area of investigation , " said study team member Rachel Miller of the Columbia Center for Children 's Environmental Health .
" because they represent potential clinical targets for intervention . "
The study was funded by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences , the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) and private foundations .
The Obama administration vigorously defended congressional legislation late Wednesday that immunizes U.S. telecommunication companies from lawsuits about their participation in the Bush administration 's domestic spy program .
It was the first time the Obama administration weighed in on a federal court challenge questioning the legality of the legislation President Barack Obama voted for as an Illinois senator in July .
" Accordingly , the court should now promptly dismiss these actions , " the Justice Department wrote ( .pdf ) U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker of San Francisco late Wednesday .
Obama opposed immunity but voted for it because it was included in a new spy bill that gave the U.S. presidency broad , warrantless - surveillance powers .
Justice Department spokesman Matthew Miller said in a statement that the immunity bill " is the law of the land , and as such the Department of Justice defends it in court . "
Walker is weighing a challenge to the immunity legislation in a lawsuit brought by the Electronic Frontier Foundation of San Francisco .
Congress crafted the bill after Walker refused to dismiss separate challenges brought by EFF accusing the nation 's telecoms of violating the rights of millions of Americans for allegedly funneling electronic communications to the National Security Agency without warrants .
The EFF claims Congress was prohibited from legalizing what the EFF termed was unconstitutional activity by the telecommunication companies .
The government claimed immunity was necessary ( .pdf ) because the spying allegations threatened to expose state secrets .
The administration 's legal move should come as no surprise .
During his January confirmation hearings , Attorney General Eric Holder told senators that the Obama administration would defend telco immunity .
" Unless there are compelling reasons , I do n't think we would reverse course , " Holder said .
Two weeks ago , Holder announced a review of litigation inherited from the Bush administration in which the so - called state - secrets privilege was invoked .
Despite the review , the Obama administration is not deviating from its predecessor .
President George W. Bush acknowledged the existence of the so - called Terror Surveillance Program in 2005 .
It authorized the NSA to intercept , without warrants , international communications to or from the United States that the government reasonably believed involved a member or agent of al - Qaeda , or affiliated terrorist organization .
Congress authorized such spying activity in July as part of the immunity legislation .
The EFF 's lawsuit , however , includes documents from a former AT&T technician that the EFF claims describe a secret room in an AT&T building in San Francisco that is wired up to share raw internet traffic with the NSA .
Judge Walker did not indicate when he would rule .

Solar and Wind Powered Portable Charger Debuts at CES
January 10th , 2009 by Jerry James Stone
[ social_buttons ]
Not to be mistaken for a solar powered desk fan ( which is what I thought it was ) , the crafty Kenisis K2 is a solar and wind powered 2 - in - 1 charger for all your USB needs .
It can power a typical cell phone 5 - times over on a full charge !
Um , where do I sign up ?
And while it ’s designed to harvest the power of nature , it ’s also quite practical .
It also includes an AC adapter for when Mother Nature is n’t cooperating .
You can stand the device up or hang it from your bike .
I like that idea since I sit next to a big sunny window at work – though I wish the wind turbine would also operate as a fan .
The device is expected to run for about $ 100 .
Engadget has a nice video of the device from CES here .
LED indicators let you know how much juice the device has , and it has internal storage for multiple adapter tips .

WASHINGTON , Jan 21 ( Reuters ) - A last - minute bid by the outgoing chief federal communications regulator to deepen a probe of Comcast Corp CMCSA.
O is fueling the hopes of those pushing for unfettered access to the Internet .
The Federal Communications Commission said this week that Comcast ’s attempt to revise the practices it uses to manage Internet traffic unfairly favors its own voice Internet service .
The last day at the FCC of Kevin Martin , the outgoing Republican chief , was Tuesday , which leaves the issue to his successor .
Democratic sources say the new chairman will be technology executive Julius Genachowski , who advised President Barack Obama on his technology agenda during the transition period .
“ The president has long been a supporter of net neutrality ; his positions are clear , ” said Ben Scott , policy director of the group Free Press , which urged the FCC to look into Comcast ’s practices .
“ And Genachowski was the driver behind ( Obama ’s ) technology platform . ”
In a precedent - setting decision last year , the five - member FCC voted 3 - 2 to uphold a complaint accusing Comcast of violating the FCC ’s open - Internet principles by blocking file - sharing services , such as those that distribute video and television shows .
“ What this represents in my view is the commission taking seriously what it started with its investigation of Comcast , ” Scott said .
The case became a flash point in a debate over a concept known as “ network neutrality , ” which pits open - Internet advocates against some Internet service providers , which say they need to take reasonable steps to manage ever - growing traffic on their networks for the good of all users .
Comcast , which is appealing the FCC ’s earlier decision , has since revised its practices .
But the FCC said in a letter this week that the company is still discriminating , this time in how it treats voice over Internet protocol , or VoIP , calls .
The FCC wants “ a detailed justification for Comcast ’s disparate treatment of its own VoIP service as compared to that offered by other VoIP providers on its network , ” agency staff wrote in a letter dated Jan. 18 .
A spokeswoman for Comcast could not be reached for comment .
The FCC has guidelines to prevent Internet service providers , like Comcast or telephone companies AT&T Inc T.N and Verizon Communications VZ.N , from discriminating against certain network traffic .
Backers of net neutrality want teeth behind those guidelines and some back legislation to codify them .
Andrew Schwartzman , president of the nonprofit Media Access Project , said that other Internet Service Providers ( ISPs ) are watching the FCC and the court decision on Comcast ’s appeal .
“ So far as we can tell , the only ISP which tried to use this highly questionable technique was Comcast , ” he said .
“ But they all would like to do it -- they are watching this case . ”

If you have n’t been following Eric Kleefeld ’s bang - up coverage of the Minnesota Senate election saga at TPMDC ( come to think of it , this fiasco pre-dates the launch of TPMDC and dates back to our TPM Election Central days — just another reminder that here it is almost March and the results of the Nov. 4 election are still unresolved ) , then you may not be aware of where things are headed .
But there ’s been an ominous turn in Minnesota , so let me bring you up to speed .
In a nutshell , Norm Coleman has lost but refuses to concede and now wants to throw out the original election , the one he lost , and hold a new one .
Coleman was ahead after the initial tally on election night , but then found himself 225 votes behind Al Franken after the state - mandated recount .
So Coleman sued to have the results of the election overturned by a court , primarily ( though not exclusively ) on the grounds that certain absentee ballots were counted that should n’t have been and others were n’t counted but should have been .
That ’s most of what the twists and turns of the legal dispute have been about ( a political junkies dream , really ) .
But five weeks into the election contest trial , the court has repeatedly issued rulings that narrow Coleman ’s chances of either collecting enough newly counted ballots or throwing out already counted ballots — or some combination of the two .
So in recent days , the Coleman legal team has become increasingly shrill in its attacks not just on the court but on the entire electoral process in Minnesota , getting closer every day to outright calling for the Nov. 4 election be declared null and void and a whole new election be held between Coleman and Franken .
And now Coleman himself has suggested that a do - over election may be necessary .
In the background of course is the fact that the longer the legal dispute drags on , the longer Senate Democrats are denied an important 59th vote , in the person of Al Franken .
But let ’s not allow that to distract from the fact that Coleman ( and the GOP ) still desperately wants to win , and has shown himself willing to do just about anything to get there .
Throwing your hands up and saying let ’s just call the election a tie and do it again is the desperate last act of a losing candidate .
That this ploy requires attacking the entire electoral process and the people who conduct elections in the state is just a sign of his desperation .
But apparently even the Coleman camp is starting to see that a do - over election is the only avenue still open to Coleman that might , albeit remotely , allow him to return to his seat .
For years , and certainly most loudly since the Florida debacle of 2000 , Republicans have made ill - founded election hijinks charges against Democrats .
But Norm Coleman , with the support of national Republicans ( keep in mind that one of Coleman ’s lawyers is Ben Ginsberg , the Bush campaign ’s top lawyer in 2000 ) is now poised to try to pull off what would be perhaps a bigger election robbery than Bush v. Gore : toss out the nearly three million votes cast on one of the most - anticipated election days in this nation ’s history in favor of a much smaller special do - over election .
It ’s breath - taking .
Yet for some reason this story still seems to be flying below the national political radar .
WASHINGTON , Dec 5 ( Reuters ) - President - elect Barack Obama has begun laying the groundwork for overhauling the troubled U.S. healthcare system , reaching out to interest groups and building grass - roots support for the huge undertaking .
Obama , who takes office on Jan. 20 , is using many of the Internet tools employed in his election campaign to engage the public .
His Internet site www.change.gov asks people to submit ideas for changing the costly and inefficient system that leaves tens of millions uninsured .
" Every American is feeling the pressure of high health costs and lack of quality care , and we feel it 's important to engage them in the process of reform , " said Obama transition team spokeswoman Stephanie Cutter .
" Change starts from the ground up , and we believe that 's true on critical issues like healthcare reform as well . "
Obama 's coordinator on healthcare , former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle , will participate in a healthcare reform debate in Colorado on Friday that is expected to begin detailing the plans for change .
During the campaign , Obama pledged to bring health insurance to millions of uninsured Americans and spend about $ 50 billion to make U.S. health records electronic .
Many health reform advocates believe Obama will need broad public support to overhaul an industry that has become among the most intractable of U.S. political problems .
Voters put healthcare reform as their third biggest concern after the economy and the Iraq war .
Finding the money and ingenuity to fix the system will be difficult .
The United States now spends more on healthcare than any other developed nation , yet has some 47 million people without health insurance .
Most insured people receive coverage through their employers but businesses complain that exploding costs threaten their competitiveness in a global market .
High worker healthcare costs have been cited as a major reason why U.S. automakers , which are seeking $ 34 billion from the federal government , are in such trouble .
U.S. healthcare costs now account for about 16 percent of U.S. gross domestic product -- or $ 2.3 trillion -- a proportion projected to grow to 20 percent or $ 4 trillion by 2015 .
UNSUSTAINABLE SYSTEM
John Castellani , president of the Business Roundtable , part of a health reform coalition that includes the AARP , an advocacy group for older Americans , and the Service Employees International Union , said maintaining the status quo was not an option .
" The current system and its costs and inefficiencies is really unsustainable , " he said .
Daschle , the former South Dakota Democratic senator who is expected to be tapped by Obama to be health and human services secretary , has been in talks with consumer , business , labor and health industry groups that have a stake in reform .
" I think this is going to be a very cooperative endeavor that will involve both the president and ( nominated ) Secretary Daschle and the Congress , " said Ron Pollack , executive director of Families USA , a healthcare reform advocacy group .
" Obama and Tom Daschle are going to work very closely with the Congress in developing a proposal , " he added .
Obama will be able to lean on the grass - roots networks of groups that supported him during the election campaign , such as the Service Employees International Union , which represents more than a million healthcare workers .
Any reform has its winners and losers and while there is broad agreement the current system is unsustainable , many competing groups -- consumers , labor unions , pharmaceutical companies , insurers and health professionals -- will be pushing to protect their interests .
Lawmakers have already swung into action even though the new Congress will not be seated until Jan .
6 .
" We are thrilled that there is this much activity this early on by this many committed leaders because the issue of healthcare reform is just that important , " said Jim Dau , spokesman for AARP .

The Israelis appear to have learned from the Bush - Cheney administration .
On Monday morning , NPR ran an interview with Michael Oren , an American - Israeli best - selling military historian and Israeli reservist who is a spokesperson for the Israeli military .
( He has also been a contributing editor for The New Republic . )
Asked if the goal of the current Israeli operation in Gaza is regime change –that is , the expulsion of Hamas from power–he replied that Israelis “ do not want to see continuation of Hamas rule in Gaza , ” but added , “ It is not Israel ’s explicit goal to topple the Hamas government … .
That is not the stated goal of this operation .
If it happens … there will be many people happy about it …
The stated goal is to restore security to the southern part of Israel . ”
This line echoes the rhetoric used by Bush - Cheney officials in 2002 and 2003 .
They repeatedly noted that the United States officially favored regime change in Iraq but that the invasion to come was about WMDs and security .
If it took regime change to neutralize that supposed dire WMD threat posed by Saddam Hussein , so be it .
The parallels between the Gaza offensive and the Iraq invasion are limited .
Palestinian militants , with their rocket attacks , have posed a real threat to Israelis–thirteen Israelis have been killed by the rocket fire since 2005 – and Saddam , despite the Bush - Cheney hype , had not posed a direct threat to Americans .
( This is not to say the Israeli response , which has led to the deaths of scores of civilians , is either justified or wise . )
But Oren ’s phrasing does mirror that used by the Bushies : we ’re not in this for regime change , but ….
One question , though , is , what is the alternative in Gaza to Hamas ?
As The Washington Post noted ,
With Hamas ’s political rival , Fatah , committed to negotiating with Israel rather than fighting it , Hamas has a virtual monopoly on armed Palestinian resistance .
That status has the potential to add to the movement ’s popularity among Palestinians , and in the broader Arab world .
Regime destruction is not the same as regime change .
Can the Israelis even literally destroy Hamas ?
That ’s debatable .
And it may be harder to replace Hamas than to eradicate it .
For the most part these browsers partially support the numerical scale , but only for two weights ; Regular and either Bold or Semibold .
A workaround
There is a workaround .
Following on the heels of Guillermo Esteves , it involves the clever addition of some font - families .
As well as the font ’s family name – Myriad Pro in the test case – each installed font weight has two other names : the screen name , eg. Myriad Pro Light and the PostScript name , eg. MyriadPro- Light ( to find these names , use a font management tool such as FontExplorer X and click info for the font ) .
To get Opera , IE 8 , Firefox 2 and Firefox 3 / Win to render an alternative weight , you need to specify the screen name , so the test case would need to be modified as follows :
# one { font - weight : 100 ; font - family : " Myriad Pro Light " , " Myriad Pro " ; }
However this does n’t work in Safari , which needs the PostScript name .
So your styles need to be further modified , as in the modified test case :
# one { font - weight : 100 ; font - family : " MyriadPro - Light " , " Myriad Pro Light " , " Myriad Pro " ; }
There are distinct downsides to this workaround .
Obviously the first is that you need to specify at least three font families just to change the weight .
But the main problem is that font - weight will no longer work ( apart from in Firefox 3 / Mac ) as the font - family you are now specifying only contains the one weight .
So if you need an Bold word within a Light weight paragraph , you ’ll have to specify the font - family as well as the font - weight .
Not very practical .
A couple weeks ago , Barack Obama picked Rick Warren to deliver his Inauguration ’s invocation prayer .
The gay community was ( rightfully ) mad .
At the same time , Obama announced that Rev. Joseph Lowery would give the benediction prayer .
Lowery is a little better on gay issues , but he still opposes gay marriage .
Atheists were mad that prayer was being used in the inauguration in the first place :
Why was he mixing church and state ?
( We even filed a lawsuit . )
What has Obama done to respond to our frustration and anger ?
He ’s brought on two more Christian pastors .
Sharon Watkins will deliver a prayer next Wednesday ( after the Inauguration ) at the Washington National Cathedral as part of the National Prayer Service .
She ’s part of a liberal church .
Good for her .
But this is a problem .
Rev. Gene Robinson will offer a prayer at the Lincoln Memorial this Sunday .
Robinson is an openly gay bishop .
Good for him .
He says he will offer a prayer for the whole nation , not just Christians , but he ’s part of the problem , too .
What ’s the problem ?
There should n’t be prayer at these government gatherings in the first place .
Many are public events funded by taxpayer money .
They should be free of religion .
…
So here ’s what I ’m doing and where I could use your help .
I suspect we ’ll be hearing a lot of God talk over the next week from these four pastors .
For every mention of the words “ Jesus , ” “ Lord , ” “ God , ” or “ Christ ” during the four prayers next week , I am going to make a $ 5 donation to the Secular Coalition for America — a lobbying group in Washington working to support the rights of non-religious people and educating Congress about the separation of church and state .
Will you do the same ?
Pledge the amount you plan to give per Godly - word - mentioned in the comments — any amount is ok !
Then honor your commitment after next Wednesday .
I ’ll tally the numbers and report back .
Please spread the word — blog it , Facebook it , inform the social bookmarkers — and help raise money for a good cause .
Let ’s turn this travesty into something positive .
By Dave Lindorff
President Barack Obama and his economic team are being careful to couch all their talk about economic stimulus programs and bank bailout programs in warnings that the economic downturn is serious and that it will take considerable time to bounce back .
I ’m reminded of an experience I had with Chinese medicine when I was living in Shanghai back in 1992 .
I had come down with a nasty case of the flu while teaching journalism at Fudan University on a Fulbright Scholar program .
A Chinese colleague suggested I go to the university clinic .
When I told him there was n’t much point since doctors could n’t do much for the flu besides recommend fluids and bed rest , he said , “ That ’s Western doctors .
You could go to the Chinese medicine doctors at the clinic .
They can help you . ”
I figured , what the hell , and we went .
The doctor inquired into the lurid details of my illness — how my bowel movements looked , the color of the mucus in my nose , etc .
He did n’t really examine me physically .
Then he prescribed an incredible number of pills and teas and sent me home with a huge bag of stuff , and instructions on the regimen for taking them through the course of each day .
I followed the directions dutifully , and my colleague came by each day to check on my progress .
By the fifth day , when I was still running a fever and feeling terrible , I told him I did n’t think the Chinese medicine was working .
He replied confidently , “ Chinese medicine takes a long time to work . ”
I laughed at this .
“ Sure , ” I said .
“ But the flu only lasts a week or so , and now , when I get better , you ’ll say it was the Chinese medicine , right ? ”
He smiled and agreed .
“ Yes .
You are right . ”
Obviously the Obama administration recognizes that it needs to keep the finger of blame for the current economic collapse squarely pointed at the Bush administration , which is certainly fair in large part ( though the Clinton deregulation of the banking industry played a major part in the financial crisis and its enthusiastic promotion of globalization began the massive shift of jobs overseas that has left the nation ’s productive capacity hollowed out ) .
But it also seems to recognize that it cannot tell the bitter truth , which is that our national economy will never “ bounce back ” to where it was in 2007 .
America , and individual Americans , have been living profligately for years in an unreal economy , propped up by easy credit which inflated the value of real estate to incredible levels , and which led people to spend way beyond their means .
Ordinary middle - class working people have been encouraged to buy obscenely oversized homes at 5 % down , or even no down payment .
They have been lured into buying cars the size of trucks , one for each driving - aged member of the family ( in our town , so many high school kids drive to school that the school ran out of parking spaces and the yellow school buses , largely empty on their runs , are referred to by the students as the “ shame train , ” an embarrassment to be seen riding ) .
They ’ve installed individual back - yard swimming pools , unwilling to share the water with their neighbors in community pools .
Boring faux ethnic restaurant franchises of all kinds have befouled the landscape , filling up with families too stressed out to cook , and willing to endure over - salted , over - priced and tasteless cuisine and tacky plastic décor night after night .
Now this is all crashing down .
Property values are in free - fall .
Car sales have fallen off a cliff .
Joblessness is soaring ( At present , it ’s approaching an official rate of 8 % , but if the methodology used in 1980 , before the Reagan administration changed it to hide the depth of that era ’s deep recession , were applied , it would be 17 % today , or one in seven workers ) .
Eventually , the economic slide will hit bottom and begin its slow climb back , as all recessions do , but there will be no return to the days of $ 500,000 McMansion developments , three - car garages and a new car every two or three years for both parents plus a car for each highschooler .
Not only will banks no longer be able to offer such credit to clients .
People , having been burned , will not be willing to borrow so much .
Company health care benefits , pension programs or 401 ( k ) matching programs that were slashed during this downturn will not be restored when the economy picks up again .
Over the last 20 years , America has degenerated into a nation of consumers , with 72 percent of Gross Domestic Product ( sic ) now being accounted for by consumer spending — most of it going for things that are produced overseas and shipped here .
That is not an economic model that is sustainable , and it is a model that has just suffered what is certainly a mortal blow .
What we are now seeing is the beginning of an inevitable downward adjustment in American living standards to conform with our actual place in the world .
As a nation of consumers , and not producers , with little to offer to the rest of the world except raw materials , food crops , military hardware and bad films ( none of which industries employ many people ) , we are headed to a recovery that will not feel like a recovery at all .
Eventually , productive capacity will be restored , as lowered US wages make it again profitable for some things to be made here at home again , but like people in the 1930s looking back at the Roaring 20s of yore , we are going to look back at the last two decades as some kind of dream .
It would be better if the new administration would be honest about this , because with honesty , we could have a recovery program that would actually address the real critical issues facing the country — the decline of our educational system , the irrationality of official promotion of home ownership that has led to the proliferation not just of suburbs but of exurbs , the over - reliance on the automobile for transportation , the unprecedented waste of resources , the pillaging of the environment , not to mention the decimation of the retirement system and the creation of a vast medical - industrial complex that is sucking the life - blood out of families and businesses alike .
With honesty , we could also confront the other big obstacle to national recovery — the nation ’s obsession with militarism and foreign wars .
The honest truth is that the US is technically bankrupt and in a state of chronic decline , and yet the nation persists in spending a trillion dollars a year on war and preparations for war , as though America were in mortal danger from foreign enemies .
The truth is that we are not threatened by Communism , by drug lords , or by Muslim Jihadists in any serious way .
Rather , we have become our own worst enemy .
The administration could start by telling us all this straight up , but the problem is , most of us probably do n’t want to hear it , which explains why we ’re not hearing it .
It also explains why we ’re about to blow another trillion or so dollars on propping up failing banks , funding pointless highway and bridge construction , and blowing up illiterate peasants in remote places like Afghanistan and Pakistan .

Political pundits are debating whether Senator Barack Obama ’s decision to spend time with his gravely ill grandmother poses a political risk .
But anyone who has ever had an ailing family member knows about another type of risk : the risk of regret .
During a recent lunch , a friend talked with me about how a grueling workload and onerous deadlines were making it difficult for her to visit her mother , who has been struggling with a health problem .
But it was also clear to her that her family must come first .
“ I do n’t want to have regrets , ” she told me .
Today ’s New York Times story “ Obama Takes Time for a Woman Dear to Him ” makes clear that this is a lesson that Mr. Obama has learned the hard way .
“ The biggest mistake I made was not being at my mother ’s bedside when she died , ” he told The Chicago Sun -Times in 2004 .
“ She was in Hawaii in a hospital , and we did n’t know how fast it was going to take , and I did n’t get there in time . ”
When my own mother was diagnosed with terminal cancer , I had just taken a brief leave of absence to work on a book project .
I tried to multi-task , spending time with her and working on my book when I could , but it was n’t going well .
My mother kept urging me to focus on work , but instead I made the decision to focus on my mom .
It meant missing the deadline and jeopardizing the project , but that risk was far easier to accept than the risk of regret for missing time with my mom .
Given that my mother ’s illness progressed far more quickly than we anticipated , it was clearly the right decision .
There were consequences , of course .
Key deadlines were missed and the editor was furious , but I never regretted my choice to be by my mother ’s side when she drew her last breath .
But I was lucky to have had a choice .
The stakes are so much higher not just for Mr. Obama , but for those people who risk losing their jobs entirely if they need extended leave to care for an ailing family member .

Cold pizza passes the taste test
A Scottish chemistry lecturer believes she has discovered the scientific reason why cold , left - over pizza , tastes so good the morning after .
Dr Maureen Cooper , from Stirling University , says the answer lies in the properties of the tomato puree .
The traditional pizza base has fibres which trap water , preventing it from seeping through to the cooked dough and making it soggy .
Given that fat and water do not mix , the melted cheese topping then sits nicely above the puree .
Dr Cooper explained : " We all see the grease on plates which causes washing - up liquid to float on top .
" That is because oil and water do not mix .
That same phenomenon can be applied to the cold pizza .
" Because the fat does not go through to the base , the pizza itself tastes so much better .
" That is not the same for chips , which are not recommended for eating cold .
National Science Week " Unfortunately the chips do n't taste nice because the fat congeals .
It 's the fat which goes solid when the food is no longer warm .
" However , oil at room temperature stays liquid , which feels much nicer on the tongue . "
Dr Cooper made public her research during the recent National Science Week , which set out to make the subject more interesting to the general public .
The scientist also thinks she can explain why cold curry tastes much better the day after .
" Spices that are used to make a curry are those which promote digestion .
" So , in terms of aromatherapy , things like clove oil , ginger and garlic are all essential oils which help digestion .
While the left - over curry sits , the oils and spices are continuing to tenderise the meat .
" By eating curries we are giving ourselves an aromatherapy session from the inside out . "
A veteran British Jewish lawmaker , Sir Gerald Kaufman , has compared the Israeli offensive in Gaza to the Nazis who forced his family to flee from Poland .
Kaufman , who was brought up as an orthodox Jew and Zionist , said : " My grandmother was ill in bed when the Nazis came to her home town a German soldier shot her dead in her bed .
" My grandmother did not die to provide cover for Israeli soldiers murdering Palestinian grandmothers in Gaza .
" The present Israeli government ruthlessly and cynically exploits the continuing guilt from gentiles over the slaughter of Jews in the Holocaust as justification for their murder of Palestinians . "
Above : Sir Gerald Kaufman addresses British MPs
He said the claim that many of the Palestinian victims were militants " was the reply of the Nazi " and added : " I suppose the Jews fighting for their lives in the Warsaw ghetto could have been dismissed as militants . "
My grandmother did not die to provide cover for Israeli soldiers murdering Palestinian grandmothers in Gaza
He accused the Israeli government of seeking " conquest " and added : " They are not simply war criminals , they are fools . "
Kaufman called for a total arms ban on Israel .
“ It is time for our government to make clear to the Israeli government that its conduct and policies are unacceptable and to impose a total arms ban on Israel . ”
He also branded the Israeli PM , the foreign minister and defense minister as war criminals .
“ Is it not an incontrovertible fact that Olmert , Livni and Barak are mass murderers and war criminals ? ”
In a BBC interview Kaufman said about the rising Palestinian death toll : " Four Jews against 1,000 Palestinians - that is Nazism . "
Kaufman , 64 , called Israel 's actions " not only barbaric but also stupid " because , he said , terrorism could not be defeated by force of arms .
" It failed in Lebanon and it will fail here , " he said .

Car sleepers in California , hard hit by the housing crisis
By Rajesh Mirchandani
BBC News , Santa Barbara
Santa Barbara boasts a classic laidback California lifestyle , with uncongested beaches , wholesome cafes and charming Spanish - style architecture .
Of course there 's a hefty price tag : nestled between the gentle Santa Ynez mountains and the inviting Pacific Ocean are multi-million dollar homes .
But in this sun-washed haven of wealth , many live far from the American dream .
In a car park across the street from luxury mansions , the evening brings a strange sight .
A few cars arrive and take up spaces in different corners .
In each car , a woman , perhaps a few pets , bags of possessions and bedding .
Across the street from homes with bedrooms to spare , these are Santa Barbara 's car sleepers .
Homeless within the last year , they are a direct consequence of America 's housing market collapse .
4x4 homes
In this woman - only parking lot , Bonnee , who gives only her first name , wears a smart blue dress and has a business - like demeanour .
A year ago , she was making a healthy living as , ironically , a real estate agent .
But when people stopped buying houses , her commission - based income dried up , and , like many clients , she too was unable to pay her mortgage .
Car sleeper Bonnee still works in the real estate business
Soon she found herself with nowhere to live but her 4x4 .
Piles of blankets are in the back of the vehicle .
Personal documents are stuffed into seat pockets .
Books litter the back seat .
A make - up bag and gym membership card ( she washes at the gym ) are in the front .
With her constantly , are photos of her former life .
She can't quite believe her situation .
" My God , America 's heart is bleeding , " she tells me .
Tears fill her eyes .
" I know it 'll get better .
But it feels sad .
I really fought hard . "
A medium - sized 4x4 pulls into the parking lot and 66 - year - old Barbara Harvey gets out .
She opens the back door and two large Golden Retrievers jump out .
Barbara begins her nightly routine .
She moves a few bags from the boot to the front seat and takes out pyjamas and a carton of yoghurt ( her dinner ) .
She then arranges blankets in the back of the car .
It 's not an American dream , it 's an American nightmare
Nancy Kapp
Outreach worker for car sleepers Barbara used to work in housing finance - this is the double whammy of the housing collapse where many who worked in the sector lost their jobs and their homes .
But since April , she and her dogs , Ranger and Phoebe , have spent every night in her car .
It 's cramped , but she says if they sleep diagonally they can all fit .
New trend ?
The car park lets the car sleepers enter from 7 pm , local public toilets close at dusk .
As a result , Barbara says she does n't drink any liquids after she arrives .
In the mornings , she showers at a friend 's house .
Dressed in clean , comfortable clothes and wearing sunglasses , she is far removed from the stereotypical image of homelessness .
" I do n't think I fit into anybody 's image , " she says .
" There 's going to be lots of homeless individuals who are middle - class , there can't be anything but .
We 're in an awful mess economically .
I do n't think we 've seen half of what 's going to happen in this country . "
It 's hard to keep things clean .
It 's hard to feel complete and whole
Paige Miller
This new phenomenon of middle - class homelessness is hard to quantify , but New Beginnings , an organisation that runs the car park sleeping scheme in Santa Barbara , says they accommodate some 55 people in a dozen parking lots .
Outreach worker Nancy Kapp , once homeless herself , says there is a waiting list for car park spaces and she is getting more and more calls each day from people about to lose their homes .
She identifies it as a new breed of homeless emerging in America .
' American nightmare ' " Being poor is like this cancer , and now this cancer is filtering up to the middle - class , " she says .
" I do n't care how strong you are , it 's a breakdown of the human psyche when you start to lose everything you have . "
" These people have worked their whole lives to have a house and now it 's crumbling and it's in ashes and how devastating is that ? " she says .
" It 's not an American dream , it 's an American nightmare . "
California house prices fell by 30 % in the year to May .
Few parts of America have been hit as hard .
But national housing groups say they have seen a rise in homelessness across the US since the foreclosure crisis began last year .
The Miller family feel " cramped " in their small mobile home
In another car park in Santa Barbara , Craig Miller , his wife Paige and their two children say they feel cramped in the small mobile home where they have been living for several months .
" It 's hard to keep things clean , " says Paige .
" It 's hard to feel complete and whole . "
Originally from Florida , the family used to own a four - bedroom house with a pool .
But when Craig 's business failed , they lost it .
Undeterred , the family embarked on a dream to drive across America and make a new start in California .
But unable to find full - time work , and unable to afford rent , as Craig puts it " we got stuck " .
He says it was like a holiday at first but now it is much harder .
" Getting money for food , it 's not something we 've had to think about before , " says Craig .
" We 're definitely looking forward to getting out and getting a place .
And we 're working hard at getting there .
This is just the journey , it 's not the destination . '
As darkness falls on Santa Barbara , the car sleepers settle in for the night .
They 'll have to be up early : they are not allowed to stay in the car parks beyond 7 am .
Some work , others spend their days driving from one spot to another .
When evening comes around again , they return to their car park homes .
In comparison to other countries , and indeed America 's own long - term homeless , they are still fortunate .
But as America 's economic crisis deepens , could there soon be more of them ?

Before his inauguration today President Barack Obama received a hand delivered letter from Nelson Mandela .
He praised Obama for bring a new voice of hope to the world ’s problems .
Mandela wrote , “ Your election to this high office has inspired people as few other events in recent times have done .
Amidst all of the human progress made over the last century the world in which we live remains one of great divisions , conflict , inequality , poverty and injustice .
Amongst many around the world a sense of hopelessness had set in as so many problems remain unresolved and seemingly incapable of being resolved .
You , Mister President , have brought a new voice of hope that these problems can be addressed and that we can in fact change the world and make of it a better place . ”
He made the comparison between Obama ’s inauguration and South Africa ’s transition to democracy , “ We are in some ways reminded today of the excitement and enthusiasm in our own country at the time of our transition to democracy .
People , not only in our country but around the world , were inspired to believe that through common human effort injustice can be overcome and that together a better life for all can be achieved . ”

Mandela wrote about the excitement in Africa over Obama , “ There is a special excitement on our continent today , Mister President , in the knowledge that you have such strong personal ties with Africa .
We share in that excitement and pride .
We are aware that the expectations of what your Presidency will achieve are high and that the demands on you will be great .
We therefore once more wish you and your family strength and fortitude in the challenging days and years that lie ahead .
You will always be in our affection as a young man who dared to dream and to pursue that dream .
We wish you well . ”
Nelson Mandela ’s letter serves as a reminder that Obama , more than other recent presidents , has global expectations on him .
Mandela is right about the enthusiasm about Obama .
It is almost palpable everywhere you go .
Part of this is due to the new president himself , but I suspect that a big chunk of it is also due to the country ’s desire for a fresh start , and to forget about the Bush years .
Mandela ’s eloquent letter demonstrates that hope is a universal message .

The Boston Red Sox agreed to a deal with free - agent outfielder Rocco Baldelli on Thursday .
It is expected to be officially announced at the Boston Baseball Writers Dinner , where Baldelli will be honored .
Baldelli , 27 , has been limited to 155 games the last three years because of a mitochondrian disorder , a condition that leaves him feeling extremely fatigued after just a brief workout .
Baldelli recently underwent a series of tests as Massachusetts General Hospital and the results were positive .
The Red Sox were struck by Baldelli's persona and are optimistic he can be a significant contributor in 2009 .
Peter Gammons covers Major League Baseball for ESPN .
As soon as they start sliding , there 's an inevitability to the result .
A cup of coffee daily will help you in more ways than you suspect .
For example , the daily dose of caffeine can keep Alzheimer ’s illness in check , can help reduce cholesterol , protects against dementia , and reduces the risk of developing type 2 diabetes .
Recent studies have also determined positive effects on performance when consuming caffeine before exercise .
Caffeine addiction is real , but is it really that big a deal when compared to all the positive effects ?
Coffee Fights Cholesterol
A daily dose of caffeine blocks the disruptive consequences of high cholesterol that scientists link with Alzheimer ’s illness .
Caffeine equivalent of merely a daily cup of Joe from could protect the blood - brain barrier ( BBB ) from damage that happens with a fat heavy diet , according to a study .
The BBB protects the central nervous system ( CNS ) from the remainder of the body ’s circulation , providing the brain with its own controlled micro-environment .
Prior research has demonstrated that raised levels of cholesterol break down the BBB that may then no longer protect the CNS from the damage due to blood borne contamination .
Coffee Fights Alzheimer’s
BBB leakage happens in a selection of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer ’s illness .
In this report , analysts of Varsity of North Dakota ( UND ) gave rabbits 3 mg caffeine daily or the equivalent of a typical daily mug of joe .
The rabbits were fed a cholesterol - enriched diet in this time .
After twelve weeks some lab tests indicated the BBB was noticeably more intact in rabbits receiving a daily dose of caffeine .
Findings of the study have been broadcast in the open access Book of Neuroinflammation .
“ Caffeine seems to block several of the disruptive results of cholesterol that make the blood - brain barrier leaky , ” asserts Jonathan Geige of UND .
“ High levels of cholesterol are a risk factor for Alzheimer ’s illness , maybe by compromising the protecting nature of the blood - brain barrier .
For the 1st time we ’ve shown that chronic ingestion of caffeine protects the BBB from cholesterol - induced leakage .
Caffeine is a safe and widely available drug and its capability to stabilize the blood - brain barrier means it may have a vital part to play in therapies against neurological disorders . ”
Coffee Fights Dementia
Danish and Swedish analysts have revealed that folk who drank 3 to 5 cups of coffee daily were sixty five percent not as likely to have developed dementia , compared to people who drank two cups or less .
Earlier studies have linked coffee to a number of health perks that will contribute to this latest finding .
Coffee drinkers have shown a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes , less plaque formation in the brain , and reduced vascular risk – all 3 of these effects could contribute to lowering Alzheimer ’s risk .
Coffee is n’t the single thing that will help you increase your brain .
A new British study shows that vitamin D could help ward off dementia and lower your risk for Parkinson ’s illness .
Next time you grab your cup of coffee from Brickell Coffee shop remember to either sit out in the sun for a few minutes or toss back some vitamin D , your brain will thank you .
Not Good for Pregnant Moms
Caffeine would possibly not be good for to - be-moms as it increases the danger of miscarriage .
But Good for Girls
A new report has discovered that drinking 3 cups of coffee daily can help forestall ovarian cancer in girls .
A gang of global analysts has carried out the study and revealed that ladies who take caffeine identical to 3 cups of coffee common - or - garden are not as likely to develop ovarian cancer later in life .
“ We noted a major inverse trend of ovarian cancer risk with caffeine intake .
The reasons why caffeine protects against ovarian cancer is n’t clear and further studies will be carried out , ” lead analyst Shelley Tworoger of Harvard Medical Faculty wrote in the ‘ Cancer ’ book .
Cancer Study Details
The team came to the conclusion that coffee helps prevent cancer after analyzing the consequences of coffee intake on a grouping of nurses .
The analysts compared the diets of eighty thousand of these girls with the prevalence of ovarian cancer as a part of the study between 1976 and 2004 .
According to the analysts , 737 of them developed ovarian cancer in the study period .
Those that had at least 3 cups of coffee a day were found to be 20 % not as likely to develop the illness than those who drank none .
Moreover , people who failed to select hormone replacement care , the chance was 43 % less .
To Drink Or Not to Drink ?
The advantages and risks of drinking coffee remain the topic of much debate .
I ’m not saying that you should start drinking 5 cups of coffee a day if you do n’t already drink coffee .
But clearly you should n’t feel so bad if you DO drink several cups a day .
Check out this list of the best coffee makers to find the home - based solution that ’s right for you .
I personally love my Kureg but any old model should do .
It ’s always more convenient to have a pot brewed and ready for a refresher .
If you would like to remain healthy for life , make this easy choice – it ’s the smartest thing you might do for your brain .

Bush Decides to Keep GuantÃ¡namo Open
By STEVEN LEE MYERS
October 21 , 2008
Copyright 2008 The New York Times Company
WASHINGTON – Despite his stated desire to close the American prison at GuantÃ¡namo Bay , Cuba , President Bush has decided not to do so , and never considered proposals drafted in the State Department and the Pentagon that outlined options for transferring the detainees elsewhere , according to senior administration officials .
Mr. Bush ’s top advisers held a series of meetings at the White House this summer after a Supreme Court ruling in June cast doubt on the future of the American detention center .
But Mr. Bush adopted the view of his most hawkish advisers that closing GuantÃ¡namo would involve too many legal and political risks to be acceptable , now or any time soon , the officials said .
The administration is proceeding on the assumption that GuantÃ¡namo will remain open not only for the rest of Mr. Bush ’s presidency but also well beyond , the officials said , as the site for military tribunals of those facing terrorism - related charges and for the long prison sentences that could follow convictions .
The effect of Mr. Bush ’s stance is to leave in place a prison that has become a reviled symbol of the administration ’s fight against terrorism , and to leave another contentious foreign policy decision for the next president .
Both presidential candidates , Senators John McCain and Barack Obama , have called for closing GuantÃ¡namo and could reverse Mr. Bush ’s policy , though probably not quickly since neither has spelled out precisely how to deal with some of the thorniest legal consequences of shutting the prison .
Mr. Bush ’s aides insist that the president ’s desire is still to close GuantÃ¡namo when conditions permit , and the White House has not announced any decision .
But administration officials say that even Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , the most powerful advocates for closing the prison , have quietly acquiesced to the arguments of more hawkish advisers , including Vice President Dick Cheney .
A senior administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the administration ’s internal deliberations said it would be much harder to fulfill a campaign promise to close the prison than either candidate has stated .
“ This may not be the ideal answer , but what we are trying to do is work with the system we ’ve got , ”  the official said .
Mr. Bush ’s decision followed a review of the implications of the Supreme Court ’s ruling in June that the 250 detainees at GuantÃ¡namo have the right to make habeas corpus appeals .
The ruling , Boumediene v. Bush , undercut a core rationale for keeping the prison off American soil , raising expectations that Mr. Bush might at last move to close it , a prospect he first raised in June 2006 , when he said , “ I ’d like to close GuantÃ¡namo , but I also recognize that we ’re holding some people that are darn dangerous , and that we better have a plan to deal with them in our courts . ” 
In August 2007 , Mr. Bush said “ it should be a goal of the nation to shut down GuantÃ¡namo , ”  adding , “ But it is not as easy a subject as some may think on the surface . ” 
Mr. Bush has harshly criticized the ruling , including at least twice in fund - raising speeches for Republicans .
When he met with his senior security advisers , no options for closing the prison were on the agenda , the administration officials said .
“ This is an administration that believes very , very strongly in certain things it has done , ”  said Matthew Waxman , a professor at Columbia Law School who served in the Department of Defense overseeing detainee polices , “ and GuantÃ¡namo is one that some administration officials at high levels believe was right all along . ” 
Mr. Cheney and his chief of staff , David S. Addington , have made it clear in the internal discussions this year that keeping GuantÃ¡namo open under a new president would validate the administration ’s decisions dealing with terrorists , the officials said .
Closing GuantÃ¡namo would most likely mean abandoning prosecutions against some detainees and risking the release of others who still pose a threat to the United States and its allies .
An administration official who favors closing the prison suggested that the next president might reconsider after having access to the classified evidence that the Bush administration believes justifies the indefinite detention of dozens of detainees .
“ The new president will gnash his teeth and beat his head against the wall when he realizes how complicated it is to close GuantÃ¡namo , ”  the official said .
Mr. McCain has suggested moving the detainees to Fort Leavenworth , Kan. , home of the Army ’s prison .
His remarks prompted a letter in June from the two Republican senators from Kansas , Sam Brownback and Pat Roberts , objecting to the idea on a variety of grounds .
Mr. McCain ’s campaign did not respond to requests for comments about GuantÃ¡namo .
The Obama campaign declined to comment specifically , but in his platform , Mr. Obama promises to abolish military tribunals and conduct a review to determine which prisoners to prosecute , which to hold under the laws of war and which to release .
His proposal does not specify where detainees would be held .
Other sites that have been mentioned include the United States Naval Consolidated Brig in Charleston , S.C. , and the United States Penitentiary Administrative Maximum Facility , known as supermax , in Florence , Colo .
Beyond political opposition in those regions , the officials involved in the administration ’s discussions said that bringing the detainees to American soil would allow additional legal challenges beyond habeas corpus and raise the prospect that judges could free them in the United States .
The prospect of that became more acute on Oct. 7 , when a federal judge ordered the release of 17 Uighurs from China who were swept up in 2002 and held in GuantÃ¡namo .
The administration had already dropped efforts to declare the men as enemy combatants , but refused to return them to China because of concerns about the treatment they would receive there , trying unsuccessfully to find a third country to accept them .
The judge , Ricardo M. Urbina of Federal District Court , ordered the detainees brought to his court in Washington to free them , but the Justice Department appealed and won a stay .
One official said that the Justice Department ’s arguments – that the 17 men remained dangerous – complicated diplomatic efforts to find a country other than China willing to accept them .
The government ’s lawyers filed the arguments for a continued stay on Thursday , and on Monday a federal appeals court refused to allow the Uighurs ’ immediate release into the United States to give it time to hear the government ’s full appeal .
Since the Supreme Court decision in June , Mr. Bush and his aides have remained focused on legal strategies for coping with the wave of habeas corpus appeals now flooding the federal court system and seeking new legislation that would allow the government to continue to hold foreign terrorists without charge .
A version of that legislation was introduced by Senators Lindsay Graham , Republican of South Carolina , and Joseph I. Lieberman , independent of Connecticut , two of Mr. McCain ’s closest friends and advisers .
But the legislation stalled and appears unlikely to be adopted during the current session of Congress .
The senior administration official involved in the deliberations said that the Supreme Court ’s ruling did not grant judges the authority to release detainees in the United States , comparing it to allowing an illegal immigrant to live in the country legally without legal standing .
That official and others said that officials from the Department of Homeland Security , along with the Justice Department , have argued most vigorously for keeping GuantÃ¡namo open , largely because a ruling like the Uighur case could result in foreign fighters being freed into American communities .
“ The federal courts have an absolute right to release these people , but the court did n’t say where , and what does that mean , to release them , ”  the senior official said .
“ And in our view , the Supreme Court did n’t say , and the district courts do n’t have the power , to order the United States to bring somebody from a foreign country – a foreigner – into the United States in complete disregard for our immigration law . ” 
Advocates for closing GuantÃ¡namo argued that Mr. Bush is still following the same flawed logic that has made it a reviled symbol , especially abroad .
Mr. Waxman , the former defense official , acknowledged the difficulties of closing the prison and the risks involved , but he argued that after seven years , a radical change was required .
“ Whatever consequence they ’re worried about , ”  he said of the administration ’s concerns , “ has to be weighed against the damage we continue to incur by keeping the status quo . ” 

President Obama 's brave and surprising inaugural address was the 56th of its kind since George Washington delivered the first one in New York on 20 April 1789 .
Over the last two centuries , these speeches have become as thickly encrusted with conventions as the limerick , the sonnet or the Times crossword : they are a bizarre literary form , unique to the United States , with a tiny handful of acknowledged classics ( Lincoln 's two inaugurals , Franklin Roosevelt 's first , and John F Kennedy 's solitaire ) that stand proud of the generally depressing mass of mediocre and bombastic writing , most of which now reads like cold porridge .
Since Andrew Jackson 's time , inaugurals have been designed for outdoor delivery to an often wet and shivering crowd in Washington 's capricious weather .
Even before Inauguration Day was set back on the calendar from 4 March to 20 January in 1937 , the ceremony seems to have been a magnet for snow , rain and frigid northeasterly gales .
Obama was lucky : the sun shone , though the temperature in the National Mall was a forbidding 28 F .
At William Henry Harrison 's March inauguration in 1841 , he stepped to the podium without hat or overcoat , under a louring sky , his trouserlegs flapping in the bitter wind , and delivered the longest address on record .
At nearly 8,500 words , it took Harrison 100 minutes to read aloud to a fast - diminishing audience .
When he died the following month , of pneumonia and pleurisy , it was widely believed that his rash feat of oratory must have been the cause .
In fact , he first showed symptoms of a cold nearly two weeks after the event , but the idea that a presidential inaugural can be fatal has gained such a hold on the American imagination that the legend of Harrison 's death - by - speechmaking lives on , despite the medical evidence against it .
Nineteenth - century presidents could count on crowds of up to 10,000 people milling around the east portico of the Capitol building ; Franklin Roosevelt spoke to 100,000 in 1933 , and more than a million showed up for Lyndon Johnson 's inauguration in 1965 .
At least half a million came when Ronald Reagan changed the venue to the west portico in 1981 , enabling the president to speak to the nation looking symbolically westward , down the Mall , past the Washington and Lincoln monuments , and through the earth 's curvature over three time zones to the Pacific coast .
Crowd estimates are always unreliable , but Obama is said to have drawn 1.8 million people on Tuesday , which , if true , is an all - time record .
The growing crowds and open - air character of the occasion help to account for the ever - increasing grandiosity of language in inaugural addresses .
The words of most inaugurals would sound insane if spoken quietly , indoors ; and they sometimes sound that way when carried on the wind via loudspeakers and vast JumboTron TV screens .
These quadrennial speeches are as close as America comes to the rhetoric heard more than 70 years ago in Red Square , the Piazza Venezia in Rome and the Reichsparteitagsgelände in Nuremberg .
Or , to put it in the more kindly words of Peggy Noonan , the columnist and former Reagan speechwriter , they are " a golden trumpet that a president gets to blow at most twice in his life " .
Four years ago , when George W Bush lifted that trumpet to his lips , he used it to declare a global war on tyranny .
" America , in this young century , proclaims liberty throughout all the world , and to all the inhabitants thereof .
Renewed in our strength - tested , but not weary - we are ready for the greatest achievements in the history of freedom . "
Try saying that across the kitchen table , paying particular attention to your pronunciation of " thereof " , then wait for the arrival of the men in white coats .
Rhetorically speaking , much - too much - is expected from a speech delivered from behind shields of bulletproof glass and introduced by the band of the US Marines playing " Hail to the Chief " , the music punctuated by gunfire from saluting cannons .
Because the president 's language has to struggle to maintain the ceremonial pomp of the occasion , lofty similes and metaphors are the order of the day , and classical tropes , with names like Aegean islands , from Anaphora to Zeugma , are retrieved from storage to give the oration an air of immemorial antiquity .
Inaugurals conventionally start with a history lesson and finish with a prayer .
In the first paragraphs , the newly sworn - in president thanks his predecessor for his service to the nation , applauds the miracle of a peaceful transition ( as if all other countries went in for putsches and coups ) , and reminds America of its unique place as the cradle of modern democracy , summoning the ghosts of his illustrious predecessors , Washington , John Adams , Jefferson , Madison and Lincoln , to crowd around him in a Mount - Rushmore - like tableau .
In the last paragraph , it 's customary to call on God to bless the nation and the great enterprise of the incoming administration , addressing him by such honorifics as " the benign Parent of the Human Race " ( Washington ) , " that infinite Power " ( Jefferson ) , " the kind Providence " ( Pierce ) , " the giver of Good " ( Theodore Roosevelt ) , " the Author of Liberty " ( George W Bush ) .
Sandwiched between these more or less canonical beginnings and endings is the less predictable meat of the piece .
Most often it's a mission statement , couched in terms of uplifting generality and promising great good for all in the sunlit years ahead .
Clinton 's second inaugural in 1997 was a dismal classic in this regard .
Although he did try to address the issue of race , the majority of the speech was boilerplate : " We need a new sense of responsibility for a new century . . .
Our greatest responsibility is to embrace a new spirit of community for a new century . . .
The challenge of our past remains the challenge of our future . . .
With a new era of government , a new sense of responsibility , a new spirit of community , we will sustain America 's journey . "
Words that were already dead on the page died a second death as Clinton gave them voice .
Coming from someone with a reputation for effortless , improvised rhetoric , the speech was shockingly empty : the liberal historian William Leuchtenburg called it " the most banal address by an American president I have ever heard " .
It generally takes an imminent catastrophe to persuade the new president to talk in detail about current events .
Lincoln , facing the coming civil war in 1861 , mounted an impassioned and closely argued defence of the " perpetuity " of the union and the constitution against the Southern secessionists , in a speech that 's still ablaze with life today .
In 1933 , Franklin Roosevelt crisply laid out the economic theory and practice of the New Deal in less than 2,000 words , weaving farm prices , factories , mortgages , foreclosures , jobs and public works into an instantly comprehensible plan of action , which took immediate effect by lifting the spirits of a profoundly depressed nation .
But these are famous exceptions to the tradition of the inaugural as an exercise in ghostwritten magniloquence .
Until very recently , the pretence was kept up that these speeches were the original work of the president - elect , scribbling alone up in his den or - in JFK 's case - the locked cabin of a private yacht , surrounded by blunted pencils and scumbled pages from a yellow legal pad .
But this has always been a polite fiction .
When Lincoln showed the first draft of his 1861 inaugural to William Seward , his chief rival for the Republican nomination and his designated secretary of state ( yes , history does sometimes repeat itself ) , Seward returned it with a sheaf of corrections to almost every sentence ( " Strike out the whole paragraph " , " For ' treasonable ' write ' revolutionary ' " ) and a drastically changed ending .
Lincoln adopted almost all of Seward 's suggestions , including the most important one , where Seward insisted that the speech end not on a challenge to the South ( Lincoln had written " Shall it be peace , or a sword ? " ) but on an appeal to what he called " the mystic chords " of shared historical memory .
Seward 's mystic chords went in , as did his hearts and hearths , his patriot graves and battlefields , his bonds of affection , his angels and ancient music , but as Lincoln rewrote Seward he sharpened every idea and phrase , giving the new ending a poignancy and intimacy of tone that hugely improved on Seward 's original .
Lincoln made Seward 's words his own , but most presidents , although they tinker with their speeches , leave the business of writing to their ghosts , and sometimes , on Inauguration Day , appear baffled by the strange - tasting language they find in their own mouths .
In January 1965 , with Mariner 4 en route to Mars , Lyndon Johnson haltingly read aloud this lyrical paean , probably written by Richard Goodwin , LBJ 's leading spook :
" Think of our world as it looks from the rocket that is heading toward Mars .
It is like a child 's globe , hanging in space , the continents stuck to its side like coloured maps .
We are all fellow passengers on a dot of earth . "
His disbelief was audible .
So was George HW Bush 's , in 1989 , when he found himself telling the children of America that " Democracy belongs to us all , and freedom is like a beautiful kite that can go higher and higher with the breeze . "
The two best inaugurals of modern times were written by ghosts .
Raymond Moley , a former professor of politics at Columbia , drafted Roosevelt 's 1933 address , and its best - known phrase , " the only thing we have to fear is fear itself " , was slipped in at the last moment by another aide , Louis Howe .
As for Kennedy 's 1961 rhetorical triumph , his chief speechwriter , Ted Sorenson , was recently questioned by Deborah Solomon of the New York Times , who asked him point - blank if he was the true author of " Ask not what your country can do for you . . . "
His succinct reply was " Ask not " .
The trouble with ghostwriting is that it raises the issue of whether the president is in a state of diminished responsibility for what he says .
Does he actually grasp the implications of the words he speaks ?
A case in point is FDR 's attack on bankers in his first inaugural :
" Practices of the unscrupulous money changers stand indicted in the court of public opinion , rejected by the hearts and minds of men . . .
They know only the rules of a generation of self - seekers .
They have no vision , and when there is no vision the people perish . . .
The money changers have fled from their high seats in the temple of our civilisation .
We may now restore that temple to the ancient truths . "
The embedded quotation from the Book of Proverbs ( " They have no vision " ) only helps to underline the antisemitism of the passage .
But Roosevelt himself was not an antisemite ; his closest friends , his cabinet and his Supreme Court appointments included many Jews , such as Felix Frankfurter , Henry Morgenthau , Abe Fortas and Louis Brandeis .
Yet calling bankers " the money changers " , along with talk of driving them from the temple , was a favourite trope of Father Coughlin , the explicitly antisemitic demagogue and " America 's radio priest " .
Coughlin , who supported Roosevelt in the 1932 election against Hoover , broke with him shortly afterwards , deriding the New Deal as the " Jew Deal " .
The lightly encoded message about an international conspiracy of Jewish bankers , written into Roosevelt 's speech by Moley , ought to have been recognised by the president for what it was and immediately struck out .
But it remained .
It 's a puzzle .
Perhaps the period explains it ; a time when genteel antisemitism was so routine that it passed unnoticed .
Perhaps - though this seems most unlikely - Roosevelt was in secret agreement with Coughlin 's paranoid tirades .
Perhaps he just warmed to the biblical roll and grandeur of the words when Moley showed him the script : vision , money changers , temple , ancient truths - powerful inaugural stuff .
Whatever its explanation , this curious passage illustrates the danger of a president becoming the unwitting puppet of his ghosts , as I believe George W Bush did in 2005 with his neoconservative , Project for the New American Century , Weekly Standard - style inaugural and its - mercifully empty - promise to bring about democracy around the globe by force of American arms .
No recent inaugural has been as keenly anticipated as Obama's .
On the strength of Dreams From My Father , he 's not only the best writer to occupy the White House since Lincoln ( not a title for which there 's stiff competition ) , he 's also the most rousing American political orator of his generation .
The big question was : would he write it himself ?
To which the disappointing answer was a qualified no .
It was probably because Obama first made his name as an eloquent writer that in December the Washington Post broke the convention of tactful silence on the issue of ghostwriting , and published a long and revealing article about Obama 's relationship with Jon Favreau , his chief speechwriter .
Favreau is now 27 , and has been ghosting for Obama since 2004 .
He was found by the Post reporter in a local Starbucks , working at a laptop on a document headed " ROUGH DRAFT OF INAUGURAL " , having missed his original deadline of Thanksgiving .
Unlike Sorenson , Favreau ( otherwise " Favs " ) was n't coy about his job as presidential dramaturge , chatting freely about how he'd been listening to recordings of previous inaugurals and had paid a visit to Peggy Noonan to get the inside dope on how to write one .
( Bad news , this : the modern inaugural address is a form that cries out to be broken , not copied . )
The reporter , Eli Saslow , described Obama 's and Favreau 's usual procedure as they work up a speech :
" Before most speeches , Obama meets with Favreau for an hour to explain what he wants to say .
Favreau types notes on his laptop and takes a crack at the first draft .
Obama edits and rewrites portions himself - he is the better writer , Favreau insists - and they usually work through final revisions together .
If Favreau looks stressed , Obama sometimes reassures him : ' Do n't worry .
I 'm a writer , too , and I know that sometimes the muse hits you and sometimes it does n't .
We 'll figure it out together . ' "
Favreau is said to travel everywhere with a copy of Dreams From My Father , written before Obama entered politics , using it as the key to his master 's authentic voice .
He has internalised Obama 's speech patterns along with his biography , and can now impersonate Obama on the page , speaking in the first person singular , with uncanny plausibility .
Favreau says that when he leaves the White House he'd like to write " a screenplay or maybe a fiction book based loosely on what all this was like " .
But - whether or not he knows it - he is writing fiction now , losing himself inside a character remote from his own , as playwrights do .
It 's a bit like Alan Bennett writing Miss Fozzard and the other monologuists in his Talking Heads series : Favreau is white , single , 20 years younger than Obama , a buzzcut Generation Y-er , whose chief amusement , when not channelling Obama on his laptop , is all - night videogaming .
( He caused a momentary scandal when the press found on his Facebook page a silly photo of him groping the right breast of a cardboard cutout of Hillary Clinton , while a friend jammed a bottle of beer against her face . )
The gulf in age and temperament between Obama and Favreau is probably a liberation for the speechwriter .
To inhabit the skull of someone different from oneself is one of the great pleasures of writing fiction , and the character of Obama ( should that be " Obama " ? ) must be fun to work with : his natural gravity , his unflappable cool , his perpetually wrinkled brow , his sudden flashes of self - depreciating humour ( " a mutt like me . . . " ) , his ability to switch styles , from law professor to black preacher and back again , his rich and flexible actor 's baritone .
No president since Kennedy has given his ghost so much to exploit , so many opportunities for elaborate verbal invention .
I suppose it 's naive to be disconcerted by the fact that Obama employs ghosts ( Favreau heads a team of them ) , but his best speeches have been so personal , so drenched in the past he described in Dreams From My Father , that one can't help feeling a little let down to learn that , for instance , his masterful and exhilarating speech on race , delivered last March in Philadelphia , was a joint Obama / Favreau production .
From the Washington Post :
" One Saturday night in March , Obama called Favreau and said he wanted to immediately deliver a speech about race .
He dictated his unscripted thoughts to Favreau over the phone for 30 minutes - " It would have been a great speech right then , " Favreau said - and then asked him to clean it up and write a draft .
Favreau put it together , and Obama spent two nights retooling before delivering the address in Philadelphia the following Tuesday . "
I think it 's fair to assume that Favreau was here minimising his own role in the composition of the speech .
But , however one reads the account , what is one to make of this much - quoted passage :
" I can no more disown [ the Rev Jeremiah Wright ] than I can disown the black community .
I can no more disown him than I can my white grandmother - a woman who helped raise me , a woman who sacrificed again and again for me , a woman who loves me as much as she loves anything in this world , but a woman who once confessed her fear of black men who passed by her on the street , and who on more than one occasion has uttered racial or ethnic stereotypes that made me cringe .
These people are a part of me .
And they are a part of America , this country that I love ... "
As soon as one becomes aware of the presence of Favreau 's fingers on the keyboard , the can of Red Bull , his preferred energy drink , beside him on the table , and the whiteness of his skin , the questions multiply : does this sound like Obama talking over the phone to Favreau ?
Obama recalling his Hawaiian childhood in his own words ?
Or just Favreau recalling Obama 's 1995 memoir ( which he must now know by heart ) ?
As Bill Clinton almost said , it all depends on what the meaning of I is .
The aim of Obama 's inaugural , he told George Stephanopoulos on ABC's
This Week , was " to try to capture as best I can the moment we are in " .
It would have been a more obviously arresting speech if he'd tried to capture the moment in the language of the present century instead of using the faux - antique dialect of past inaugurals .
So many phrases had the dull patina of silver that has jingled in dead presidents ' pockets .
The few mint coins in his oration stood out by their brightness , like " our patchwork heritage " , followed by the addition of " non-believers " to " We are a nation of Christians and Muslims , Jews and Hindus " - the first time that atheism has been included under the rubric of religious tolerance and freedom .
And there was the pretty rhetorical flourish of " The nation cannot prosper long when it only favours the prosperous " .
The surface tone of the address was set by somewhat moth - eaten metaphors ( " rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace . . . amidst gathering clouds and raging storms " ) and a curious solecism in its sixth sentence : " At these moments , America has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office , but because we , the people , have remained faithful to the ideals of our forbearers , and true to our founding documents . "
Forbearers ?
In neither American nor British English is a forbearer a forebear , or ancestor ; it 's a person who shows forbearance - endurance under provocation .
But someone ( Favreau ? Obama ? ) must have thought that the extra syllable in " forbearer " gave the word the sort of solemn weightiness suitable to the liturgical grandeur of an inaugural address , and tipped it into the speech without regard for its actual meaning .
Its presence in the speech as delivered and distributed to the press ( the White House has since corrected its official text ) reveals just how anxious the authors were to uphold the stilted linguistic conventions of the form - and for good reason .
Under the guise of noble platitude Obama was able to get away with murder , cloaking in familiar and emollient language an address that otherwise defied convention .
There was a hint of this in his ritual bow to the outgoing president , in which he spent five words acknowledging Bush 's service to his country and 10 in thanking him for his departure from office .
In no inaugural has a president so completely repudiated the policies of his predecessor as Obama did on Tuesday .
Look back at the " forbearers " sentence , and see the sting in its tail : " true to our founding documents " .
Most of the crowd of more than a million who packed the Mall , a few of whom loudly booed Dick Cheney when he was wheeled on to the stage , believed that the Bush administration had done its best to shred the constitution .
The distinction between " we the people " ( who are loyal to the founding documents ) and " those in high office " ( who stand accused of abusing them ) hung ambiguously in the air .
If you wanted to hear it , it was there ; if you did n't , it was n't .
This veiled quality suffused the entire address , whose central motif was stated early on : " The time has come to put away childish things . . . to reaffirm our enduring spirit ; to choose our better history . "
The distinct echo of Lincoln 's " the better angels of our nature " helped to soften the implication that the last eight years belong to our worse history , under a president famous for his childish pursuits ( as one of Bush 's own advisers once asked , " What kind of male obsesses over his bike - riding time , other than Lance Armstrong or a 12 - year - old boy ? " ) .
Yet there was no triumphalism in this ; there was , rather , a note of sombre regret .
It was necessary for Obama to announce to both the United States and the rest of the world ( and his inaugural was directed , unusually , at least as much to the foreign as to the domestic audience ) that on Tuesday the Bush era had ended and that America , after a long , unhappy detour in the wilderness , was returning to its better history .
Since inaugural addresses are by tradition high - toned , bipartisan affairs , this was an immensely difficult feat to bring off with grace .
What needed to be said had to be phrased in language as well - worn and conventional as possible , to give the illusion of smooth continuity between Obama 's speech and those of past presidents .
The driving theme of the address made its appearance at artfully calculated intervals , with Obama touching on it , departing from it , returning to it , burying it for a while and digging it up again in a way that made some critics call the speech diffuse .
But it was not diffuse .
It was quietly , courteously insistent on its purpose .
" On this day , we come to proclaim an end to . . . the worn - out dogmas that for far too long have strangled our politics " : an end , then , to the liberal imperialism of the neoconservatives and the " Bush doctrine " of preemptive invasion .
" Starting today , we must pick ourselves up , dust ourselves off and begin again the work of remaking America " : so , under the 43rd president , we have been floored and supine .
The most damning censure of the Bush administration arrived exactly midway through the speech , at the nine - and - a - half minute mark :
" As for our common defence , we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals .
Our founding fathers , faced with perils that we can scarcely imagine , drafted a charter to assure the rule of law and the rights of man , a charter expanded by the blood of generations .
Those ideals still light the world , and we will not give them up for expedience 's sake .
And so to all the other peoples and governments who are watching today , from the grandest capitals to the small village where my father was born : know that America is a friend of each nation and every man , woman and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity , and we are ready to lead once more . "
That is as near as George W Bush has come to being impeached .
It covers the legal black hole of Guantánamo Bay and its kangaroo courts , the overreaching powers of the Patriot Act , torture , warrantless wiretapping and all the other infractions of the civil liberties of Americans and foreigners alike that occurred under the outgoing administration .
" We are ready to lead once more " is startlingly candid in its admission that , under Bush , the United States did not lead the world but attempted to bomb and bully it into submission .
The reference to " the rights of man " was salient .
The title of Thomas Paine 's giant pamphlet prepared the way for Paine 's incognito appearance at the end of the speech , when Obama talked of Christmas night in 1776 , when George Washington led his ragtag army across the ice - choked Delaware river to confront the British and Hessians who were encamped at Trenton , New Jersey .
Obama spoke of " the timeless words " that " the father of our nation " ordered to be read to the American people : " Let it be told to the future world , that in the depth of winter , when nothing but hope and virtue could survive , that the city and the country , alarmed at one common danger , came forth to meet [ it ] . "
The oddly bracketed " it " replaced the original end of the sentence , which was " came forth to meet and to repulse it . "
Every commentator I heard - including , surprisingly , the historian Doris Kearns Goodwin - assumed that the quotation came from Washington himself , but it is from Paine 's The Crisis .
" With hope and virtue , let us brave once more the icy currents , " Obama said , and , again , the commentators assumed , mistakenly I think , that he was speaking only of the recession as it deepens , with increasing speed , into depression .
But Paine 's authorship of those words suggests otherwise .
The " common danger " , requiring " hope " and , more pointedly , " virtue " in order to " meet [ and to repulse ] it " , is surely as much the spectre of a dictatorial administration , emboldened by Dick Cheney 's theory of the " unitary executive " , and its dangerous freedom to abuse the rights of man , as it is the present economic crisis .
No wonder " and to repulse " was left out : Obama , a cautious politician and sensitive to the nuances of words , stopped short of calling the Bush administration repellent .
His image of leaving the blood - stained snow behind to cross the freezing river - famous from schoolroom reproductions of Emanuel Leutze 's 1851 painting George Washington Crossing the Delaware - and his marriage of December 1776 to " this winter of our hardship " were his most daring attempts at inaugural loftiness .
But there was more to them than a stirring call to arms to fight recession ; he was placing between his incoming administration and that of the outgoing president a broad river packed with growling chunks of ice - a river just crossed , at great hazard to the survival of America 's " founding documents " .
I 've read - or at least skimmed - every inaugural address since George Washington's , and none comes close to so categorically rejecting the political philosophy and legislative record of the previous occupant of the White House .
Obama did it by stealth - so much stealth that most of the red meat of the speech has so far passed largely unnoticed .
The most astonishing visual moment of the inauguration came after the speech , and Elizabeth Alexander 's dud poem ( " On the brink , on the brim , on the cusp . . . " , mistaking her thesaurus for her muse ) , and the Rev Joseph Lowery 's magnificent , scene - stealing benediction , when Obama and his wife Michelle walked George W and Laura Bush to the US Marine helicopter parked beside the Capitol 's west portico .
The two couples joked , then hugged , before the Bushes climbed aboard , on their way to Midland , Texas .
It was like seeing Mark Antony and Brutus locked in a warm embrace after " Friends , Romans , countrymen . . . "
No one will say of Obama 's inaugural , as the Atlanta Constitution said the next day of Roosevelt 's 1933 speech , " The address takes its place among the greatest of historic state papers of the nation , ranking with Lincoln 's address at Gettysburg " .
Even on Inauguration Day itself , when the press usually takes a rosy view of whatever is said by the new president , journalists grumbled that Obama 's oration , though predictably well delivered , was short of specifics , fire and memorability .
They searched the text for phrases to stand beside " the only thing we have to fear . . . " or " Ask not what your country . . . " , and came away empty - handed .
Conservative journalists noted that Obama had taken some " digs " at Bush , but failed to read the truly damaging subtext .
Among the first - response reviews , the Dow Jones index appeared to pan the speech with its steady decline through trading hours , losing 332 points on the day , with a dip , not a blip , in the minutes immediately following the address .
Certainly Obama failed to inject the nation with a shot of instant , FDR - style consumer confidence .
" The state of our economy calls for action , bold and swift , " he said , but already his stimulus package is under attack from Keynesians for being far too little and from fiscal conservatives for being far too much .
His appeals for a renewed spirit of community and mutual responsibility , though phrased more vividly than Clinton 's in 1997 ( " It is the firefighter 's courage to storm a stairway full of smoke , but also a parent 's willingness to nurture a child , that finally decides our fate " ) , were cast in the same communitarian mould as Clinton's , and had the unfortunate effect of reminding me , at any rate , of the dullest inaugural in living memory .
It was this aspect of Obama 's address that his aides hawked around the TV networks as its dominant theme : he would , they said , use the address to herald " a new era of responsibility " .
But that was a blind : Obama 's real preoccupations lay elsewhere .
Next week , the speech will be pretty much forgotten , and people will scratch their heads to remember a single quote from it .
Yet if ( and it 's a huge if ) 2009 should eventually turn out to have been the date when the United States renounced the accumulated policies of the Bush years , regained an honourable place in the wider world and returned to the course of its " better history " , then we 'll reread Obama 's inaugural and discover how subtly audacious he was being .
It 's already original - and not so much in spite of , but because of , its unoriginal language .
It might , just conceivably , be seen as revolutionary .

You may have a personal portfolio website for a number of reasons .
If you ’re a freelancer , then you ’d need one to showcase your work and allow people to contact you .
If you ’re a student ( or unemployed ) , then you ’d need one to show prospective employers how good you are and what you can do , so that they might hire you .
If you ’re part of a studio , then you might use one to blog about your design life , show people what you ’re doing and build your online presence .

A personal portfolio website is all about promoting you .
You are a brand , and your name is a brand name .
No one is going to know about your brand unless you get it out there ; and if you ’re a Web designer , developer , writer , gamer or any other type of creative , then it ’s essential that you have a good portfolio website .
You may want to take a look at the following related articles :
What makes for a good personal portfolio website ?
1. Logo
Your logo is usually the first thing a user sees .
In the Western world , we read from left to right , top to bottom , so it makes sense to put your logo in the top left of your website so that users can immediately identify who owns the website .
It does n’t necessarily have to be your name , but if you ’re trying to promote yourself online , then it ’s a good idea to go by your name .
And always link your logo to your home page .
It ’s a common convention that users expect online .
Mohit goes by the alias of CSS Jockey .
Jason Reed uses a signature - style logo of his name .
2. Tagline
Once the user sees who owns the website , they ’ll want to know what it is you do .
This is where you explain what you do with a tagline .
Your tagline should be short and snappy , summarizing what you do .
Things to ask yourself when writing your tagline :
What are you ?
A designer ?
A writer ?
A developer ?
What do you do ?
Design websites ?
Develop games ?
Where are you from ?
Country ?
City ?
Are you a freelancer or do you work for a studio ?
Are you looking for work ?
Sarah Longnecker makes it clear that she puts together videos and is good at it .
3. Portfolio
This is a personal portfolio website after all , so your portfolio will determine whether the website is interesting or not .
People will want to see your previous work to decide whether you ’re good or not and for general interest , to see what you ’ve been up to in the past .
Depending on what you do , your portfolio should contain big high - quality images , clearly accessible to the user .
Always include a link to the live version of the website you worked on , and link your screenshot to the live version ( another common convention that people expect ) .
Include a short description for each project , including the different skills that you needed to complete the project .
It ’s never a bad idea to get a testimonial from a client .
Your visitors might also be interested in the stages of development for your projects and how you arrived at the final outcome .
Leigh Taylor displays nice clear screenshots of previous work and indicates what softfigureare was used during development .
4. Services
Your tagline summed up what you do , but you ’ll want to go into a bit more detail here about each service that you offer .
You ca n’t expect potential clients to guess what you do based on your portfolio , and you do n’t want to leave them wondering whether you offer a particular service or not .
Make it clear , and break it down :
Web design , development , video , copywriting , branding , etc .
You may want to be even more specific : corporate branding , church website design , Flash banner ads and so on .
Chris Spooner clearly indicates the services he offers for both print and Web .
5 . About me
It ’s all about you .
Let people see the man or woman behind the mask ( i.e. website ) .
Share your background , where you came from , how many years you ’ve been in the business , etc .
The more details you give , the better your users can form a bond and build trust with you .
If you ’re not camera - shy , show a picture of yourself .
This will give potential clients peace of mind by allowing them to see who they ’re dealing with , and it adds an element of trust .
Do n’t be afraid to show off your awards and recognition here .
You want people to know you ’re good at what you do .
Chikezie Ejiasi shows us a photo of himself and even lets us know how to pronounce his figureame .
This is one of the most important elements of a portfolio website but is often hidden or even neglected .
A potential client has browsed your website , is impressed with your portfolio and can see who you are .
Now they want to hire you .
Your contact information should be obvious and easy to access ; do n’t hide it in the footer .
Let people know they can contact you for a quote or a chat .
Use a form to make it easier for users to contact you ( so that they do n’t have to take down your email address and then open up their email manager ) .
A form also allows you to ask for specific information , such as name , email address , website URL , details of inquiry .
Stuart Johnston offers clear contact details throughout his website but also provfiguredes an easy - to - use contact form .
7. Blog
A blog is always a good idea .
Blog about your area of expertise ; show you know what you ’re talking about .
It will help promote you and prevent your website from lying static .
Let people follow you by subscribing to an RSS feed , and show off your most popular blog posts to new readers .
Be sure to enable comments for feedback .
Do n’t make users register to add a comment to your blog , and do n’t use anti-spam Captcha software , which only turns people off from commenting .
There are plenty of anti-spam plug-ins available that do n’t require users to do extra work .
Chris Wallace uses his blog about Web design - related topics to help out other people in tfiguree industry and to engage in discussion .
8. Call to action
Ask yourself what you want to get out of your personal portfolio website .
Do you want to be hired ?
Attract more blog readers ?
Maybe you just want people to know who you are .
Each page should have a call to action , a “ Next step . ”
The best way to accomplish this is with a “ call to action ” button that is clear and stands out from the rest of the page .
Link it to your blog , portfolio or contact page , and use appropriate language ( e.g .
“ Hire me , ” “ Request a quote , ” “ View my portfolio ” ) .
Matthew Brown ’s call to action is a contrasting button that stands out from the restfigureof the website .
9 . Use social networking websites
Now that people have an interest in you and your work , encourage them to follow you on other websites .
Make it clear that they can follow you on Twitter , Facebook , Flickr , Linked In , etc .
Make the most of social networks and have a group of friends to call on if needed .
Sam Brown offers clear links to other websites he uses , allowing us to stalk him .
10 . Language and communication
How you conduct yourself is important .
Remember , it ’s a personal portfolio website , so be personal .
You do n’t need to sound like a corporate brand with no emotion .
Be friendly and personal , but also clear and precise ; do n’t ramble .
Once you write all the text for your website , read it again and see if you can cut it in half .
Marius Roosendaal uses a relaxed and friendly tone on his website .
Other tips :
Let people know where you ’re from .
This is always interesting to know , and some clients prefer to work with people nearby or in the same time zone .
Validation is important , especially for Web designers .
If you ’re going to be building professional websites for clients , then your own website ’s code should at least be valid .
Link images , not just text .
Most people will click on images , expecting them to point somewhere .
If you do n’t have any previous clients for your portfolio , create a WordPress theme , design an icon set , develop a Twitter mashup , etc .
You have a lot of possibilities , and there ’s a big difference between having one project to show in your portfolio and having none .
What do you expect to see on a good personal portfolio website ?
Anything important we ’ve missed ?
What would make the difference between your deciding to hire someone and deciding against it ?

Insurer : Victims of Houston office fire died from ' pollution '
Insurance loophole claimed in fire deaths
Company says smoke that killed 3 was ' pollution '
An insurance company with a potential $ 25 million liability from a 2007 Houston office fire is claiming smoke that killed three people was " pollution " and surviving families should n't be compensated for their losses since the deaths were not caused directly by the actual flames .
Great American Insurance Company is arguing in a Houston federal court that the section of the insurance policy that excludes payments for pollution — like discharges or seepage that require cleanup — would also exclude payouts for damages , including deaths , caused by smoke , or pollution , that results from a fire .
" This is shocking .
It 's an extraordinary effort by an insurance company to avoid paying on a contract for insurance , " said Randy Sorrels , who represents several family members in wrongful death lawsuits from the fire in a six - story atrium building on the North Loop .
Great American has asked U.S. District Judge Lee Rosenthal to find that the deaths caused by the smoke , fumes and soot from the March 2007 fire set by a nurse working in the building will not be covered by the policy because there is a specific exclusion for pollution and it mentions smoke , fumes and soot .
' We think it is wrong '
" This took me by surprise , " said Don Jackson , the Houston lawyer for building owners Boxer Property Management Corp .
He said the insurance company that has the primary $ 1 million policy on the premises has n't made this argument and he disagrees with the effort by excess insurance carrier Great American .
" We think it is wrong .
It 's inappropriate for the insurance company to try to run and hide now , " said Jackson .
In October , vocational nurse Misty Ann Weaver was sentenced to 25 years in prison after pleading guilty to three counts of felony murder and one count of first - degree arson for setting the fire to conceal that she had failed to complete paperwork on time .
Great American 's legal request , filed in late November and set for hearings in February , notes that there are four pending lawsuits against the property owners for wrongful death and injury , and contends that the insurance company should not have to pay on any of them .
Kevin Sewell , the Dallas lawyer who filed the request , did not return phone calls Tuesday afternoon .
Great American spokeswoman Diane Weidner said company policy is to not comment on pending litigation .
Seth Chandler , a University of Houston Law Center professor who teaches insurance law , said while the insurance company 's maneuver was n't out of bounds , it will test the limits of the law .
" This is pushing the boundaries of the absolute pollution exclusion , " Chandler said .
" We 're going to have a battle between the literal language of the policy and the way people speak of pollution . "
A question of semantics
He said the issue is an ongoing conversation between the courts and the insurance industry .
Chandler said he does n't know of any other Texas cases on this issue .
Nationwide , he said , even carbon monoxide poisoning has been found to be covered by insurance despite a pollution exclusion .
Tom Baker , an insurance law expert who teaches at Penn Law school , said property insurance has a long history of being designed for fire coverage and excluding a fire 's smoke is applying the law too broadly .
But , he said , smoke can be tricky and Texas may be a state where the literal meaning could be considered rather than common understanding .
" The purpose of a pollution exclusion is not to not cover people who die from smoke inhalation in a fire , " Baker said .
" I would hope they ( the insurers ) lose this . "

The postings to the Whopper Virgins Twitter account are n't what you might expect from a major corporation like Burger King .
" Gained like 5 lbs. in 1 week .
I do n't understand .
...
At least I have my whoppers to keep my spirits up , " a message posted a few weeks ago read .
" Lost my virginity to a whopper .
Feeling like a slut , " read one of the earliest tweets .
As you may have gathered , this is n't affiliated with the Burger King company or its marketing team , which is running the TV campaign in which foreigners document their first encounters with the hamburger .
The Whopper Virgins account is maintained by a Milwaukee man who calls himself Paul .
( He refused to give his full name to protect himself from potential legal recourse . )
And he does seem to have reason for concern .
Last month , the BKlounge , which looks much more like a legitimate account run by Burger King , sent a public message to Whopper Virgins , saying , " CEASE AND DESIST .
UNAUTHORIZED USE OF TRADEMARK .
What is your motivation by the way ... ? "
Paul had n't seen the tweet until I pointed it out to him Thursday .
" It looks very unofficial , " he said .
" I 've never had a cease and desist presented to me , but I would imagine it does n't normally look like that .
...
It seems like they 're joking around . "
He was right .
The BKlounge account , just like Paul 's own , is simply another overzealous burger fan .
A Burger King spokesperson said , " We 're flattered the King has fans on Twitter .
While we appreciate the love , we do want to clarify those twittering are unofficial members of the Kingdom , and not the King or his Court . "
And since that 89 - character legal warning , the BKlounge has begun sending Twitter messages ...
Thirty years have now passed since the stern , bearded visage of Ayatollah Khomeini graced our television screens decrying the many " ills " of the West and its allies .
It was a revolution few , if any , at the time had anticipated , one participants and observers alike still endeavor to properly understand .
Khomeini ’s image , which has since become a kind of shorthand for the West ’s first encounter with the forces of radical Islam , continues to arouse fear and hostility .
But 30 years on , that turbulent time in Iranian history continues to leave Western audiences perplexed , with little comprehension of the forces that incited crowds to chant " Death to America . "
In this haze of images , which for the most part dwelled upon the imminent threat to Western interests presented by " black - turbaned reactionaries , " Iran ’s 100 - year struggle for political independence against colonial dictatorship was more often than not elided in a frenzy of sensationalism and hysteria .
Incidents such as the 1953 MI6 - CIA - orchestrated coup d’etat , which ousted Iran ’s democratically elected prime minister , Mohammad Mossadegh , and their importance in Iran ’s meandering path toward revolution were simply cast aside .
Sadly , the tableau commonly offered up for consumption ( even to this day ) is that of a mob of " fanatical zealots " stirred up and manipulated by a bunch of " mad mullahs . "
No nuance , no context .
Today , with the benefit of hindsight , the world - historic proportions of the Iranian revolution of 1979 are becoming clear .
Not only did this event initiate the end of the 50 - year - old , American - backed Pahlavi dynasty , but it also brought to a cathartic climax the dissolution of 2,500 years of Persian monarchy and the arrival of the first theocratic republic in modern history .
Since those early days of the revolution and the ascendance of the clergy to the seat of power , Iran has undergone eight years of brutal war with Saddam Hussein ’s Iraq , which resulted in 1,000,000 casualties , the American hostage crisis , revolutionary purges , the Cultural Revolution , the infamous Rushdie fatwa , sanctions , and international isolation .
On the other hand , the last 20 years have also witnessed the rapid expansion of civil society , the growth of local government , and the participation of women en masse in Iranian society .
Today women outnumber their male counterparts in institutes of higher learning .
Moreover , 70 percent of Iran ’s population is under the age of 30 , and with every passing day the young demand more from their leaders .
Back in 1997 , the future looked bright under the unassuming and kindly reformist President Seyyed Mohammad Khatami , who was riding on a crest of popular support ( 70 percent of the popular vote to be exact ) .
Khatami , in stark contrast to his predecessors , chose to stress the rule of law and transparent elections .
Iran was entering a new era , in which a language of accountability was increasingly injected into mainstream discourse , with a courageous and indomitable press its foremost champion .
Despite Khatami ’s endeavors to foster dialogue between East and West , the Bush administration dubbed Iran a member of the " axis of evil . "
This event was not only a major setback to the Khatami government in its dealings with the international community , but it also played right into the hands of Iran ’s hard - liners , who have long tried to forestall the realization of an Iranian détente with the West .
Furthermore , and in spite of his best efforts , Khatami often found himself being undercut through official and unofficial channels and harassed by the powerful , conservative forces who man the unelected Guardian Council and judiciary .
Nevertheless , Khatami ’s legacy is still vehemently contested , and there is little doubt that nostalgia is strong for the days of reform , with calls abounding for his entry in the presidential race set to take place this June .
Most analysts agree that many of the popular initiatives first embarked upon by Khatami have since been hampered and " reined in " by the election of radical populist Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who seems to have reawakened the West ’s collective memory of the Islamic revolution and its more reactionary tendencies .
At the domestic level , the former mayor of Tehran is increasingly resented for his mismanagement of the economy .
His many sins in this regard include the squandering of an unparalleled oil revenue surplus and climbing inflation , the likes of which Iran has not seen in years .
While the UK reinstated relations with Iran some years ago , a U.S. - Iranian rapprochement remains elusive .
Yet even under President Bush , the U.S. had been negotiating with Iran over the security situation inside Iraq and Afghanistan to great effect , and it was also on the sidelines of Iran ’s nuclear - program negotiations with the European Union .
The question of whether there will be a substantive shift under the Obama administration has evoked both positive and pessimistic responses .
His appointment of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , who openly stated that if Iran were to attack Israel the U.S. would " totally obliterate " the Islamic Republic , has not been a particularly encouraging sign .
Her statement upon Senate confirmation also offered absolutely nothing that significantly deviates from the course of Iran - U.S. relations pursued under the Bush administration .
Nor has the rumor that Dennis Ross , a key ally of the hawkish Washington Institute for Near East Policy , may be given the so - called " Iran portfolio " quelled analysts ’ growing pessimism .
A recent op - ed by Ross in Newsweek merely emphasizes the fact that he differs little , if at all , from the Bush administration in terms of his bellicosity toward Iran .
President Obama has promised much , and there still remains doubt as to whether he will be able to deliver .
After initially pledging unconditional talks with the Iranian leadership , Obama ’s stance on Iran has become more restrained , much closer to the status quo bestowed by his predecessor .
Reports state that he has been advised to bide his time until Iran ’s June presidential election , after which a new figure may come to the fore " with whom America can deal . "
" Change , " it seems , will have to wait a while longer till it reaches Iranian shores .
Here ’s an interesting article I found that sheds some new “ social research ” light on why men take risks .
Not terribly new , if you ask me , but it is interesting that there is consistent information like this out there , and we all still rationalize our behavior for other reasons .
If there ’s one thing to remember , it ’s this :
You do n’t do things for the reasons you think you do …
_______________________
Men make up four - fifths of the world ’s skydivers and two - thirds of all rock climbers , and a new study suggests they do it for more than just the thrill .
Men may flirt with risk because they think it will help them score women
Evolutionary psychologists have long believed that women are choosier about men than men are about women .
It ’s not ( just ) because girls want to make life difficult for guys ; it ’s because , at least historically , women have had to pick men who could provide for them and their children .
This pressure forces males to work harder to prove their worth to females and out - compete other guys in the running .
Social psychologists at Florida State University wondered : could risk - taking be one of the ways in which men show off their strength , ambition and confidence to potential lovers ?
To find out , they asked 134 undergraduate male and female psychology students to participate in an experiment .
They wanted to see whether men would take more risks if they were “ in the mood ” and if the men thought there were beautiful women around for them to woo .
The researchers showed students pictures of either 10 attractive or 10 unattractive faces of the opposite sex .
Then they asked the subjects how sexually motivated they felt — that is , how interested they were in finding new sexual partners .
One - by - one , each of the students then played a succession of 11 rigged blackjack hands ; since the researchers knew what cards the participants had , and all were given the same cards , the scientists could compare how the subjects played each hand .
( Asking for a “ hit ” indicated a risky move , since the player risked going over 21 , while “ staying ” was considered safe . )
Finally , after the game , the researchers tested the students ’ memories for the faces they had seen before the game .
The men were much more likely to take blackjack risks if they were sexually motivated and had seen images of beautiful women before they played .
The guys were also more likely to take risks if they saw attractive female faces and remembered them afterwards — even if they were n’t looking for a new partner — perhaps because the faces made more of an impression on them and ramped up their sexual desire .
The behavior of the female students , however , was n’t affected by what they felt , saw , or remembered .
“ The bottom line is that risk - taking can be a tool that men use to show potential mates that they have desirable qualities such as confidence or ambition , ” said study co-author Michael Baker , a doctoral student in social psychology at Florida State .
Interestingly , the study found that guys who saw attractive faces but were n’t sexually motivated did not take more risks than guys who saw unattractive faces .
Baker speculates that guys only take risks if they stand to benefit from them , because risk - taking does come with a cost — after all , a bad skydiving or rock climbing experience could keep a guy from reproducing ever again .
“ If men are not motivated to pursue a mate or there are no potential mates present , then the potential benefits of a risky display are less likely to outweigh the potential costs , ” Baker told LiveScience .
In other words , if a guy does n’t really want a new relationship , then his safest bet may be just to stay home and watch football .
This widely circulated photograph is of a re-enactment of the first operation under anesthesia on Oct. 16 , 1846 in the operating room of the Massachusetts General Hospital , Boston .
We all know medicine has come a long way in the past century .
Now a 300 - year - old guidebook , recently found on a dusty shelf , reveals how horrible things were way back then .
The book , written in 1712 and titled " Treatise of the Operations of Surgery , " gives advice on such horrific procedures as amputations — before anesthesia was invented .
The publication 's discovery was reported today by the Daily Mail .
Here are some of the gory details within , according to the British newspaper :
On amputating a leg : " Cut quick with a crooked knife before covering the stump with the remaining skin , " French medical author Joseph Charriere recommended .
On treating wounds : " If the wound be only in the flesh you may bathe it with brandy and cover the part with a compressed dip in a warm wine quickened with spir vini , " Charriere wrote .
" If the wound is to the nervous parts you can dissolve sugar candy , camphire and myrrh in it . "
( Charriere was kind of onto something : A study in 2007 found wine kills germs in the mouth and throat . )
On the best time for surgery : " Either Spring or Autumn , " Charriere advised .
" In the Spring , the blood is revived with greater heat whilst in the Autumn blood is calm . "
Surgery was a last resort in the 18th century that often resulted in infection and death anyway .
" Having a limb sawn off without anesthetic is just unimaginable , " Howard Ellis , professor of surgery at the Westminster Medical School and author of " A History of Surgery , " told the newspaper .
Things changed in 1846 with the use of general anesthesia and again in 1867 when antiseptics to control infection came into widespread use .
( Interestingly , even today scientists do not fully understand how anesthesia works . )
Meanwhile , the harnessing of morphine as a painkiller in the mid-1800s was a big relief , too .
" The book would have proved invaluable to surgeons in its day — it would have been like a bible for them to use and refer to when operating , " said Charles Hanson of Hansons Auctioneers .
The book will be auctioned next month .

Authoritarians in Libertarian Clothing
Some time ago Charles Johnson , in “ Liberty , Equality , Solidarity : Toward a Dialectical Anarchism , ” argued for what he called “ thick libertarianism . ”
That is , libertarians should –AS libertarians –promote values of equality and justice beyond the bare bones nonaggression principle on which “ thin libertarianism ” is grounded .
Equality and justice , he argued , should appeal to libertarians for the same reason that ( assuming they were sane ) they were originally attracted to libertarianism itself .
Most people do not come to libertarianism as a result of deductive reasoning from the nonaggression principle .
They are first attracted to libertarianism because it appeals to broader cultural values of equality and fair play , or an aversion to seeing people treated badly and pushed around , and then they gradually come to accept the more philosophical arguments for it afterward .
So while it ’s possible for a person to be libertarian in the sense of accepting the nonaggression principle , and without formal contradiction simultaneously favor such voluntary forms of authoritarianism as the patriarchal family , the hierarchical employment relationship , and various other forms of cultural domination , Johnson argued that it would be just plain weird .
Why would the sort of person with an affinity for that sort of thing draw the line at state authoritarianism , in particular ?
Unfortunately , there seems to be a great deal of such authoritarian weirdness among professed libertarians .
A good example is Lew Rockwell ’s post of Jan. 28 at LewRockwell.com
Blog , in which he appeals to the common understanding of most American workers–in contrast to “ trade - union commie ” dogma–that
their boss is their benefactor , and that they owe him gratitude as well as hard work .
If the employment contract is–ahem–a CONTRACT between two equal parties for mutual benefit , why should be workers be any more “ grateful ” to the boss than vice versa ?
Can you imagine Rockwell ’s reaction if some “ commie ” commenting on a layoff story argued that the workers were the boss ’s benefactor , and that he owed them gratitude as well as good pay ?
Rockwell ’s attitude reminds me of Paul Graham ’s quip that the contractual employment relation , in practice , contains a lot of recycled master - servant DNA .
It ’s certainly odd that a libertarian , who professes to celebrate the supercession of status by contract , should such nostalgia for the baggage of the age of status .
It ’s almost Burkean : squires in powdered wigs sipping mint juleps on the verandah , and grateful laborers in the field singing old English spirituals .
No less a free market libertarian than Herbert Spencer remarked on the cultural holdovers , in the modern wage employment relationship , from the old “ regime of status . ”
So long as the worker remains a wage - earner , the marks of status do not wholly disappear .
For so many hours daily he makes over his faculties to a master … , and is for the time owned by him … .
He is temporarily in the position of a slave , and his overlooker stands in the position of a slave - driver .
Only , unlike many libertarians of the contemporary right , Spencer thought this was a BAD thing .
Another , even more appalling example is a collection of quotes from Mises .
Org Community forums , compiled by the market anarchist blog Polycentric Order ( “ Why I Dislike the Hoppeans and Libertarian Conservatives ” ) :
“ Nonetheless we do favour individuals with authority , in the form of a natural elite . ”
“ If the parents wish to use force , then so be it .
The child consents by continuing to live off his parents . ”
“ Libertarianism does n’t support equal negative rights , a child does not have the same rights as an adult . ”
“ This does n’t imply equal negative rights for adults .
Some adults , such as primitives , are not capable of rational argumentation and cannot be brought peacefully into the division of labour .
Moreover , they have no conception of property rights nor any enforcable claim . ”
“ These people ( tribal or less developed cultures ) simply are n’t capable of rational argumentation , and therefore have no rights , whether this is biological or cultural makes no differences . ”
“ The fact is they often can not be brought within the division of labour and without any concept of property rights it ’s impossible that they own anything .
Moreover they have no legitimate claim to any of this territory and as such it ’s free to be homesteaded . ”
“ People incapable of moral choice must either abide by the decisions of those who are or they must be removed from free society . ”
“ Against people who have no law , the initiation of force is fully justified . ”
“ It was not wrong for the spanish to overthrow an empire that literally fed on its slaves in religious rituals and replace it with its much milder form of serfdom . ”
“ Childish rejection of a natural order and authority is n’t the opposite to subservience .
It ’s a bad trait that needs to be kept down until the youth have matured sufficiently . ” ….
“ Seeing as towns would be owned by single entrepreneurs … ” “ Why would n’t people sell their land to a single entrepreneur ?
The have no interest in owning land , only in being able to lease it from some owner . ” ….
“ Opposition to the family and church sounds somewhat Marxist to me , any libertarian society will be founded upon those two institutions so in a sense yes , one does need to be a cultural conservative to be a libertarian . ” ….
“ Feudalism is actually an entirely appropriate model for anarchist society , and my prediction is it ’s coming whether the anarchists like it or not . ”
“ A system of feudal holdings all competing with each other for human and fiscal capital stacks up pretty good against a system whereby the parasitic majority lives off the productive minority . ”
You get the impression that capes and cigarette holders , and maybe pictures of Franz - Ferdinand , are popular in such circles ?
The irony is that the remarks on division of labor come , in all probability , from people who pride themselves on their “ methodological individualism . ”
And as I understand it , “ division of labor ” is just a fancy way of saying that people choose to trade with other people of their own free will when they find it beneficial , because they believe it saves effort to specialize in what they ’re best at .
So how do these people manage to transform the “ division of labor ” into an entity over and above individual human beings , that individuals are forced to serve ( “ brought into ” ) against their will –like Moloch ?
The idea that Western colonizers are owed a debt of gratitude for bringing native peoples into the division of labor , and that land robbery is perfectly legitimate because the latter have no “ legitimate ” conception of property rights , is fairly common among the more vulgar Randroids .
Such views are fairly common in right - wing , paleolibertarian venues , as well .
A good example is the argument , by Hans Hermann Hoppe and his followers , that immigration would be restricted in a free market anarchy by the universal appropriation of land .
When every square foot of land , including the roads and sidewalks , is appropriated , there will be nowhere for anyone to stand without the permission of an owner .
So it will be impossible to live or even exist anywhere without either being a property owner or having been invited by a property owner .
Never mind that it is impossible for land to be appropriated on a scale even approaching universality , given the present population density , on principles consistent with free market libertarianism .
As Franz Oppenheimer pointed out , it is impossible for land to be universally appropriated , and for the landless to be excluded from vacant land , unless access to vacant land is preempted through political appropriation .
Unless absentee titles are enforced to vacant and unimproved land , there will be vast tracts of unowned land open to homesteading in a free market society .
Never mind , as well , the vesting of traditional rights of common ownership over such things as public rights of way .
In America , they generally date back to the time of first European settlement when townships were laid out , and in turn were frequently based on preexisting Indian trails .
In Europe , such rights of way were common property from time out of mind , probably dating back to the neolithic era in some cases .
Such common property rights , as argued by thinkers like Roderick Long and Carlton Hobbs , are entirely legitimate .
There is no way that public rights of way can be individually appropriated , and the public deprived of access rights against its will , that can not be unequivocally condemned as robbery .
But again , never mind all that .
What kind of libertarian , in his right mind , could ever find such a total lockdown society appealing ?
What kind of “ libertarian ” would want to live in the kind of “ free market ” utopia in which it is impossible to set foot on a road or sidewalk or public square , anywhere on God ’s green earth , without being scanned for biometric data or having someone demand “ Ihre Papiere , bitte ! ”
All too many , I fear .
In my worst moments , I suspect such libertarians are drawn to libertarianism precisely BECAUSE they are authoritarians .
Here in Northwest Arkansas , Benton County is famous for the kind of bluenose Stepford Wife Republican for whom “ God ” is spelled B - O - S - S and “ Christian businessman ” is one word .
Bob Jones University alumni , who look like the Hitlerjugend equivalent of Eagle Scouts , are heavily represented in the local GOP organization –which should tell you everything you need to know about the cultural atmosphere .
I can generally identify a Republibaptist ( a term coined by local newspaper columnist John Brummett ) on TV even with the sound turned off , because he ’s wearing a navy blue suit and power tie and looks like he ’s got a stick up his ass .
The Hoppeans seem to come from the same gene pool .
They seem to favor the free market because they believe it will eliminate the state as a constraint on the kinds of local authoritarianism they enjoy , and give them a free hand in playing with the powerless victims in their little killing jars without any outside interference .
A “ free society , ” for them , is a society in which the local petty authority figure is free to brutalize those under his power without hindrance .
It ’s the freedom of the squire to enclose the land and rackrent his tenants , of the pointy - haired boss to make life hell for Dilbert .
You know , the way things were in the good old days , when men were men and sheep were nervous , and people who did n’t look and act like us kept in their place and did n’t whine about their “ rights . ”
I vaguely recall that the Book of the Subgenius included a listing for someone who called himself an anarcho - monarchist , or something of the sort ; his slogan was “ Every backyard a kingdom , every child and dog a serf . ”
I can imagine him fitting in well in certain paleolibertarian circles .
Tesco , Waitrose and well - known health food shops have withdrawn tens of thousands of packets of edible seeds in one of the biggest product recalls for a decade after a survey found " unacceptable " levels of salmonella and E. coli .
One in 50 packs of ready - to - eat seeds such as sesame and sunflower was found to be contaminated with dangerous levels of the food - borne diseases , which can cause serious illness in fit people and death in the vulnerable .
The study 's authors pointed out that although there was no direct link to the contaminated seeds , 137 people in England and Wales fell ill from six sub -types of salmonella found in the seeds during the six - month study .
Many more ill people are likely to have not reported their symptoms to GPs .
The Health Protection Agency and the local authority group Lacors , which conducted the study , warned food manufacturers and retailers to improve hygiene during harvesting and drying of seeds .

The study was carried out because seeds – a popular snack among health - conscious shoppers wishing to avoid high - calorie chocolate and sweets – have become associated with at least seven outbreaks of salmonella in countries such as Germany , Norway , Sweden and Australia since 2000 .
To gauge levels of contamination here , environmental health officers from 317 local authorities collected 3,735 packets of ready - to - eat seeds from 3,390 supermarkets , health food shops , convenience stores and market stalls between October 2007 and March 2008 .
They were analysed in 32 food laboratories .
Twenty - three samples – 0.6 per cent – were contaminated with salmonella and E. coli was detected at unsatisfactory levels in 55 samples , or 1.5 per cent , putting the proportion of dangerous food - borne disease at 2.1 per cent of the total .
Melon seeds had the highest proportion of salmonella – 8.5 per cent – but the bug was also found in sesame , linseed , sunflower , alfalfa and mixed seeds .
E. coli was found in melon , pumpkin , sesame , hemp , poppy , linseed , sunflower and mixed seeds .
" Our study found that the vast majority of ready - to - eat seeds we tested were safe to eat .
However , a small number were contaminated with salmonella or high levels of E. coli , which is concerning , " said Jim McLauchlin , the HPA 's director of microbiology .
" This is clearly unacceptable and in each case the retailer publicly recalled the contaminated batches and food alerts were issued by the Food Standards Agency advising consumers not to eat the affected products , " he said .
As a result of the study , 10 retailers and wholesalers withdrew packets of seeds at the end of 2007 and the beginning of 2008 .
Tesco and Waitrose each issued two recalls for salmonella contamination ; for seed mixes in the case of Tesco ; and alfalfa and mixed seeds in the case of Waitrose .
Holland & Barrett , Julian Graves , The Health Store , TRS Wholesale and Imperial Snack Foods also recalled the seeds .
Salmonella was detected in seeds produced in Argentina , Burkina Faso , Guatemala , India , Nigeria , the US and west Africa .
Unsatisfactory levels of E. coli were detected in seeds produced in Argentina , Austria , China , France , India , the Netherlands , the UK , the US and west Africa .
The seeds may have become contaminated as they were left outside to dry in the sun in developing countries or because of poor hand - washing ( the HPA says E. coli is traditionally regarded as an indicator of faecal contamination ) or other factors .

A startling new WWF study has revealed that people living in Hong Kong currently use twice as many resources as residents in China , more than double the sustainable level .
To feed the vibrant city ’s massive demand for natural resources , and absorb the CO2 emitted , residents need an area of land and sea larger than 250 Hong Kong ’s , an incredible seven - fold increase since 1965 .
According to Mathis Wackernagel , Executive Director of the Global Footprint Network , “ Although small geographically , Hong Kong not only has significant resource demands , but it also has an over - proportional influence on the world .
In light of the study ’s damning conclusions , Hong Kong is being urged to develop a comprehensive low carbon energy strategy to reduce its escalating ecological deficit .
Speaking about the findings , Dr Andy Cornish , Director of Conservation WWF Hong Kong said , “ Hong Kong is fortunate in having financial resources to transform into a truly modern city where we can live well on a modest ecological footprint . ”
The Hong Kong economy has traditonally been reliant on high levels of imports to support its status as a global financial powerhouse .
However , in a climate of growing worldwide energy and resource scarcity , it is in the city ’s best interest to move towards a more sustainable growth trajectory .

There come times , in the course of human events , whereby an official - unofficial OTI Staff Scientist such as myself feels compelled to write about pop-cultural issues which he or she ( statistically : he ) finds irksome on a professional level .
Back to The Future is a nearly endless font of these issues for me — from the obligatory complications surrounding causality in time - travel paradoxes to hoverboards which do n’t work above water to the continued reminder of the sheer mathematical improbability of Huey Lewis and the News .
But as my esteemed colleagues have already touched on these with great aplomb , I ’ve got some another problem to Overthink™ today .
And oh yes , there will be math involved .
Pop culture has envisioned a multitude of time –travel devices , and these give rise to the usual scientific musings ( physical and metaphysical alike ) : questions of causality , internal paradoxes , and the “ inconveniences ” associated with the creation a billion alternate universes or self - referential circular time lines .
Also , there ’s usually lightning and dramatic music .
However , there ’s a much smaller –though fundamentally difficult–caveat to time travel that ’s always kinda ’ bothered me .
With the notable exceptions of Doctor Who and Bill and Ted ’s Excellent Adventure , the spatial aspects of time travel are almost universally overlooked when characters decide to go gallivanting through temporal mayhem .
I was reminded when questioned by a fellow OTI ™ writer in a recent email ; so as to protect his / her ( statistically : his ) anonymity , I ’ll keep the author ’s identity a secret :
Q .
“ Watthew Mrather ” writes : The DeLorean ca n’t go anywhere in space , except in the conventional driving / flying sense .
Your [ sic ] always in the same place you left , but in a different time .
A .
Well , for starters , that ’s not a question , “ Mr. Mrather , ” but I ’ll go along with it anyway .
Remember , though : without proper punctuation and grammar , we are no better than the animals .
In fact , in order to pull off the kind of time travel we see in the Back To The Future trilogy –the kind where the traveler is transposed in time , but remains stationary in the same relative position to where he / she left –the DeLorean would have to be an outstanding space ship , in addition to its already laudable work as a time - ship .
A major issue of freely traveling within time while limiting one ’s self to a local reference frame–say , a California mall parking lot–is that the reference frame itself is n’t stationary .
As an illustration , let ’s figure out how far the DeLorean would have to travel in order to stay in sync with the Earth over a relatively small time - jump .
We ’ll look at the simplest example ( and the first one , diagetically speaking ) of the whole BTTF trilogy .
You all remember the scene , right ?
( Spoiler alert : Professor Plum and Alex P. Keaton send a dog one minute into the future . )

( Why no one in sci - fi movies ever names their pet Smoluchowski , I ’ll never know . )
As most of us know , the Earth both rotates about its axis ( accounting for the regular cycle of day and night , and hence a good bit of poetry ) and revolves around the sun ( accounting for the seasons , and hence the rest of poetry ) .
However , the litany of additional factors affecting Earth ’s absolute position in space makes it fantastically difficult to calculate where a given point on its surface would be after some interval of time has passed .
A little professional lingo , here : we in the science biz refer to this level of complexity as a “ colossal mind - fuck . ”
So , to make my life easier , I ’ll first lay down the standard boilerplate warning we employ for all Overthought ( ™- pending ) mathematical meta- transmutations :
For all calculations pertaining to a period of time less than one hour , the Overthinking It™ writers reserve the right to disregard effects due to the nonperpendicular axial - tilt of the Earth relative to its plane of revolution , the precession of the Earth about its axis , the gradual decay of Earth ’s orbit into the sun , the rotation of the Milky Way , analogous rotational and linear velocities within the Virgo Supercluster , and the general expansion of the Univese .
Also , we wo n’t factor in Daylight Savings Time .
Got it ?
Good .
Let ’s get this party started .
SO , according to Doc Brown ’s stopwatch , Einstein ( the dog , not the Princetonian–or the grossly mispronounced Russian film director ) travels precisely one minute into the future on this first jump , arriving , relative to their frame of reference , at the same location he left .
But how far has this reference frame itself traveled during that one minute ?
Let ’s calculate and see .
A defining moment of the “ old ” John McCain — as many Americans , even some of his friends , have begun to refer to him as he was before his run for the Presidency in 2008 — took place in February , 2000 , during his first bid for the White House , when he was challenging George W. Bush for the Republican nomination in the South Carolina primary .
McCain had recently upset Bush in New Hampshire and was in a buoyant mood , vowing that , like “ Luke Skywalker fighting the Death Star , ” he would not only defeat Bush but reform a party corrupted by “ big money ” and , as he later put it , “ agents of intolerance . ”
People liked McCain because they thought him more honorable than other politicians .
Illustration by Finn Graff
Within days , sordid attacks began to appear : flyers on car windows claiming that McCain , who had adopted an orphan from Bangladesh , actually had fathered a black child ; recorded phone messages , or robo-calls , spreading rumors that McCain ’s wife , Cindy , who had once been addicted to prescription painkillers , was a junkie ; and lies , propagated by an obscure group of Vietnam veterans , suggesting that McCain had become a traitor while serving in Vietnam .
McCain ’s response was decisive : he pulled from television his negative advertisements , and announced to supporters , “ If we do n’t prevail , my friends , we know that we have taken the honorable way . ”
On the evening of the primary , McCain and his family watched the returns in a hotel suite in Charleston .
As the polls came in , showing that he had lost by more than ten points , Cindy wept .
“ How could they believe all that about you ? ” she said of the public .
McCain , after embracing his wife and children , headed down to a ballroom to deliver his concession speech .
“ I will not take the low road to the highest office in this land , ” he said .
“ I want the Presidency in the best way — not the worst way .
The American people deserve to be treated with respect by those who seek to lead the nation .
And I promise you : you will have my respect until my last day on earth .
The greatest blessing of my life was to have been born an American , and I will never . . . dishonor the nation I love or myself by letting ambition overcome principle .
Never . Never. Never . ”
In the final weeks of the 2008 campaign , it became clear that John McCain might lose more than the Presidency .
On October 6th , slipping steeply in the polls , he held a rally in Albuquerque .
Rather than speak off the cuff , as he preferred , he kept his eyes on a teleprompter .
During the 2000 race , McCain was known as the “ happy warrior , ” but now his tone was harsh .
Angrily waving a finger , McCain portrayed his Democratic opponent , Barack Obama , as a shadowy figure who never seemed to reveal his true identity .
McCain noted that Obama ’s campaign recently had to “ return thirty - three thousand dollars in illegal foreign funds from Palestinian donors . ”
McCain urged the audience to wonder , “ Who is the real Barack Obama ? ”
Before he even finished the speech , he and his aides had begun their now notorious campaign — sometimes in public , sometimes sub rosa — to supply insinuating answers to this question .
Ads appeared accusing Obama , who had served on the boards of two charities with William Ayers , a founder of the Weather Underground , of being allied with a “ terrorist . ”
Voters received flyers featuring a mug shot of Ayers and the words “ Terrorist .
Radical .
Friend of Obama . ”
Then came the same kind of robo-calls that had savaged McCain in 2000 , and that he had once denounced as messages of “ hate . ” McCain even hired one of the same firms that Bush used in 2000 .
The messages warned , among other things , that Obama had tried to stop doctors from caring “ for babies born alive after surviving attempted abortions . ”
Meanwhile , McCain ’s running mate , Sarah Palin , charged that Obama was “ palling around with terrorists . ”
Other surrogates claimed that Obama was “ anti-American , ” a “ guy of the street ” who “ used cocaine , ” and had “ friends that bombed the Pentagon . ”
According to Newsweek , Michelle Obama asked an aide , “ Why would they try to make people hate us ? ”
Early on , McCain vowed that he wanted “ the most positive kind of campaign . ”
But even though he sometimes seemed uncomfortable , shifting in his chair or looking away from the camera , he was at the heart of those personal attacks — demanding that Obama confess his relationship to a “ washed - up terrorist , ” and proclaiming that Obama would “ lose a war in order to win a political campaign . ”
As the rallies of McCain and Palin grew angrier — at the mention of Obama ’s name , supporters yelled “ Traitor ! , ” “ Kill him ! , ” and “ Off with his head ! ” —
McCain seemed startled by what he had helped unleash .
When , at one rally , a woman called Obama an untrustworthy “ Arab , ” McCain turned ashen and stammered , “ No , Ma’am .
He ’s a decent family man . ”
Afterward , Ray LaHood , a Republican congressman from Illinois , who earlier had condemned the campaign ’s inflammatory rhetoric , told me , “ That ’s the John McCain I know . ”
Obama and his supporters decried McCain ’s tactics .
Yet some of the strongest criticism came from people whom McCain revered or who had long revered him .
And it was not merely about strategy — the backbiting that always consumes losing campaigns .
It was about the very nature of John McCain .
In their eyes , at least , their hero was losing not only an election but his reputation — or , as one prominent backer put it , “ his soul . ”
William G. Milliken , a moderate three - term Republican governor of Michigan , was part of the unusual coalition that had made McCain an almost singular figure in American politics .
Although for most of his career McCain ’s voting record was consistently conservative , he was far more popular with centrist Republicans , independents , and many Democrats than he was with the Party ’s base .
His appeal was rooted less in ideology than in character : he presented himself as a figure who would never pander or betray his convictions .
When he fell short of his principles , as in the 1989 Keating Five scandal — the Senate Ethics Committee found that he “ exercised poor judgment ” in helping a major donor — his willingness to lacerate himself in public only reinforced this impression for many .
Milliken , who served as governor from 1969 to 1983 , had been a gunner in the Air Force during the Second World War , and he was amazed by the way McCain , after being shot down as a Navy pilot during the Vietnam War , had stoically endured more than five years in captivity .
He was also impressed that McCain had challenged his own party by embracing campaign - finance reform .
Though the two men disagreed on social issues , Milliken felt that McCain did not exploit such issues as “ wedges ” to divide the electorate .
In 2000 , McCain — in a move that , seemingly , no self - preserving Republican politician would make — took on two of the most powerful leaders of the Christian right , Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell .
As McCain put it , “ Neither party should be defined by pandering to the outer reaches of American politics . ”
Many of McCain ’s supporters were equally struck by his refusal to use his status as a war hero to impugn others ’ patriotism , particularly in the case of David Ifshin , a student radical who , in 1970 , travelled to Hanoi and delivered a scathing radio address against the Vietnam War .
The North Vietnamese broadcast Ifshin ’s words into the cells where McCain and other U.S. prisoners were being held .
Sixteen years later , Ifshin met with McCain , who had once publicly criticized his actions , and apologized ; McCain accepted the apology and later defended Ifshin on the Senate floor .
Similarly , in 1994 , McCain backed Bill Clinton ’s efforts to normalize relations with Vietnam , offering cover to a President whom many conservatives had derided as a draft dodger .
Clinton later called McCain “ a great man . ”
During the Michigan Republican primary in 2000 , Milliken endorsed McCain , helping him carry the state .
When McCain ran in 2008 , Milliken again supported him in the state primary , even though McCain was up against Mitt Romney , whose father had been governor of Michigan in the nineteen - sixties ; Milliken had served as his lieutenant governor .
“ I received criticism for not backing Mitt , but I thought McCain was the best person to be President , ” Milliken said .
Yet , last month , Milliken expressed disbelief that McCain , after experiencing “ the most disgusting aspects of politics ” in South Carolina , had adopted the same methods against Obama .
He said , “ McCain keeps asking , ‘ Who is the real Barack Obama ? , ’ but what I want to know is who is the real John McCain ? ”
In 2000 , some prominent Republicans came to McCain ’s defense , among them Frank Schaeffer , the son of Francis Schaeffer , an evangelist and anti-abortion crusader who is credited with helping to create the religious right .
Schaeffer worked closely with his father , who died in 1984 , but he felt that the movement had become extreme .
In 2000 , Schaeffer gave McCain his family ’s imprimatur , vouching for him on Christian radio shows .
Six years later , Schaeffer , who had a son in the Marines , co-wrote a book , “ AWOL , ” which spoke of the need for Americans to serve their country .
McCain provided a blurb saying that the book illuminated “ a more genuine and wiser patriotism . ”
But , in October , Schaeffer , a lifelong Republican , wrote an open letter to McCain that said , “ If your campaign does not stop equating Sen. Barack Obama with terrorism , questioning his patriotism and portraying Mr. Obama as ‘ not one of us , ’ I accuse you of deliberately feeding the most unhinged elements of our society the red meat of hate , and therefore of potentially instigating violence . ”
He went on , “ You are unleashing the monster of American hatred and prejudice , to the peril of all of us .
You are doing this in wartime .
You are doing this as our economy collapses .
You are doing this in a country with a history of assassinations . ”
According to one of McCain ’s longtime friends , the endorsement of Obama by General Colin Powell was “ especially painful , ” as there was no one whom McCain “ admired more . ”
Equally devastating were criticisms made by John Lewis , the civil - rights leader and Democratic congressman from Georgia , whom McCain had idolized .
In the 2004 book “ Why Courage Matters , ” which McCain wrote with his aide Mark Salter , a chapter was devoted to Lewis ’s march against racism in Selma , Alabama , during which he was beaten nearly to death .
Because of the actions of Lewis and his colleagues , McCain wrote , many Americans were “ ashamed that they had not loved their country as much as the marchers ; that they had not the courage to march into the force of such injustice . ”
McCain also praised Lewis for decrying incendiary black leaders , such as Louis Farrakhan , as “ bigots . ” McCain concluded , “ I ’ve seen courage in action on many occasions .
I ca n’t say I ’ve seen anyone possess more of it , and use it for any better purpose and to any greater effect , than John Lewis . ”
A month before the election , Lewis released a blistering statement accusing McCain and Palin of “ sowing the seeds of hatred and division . ”
Though McCain publicly called the accusations “ shocking and beyond the pale , ” a campaign aide told me that when McCain first heard Lewis ’s remarks he sat in silence inside the campaign ’s official bus .
Even members of McCain ’s inner circle expressed bewilderment and anger over his seeming transformation .
One friend told me he thought that the man he had known for decades would never “ take the low road to the highest office in this land . ”
Near the end of the campaign , a perception had set in , among the press and some of McCain ’s former supporters , that the “ old ” John McCain was a fraud — a creation of consultants and a once fawning media .
Reporters had often romanticized McCain and ignored evidence of his conservative ideology and his personal flaws — a fierce temper , impetuousness , and a tendency to demonize opponents .
But the people who know McCain well , including many Democrats , believe — as the former Democratic Senator Tom Daschle put it — that McCain is a fundamentally “ good man . ”
The friend of McCain said , “ I would take issue with anyone who says that he was a sham .
He was the real deal . ”
In this view , McCain ’s fall in 2008 has an almost mythic cast — it is the story of a great man who , overcome by what he himself once called the “ disease ” of Presidential ambition , sacrificed all .
“ I do n’t think he ’ll ever recover , ” another friend , who has been instrumental in his career , said .
“ My fear is that people who view the John McCain from the years ’ 96 to ’06 will think it was a political gimmick and what they ’ve seen in the last five months is who he really is .
If honor is your ideology , and you lose that , then what do you have left ? ”
After 2000 , few politicians in America held greater moral stature than McCain .
Though he remained unpopular with the right , his unusual coalition of supporters was rapidly growing .
“ I say to independents , Democrats , libertarians , vegetarians — come on over , ” he liked to say .
His defeat in South Carolina had seemed to confirm his virtue , especially to Democrats who had long suffered at the hands of Republican operatives such as Lee Atwater .
His popularity was largely driven by a single belief : that he was more honorable than other politicians .
Todd Harris , one of McCain ’s strategists in 2000 , told me that he has never worked on a campaign more closely focussed on a candidate ’s biography , and on that candidate ’s ability to project integrity .
Accordingly , McCain ’s advisers let him speak to reporters for hours , unfiltered , on the Straight Talk Express .
“ It was a completely character - driven campaign , ” Harris said .
“ Other than the push for campaign - finance reform , many people would be hard pressed to recall any real policy initiatives that we campaigned on . ”
“ Today we ’ll be discussing the three branches of government­ — executainment , legislatainment , and judiciatainment . ”

McCain ’s heroic reputation was centered on his experiences in Vietnam , but it had increased in Washington .
Unlike most U.S. legislators — who spend hours a day picking over the minutiae of budget projections or health - care policy , and tending to the mundane needs of constituents —
McCain waged gallant , and often futile , crusades against the corrupt and the powerful .
He took on the tobacco industry and repeatedly lost , enhancing his stature in defeat .
In the Senate , his signature concerns — including campaign - finance reform and opposition to secret “ earmarks ” for legislators ’ pet projects — were primarily ethical ones .
Ivan Schlager , a former Democratic counsel to the Senate Commerce Committee , who worked with McCain during the nineties , recently told Time , of McCain ’s approach , “ It ’s not ideological .
It ’s good guys and bad guys . ”
Starting in 1999 , with the help of Mark Salter , McCain published a series of best - selling books that championed his character - based politics .
In “ Character Is Destiny , ” McCain said , “ It is your character , and your character alone , that will make your life happy or unhappy . ”
And in “ Why Courage Matters ” he wrote , “ Without courage all virtue is fragile : admired , sought , professed , but held cheaply and surrendered without a fight .
Courage is what Winston Churchill called ‘ the first of human qualities . . . because it guarantees all the others . ’
That ’s what we mean by the courage of our convictions . ”
Hope begins by facing the truth because decisions made in a state of denial are likely to be poor ones .
Sometimes , truth is painful , and so hope may only arise through a path of disillusionment .
Our country has been living in a state of denial for a long , long time , and now many are disillusioned .
My question is :
Will you lead a process of truth telling ?
Are we going to stop scapegoating and over - simplifying our troubles , and get to the core of our predicament ?
We may have to shed a lot of healing tears along the way , but people are waiting for this .
The theme of your campaign was hope .
Quite honestly , I do n’t have a whole lot of hope for my children ’s future , and that ’s why I am doing something as audacious as writing you a letter .
I am a worker , not a big complainer , and I will suggest some concrete steps that would make me hopeful .
But first I want to connect hope to something else , realism .
You do n’t know me personally , but we have a few things in common .
Like you , I became a community organizer after earning an advanced degree ( my doctorate is in biology ) .
Thanks for dramatically elevating the status of my current work .
I was also elected president once , though that was over twenty years ago while I was in high school .
Our children are about the same age ( my pair are boys ) and I especially enjoyed watching yours during the inauguration , imagining what an adventure this must be for them .
The Predicament
As a scientist my job is to sort out the rules of the universe , but most of my expertise is limited to planet Earth .
The trouble I see is that the laws , policies , codes , habits and various behaviors of Homo sapiens are incompatible with keeping the planet suited to our habitation .
As a lawyer you are aware of the phrase : “ The constitution is not a suicide pact . ”
If that is the case , your oath of office permits you make sure , above all else , that social norms are in alignment with the laws of nature .
After all , nature does n’t negotiate .
Furthermore , a primary role of government is to protect the commons from assault or corruption .
Governments also strive to protect private property and individual liberties .
When these two functions of government are at odds , one must be given primacy .
We all know that private interests tend to fund politics , but it is well past the hour to stand up for the commons above all else , or everybody — rich and poor — will lose .
What an amazing gift of perspective we have , to see the planet from space .
Clearly , the United States of America is only one territory on Earth .
The relationship between our nation and the Earth is a nested one , meaning the Earth contains our nation .
Here ’s the rub .
The same nested relationship holds to the global economy .
All economic activity is nested within , and wholly dependent upon , the biological , geological , climatological and hydrological systems of the Earth .
What we do to the Earth we do to ourselves .
Why is the economy collapsing right now ?
In the news we see the problems reported as a process of “ deleveraging ” following a “ bubble , ” and that we ran up too much “ debt ” relative to our “ balance of trade ” and long - term prospects for “ GDP growth . ”
This is all true , but only hints at what lies underneath .
When I step back and put on my biological goggles it is a much bigger story .
In reality , the rules of finance and commerce do not recognize the simple and obvious fact that the economy is a subset of the Earth .
Our predecessors mistakenly created monetary and political systems that drove humanity into ecological overshoot .
The most worrying debts are not financial , but ecological .
Financial debts can be forgiven ; ecological ones need true repayment .
Let me explain .
Look at the graph below of the Ecological Footprint .
The human impact on the planet has risen in parallel with the growth of the economy .
This is no co-incidence , but a function of rising population and consumption levels that are measured collectively as growth .
It has gone way too far .
Perhaps an analogy will drive home this key point of mine .
I would hope that my children will grow for another decade , perhaps averaging 10 lbs per year over that period .
Then I want them to stop growing .
If they do n't stop , either something is wrong hormonally and / or they are eating too much .
Imagine they keep up the 10 lbs per year rate after they become 20 or so , by the time they reach my current age they will weigh nearly 400 lbs .
I happen to weigh the same as I did in college .
This is good .
You see , I am not " anti- growth " but comprehend the simple fact that physical growth is a phase that eventually ends .
To our great detriment , the human economy went past its healthy growth phase and is now so enormous it desperately needs liposuction and a frugal diet plan , or it and its host ( the planet ) will die .
Now the bankers in your administration may say :
We must grow the economy or the financial system collapses .
They are right !
However , I speak as an ecologist ( akin to Jane Lubchenco , nice choice there ) and ask that you reply to the bankers with :
Then create a financial system that does n’t require perpetual growth .
Believe me , this is possible , the theories and models exist , and it is easier to do than repealing the laws of physics and ecology .
Okay , if you have followed me so far perhaps it is safe to tell you the following .
When I hear you talking about stimulating the economy and rebuilding our roads , honestly , I shudder .
Perhaps I do n’t know you well enough , but my fear is that you are trying to get us onto that red path on the Ecological Footprint graph above , the one labeled “ business as usual . ”
Frankly , that is impossible now , and I think you know that .
Rapidly “ greening ” the economy and giving money to governors for their new , “ shovel ready , ” freeway projects are mutually exclusive propositions .
I am going to follow the money .
Will precious resources be used to perpetuate our national “ suicide pact ” or will they turn us onto the above - labeled rapid reduction path ?
Let ’s face up to it :
We ca n’t have it both ways .
More specifically , the economy requires inputs in the form of resources that come from the Earth .
Our people and industry use these to make products that are bought and sold in a reinforcing feedback loop ( circular flow model ) .
The outputs are wastes that become part of the Earth too .
We are in trouble at both ends right now .
The inputs are getting more difficult to come by ( e.g. , fossil fuels , water ) and the pollution has accumulated to damaging concentrations ( e.g. , greenhouse gases , persistent organic compounds ) .
Policies need to recognize limits at both the “ source and sink ” sides of the equation and treat the economy as a subset of the planet .
Allow me to sink this basket :
Wave a magic wand and solve the credit problems .
Banks are solvent and consumer confidence is high .
Would we have an economic rebound ?
I seriously doubt it , because money is a claim on source supplies and sink capacities that have reached physical maxima .
That 's what the Ecological Footprint is showing us with hard , real world numbers , not ethereal financial digits in a database .
When more money chases fixed or declining goods the result is inflation that brings demand in line with what is available .
How You Could Give Me Hope
I know heaps of ridiculously high expectations are being placed upon you , but allow me to give you five simple , inexpensive and immediate ways that you could provide hope .
1. Convert White House lawns to food gardens .
In addition to an assortment of vegetables ( imagine fresh arugula whenever you are at home ) , go ahead and include hens , a beehive , and perhaps a dairy cow ( I think you have the space ) .
I am a farmer so I know that getting your nails dirty would be a great compliment to a basketball workout and is fantastic for mental relaxation and acuity .
A walk through the garden would likely help during tense negotiations , whether foreign or domestic .
But most importantly , this move would give people the message that some degree of self - reliance is good for them and their country .
2. Bring House Rep. Roscoe Bartlett over to your office for a special presentation of his energy talk , make sure your cabinet is there , and present him with an appropriate Presidential Medal of some sort .
He ’s a Republican so this would be a great bipartisan move .
He is also a bona fide scientist who can speak with authority on the “ source ” side of the equation with respect to fossil fuels .
3. Invite James Hansen and his wife to stay in the Lincoln bedroom .
Keep him around long enough to personally be assured that you understand his positions and reasoning .
He believes substantive changes in energy policy need to happen within your first term or the planet is toast .
Unfortunately , I think he ’s right .
4. Place Herman Daly as a key economic advisor .
So far your economic team looks to me like the same folks who created the mess .
I have absolutely no confidence in them .
Much of the banking system is a black hole that is insolvent and unredeemable .
By contrast , the hundreds of billions ( soon to be trillions ? ) of dollars wasted in shoring up banks could help pay down our ecological debts if allocated wisely .
Maybe you are going to tell these guys to do a pirouette and reform themselves and their ilk ?
5. Develop a “ Securing the Basics ” plan .
With the economy tanking , the risk of civil unrest , both here and abroad , is real .
Because we are mostly a society of urban and suburban consumers , households in the U.S. must pay for basic goods .
The extreme income inequity in the U.S. is an additional vulnerability .
Lack of self - reliance means that if oil imports are cut off suddenly or commerce falters due to a cascade of credit failures , the very necessities of life such as food , water , and shelter may be lost to tens of millions of citizens .
If the population knew that a credible plan existed to mitigate for such a catastrophe , ensuring fair and timely distribution of goods , it would reduce the likelihood that panic would set in .
Over the long - term , a society that is not so import - dependent , especially for food and energy , should be a policy goal .
Tell you what .
If you do these five steps I ’ll invite you onto my radio show , called The Reality Report , and you can have plenty of time on local public radio to tout these early accomplishments . :-)
Overcoming the Hungry Ghost Syndrome
Several religious traditions describe what are termed “ hungry ghosts . ”
These sad beings have insatiable appetites , with tiny mouths and huge stomachs .
Modern society creates hungry ghosts among the living .
We “ have ” more than ever , but are constantly bombarded with messages that it is never enough .
The poor go to dollar stores , the middle class spend hours at Bed Bath and Beyond , the rich buy ever larger yachts , and city planners are always looking for more land and water in which to expand their urban sphere .
Wants have become indistinguishable from needs .
I anxiously walk among our nation of hungry ghosts , asking myself what these addicts will do when they can't get their fix ?
I am afraid of what they will think of you eventually .
They expect you to turn things around so they can feed on more and more and more , but this is impossible .
Will they come to despise you when the " economic stimulus plan " fails to stimulate them ?
Like obese junk - food junkies , our addiction to consuming the planet will lead to an untimely death for most of us if we ca n’t stop it .
Many of us know we are addicts but need social reinforcement to change .
This is where great political leadership can really help .
Your inauguration ceremony suggested to me you may accept this role .
Your speech and the poem spoke of the hard times ahead and the value of a life of honest work , friends and family .
Social scientists and neurobiologists know where addiction comes from and what can be done to break it .
Once we “ hit bottom ” it could be amazing to see and feel a nation regain a sense of purpose and direction again .
Greater systemic fairness , social equity , and honest communication will be crucial to our revival .
I am not a politician , and you are a very skilled one .
How you lead us away from the hungry ghost syndrome I leave to you .
While I want hope , I fear it will never come .
My life feels like it is taking place on a runaway train .
My friends , family and all I hold dear are on this train with me while it careens towards destruction .
But the passengers and driver are apparently oblivious to their peril .
They sometimes get angry at me for trying to alert them of the dangers ahead .
At some point , because of momentum , it will be too late .
Physics will trump hope .
I do n’t want to face that sort of existential crisis ; living while aware that we ’ve passed the point of no return .
Do you know what I mean ?
Can you be fearless ?
I do n't mean this in a reckless sense , arising from delusional , juvenile feelings of immortality , but in a way that comes from a cool and truthful evaluation of a deeply difficult predicament .
It has probably been said before , although it now seems truer than ever .
We have arrived at a paradoxical point in history where we have nothing to lose , because if we do n’t act properly then everything is lost .
Sincerely yours ,
Jason Bradford

( OPRAH.com ) --
I 've been practicing psychotherapy for more than 30 years , and in my view a great number of people are running around thinking that they are depressed when it may be that they are simply disappointed .
Expert : A mature relationship does n't begin until after disappointment .
Not that disappointment is merely a case of depression lite .
It can cast heavy shadows over one 's life , often with lasting consequences , especially when it occurs in love or career .
As the character played by Shirley MacLaine in The Evening Star ( the sequel to Terms of Endearment ) put it , " Disappointment has ruined more lives than all the diseases known to man . "
But it 's not disappointment that ruins lives .
It is the incapacity or the refusal to deal with life after disappointment .
There are plenty of roads that can lead to disappointment .
But probably the heaviest traffic turns up on the one traveled by people in search of love .
Consider the plight of Shelley and Franklin , a couple in their mid-30s who came in together to see me for marital therapy .
They had found each other six years earlier at a mutual friend 's book party .
Both were glamorous professionals moving steadily forward in their careers -- he as a creative young scholar at a major university who also writes a literary column for the Sunday edition of a newspaper , she with a big job in the media , producing documentary films for a national cable channel .

When their eyes first met , the din of the party seemed to recede and the room to light up for the two of them with a glow of promise .
After a few months of Friday and Saturday nights together , they moved in with each other .
Within a year , marriage felt right to both of them .
But marriage turned out to be a good deal more than they had bargained for .
As singles living together , they 'd conducted their lives separately .
When they dined together , it was usually in restaurants .
Now someone had to shop and cook , clear the table and do the dishes .
The garbage had to be taken out every night .
Piles of bills mounted .
There was the question of who got to sleep through the night and who was on call when their new baby 's colic kicked up at 2 a .m .
It became more and more difficult to find time for sex .
They were both too tired anyway .
No such thing as a perfect union
Resentments accumulated between these two busy professionals .
Everyday demands overwhelmed their earlier vision of married life : a dream of four or five decades of thriving careers interspersed with romantic evenings and weekends .
From the beginning of courtship through the initial excitement of moving into one or the other 's small apartment , from the wedding ceremony through the honeymoon , being newly in love tends to hide or at least blur two people 's differences -- particularly differences in needs for sex , for intimate time together , for autonomy and time apart , for planning and organization , for control over finances , for being with the children , and for freedom from parenting -- in just about everything .
The extraordinary experience of romantic love conveys the feeling that " the two of us are as one . "
But the daily tasks of marriage can quickly disabuse a couple of the notion that they have found such a perfect union .
As their different rhythms and preferences emerge in the course of living together , each comes to feel that the other is not , after all , the ideal partner who brings salvation from loneliness , deprivation , a sense of personal inadequacy , or other anxieties of the solitary self .
" You are not who I thought you were , " they tell each other .
And from the depths of this disappointment , they often turn to accusing each other of deception , selfishness , or worse .
If you were to experience Shelley 's and Franklin 's unhappiness individually , you might think they both were depressed .
But in my office , they reeled off their disappointments to each other .
It was like witnessing a trial between two plaintiffs , each making a case for being the bigger victim , the major sufferer of unmet needs at the hands of the other .
Disappointment is a stage of love nearly every serious intimate relationship -- probably every one that lasts longer than overnight -- has to struggle with .
It may strike suddenly or build up slowly , but once the battling begins , it can assume tragic proportions for a couple trying to make a life together .
Oprah.com : Meet 3 less - than - perfect couples
The very first disappointment
We do n't have to look very far to come upon a captivating tale about disappointment -- it is among our oldest and most familiar stories , the story of Adam and Eve in Genesis .
Where else among the world 's cultures does one find a creation myth in which human history begins not with magic animals or demigods or occult forces but with newlyweds engaged in doing what so many other married couples since have done : making bad judgments together and then blaming each other for the difficulties that they bring down on themselves .
Despite the best real estate on the planet , peace everywhere , no competition for mates , and all their needs gratified , Adam and Eve cannot leave well enough alone .
Once they find something they can't have , they hardly seem interested in anything else .
The forbidden apple is too fascinating to resist .
Eve at least has the intellectual curiosity and rebelliousness to take the initiative .
Adam is too busy being a good boy .
When God shows up and demands an explanation , Adam declares that it was the woman 's fault .
Adam is the first in a long line of passive - aggressive males .
The famous pair wrapped themselves in fig leaves and took to the bushes after the apple made them aware that they were naked .
Centuries of theologians have informed us that this discovery signified the first sexual shame .
Maybe so , but I have a slightly different take .
Adam and Eve had always been naked in Eden .
What made the difference ?
In the Garden of Eden , nothing changed , nothing grew , nothing died .
Time never passed until Adam and Eve learned that the Fall meant that they would eventually die .
It 's mortality that starts the meter running .
And nakedness under the regime of time is significantly different from nakedness before time exists .
No more perfect youthful bodies forever .
From now on , the hint of a potbelly here , the possibility of a sagging breast there .
In other words , I suspect that when Adam and Eve looked at each other through the filter of time , they were more disappointed than ashamed .
" You are not who I thought you were , " they might have been the first to say to each other after the revelation that nobody is perfect .
But to love is to become aware of loss with further losses to come .
I believe that this is among the major reasons that love makes us so anxious .
Falling in love leads to such monumental expectations of happiness that it can feel like the discovery of paradise .
But falling out of paradise with regularity also seems to be our lot .
What happened to Adam and Eve happens to all of us -- over and over again .
There 's nothing like thinking that you have failed at love to sharpen your knowledge that life is uncertain and the clock is relentlessly ticking .
One tends to ask oneself , " If this relationship wo n't work , will I ever find one that does ? "
Disappointment measures the passing of time as a fall .
It is one of our harsh reminders of solitude and aging and mortality .
Depression or disappointment
How can we bear to live with it ?
Here 's where the difference between depression and disappointment becomes crucial .
Faced with the prospect of loss , the person who gets depressed bypasses disappointment and rushes to the end of the story , even before the story begins .
All is failure , decay , and rejection .
When spring begins and the buds appear , the depressive is already dreading the leaves turning brown and falling off the trees .
Depression is a withdrawal from life .
There is a kind of hubris in this withdrawal , as though being depressed were a way of saying , " this imperfect , difficult world is not good enough for me .
Give me paradise or give me death . "
The philosopher Jean - Paul Sartre pointed out that depression is like a spell that a person casts over the world to make it utterly gray and uninteresting .
Then you can tell yourself , " What 's the use of trying ?
Why bother to get out of bed ? "
The disappointed person lingers , however painfully , in the middle of the story , even though paradise has slipped through his or her fingers .
Disappointment keeps you connected to life as it continues to unfold and places an important choice in front of you .
It informs you that time has gone by and things have changed since you first risked investing in a cause or a career or an intimacy with another person .
Neither a utopian outcome nor easy success nor bliss in love is just around the corner .
Life is more difficult than you thought .
The question is , what next ?
Are you going to take on the vital forces of life , despite limitations and imperfections , or pull the covers over your head as an exit strategy ?
A patient of mine , a divorced woman in her 30s , a graphic designer , constantly bemoaned the lack of intimacy in her life .
She told me that she was prone to black depressions , particularly on weekends .
I found out that she spent weekends alone in her apartment , making no effort to contact the outside world .
It was as if she were waiting for a Prince Charming to arrive and sweep her away .
Apparently this rescuing figure had to do all the work ; she was n't going to budge .
Behind this repetitious and unpromising pattern lay a history of disappointment at the hands of the key men in her life .
Her father had disappeared behind The Wall Street Journal at breakfast , and the rest of the time into his own unhappiness over his failed career aspirations .
He did n't even bother to show up at school plays in which she sometimes had leading roles .
She married young , having found a man who courted her enthusiastically .
But before long he , too , disappeared -- into alcohol .
She lost faith that any actual intimacy would meet her needs .
It became necessary to explore her deep disappointment rather than simply treat her depression .
Disappointment has a future ; depression does n't .
There is no where to go if you are already at the end of the story .
With disappointment , the plot is still taking shape , even though there may be hard work to do -- such as , in the case of my patient , learning to tolerate the unknown of the future despite past suffering and to risk rebuilding a social life anyway .
Therapy aims at helping people live in the present free from the compulsion to repeat the past , but you often have to dig down to find what gives rise to the repetition .
Oprah.com : Are you depressed ?
Stay in control of your mind
Finding empathy
I am pretty sure that no amount of medication is going to make disappointment much easier to deal with .
The challenge is how to live a good life in spite of disappointment .
Among the least promising ways is to blame others .
Partners who blame each other for what goes wrong in a relationship wind up acting like people pushing past each other to get on a crowded subway or bus , one saying , " I 'm late ! " and the other replying , " No , I 'm late ! "
The result is an atmosphere of growing tension as the two defend the turf of their separate identities against each other .
What 's needed to transform disappointment in a relationship into something livable in the present and useful for the future is that kind of empathy in which two people 's selves take a backseat to a shared sense of each other 's suffering .
It is impossible to be defensive and empathic at the same time .
Empathy helps turn anger into sorrow .
When sorrow becomes mutual , it begins to erase the lines drawn in the sand .
Only then does the possibility of apology and forgiveness become real .
I consider this sequence -- anger , sorrow , apology , forgiveness -- one of the most important developmental passages in marriage or in therapy with couples because it is a prerequisite for the restoration of innocence .
That may sound strange , but what I mean is not the first innocence of childhood or infatuation but a kind of second innocence , innocence after experience , which is free from repetition and thus can treat a new moment as new .
Repetition kills love .
To experience the next moment with a person as a new moment -- and therefore open to curiosity , surprise , even revelation -- is the heart of love .
A flourishing intimacy is likely to demand an extraordinary amount of empathic and patient cultivation from both partners .
Unfortunately , what we experience growing up in our families or viewing ads of gorgeous couples zooming off for ski vacations in their new BMWs does very little to teach us that creating a satisfying relationship is a difficult but worth while discipline , like mastering a craft or an art form .
The first drafts of love are usually in need of considerable revision .
Romantic love is beautiful , but no matter how full the moon that first night , no matter how many willows are weeping and birds singing your song , you can't build years of relationship on that lovely , fragile foundation alone .
Everything I 've learned from my work with people disappointed in love points to this conclusion :
A mature relationship does n't begin until after disappointment .

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
A key oversight panel released a report Wednesday seeking to have the Treasury Department provide details about how financial institutions receiving capital from a $ 700 billion bailout are using the money .
" The oversight panel believes the public has the right to know how financial institutions that have received public money are using that money , " according to a report produced by the Congressional Oversight Panel for Economic Stability .
" It also believes that Treasury should be responsible for holding individual institutions accountable for how they use public 's money . "
At issue is the governance surrounding how the Treasury Department is spending $ 700 billion in bailout funds for banks .
The report was released at a hearing held Wednesday by House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank , D - Mass .
Frank said he expects to hold a hearing either later this year or early next year to hear testimony from executives of banks receiving bailout funds .
The timing of the hearing will be based , in part , on whether or when the Treasury Department seeks the second half of the bailout fund .
See the report .
“ ' Treasury should be responsible for holding individual institutions accountable for how they use public 's money . ' ”
A GOP - nominated panel member , Rep. Jeb Hensarling , R - Texas , said he was happy with many of the questions addressed in the report , but that he has concerns about whether the oversight panel is allocating its own resources effectively .
He expects the panel will have a series of hearings on the bailout funds to examine , in part , why certain financial institutions received capital injections while others have n't .
" I am concerned about how Treasury adopts policies that could delay the recovery of our housing market at exactly the wrong time , " he added .
The report acknowledges it is a " difficult challenge " for Treasury to identify how financial institutions receiving government - capital injections are being used , because " systemic economic effects take time to manifest themselves . "
In the report , the oversight panel says that because other government agencies , such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp . and the Federal Reserve , have their own separate programs in place to encourage financial institutions to lend , it is difficult for Treasury to track the specific impact of the funds provided as part of the $ 700 billion package .
In addition , the report calls on the Treasury to provide details why it is opposed to a plan introduced by FDIC Chairwoman Sheila Bair , which would use $ 24.4 billion of the bailout fund to assist lenders to modify mortgages as a plan to avert foreclosures .
Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren is chairwoman of the oversight panel .
Accountability
The Treasury should obtain and provide some details about the lending plans of participating financial institutions , according to Consumer Federation of America researcher Barbara Roper .
" Pressure is being brought to bear on Treasury to be a lot more accountable for how they are spending this money , " she said .
Defending governance of the government 's plan , Assistant Treasury Secretary Neel Kashkari told lawmakers Wednesday that the department is working with other banking regulators to obtain quarterly reports of participating financial institutions and " what else we need " to identify the extent to which lending is taking place .
Frank and other lawmakers expressed concern about both the conclusion of the congressional panel 's report and a study released last week by the Government Accountability Office that raised some issues as well .
Treasury should take steps to provide details about lending , Frank told Kashkari , so that he could be better prepared to defend release of the second half of the funds to Treasury , should it be requested .
" Whether or not there is a successful attempt to draw down the second $ 350 billion will be based on whether there are attempts to limit mortgage foreclosure , other consumer matters and showing that there is some way of counting how the funds are being used , " the legislator said .
Several lawmakers were worried that Congress was not moving to oversee some of the recent actions taken by the Federal Reserve to limit the financial crisis .
For example , the Treasury announced a program Nov. 25 that would use $ 20 billion of the funds to back a consumer - lending facility to be run by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to provide liquidity to consumer loans , such as student loans and credit cards . \
" We in Congress will be negligent if we only focus on TARP [ the Troubled Asset Relief Program ] and not the actions taken by Federal Reserve , " Hensarling said .
More help for homeowners
Some lawmakers expressed a desire for Treasury to establish additional programs to help homeowners .
Rep. Carolyn Maloney , D - N.Y. , said she has been receiving lots of support for an idea reportedly floated by the Treasury department that would use government funds to cut mortgage rates for new loans for homes to as low as 4.5 % , roughly 1 percentage point lower than current rates .
" My phone has rung off the hook with people calling in support of it , " Maloney said .
Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren , chairwoman of the governance panel , testified at the hearing that she was n't resistant to the idea of helping out new homebuyers with a 4.5 % rate , but that lawmakers should also focus energy on assisting existing borrowers to refinance their existing loans .
Warren said lawmakers may want to revive efforts to change bankruptcy law and let judges adjust the terms of mortgages .
In September , many Democrats sought unsuccessfully to include bankruptcy law modification as part of the larger $ 700 billion bank bailout package that passed Oct. 3 .
Should lawmakers consider the measure again , it would give judges the authority to modify mortgages such as reduce principal or interest rates or lengthen the amount of time to pay back the mortgages .
" We have to think about who will be the beneficiary of these measures , " Warren said .
Maloney added that lawmakers are considering introduction of legislation that would require Treasury to use $ 24.4 billion of the remaining bank bailout funds to employ Bair 's mortgage modification proposal .
The measure would require Treasury to implement the mortgage modification package to gain congressional approval to use the remaining $ 350 billion in funds .
The report also calls on Treasury to provide details why it is opposed to a plan introduced by Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
Chairwoman Sheila
Bair that would use $ 24.4 billion of the bailout fund to assist lenders to modify mortgages as a plan to avert foreclosures
MySpace provided two state attorneys general the names of 90,000 registered sex offenders it had banned from its site in response to a subpoena .
The figure is 40,000 more than the amount previously acknowledged by MySpace , according to Attorney General Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut , who along with Attorney General Roy Cooper of North Carolina are among officials pressing social networking sites to adopt more stringent safety measures .
“ Almost 100,000 convicted sex offenders mixing with children on MySpace — shown by our subpoena — is absolutely appalling and totally unacceptable , ” Mr. Blumenthal said in a statement .
“ For every one of them , there may be hundreds of others using false names and ages . ”
Last year , MySpace , owned by News Corporation , and Facebook.com agreed to set security standards after the Web sites were criticized for not doing enough to protect minors from sexual predators lurking on social networking sites .
How many more of these offenders will pop up on the popular teen site ?
I am sure MySpace is moderating their site to ensure that if anyone violates their terms of use will be banned and reported .
This is not going to be an easy task , and some offenders may slip under the radar .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A senior Senate Democrat said on Wednesday a planned economic stimulus package will likely include money and tax breaks for doctors and hospitals to buy advanced technology that will make it easier for them to share patient care information .
Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus , a Montana Democrat , said at a news conference that lawmakers were discussing what should be included in the package of tax breaks and infrastructure spending that President - elect Barack Obama has said will be needed to jump start the faltering economy .
Baucus said the package , which some have estimated would be about $ 500 billion to $ 700 billion , would also include tax incentives for businesses and alternative energy as well as tax relief for the middle class .
As head of the tax - writing Finance Committee , Baucus will have a major say in what goes into the legislation .
About half the value of the economic recovery package could be in the form of tax relief , he said .
Obama has said he wants an economic package that would include the largest infrastructure investment since the 1950s .
That infrastructure investment will likely include grants and tax incentives for health information technology , Baucus said .
Businesses and health reform advocates have said harmonizing the electronic standards needed to exchange information about patient care could go a long way toward reducing costs .
Lawmakers are working to address privacy concerns with such technology .
He declined to give a specific amount for the technology aid .
But when asked if it would amount to the $ 50 billion some have suggested is needed , Baucus said that “ might be a little high . ”
Baucus , who also plans to work with Obama to push for major health - care reform legislation next year , said including information technology in the economic stimulus will help get a jump start on the overall reform .
“ We have to make a start , ” he said .
The economic stimulus plan is also likely to include aid to cash - strapped states to help them pay for the Medicaid health care program for the poor .
Lawmakers are also discussing whether to include temporarily extending a children ’s health care program that expires in March , giving them time to more fully address the issue in a broader health reform .
The chemical acts on receptors in the brain .
A synthetic drug that is up to five times as powerful as cannabis is being sold legally in Britain , as incense .
It has already been made illegal in Germany and is also banned in the Netherlands .
The drug is based on the chemical JWH018 which mimics the effects of tetra hydra cannabinol or THC , the main active ingredient of cannabis .
Drugs watchdogs are currently investigating the sale of the substance in the UK .
JWH018 , was first synthesised in a US lab in 1995 .
It was originally developed for scientific experiments on chemical receptors in the brain .
However , it is now being manufactured in China , and is being sold at UK events like rock festivals as part of the growing " legal high " industry .
Concerns
The UK drugs regulator , the Medicine and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency ( MHRA ) , is understood to have identified JWH018 in products available in the UK .
It is currently in order to determine whether or not it should be classified as a medicinal product - which would mean it should only be available from a doctor .
We 're not aware of casualties appearing in A&E , but there 's an underlying potential for a problem
Dr John Ramsey
The UK Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs , which advises the government on whether a drug should be made illegal , is also aware of the substance , and is investigating it .
In addition to being illegal in Germany , it has been banned in the Netherlands and its legality is under review in Austria .
But scientists do not know what side effects the drug could have , as no tests have been done on its toxicity either in the lab or on animals .
Toxicologist Dr John Ramsey , who runs the Tic Tac Communications drugs database at St George 's Medical School in London , said : " It 's not a problem at the moment , in that we 're not aware of casualties appearing in A&E , but there 's an underlying potential for a problem . "
He added that there were between 20 and 30 other similar substances that could be added to the incense mixtures .

Canadian Auto Workers union lobbies for military contracts
By Carl Bronski
24 January 2009
The Canadian Auto Workers ( CAW ) union has ratcheted up its nationalist " Buy Canadian " campaign in response to the deepening world economic crisis — a crisis that resulted in the elimination of close to 150,000 full - time jobs in Canada in the last two months of 2008 and has brought the Detroit automakers to the brink of bankruptcy .
The CAW 's " Buy Canadian " campaign is diametrically opposed to , and meant to prevent the development of , a genuine struggle in defence of the jobs , wages and rights of workers .
It is predicated on slavish acceptance of the dictatorship of big business — of the subordination of socio- economic life , including workers ' jobs , to the corporate drive for profit — and serves to pit Canadian workers against their class brothers and sisters in other countries .
While the CAW and other unions in Canada shout " Buy Canadian , " the labor bureaucrats elsewhere counter with " Buy American , " " Buy British , " or " Buy Japanese " campaigns .
The promotion of protectionism and trade war goes hand - in - hand with the unions ' efforts to " save " jobs by ensuring corporate " competitiveness , " through wage cuts , speed - up and job - cutting work - rule changes .
The CAW , like the UAW in the US , is currently in the midst of imposing another round of massive concessions on workers at the Big Three to satisfy Washington 's and Ottawa 's demand that any auto industry bailout be conditional on reducing workers ' wages and benefits to the levels prevailing at the non-union Japanese transplant operations in the southern US .
The reactionary character of the CAW 's " Buy Canadian " campaign is underscored by its recent appeals to the federal Conservative government to speed up military procurement and ensure that new equipment for the Canadian Armed Forces be built in Canada .
The Conservatives , led by the neo-conservative ideologue Stephen Harper , have placed the revival of the Canadian Armed Forces ( CAF ) as an instrument of war at the center of their agenda , extending and expanding the CAF 's leading role in the Afghan war and announcing ambitious plans to re-arm the military .
The CAW is urging the government to revisit a recent decision by Public Works Canada to award a military truck contract to a Navistar assembly plant south of the border .
A division of International Trucks , Navistar maintains facilities in Canada , the United States and Mexico .
It was the only company to bid on a C$ 254 million contract to build a new fleet of 1,300 medium - duty logistics trucks for the Canadian military .
The company has earmarked the contract for its Garland , Texas , facility .
In a letter to the Conservative Minister of Defence , Peter MacKay , CAW president Ken Lewenza wrote , " Canadians would agree that our military should have the best equipment to deal with their requirements .... [ But ] if we are going to try and stimulate the economy in Canada and specifically , where manufacturing is at an all time low and job loss is unprecedented , your government must recognize how critical it is to ensure Canadian tax dollars are spent to put Canadians to work . "
The CAW is seeking to " make hay " from the Public Works announcement by linking the steady stream of layoffs at Navistar 's Chatham , Ontario , heavy truck assembly plant with the awarding of the military contract to the firm 's Texas operation .
Over the next few weeks , truck production at the Chatham facility will be reduced from 100 vehicles per day to just 40 .
Some of the reduced production will be made up at a low - wage plant in Escobido , Mexico .
However , the lion 's share is being eliminated and may never be restored .
More than 2,300 North American trucking firms have collapsed in the past year as sky - rocketing fuel prices followed rapidly by the ongoing economic crisis laid low an entire industry .
Navistar announced last week that 200 workers at the plant would be laid off on March 1 .
Only last November , the company issued layoff notices to an additional 500 workers .
Those cuts will take affect at the end of January .
After the March layoffs , 180 workers will remain in the plant and 80 more in the offices .
At the peak of production only 10 years ago , the plant employed almost 1,800 workers .
The company is committed under the current contract with the CAW to produce no fewer than 35 vehicles per day for the first quarter of this year .
Daily production will drop further in the spring .
When the collective agreement expires on June 1 , many fear that the plant will be permanently closed .
Already , one of Navistar 's main competitors , Daimler AG Sterling Trucks in nearby St. Thomas , Ontario , has announced the final closure of its Freightliner plant for March with the attendant layoff of 1,300 workers .
In 2003 , a year after the conclusion of a bitter six - week strike in Chatham that saw the CAW sign away C$ 44 million in concessions , Navistar accepted C$35 million from the Ontario government and C$ 30 million from Ottawa in a bailout package designed to keep the plant from being shuttered .
Both Navistar corporate spokesmen and Conservative Party Members of Parliament have defended the military contract decision .
In a statement issued from Navistar 's headquarters in Chicago , Illinois , Roy Wiley said that as the Chatham facility is tooled only for heavy - duty trucks , it would be too costly to reconfigure the assembly line to accommodate the lighter - duty model specified in the government tender .
Public Works Minister Christian Paradis supported the company 's position .
In a brief statement , he asserted , " The proposal was [ evaluated ] and the Government of Canada negotiated with the company to ensure the best overall value for Canadian taxpayers . "
The CAW and Chatham - Kent Labour Council are mounting a protest outside the office of the local Conservative MP , Dave Van Kesteren , today , January 24 , to press their demand that the government force Navistar to shift the military - truck contract to its Chatham plant .
The unions however will mount no challenge to Navistar 's " right " to eliminate jobs .
The CAW 's campaign for military contracts to be used to support Canadian manufacturing dovetails with demands from the right wing , the Canadian military , and Canadian arms manufacturers for speeded - up and increased military procurements to be an important part of any federal government economic stimulus package .
The Conference of Defence Associations ( CDA ) , a pro-military lobby group with intimate connections to the military and arms manufacturers , has argued that increased military spending is fully consistent with the stated goals of the government 's stimulus package : that initiatives be " timely , " " maximize " economic benefits to Canada , and conform with the government 's long - term policies .
Specifically , the CDA is urging the government to modernize the physical infrastructure at Canadian military bases and other Defence Department facilities and build three naval supply vessels .
Last year , the government cancelled the naval project after both the final bids exceeded the money budgeted for the project .
" An investment in the capital renewal of the [ Defence ]
Department 's physical infrastructure would certainly meet the criteria you have established , " declared CDA Chairman and retired CAF Lieutenant - General Richard Evraire in a December 16 statement , to the government 's " National consultation on budget actions to protect Canada 's economy . "
" The investment , " said Evraire , " will benefit local contractors and labour such that the economic benefits will remain in Canada . "
Similarly , the naval contract would be , said Evraire , a means of promoting " industrial and regional development , " in accordance with " the government 's Buy Canada policy " and its " Canada First Defence Policy . "
( Released last May , the Conservatives ' " Canada First Defence Policy " calls for Ottawa to spend C$ 490 billion so as to give Canada , in the words of Prime Minster Harper , " the capacity to act " on the world stage , ensuring thereby that the aims and interests of the Canadian elite will " be taken seriously in the world . " )
The CAW and New Democratic Party MP Peter Stoffer mounted a joint appeal in Halifax January 15 for the Conservatives to include the naval vessels project and the purchase of 12 coast guard vessels in its stimulus package .
" The federal Conservative government , " declared the CAW 's Atlantic Director Les Holloway , " must immediately push ahead with plans to build these three [ navy ] ships and it must build them in Canada . "
Both the CAW and the social - democratic NDP claim to oppose Canada 's leading role in the war to prop up the US - installed government in Afghanistan .
But in the interests of bringing to power a Liberal - led coalition government in Ottawa , the NDP has announced it is ready to set aside its opposition to the war — that is to say , it is ready to serve in a government that will wage the war at least through 2011 .
Similarly , the NDP has said that in the interests of allying with the Liberals , it will abandon is opposition to the C$ 50 billion five - year Liberal - Conservative plan to slash corporate taxes .
As for the CAW , it is one of the most fervent advocates of the coalition .
What ’s the next step for the netbook ?
If these sneaked pictures are to be believed , the tiny machines are going slimline , making them even more purse - friendly .
This is the new Acer Aspire One , spotted by a reader of the German news site Netbook News .
Thankfully , the anonymous tipster broke the cardinal rule for leaked product shots — he actually managed to keep the camera still and take sharp pictures .
The specs are all netbook - standard , from the N270 1.6 GHz Atom chip to the 160 GB hard drive .
But the difference is the thickness , at 2.4 cm ( 0.94 ” ) .
That ’s not exactly MacBook Air thin , but it ’s pretty decent for a netbook .
Looks - wise , we ’re reminded of nothing so much as the pre-metal PowerBooks , a delightfully retro touch .
Being a leak , there are no launch dates but curiously the anonymous tipster has furnished us with a full set of specifications , which you ’ll find machine translated below along with some more snaps of the skinny new shell .

Do Plants Speed Up Recovery
In Hospitals ?
Contact with nature has long been believed to increase positive feelings , reduce stress and provide distraction from the pain associated with hospital stays and researchers now say they have confirmed the beneficial effects of plants and flowers for patients recovering from abdominal surgery .
A recent study by Seong - Hyun Park and Richard H. Mattson , researchers from the Department of Horticulture , Recreation and Forestry at Kansas State University , provides evidence that contact with plants is directly beneficial to a hospital patient 's health .
Using various medical and psychological measurements , the study set out to evaluate if plants in hospital rooms have therapeutic influences .
Studies show that when patients have great stress associated with surgery , they typically experience more severe pain and a slower recovery period .
Some of these problems are treated through the use of anesthetics and analgesics , but , if not properly administered , the drugs can have side effects ranging from vomiting and headaches to drug dependency or even fatality .
It is therefore beneficial to patients and care providers to develop approaches that improve the overall patient experience but do n't rely on pharmaceuticals .
The study was conducted on 90 patients recovering from an appendectomy .
Patients were randomly assigned to hospital rooms with or without plants during their postoperative recovery periods .
Data collected for the study included information on the length of hospitalization , administration of drugs for postoperative pain control , vital signs , ratings of pain intensity , distress , fatigue and anxiety , and the patient 's room satisfaction questionnaire .
Patients with plants in their rooms had significantly fewer intakes of pain medication , more positive physiological responses ( lower blood pressure and heart rate ) , less pain , anxiety , and fatigue , and better overall positive and higher satisfaction with their recovery rooms than their counterparts in the control group without plants in their rooms .
An interesting note to this study — the majority of patients who had plants in their rooms reported that the plants were the most positive qualities of their rooms ( 93 % ) , whereas patients without plants in their rooms said that watching television was the most favorable aspect of their rooms ( 91 % ) .
The study suggests that potted plants offer the most benefit , as opposed to cut flowers , because of their longevity .
Nursing staff reported that as patients recovered , they began to show interaction with the plants , including watering , pruning , and moving them for a better view or light .
A number of studies have also shown that indoor plants make air healthier and provide an optimum indoor environment by increasing humidity , and reducing the quantity of mold spores and airborne germs .
This nonpharmacological approach to recovery is good news for patients , doctors , and insurers alike in terms of cost effectiveness and medical benefits .
The study provides strong evidence that contact with plants is directly beneficial to patients ' health , providing meaningful therapeutic contact for patients recovering from painful surgery .

I AM IN SO MUCH PAIN !!!!
An 800 milligram Ibuprofren and a heating pad later … I mentally justified my agony as I stretched this morning .
I AM IN LOVE WITH Wii. AND LOVE , IS SOMETHING UNCONTROLLABLE .
A little background info …
I ’ve played Wii several times before ; once at a promo party when it was first released and a few times at various friends ’ houses .
Threw a few strikes with a virtual bowling ball and raced on a cow ’s back for fun between beers .
Yeah , I thought it was fun , but never really got into it .
Not in the way that I ’ve gotten into certain Xbox or online games .
Not in a way where I felt like I might die if I could n’t play .
My Wii emotions changed over this holiday .
I met DDR on Christmas Day , fell head - over - heels in love and knew for sure that I might die if I woke up tomorrow and the blue and white mat was n’t waiting for me in front of the TV .
Santa brought me new Choos , an iPod ( to replace the one I left on an airplane ) , a Wii and Dance Dance Revolution .
I ’m terrified that the big guy made a mistake and hit the wrong house .
What if my stellar gifts were intended for the girl who lives next door … you know … the one who was nice all year ????
EEK !
My stuff has n’t been repo’d yet , so perhaps I was left off the naughty list for the first time since ’ 88 .
SWEET .
My new favorite toy could n’t have come at a better time .
I smashed 6 tamales and about 8 cocktails on Christmas Eve … a workout was definitely in order .
The family gathered ’round and we each created our Miis , which is an inexplicably comical process .
Why is a cartoon - like image of people you know so funny ?
I have no idea , but it is hilarious .
About 15 of us battled one another in Wii boxing , baseball , tennis , bowling , and golf .
It got competitive … REALLY competitive .
My parents ’ family room sounded like game 7 of the World Series … bases loaded , bottom of the ninth , 2 outs … only difference was my cousin was up to bat , not Babe Ruth .
Our series wrapped up around 2:30 a.m. and after everyone turned in , I decided to crack open the DDR box for a looksie .
I envisioned the one - legged champion who I ’d seen crushing it on YouTube … had a moment of inspiration so I ignored the clock , popped in the disc and plugged in the mat for a quick test run .
Six hours later , I saw my mom ’s reflection in the slider .
I was mid arrow left + down , double right nunchuk … I turned to look at her just as she stopped dead in her tracks and said , “ Oh my god , ” in a low , serious voice .
With one hand over mouth , no doubt an attempt to hold back laughter at the sight of her adult daughter in a sweatsuit , cutting a DDR rug , in her living room .
I stepped off the mat and paused the techno beat .
I was instantly overwhelmed with fatigue and nausea .
“ What time is it ? ” I asked .
I blinked and it stung like tiny pieces of glass were slicing through my eyes .
“ Six in the morning , ” she said through a chuckle .
I walked to my old bedroom and crashed out .
Six hours later , I was woken up by dishes clanging , people laughing , and music pumping — the standard soundtrack at my rents ’ house .
I found the fam and some friends already deep into some Wii sports action .
There were empty beer cans , glasses of wine , and finger foods everywhere .
I saw a pad of paper revealing a pool that my dad created and my aunt was holding an ice pack to her ankle .
Holy $ # %!
We ’ve all lost our minds .
I was pretty sore from my private DDR party , but got suckered into a cold Chelada and a bowling tourney by 1 p.m .
Day 2 was much like the day 1 .
Wii sports all day , DDR all night .
On day 3 I had to slowly roll out of bed , OUCH !
My calves were on fire and my right tricep throbbed .
I limped to the bathroom and took advantage of the steam .
About 15 minutes into a piping hot shower , I thought about how Wii-crazy I ’d gone and how I ’d really like to spend some one - on - one time with mom .
I figured maybe I ’d take her shopping or to a movie .
I quickly got ready and headed for the kitchen to put on some coffee .
I was pleased to find the smell of fresh grinds lingering in the hallway … someone had beat me to it — nice !
Oh , how I wish I had the next minute on video to show you … I ’d kill to have it all on tape !!!!
I turned the corner and found my mom standing in front of the 50 inch flatscreen , one Wii controller in her right hand and THE SECOND CONTROLLER IN HER LEFT HAND .
WAIT … WHAT ?!
Mom had to get her Wii on so bad that she was actually playing 2 Miis at once ?!
Yes , I saw it with my own eyes , she was smashing tennis balls … serving AND playing .
SWEET .
She spun around with a face of embarrassment laced with guilt .
I BUSTED OUT laughing .
“ No one was awake , so I … I thought I ’d , I was bored so I just , I — ” she stammered .
“ Who ’s winning ? ” I asked .
I could not hold in my laughter .
“ Oh , shut up , ” she said and handed me one of the controllers .
And like that … day 3 began .
Somewhere into day 4 I had another moment of what are Wii doing … uh , I mean we … but everytime the gaming stopped , it never lasted .
The “ let ’s stop moments ” were merely time outs .
Some of our family traditions were skipped this holiday … my mom and I usually do some after - Christmas sale shopping , I did n’t make my famous sugar cookies , and my dad never built the fire he does every year on Dec 25th ( we were all sweatin ’ from the Wii , it was too damn hot ) .
But , now that I think about it , those traditions were not moments lost , they were moments gained .
Rather than spending more money , eating more fatty sweets , and sitting still like a pile of over - stuffed potatoes on the couch … we played as a family , we laughed as a family and hell , we even burned some calories as a family !
There is definitely something to be said about that .
Today is day 5 of my new found Wii love .
I ’m back at work .
WICKED SORE .
But it ’s going to be okay …
’ cause in just 9 hours …
I ’ll be free …
free to Wii .
SWEET .

Best Allegory for the Condition of the Urban Male in the Modern World : Quantum of Solace
Everything wrong with the Oscars can be summed up by this fact : Nobody has ever won Best Actor for James Bond .
We ex-pect them to ignore the best of high art — to pick Rocky over Taxi Driver .
The problem is , they wo n't go low , either .
James Bond is the John Wayne for men who live in big cities — the model of the sophistication , confidence , and aplomb needed to survive in complex societies .
Daniel Craig's is the darkest
Bond yet but also one of the most honest : a man facing a brutal world in which the enemy is secretive and unknown , and he 's betrayed by all the institutions he cares about .
Is n't art supposed to reflect the world unflinchingly , to " hold the mirror up to nature , " no matter how uncomfortable the reflection may be ?
Quantum of Solace does it .
The al - Qa'ida leader Osama bin Laden called for jihad ( holy struggle ) over the Israeli offensive in Gaza in a new audio tape that appeared on Islamist websites today .
The Saudi - born militant said the global financial crisis had exposed the waning US influence in world affairs and would in turn weaken its ally Israel .

" Our brothers in Palestine , you have suffered a lot .... the Muslims sympathise with you in what they see and hear .
We , the mujahideen , sympathise with you also ... " bin Laden said in the tape entitled ' A Call for Jihad to Stop the Aggression against Gaza ' .
" We are with you and we will not let you down .
Our fate is tied to yours in fighting the Crusader - Zionist coalition , in fighting until victory or martyrdom . "
The Palestinian death toll from a 19 - day - old Israeli offensive to crush the Islamist Hamas movement in Gaza has risen to 971 , causing widespread anger among ordinary Arabs and Muslims .
Israel says 13 Israelis have been killed by rockets or mortars from Gaza .
In the 22 - minute tape , bin Laden said that the United States was losing its dominant position in the world and that this was due to al - Qa'ida 's campaign .
" The jihad of your sons against the Crusader - Zionist coalition is one of the key reasons for these destructive effects among our enemies , " bin Laden said in the tape that was dated in the current Islamic month .
" God has bestowed us with the patience to continue the path of jihad for another seven years , and seven and seven ...
The question is , can America continue its war with us for several more decades to come ?
Reports and evidence would suggest otherwise . "
The authenticity of the tape , produced by al - Qa'ida 's media arm As - Sahab , could not immediately be verified but the voice sounded like that of bin Laden .

Bin Laden last appeared in an audio tape in May and also focused on Gaza , calling on Muslims to try to help end the blockade of the area .
The al - Qa'ida leader has placed growing emphasis on the Israeli - Palestinian conflict in recent years and Wednesday 's audio tape was accompanied by a still of bin Laden and a picture of al - Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem , Islam 's third holiest shrine .
Behind the September 11 , 2001 attack on US cities , al - Qa'ida has regularly called for attacks on the Jewish state .
Al Qaeda is widely blamed for a suicide attack on an Israeli - owned hotel in Kenya and a simultaneous failed attempt to shoot down an Israeli charter jet near Mombasa airport in 2002 .
She added : " I do n't want to scare anyone any more than necessary , but felt it was best I made you all aware of the situation and what we are doing about it .
WASHINGTON  The Supreme Court on Monday revived a lawsuit brought by four former prisoners at Guantánamo Bay against Donald H. Rumsfeld , the former defense secretary , and other officials .
The former prisoners , all British citizens , say they were tortured and subjected to religious persecution .
In a brief order , the justices instructed a federal appeals court to take a second look at the case in light of the Supreme Court ’s decision in June in Boumediene v. Bush granting Guantánamo prisoners the right to challenge their detention in federal court .
The appeals court , the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit , ruled against the men in January , saying that neither the Constitution nor a federal law protecting religious freedom gave them the right to sue in American courts .
In urging the Supreme Court not to hear the case , the Justice Department said the Boumediene decision “ did not overturn the court ’s prior rulings that the individual - rights provisions of the Constitution run only to aliens who have a substantial connection to our country and not to enemy combatants who are detained abroad . ”
( CNN ) --
The maker of peanut butter linked to a nationwide outbreak of salmonella shipped tainted product it knew had tested positive for the bacteria , the Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday .
The Peanut Corporation of America found salmonella in its plant in Blakely , Georgia , the FDA said .
The FDA report said the Peanut Corporation of America 's own testing program found strains of salmonella 12 times in 2007 and 2008 at its Blakely , Georgia , plant .
The problem does not appear to have been resolved .
When FDA inspectors visited the plant this month , they reported finding still more salmonella contamination .
According to the inspection report , posted on the FDA 's Web site , the " firm 's own internal microbiological testing " found salmonella in peanut paste , peanut butter , peanut meal , peanut granules and oil - roasted , salted peanuts .
Watch what violations occurred at the plant »
However , it added , " After the firm retested the product and received a negative status , the product was shipped . "
That 's not the way it ought to have been handled , according to one expert .
" They were lab shopping , " said Tommy Irvin , Georgia 's agriculture commissioner .
" They were trying to find a way to clear their product , so they can ship their product out , " he told CNN .

He said proper practices demand that if any food product tests positive for salmonella and another test comes back negative , " you believe the one that is positive . "
In a written statement , the company denied accusations it had been " lab shopping " to get a negative test result in order to ship the product .
" PCA uses only two highly reputable labs for product testing and they are widely used by the industry and employ good laboratory practices , " the company said .
" PCA categorically denies any allegations that the company sought favorable results from any lab in order to ship its products . "
But according to Irvin , once salmonella is found in a product , " that lot should be destroyed , but [ in this case it ] was n't . "
The Georgia Department of Agriculture is working with the FDA on the investigation of the outbreak , which has been linked to the plant .
" The inspection also revealed no steps were taken in terms of cleaning or cross- contamination " after the salmonella was found in the plant , said FDA 's director of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition , Dr. Stephen Sundlof .
The company did not clean the production line after Salmonella Typhimurium , the bacterium implicated in the outbreak , was found there last September , according to the FDA report .
This is the same type of bacteria found in 502 people who have become ill in 43 states and Canada since September .
At least eight deaths have been linked to the outbreak .
Violations also include contamination of plant surfaces and equipment by other microorganisms , the discovery of roaches near production and packaging areas and the inability of the company 's ventilation system to prevent the salmonella from contaminating other parts of the plant .
Sundlof said the reported problems indicate the plant deviated from the good manufacturing practices companies are supposed to follow .
The FDA investigation began January 9 , shortly after the manufacturer was implicated as a source of the outbreak .
The plant produces peanut butter sold to institutions , such as nursing homes and cafeterias , as well as peanut paste , which is used in cookies , crackers , ice cream and pet treats .
Watch the salmonella outbreak that has sickened hundreds »
This month , Peanut Corporation of America began recalling peanut butter and paste produced since July 1 .
The recall was expanded Wednesday to include products produced since January 1 , 2007 .
More than 300 products using PCA 's peanut paste and peanut butter have already been recalled and the FDA has urged consumers to check the agency 's
Web site frequently for updates .

Federal health officials recommend that consumers throw away any recalled products and not consume any products whose safety cannot be verified .
The American Peanut Council has compiled a list of companies not implicated in the recall on www.peanutsusa.com.

The monetary base has again risen dramatically over the past few weeks up 38 % yoy , the largest increase since 1939 .
You can expect all the major central banks to do the same thing , as this was a large part of what G - 20 was all about .
Those of you , as we mentioned over the past several weeks , who do n’t believe loans are loosening up are wrong , they are .
Consumer and bank lending has grown by an annualized rate of close to 50 % in the last six months .
As this unfolds we see demonstrations in Iceland where the currency has been crippled , inflation is 18 % and no one trusts government , bankers and politicians anymore .
European banks will take a $ 75 billion hit on this fiasco .
Incidentally Danske Bank sees Iceland ’s inflation hitting 75 % .
That could well cause the overthrow of the government .
The Iceland experience could be the forerunner for America three years from now .
It could be preceded by Pakistan , Argentina and a number of other countries .
Just last week Argentina confiscated pension plans worth $ 26 billion .
Our House of Representatives has discussed a similar plan .
Then there are the loans all over the world in trillions of dollars that will never be repaid .
They ’ll be monetized and American taxpayers will again pay the bill .
The prime targets for trouble are not just the ones you notice among the major countries , but all over the world , especially in Eastern Europe and Latin America - things are going to be every bit as bad .
Deficits in Eastern Europe are close to 10 % of GDP whereas 3 % is normal .
Cross border lending by European and UK banks to emerging market countries accounts for 22 - 1/ 2 % of respective GDPs compared to 4 % for US banks and 5 % for Japanese banks .
Europe has $ 3.5 trillion of debt outstanding to these financially 3rd world countries whereas the US has only about $ 500 billion .
Most exposed is Austria .
Those loans make up 85 % of their GDP , most of it in Eastern Europe .
They are the largest holders of debt in the Ukraine and Hungary - two very weak banking systems .
Italy ’s public debt is now the third largest in the world behind the US and Japan .
At 107 % of GDP it is twice the Maastricht limit .
When Italy joined the Eurozone they were hardly qualified to do so and we said so at that time .
They lied about their finances and everyone looked the other way .
Their problems are shown in their bond yields , which are 1.08 % more than similar German bonds .
This predicament probably will force Italy and perhaps Austria out of the euro .
British bank exposure is primarily in Asia and Latin America .
Sweden is exposed in the Baltic .
Spain is the largest lender in Latin America .
That is indeed dire news when the domestic economy is in such trouble .
They have lent $ 830 billion in Latin America .
Today worldwide banks are very interconnected and in the current environment that is very bad news , because eventually problems in one sphere will affect other spheres , making all currencies fall against gold .
Then there are the de-leveraging hedge funds of which over the next year could see 1,000 or 50 % of their number , close down or go bankrupt .
Hedge funds just sold about $ 600 billion in assets to meet redemptions and to reduce assets to conform to lower lending by lenders .
For now that selling is over with .
We could see a reoccurrence in February if credit lines are cut again , or if redemptions rise again .
That $ 600 billion represents 30 % of hedge fund assets .
We expect the market to move lower earlier in the year so we could expect another $ 300 billion liquidation in February or March .
We are assuming credit wo n’t be cut further .
We see present leverage at 1.4 to 2 to 1 .
Hedge funds , banks , brokerage houses and insurance companies were and are big players in the writing of CDS , credit default swaps , some $ 50 trillion to $ 60 trillion worth .
Most of this derivative commitment is not hedged .
The writers are running naked .
If we have a string of corporate failures such as GM and Ford , etc. , which is very possible , the system will collapse .
That is possible and probable .
We have not seen a market selling climax , so pressure will remain on the market for sometime to come .
All the fairy tale rallies – the “ Working Group on Financial Markets ” creates will not last .
2009 will see many bankruptcies .
Investors have not capitulated , nor do many really understand the severe gravity of our economic and financial problems .
95 % of investors , the public and Wall Street still do not get it .
One of the reasons is government ’s phony statistics .
They believe the government .
They would not think of thinking outside the box .
That is where the problem lies .
If you do not think outside the box you are doomed .
Bear Stearns , Fannie and Freddie and AIG were just tips of Icebergs .
Bear and AIG were supposed to be the best of the best .
If they got in trouble what is going to happen to the rest of the players ?
Pros and investors are in denial .
They just are unwilling to accept that all the things they knew , there whole lives are going to change for the worse for a long time to come .
The worst of the financial crisis is not behind us .
It is in front of us .
That will be exacerbated by the coming economic crisis .
We ’ve had two major manipulated rallies in the past month .
That is n’t unusual in a bear market with or without government manipulation .
Some hedge funds have a liquidation cut off of 12/31/08 , so any rally will be used for some unusual selling .
That will put a lid on any real upside action .
Sixteen months ago the US financial system went into a state of collapse and the rest of the world is caught in the same trap .
No grandiose plan by anyone has been offered or concocted to save the economy and the financial system or the economy .
All the so - called solutions have not and will not work .
More debt and increased taxes wo n’t work .
As a result , governments worldwide are under attack - an extension of religious warfare in India , demonstrations in Iceland and Thailand and justified smoldering resentment .
Our management , corporate , financial and governmental is corrupt and is a failure as it is in most other countries .
Your assets are not safe from anything .
2009 will see bedlam in every sector of every economy in the world .
Your best shot at financial survival is in gold and silver related assets , as we start the second of four phases of the biggest bull market in history .
That leads us to the US government bond market , which is suffering a crisis of confidence and it could n’t have happened at a worse time .
Here is our Treasury and the Fed bailing out Illuminist Wall Street , banking and corporate America via bonds and other money and credit for distressed assets worth an average of $ 0.25 on the dollar .
This has force Treasuries to record low yields at least temporarily .
The one - month bill is yielding 0.2 % .
How can anyone of sane mind buy those bills with inflation at 12 - 1/2 % and our nation is bankrupt .
We recently saw a recommendation by a money manager , brokerage firm recommending US Treasuries .
They have to be out of their minds .
Everytime bonds are issued it makes the issuer less solvent , our currency less viable and the borrower a major loser .
That is why people worldwide for the past six months have been cashing in dollars and other currencies for gold and silver bullion and coins .
Some see what is in our future .
As we stated recently the bond settlement system has broken down .
Fails to deliver in Treasuries are now over $ 2 trillion .
Broker / dealers have stopped delivering bonds and holders are now afraid to lend them into the repo market for fear they ’ll never be returned and potential buyers sit on the sidelines fearful of handing over their money to a counterparty that at best might not deliver a bond on time , or at worst might go under .
This is another reason that US Treasuries are no safe haven .
There is a lack of functionality in the Treasury market and if not soon connected it could lead to negative investor perception .
If that happens the Treasury will find it increasingly difficult and expensive to raise money and to roll over maturing debts .
That will cause interest rates to rise as government is manipulating them lower negating their attempts to jump - start not only the economy , but the world as they both head into depression .
The situation is so far advanced that 10 - year TIPS are pricing in zero or netative average inflation for the next ten years , which , of course , is insane and shows you the extent of bond market manipulation by the Fed to keep interest rates low in order to keep mortgage rates low enough to allow refinancing and new buyers .
Our government has savaged the TIPS inflation spread in order to keep their scam going and to give retirees no return on their Treasury investments .
Anyone who buys US Treasuries is insane or stupid .
Delivery needs to be enforced .
If it is n’t it is over .
It ’s a situation similar to the SEC not enforcing the law on naked shorting .
This game of Wall Street , banking and government always winning is over .
You cannot have 8.6 % of all treasuries outstanding failing in the first five months of the year , compared with 1.2 % in the first five months of 2007 .
Now the figure is $ 2 trillion .
Our elitist globalists are in the process of destroying our financial system to eliminate the nation - state system and impose a global , corporatist , and fascist dictatorship over the entire world .
You subscribers understand this and now perhaps as much as 25 % of our fellow citizens do as well thanks to the Internet and alternative radio .
This time it ’s just not Germany and Italy that is to become fascist , it is the whole world if the Illuminists and Europe ’s Black Nobility has its way .
As part of the Venetian style banking system and the concentration of corporations into cartels , the project is able to finance itself .
It also causes concentration of military and police power under a federal mandate such as Homeland Security to keep the people in line .
Thus we are to have a world system run by banks , finance and insurance companies and corporate cartels .
This is what is to replace the sovereign state .
We saw the Illuminists try this in the Western nations in the 1920s and 1930s .
In the US the driving force was Morgan & Dupont who tried to implant a fascist government .
They were stopped when exposed by General Smedley Butler in 1934 .
The next modern move to fascism began with GATT that was to usher in the WTO in 1986 to develop modern British mercantilism today known as free trade , globalization , offshoring and outsourcing .
During that time frame the corporatist fascist movement was again set in motion by Bilderbergers in 1968 at Mont Tremblant , Canada .
The planning was by George Ball , an Illuminist mover and shaker in those days , who was a senior banker at Lehman Brothers .
He was a key top member of the Illuminati .
He called for the World Company .
The approach has been implemented and it will show you how far ahead the Illuminists plan .
The name changed to globalization in the process .
The process has now reached the stage where debt from banks , finance houses , insurance companies and Illuminist corporations is being transferred from their balance sheets to those of government , which are the people .
During this process the physical economy is simultaneously being driven into the ground , recession begins and depression follows .
De-industrialization is then complete and the economy collapses along with the financial system .
No longer a major producer and only a service provider the economy has a massive account deficit to be funded by foreigners .
This the Illuminists hope will return the world back to the 17th century ’s mercantilist , rentier - financial feudalist model .
This is where the elitists want us to go so get ready for it by protecting your assets by owning gold .
Conditions are going to get considerably more difficult for Americans .
In 2 years 25 % to 38 % of all Americans will be out of work and waiting outside homeless shelters and food pantries .
Many will be the elderly or single women and children .
The question is will welfare and food stamps still be available ?
Many former manufacturing centers already are experiencing 20 % unemployment due to the deliberate elitist policy of transnational conglomerates of free trade , globalization , offshoring and outsourcing .
The financial meltdown has been and will continue to plunge the working class into levels of destitution worse than those seen in the “ Great Depression . ”
As a prelude to this banking , Wall Street and our government squanders taxpayer money on idiotic schemes to prop up bankrupt Illuminist banks , Wall Street , insurance companies and select Illuminist corporations .
In that process faithful workers are thrown onto the street with no further way of making a living .
They are losing their homes , jobs and vehicles and some are living under bridges .
Our Treasury and the Fed are holding trillions of dollars in almost worthless assets .
Each day billions of taxpayer dollars are being thrown into a black hole .
The biggest bank and insurance companies in America are bankrupt , Citicorp and AIG .
Retail sales are falling and the entire automotive industry is bankrupt .
Real unemployment is 14 % and long - term unemployment is 18 % .
We ’ll lose about 1.5 million jobs in 2008 to go along with the 5 million lost in the previous 8 years .
In inner city areas young male unemployed is 30 % to 50 % .
Twelve million homes are worth less than their mortgages and millions more will either lose their homes or simply walk away .
Another one - third of homeowners face foreclosure in 2008 .
As Wall Street , banking and corporate America are bailed out the USDA ’s Emergency Food Assistance Program has cut its donations to the poor from $ 240 million to $ 59 million .
Social assistance programs have been laid waste in Medicaid and education .
Tax revenue continues to plummet in every state , almost all of which have been terribly managed .
States have imposed hiring freezes , cancelled raises and are cutting back expenses .
In many states such as California and New York unemployment insurance funds are running out .
Recently we ran the numbers of Barak Obama ’s major contributors , which was Wall Street , banking , corporate America and the University of California – Berkeley , a long time nest of far left and communist causes .
This is whom Obama is beholden too , not the American people .
Obama will expedite the economic collapse by doing very little to help the people as America slips to second - world status .
He will continue the occupations in Iraq and Afghanistan and continue to spend vast amounts on security in the name of the scam called terrorism .
His Cabinet is a rehash of Clinton Illuminists .
The elites remain solidly in power , so much for change .
This while the average American is desperate .
Next comes the social and moral collapse as desperate people do desperate things .
Crime is about to skyrocket .
This is why you need weapons in your home to defend your family .
They ’ll soon come a time when everyone will be carrying arms , laws or no laws .
Your nation is in the process of crumbling physically and morally as our politicians in Washington , bought and paid for , tends to the needs of the elitists .
Mr. Obama has $ 67 billion more to spend at the Pentagon but less to spend on Americans .
War is profitable for the generals and the corporations and it keeps incumbent politicians in office .
It does nothing for the average American but kill off its young .
Washington and Wall Street continue to be rewarded for incompetence and greed .
We are simply collateral damage in what the elitists believe is a world with too many useless eaters .
The US military expects to have 20l,000 uniformed troops inside the US by 2011 trained to help state and local officials respond to terrorism , nuclear attacks , civil insurrections , or for domestic catastrophe .
This , of course , is in violation of the Posse Comitatus Act , but that is not a bar to our government .
They just refer to the Patriot Acts , which they say overrides the Act .
The Cato Institute and the ACLU disagree .
They consider the placement of military for such purposes an expansion of executive authority .
These 20,000 troops represent a 7 - fold increase in five years .
Our Defense Secretary Robert Gates in moving toward merging the active - duty military and reserve components into an “ integrated total force ” ( a merger ) , calling for wide - ranging personnel policy changes , codifying the reserves ’ homeland defense role and adequately funding oft - overlooked reserve equipment requirements .
As you can see Gates has his own full - time military personnel .
He wants Congress to “ mandate that the National Guard and Reserves have a lead role in and form the backbone of DOD , Department of Defense , operations in the homeland . ”
We were surprised he did n’t say fatherland .
There is no question that Americans have been short - changed by banks , brokerage firms , insurance companies , financial services , the Fed and by their government .
The risks previously borne by these services have been heaped on consumers .
These industries have screwed the public for years , but the last eight years have been disastrous for consumers and a money fest for these financial advisers and that is about to come to an end .
It used to be in the 1980s the financial sector of US corporate profits was 10 % .
In 2007 , it was 35 % .
The theory promulgated by Wall Street that financial innovation would suddenly give customers the ability to manage risks was a lie and catastrophically false .
The bottom line is the brokers and bankers got rich and the investors lost .
Lots of bad news on Monday as defaults on privately insured mortgages rose 35 % in October , topping 80,000 for the first time .
This is up from 59,308 yoy , and surpassed September ’s record of 76,776 .
A.P. says the Bush administration backed off on proposed crackdowns on no-money down , interest - only mortgages years before the economy collapsed , as the big lenders put pressure on the White House .
Action was delayed for a year .
They were all in on the rape of the American homeowner .
Despite the positive twist put on shopping statistics over the Black Friday weekend total holiday sales for the four days were up 2.2 % to $ 470.4 billion .
This is the weakest in six years .
Lured by 70 % discounts retail buyers came out in greater numbers than expected this past holiday weekend .
That was 172 million shoppers , a 17 % increase yoy and up from expert estimates of 128 million .
Online sales were off 4 % yoy .
OPEC left Cairo last weekend without an agreement to further reduce production to push prices up .
The next meeting is in Algeria and Russia , Mexico and Norway will join the OPEC meeting .
NYC had to pay back $ 80 million to companies who overpaid their taxes this past year .
The City estimates a shortfall of more than $ 4 billion over the next two years .
New York State paid out $ 60 billion in total in corporate refunds during the fist 10 months of 2008 , up from $ 581 million yoy .
In all corporate taxes make up $ 5.4 billion of total taxes paid to the city , or 14 % , and $ 6 billion of total taxes paid to the state , or 15.6 % .
One of our Illuminist masters of the universe at Black Rock is Peter Fisher who said the US Treasury should consider selling 100 - year bonds to ease the federal government ’s borrowing costs as it faces a budget deficit expected by us to exceed $ 1.3 trillion .
That is a great idea .
Lay off your responsibilities on children being born four generations from now .
A typical Wall Street solution .
Commercial property borrowers are having trouble borrowing money and the commercial - mortgage - backed securities market is comatose .
Worse , the market is loaded with foolish loans made between 2005 and 2007 .
Most of these loans do not mature until 2010 , but they overhang the market .
What loans that are being made are 15 % above benchmark interest rates .
Money investors believed the Treasury Department would bail them out but it is not going to .
Illegal aliens are finding ways to circumvent the state ’s employer - sanctions law by turning to the underground cash economy .
Some provide services or sell items .
Others borrow the identity of citizens or legal residents to get jobs .
This is depriving the state and federal government of tax revenue and they are not happy about that .
Zbigniew Brzezinski is already comparing Barah Obama with John R. Kennedy .
Rumors abound in the farming community that in January and February some of the grain companies that bought wheat at $ 10.00 a bushel may not be able to pay for it .
Major grain operations are already facing huge losses .
Wheat and corn prices have fallen some 50 % .
If they default , farmers are going to the wall .
If they pay the commodity buyers go to the wall .
The result of this is another huge bump up in the price of food .
March delivery will be in the stores by June and with it another big upward spike in food prices .
Hedging could moderate the effects , but after what we ’ve seen with hedge funds and derivatives blowing up , we are very skeptical that any real help will be found there .
This is not a zero sum game when writers are naked short .
This could bring on a severe recession in the form of acute stagflation .
A UN study has concluded that South Korea and Japan have the most effective education systems .
It was based on testing what pupils actually know and what they are able to do .
The US ranked 18th , Germany 19th .
Furthermore the US finished low in each test and in adult literacy .
The bottom line is stupid people do not stay free very long .
One of the problems is that 45 % to 50 % of school budgets is devoted to teachers , textbooks and other basic instructional cost .
The rest goes to buildings , liquidating debt and administrative salaries .
Over the last decade administrative costs have risen 50 % .
Teacher pay increases have been miniscule at 36 % .
In the Chicago area superintendents received an average income of $ 114,000 and 27 of them received more than $ 200,000 .

Bankrupt electronics chain
Tweeter yesterday converted its case to a Chapter 7 liquidation , abruptly shuttered its stores , and fired more than 600 employees at 70 stores across the country , days before the company was set to close for good .
Investors in the $ 4 billion Templeton Foreign Fund already have lost more than 50 percent of their money this year and now they ’ll be forced to pay taxes on as much as $ 1 billion of gains from the sales of investments .
Shareholders of Templeton Foreign , run by Franklin Resources Inc. in San Mateo , California , have plenty of company .
Franklin said 33 of its 106 stock and bond funds will have capital gains .
Fidelity Investments , the world ’s largest mutual - fund manager , expects 135 of its 212 funds to make the distributions , based on data as of Nov. 15 .
Money managers have had to sell profitable holdings this year as customer redemptions increased , resulting in short - and long - term capital gains .
The result means tax bills for investors in the worst year for financial markets since the 1930s .
“ It feels like a sucker punch for investors to pay taxes on gains when you ’ve lost so much money , ” said Christopher Davis , an analyst at financial researcher Morningstar Inc. in Chicago .
The last time investors were hit with capital gains during a losing year was in 2001 , when they paid $ 9.9 billion in taxes on fund distributions after the collapse of the Internet bubble , according to Lipper & Co. , a Denver - based financial - research firm .
In 2001 , the Standard & Poor ’s 500 Index declined 13 percent , compared with 40 percent this year .
An optimist and a pessimist are shipwrecked , and wash up together on a desert island .
The optimist decides that , though there 's no food or fresh water where they are , it 's worth exploring the other side of the island to see whether there 's anything edible or potable there .
" Come on ! " he says .
" Where there 's life , there 's hope ! "
" No there is n't , " says the pessimist .
" This is a desert island .
There 's nothing here .
We might as well just lie down and die . "
" Well , come on , it 's worth a try , is n't it ? "
" No it is n't .
We 're going to die . "
So the optimist , not a mite discouraged , sets off by himself for the other side of the island , where he is eaten by a crocodile .
And the pessimist starves to death .
Those of us who nod with sad recognition at this story have fresh cause for gloom with the arrival on our coffee tables of the latest fun -filled issue of the Proceedings of the Royal Society .
Psychologists have conducted a study of more than 100 people and claim to have identified an optimism gene .
" We 've shown for the first time that a genetic variation is linked with a tendency to look on the bright side of life , " says Elaine Fox of the University of Essex .
" This is a key mechanism underlying resilience to general life stress . "
The fates of our unfortunate Crusoes are determined not , then , by their characters but by the genetic determinants on their characters .
The crocodile victim has two long variants of a particular gene , and that 's that .
He 's always going to be the optimist .
The study sounds , it has to be said , a bit preliminary .
A sample size of " more than 100 people " , as far as scientific studies goes , is n't a great boast .
It 's like saying you have " a collection of more than five stamps " .
The idea that a single gene , even a " bright - side gene " , controls your entire outlook on life is - how to put it ? - a strong claim .
And the research consisted of what ?
They showed these people some pictures of cheerful stuff and depressing stuff and noted which they spent more time on .
The positive pictures included a couple hugging and someone sailing a boat .
The negative images included a photo of someone being mugged .
Who 's to say which is positive and which is negative ?
Some people are terrified of sailing boats , and perhaps it was Chris Tarrant being mugged .
I 'll leave closer scrutiny of the methodology to Ben Goldacre on Saturday .
I choose to believe the result , though , because it confirms what I suspected : we are the victims of our own brains .
Actually , I should recast that sentence .
Rather than choosing to believe this study because it confirms what I already suspected , I was genetically doomed to believe it because it confirms what I am genetically doomed to believe about the setup of the universe .
I once imagined that optimism was a matter of willpower .
When life serves you a shit sandwich , I thought , you can make a positive decision to close your eyes and enjoy the gherkiny bits .
My growing feeling of having been wrong about that now enjoys scientific confirmation .
I take no pleasure in the knowledge .
Every book I read lately , every news report I come across , seems to add to the sense that not only am I not in charge of my destiny , I 'm not even in charge of how I feel about not being in charge of my destiny .
The Anglo Saxons were right after all : wyrd bith ful aræd .
Hundreds of years of Enlightenment humanism is on the verge of bringing us back to where we started .
I recently read Jonah Lehrer 's new book , The Decisive Moment , about the neurology of decision - making , and the lesson was , more or less , that we do n't make decisions : our brains make them for us .
I might will a particular outcome , but is my will , as I think it was Wittgenstein who wondered , not simply an event in my brain also ?
How did that man sleep at night ?
Be eaten by a crocodile ?
Or starve to death ?
The choice is yours .
Except it is n't .
How bleedin ' depressing .
I was in the late - night newsagent in west London the other night , when I was struck by that faint thrill you get when you notice that the man in front of you in a queue is Lord Lamont .
The drunk blokes behind me spotted him too .
" All right Norman ! " shouted one of them in a sort of menacing way .
" Yeah , NORMAN ! " another one riposted .
He mumbled something into the collar of his coat and scuttled off looking miserable .
Do former
Tory chancellors spend the rest of their lives as what my little brother used to call " bully magnets " ?
Anyway , it was a slightly ugly scene and I felt sorry for him .
Shame on you , drunk people .

Richard Williamson , the Holocaust - denying Catholic bishop , seems to be a subject fit more for curiosity than outrage .
First there 's his conviction that there were no gas chambers and only 300,000 died in the camps .

Was he holding it upside - down the first time ?
Remember the man in the Monty Python sketch who says he wrote the plays attributed to Shakespeare ?
He is cross-examined : " How is it possible for you to have written plays performed over 300 years before you were born ? "
" Ah well , " he responds good - naturedly .
" This is where my claim falls to the ground . "

This story is part of an ongoing series of profiles by CNN about economic survival in this time of financial crisis .
Leah Bird and her husband Ed Wright stand in front of their new home : a 1974 Airstream trailer .
( CNN ) --
They bid farewell to their beloved trips to the opera and museum , the beach and Buddhist temples .
They ate one last time at their favorite restaurants serving Indian curried chicken and warm bowls of Vietnamese pho .
Leah Bird and her husband , Ed Wright , have traded their comfortable two - bedroom apartment and jobs in Beverly Hills , California , for life in a trailer on a five - acre Oregon farm .
No longer do the couple hear roaring fire trucks in the street or chatter from patrons dining at outdoor cafes .
On this farm , the dominant silence is occasionally interrupted by the sounds of frogs and crickets .
" It 's not necessarily a lifestyle that has ever seemed attractive to me , " says 28 - year - old Bird , between tending to the farm animals : two sheep , two Nubian goats , miniature horses and geese .
" I always saw myself as more of a metropolitan person , but you know , without money , this was our best option . "
The couple 's drastic lifestyle change -- one they chose -- came last October when Wright , 48 , lost his job managing life insurance portfolios for millionaires at a private firm in Beverly Hills .
His niche company , which relied heavily on capital flow , had felt the pain of the credit crunch .
Once making over $ 100,000 a year , Wright soon joined the growing number of Americans facing unemployment in the economic downturn .

With meager savings , Bird and Wright knew they could n't maintain their costly Los Angeles lifestyle in an area where , they say , image is everything .
Even if they had stayed in Beverly Hills , they would have needed to move into a smaller apartment and rely on Bird 's modest salary as a financial manager .
Exhausted from the rat race , Wright decided they needed another option .
" I 've been in Los Angeles for a long time and I 've had to start over before , " Wright says .
" You spend two or three years getting back on your feet and then what ?
It 's a struggle if you are n't making a lot of money . "
Then Wright 's parents offered to let the newlywed couple live on their family farm in rural Douglas County in southern Oregon until the couple bounced back .
Wright agreed immediately .
He says he wanted to move there to help his elderly parents manage the sprawling property .
His wife , however , was more reluctant because she still had her job .
But Bird says she soon agreed to move to the farm because it was the fastest way to cut expenses .
" I did it out of immediate necessity , " says Bird , who grew up in more of a suburban setting near Tucson , Arizona .
" I do n't think I was ready to leave L.A . "
While Wright wanted to make the move north , he was n't ready to move in with his parents .
At Christmas , the couple purchased a 1974 Airstream trailer , shaped like an oblong silver bullet , from Craigslist for a few thousand dollars .
The trailer living quarters are cramped , with about 300 square feet , a major downgrade from the couple 's 1,400 - square - foot apartment in California .

The couple moved to Oregon in mid-January , after a two - day drive from Los Angeles , hopeful the farm would give them the needed break from city life and a chance to focus on finding new careers .
In Los Angeles , they lived in a neighborhood with about 20,000 people .
Now , the closest town has fewer than 20,000 people .
" We 're not going to lie to you and say everything is hunky dory , " Wright says .
" It 's hard being out here . "
" I feel like a fish out of water , " Bird added .
" I 'm so out of my element . "
Their mornings now begin at the crack of dawn .
They clean the living space for the animals , pick up manure and fix the landscaping .
Afternoons are spent job hunting , a challenging feat in a region where lumber and nursing are the two dominant fields .
For now , they are spending their savings until they find employment .
Their trailer 's bedroom has just enough room to stuff in a queen - size bed .
A narrow window by the bed looks out on the farm , where they can see deer roaming the land in the mornings .
There is no dining room , a difficult adjustment for the couple , who once enjoyed entertaining guests over dinner and wine .
The living room furniture consists of colorful pillows piled against the wall on the floor facing the television and a desk for their laptops .
Their new kitchen has just enough space for one person to stand and work .
There is one toilet , which is currently being remodeled , and no shower .
The couple bathe at Wright 's parents ' house ; they admit that they only shower a few times a week now .
Most of their belongings from Los Angeles , expensive furniture and art accumulated over the years , remain in storage .
While the couple miss these things , they say their new lifestyle will help them survive the troubled economy .
They also hope it will teach them to live simpler lives .
In many ways , Bird and Wright are enjoying the serenity of their slower - paced lifestyle .
They are spending more time together , and Bird says she is getting closer to Wright 's parents .
After the initial culture shock in the first month , Bird says she is slowly adapting to farm life .
She learned how to build a fire pit , and she plans on growing a fruit and vegetable garden in the spring .
She wants to buy more productive animals like cows .
With the garden and some cows , she says , the couple wo n't have to purchase vegetables or milk from the grocery store .
Her husband is remodeling their trailer by adding amenities to the kitchen and bathroom .
Wright , who has always been interested in philosophy and religion , says he sees his unemployment as a time for " soul searching . "
The couple are still mulling their career options .
Wright , who is also an amateur musician , is looking at new job opportunities for the future .
He has dabbled with the idea of starting his own bar since he knows so many musicians in the industry , he says .
He and his wife are thinking about joining the Peace Corps together , or maybe building a log house on the farm .
The options are limitless , they say .
A few weeks ago , surrounded by giant pine trees in the cold winter air , the couple walked outside and looked up .
For the first time in a long time , they could see the stars shining brightly in the dark sky .

Yesterday marked the end of the Muslim festival Eid al - Adha , or " Feast of Sacrifice " - which also marks the end of the Hajj , the annual pilgrimage to Mecca , Saudi Arabia .
One of the pillars of Islamic faith , the Hajj must be carried out at least once in their lifetime by any Muslim who has the ability to do so .
This year , nearly 3 million Muslims made the Hajj , without major incident , and are now returning to their homes across the world .
Muslims who stayed closer to home celebrated Eid al - Adha , commemorating the the willingness of Ibrahim ( Abraham ) to sacrifice his son to God .
Traditional practices include ritual prayers , the sacrifice of animals ( usually sheep ) , distribution of the meat amongst family , friends and the poor , and visiting with relatives .

Iguana with a story
Enlarge Image
A spectacular pink type of Galapagos iguana promises to rewrite the family 's evolutionary history in the islands .
Rosada was missed by Charles Darwin during his 1835 visit , but appears to indicate the earliest known divergence of land animals in the archipelago .
Writing in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) , researchers say rosada split from other land iguanas about 5.7 million years ago .
The scientists suggest that fewer than 100 of the animals still exist .
Park rangers first noted the presence of a pink variety of iguana on the slopes of Volcano Wolf on the island of Isabela in 1986 , but it was not until 2000 that scientists began to examine it .
Darwin 's studies in the Galapagos provided key evidence underpinning the theory of evolution by natural selection , which he set out in the 1859 tome On the Origin of Species .
Our studies would indicate that the population size is very small
Gabriele Gentile Animals such as finches and tortoises showed subtle changes of form between the islands , leading him to theorise that they had evolved along different paths in different environments .
His travels bypassed Volcano Wolf , and so he missed the characteristic pink iguana , which has not been found outside this single , relatively young volcano .
Separate lives
The researchers have now produced several strands of evidence suggesting that rather than being one form of the main land species Conolophus subcristatus , rosada should be considered a separate species .
Iguanas typically bob and duck when they meet each other - a behaviour thought to be important for marking territory and courtship - and rosada does so in a more complex fashion than the yellow - coloured subcristatus or the other Galapagos species , Conolophus pallidus .
It also has a different shape of crest .
There is little sign of cross - breeding between pink and yellow .
And the DNA analysis shows it is far more distinct from all the other land iguanas than they are from each other .
Rosada ( above ) has different colouring from most subcristatus ( below )
That means the line that led to subcristatus and pallidus must have diverged from that leading to rosada long ago , with the split between subcristatus and pallidus coming much later .
The DNA work puts the date of divergence between rosada and the rest at about 5.7 million years ago , raising a new set of questions .
" At 5.7 million years ago , all of the western islands of the archipelago did not exist , " said Gabriele Gentile from the University of Rome Tor Vergata , who led the new analysis .
" That 's a conundrum , because it 's now only inhabiting one part of Isabela that formed less than half a million years ago , " he told BBC News .
Even the oldest parts of the archipelago may be less than five million years old .
The explanation may be that some volcanoes that are now under water were above it at the time when the first iguanas arrived , and this allowed some of the creatures to climb onto land and begin their separate evolution .
Earlier DNA analysis suggests that land - based iguanas split from their marine counterparts about 10 million years ago .
Small world
Whatever the history , Dr Gentile 's team believes rosada 's single population is so tiny as to put its survival in danger .
" Our studies would indicate that the population size is very small , " he said .
" We only collected 36 in two years ; and last year a large research team hiked up Wolf and only found 10 , and most of those were ones that we 'd marked earlier . "
These numbers are low enough to make rosada a Critically Endangered species - if , indeed , it is a separate species from its yellow relatives .
Dr Gentile 's team is now preparing a formal description of the animal , and will be asking the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature ( ICZN ) , the body that adjudicates on such matters , to rule that it is separate and distinct .

There is no strong evidence either way for several herbal remedies commonly taken to relieve troublesome menopausal symptoms , concludes the January issue of the Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin ( DTB ) .
And for some , there is hardly any evidence at all .
Between 30 % and 70 % of women in industrialised countries will experience vasomotor symptoms around the menopause , such as hot flushes and night sweats , prompted by the sharp fall in oestrogen levels .
On average , such symptoms last for around four years , but in around one in 10 women , they can last more than 12 years .
Herbal remedies commonly used to relieve menopausal symptoms include black cohosh , red clover , Dong quai , evening primrose oil , and ginseng .
Others include wild yam extract , chaste tree , hops , sage leaf , and kava kava .
But little good quality evidence on the effectiveness of herbal medicines , or how they might react with prescription medicines is available , says DTB .
And , in general , safety has been under researched , which is a major concern given that herbal remedies are often assumed to be " safe " just on the grounds that they are " natural , " says DTB .

Published studies are often poorly designed , include too few participants , or do n't last long enough to be of real value .
Furthermore , the chemical make - up of various preparations of the same herb may differ , which can make it difficult to compare trial results .
The drugs regulator , the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency ( MHRA ) , has given a Traditional Herbal Registration to Menoherb , which contains black cohosh , under a scheme designed to boost the safety of herbal products on sale .
But clinical trial data on black cohosh are " equivocal , " says DTB , with some studies suggesting that the remedy works well , while others suggest that it does not relieve symptoms effectively .
Liver toxicity is also a potential side effect of black cohosh .

There is " no convincing evidence " that red clover extract is effective , says DTB , and little evidence one way or another for dong quai , evening primrose oil , wild yam , chaste tree , hops , or sage .
This review appears in the new look DTB , which has been given its first major design make - over since it was first published in 1962 .
Pagination has also increased from eight to 12 , in a " deliberate attempt to address healthcare professionals ' needs for clear , succinct information and practical advice on medicines , other treatments and the overall management of disease , " says an editorial , another new feature of the redesign .
Other additions include the use of colour and a new layout , which will allow for illustrations , to make DTB both even more informative and more enjoyable to read .
Commenting on the move , DTB editor Dr Ike Iheanacho , said :
" For over 45 years , DTB has strived to produce rigorously researched information and advice for healthcare professionals , to help ensure patients get the best possible care .
The newly redesigned version of the publication aims to continue and build on this tradition . "
