MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - President Dmitry Medvedev struck a conciliatory note at Russia ’s Victory Day military parade on Sunday , urging world powers to unite for peace and defending his decision to invite NATO troops to march on Red Square .
For the first time since Stalin began commemorating the Soviet Union ’s victory over Nazi Germany , serving U.S. , British Polish and French troops joined over 11,000 Russian soldiers to parade past the Kremlin ’s red walls in bright sunshine .
The opposition Communists and some Soviet war veterans condemned the move but Medvedev said in a speech that the lesson from World War Two was “ to urge us to unite in solidarity ” to counter present - day threats and ensure global security .
“ Today , at the military parade , soldiers of Russia , of countries of the ( former Soviet Union ) , and of the Allied powers will march together , in one column which is evidence of our common readiness to defend peace , ” he said .
Welsh Guards from the British military marched in their trademark black bearskin hats ahead of 70 troops from the U.S. 170th Infantry Brigade in a section reserved for the Soviet Union ’s war allies .
Underlining the message of reconciliation , a 1,200 - strong military band closed the parade with a moving rendition of Beethoven ’s Ode to Joy as German Chancellor Angela Merkel , Chinese President Hu Jintao and other world leaders looked on .
Russia ’s Communists , still the country ’s biggest opposition party , held a demonstration after the parade , chanting “ Glory to the great Stalin , ” to protest against NATO forces for marching over the square , home to the embalmed body of Lenin .

Most of the Soviet war veterans attending the parade seemed unconcerned by the presence of NATO soldiers , though they did not applaud when they marched past .
“ Why not ?
Let them see how we celebrate a solemn parade , ” said ex-World War Two soldier Grigory Petrovich Zabuski .
“ I ’m absolutely not against it .
I met English troops myself on the Elbe on May 4 , 1945 . ”
But not everyone was happy .
“ We veterans were against this from the beginning , ” said one former naval officer , who declined to give his name .
“ The Americans have their interests everywhere , even in our country .
Remember when ( then U.S. Secretary of State ) Madeleine Albright said it was not fair that all of Siberia belonged to Russia ? ”
President Barack Obama , unable to come to Moscow because of a scheduling clash , praised the historic invitation to NATO troops , saying Medvedev had shown “ remarkable leadership in honoring the sacrifices of those who came before us . ”

BIGGEST EVER
A poll by the independent Levada Center last month showed that 55 percent of Russians were wholly or partly positive about NATO troops at the parade , with only 28 percent against .
The result may reflect better ties between Moscow and Washington since Obama ’s election and his “ reset ” of relations .
Victory Day is one of Russia ’s most important public holidays and Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov said this year ’s commemorations would be among the biggest , with over 102,000 troops marching in cities across this vast country .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy and Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi canceled their attendance at the last minute to deal with the crisis surrounding the euro currency .
Russian leader Vladimir Putin revived two years ago a Soviet - era tradition of parading tanks , missiles and military vehicles across the square and flying aircraft overhead .
This year ’s parade included 127 helicopters , fighters , bombers , reconnaissance aircraft and refueling planes which screamed over Red Square at low altitudes in close formation .
Behind the ceremony and the celebrations , serious business was transacted .
Putin , who is now Prime Minister , hosted a meeting and dinner at his country retreat for China ’s Hu .
Putin ’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said afterwards only that discussions were substantive .

A dog stares up from inside its cage in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina on Friday , Sept. 16 , 2005 at the Project Halo animal shelter in Gulfport , MS .
The shelter is one of several which take in and care for stray animals and pets that were abandoned or otherwise separated from their owners by the storm .

A young man recently jailed after stealing two puppies from a suburban Chicago pet store probably could n't have gotten the dogs from a shelter even though shelters are bursting at the seams .
One of the stolen Pomeranian pups died after being shot with BB gun pellets .
The 21 - year - old dog thief had an extensive juvenile record .

Overcrowded no-kill shelters try to screen pet adoptions and urge people who feel they can no longer care for their pets to surrender rather than abandon them .
When a man called an Indiana veterinarian to ask her to put down a dozen newborn kittens the answer was no , The ( Lafayette / West Lafayette , Ind. ) Journal & Courier reported .
" We 've gotten other calls from people saying , ' I do n't know what to do with my dog .
Can I just put it to sleep ? ' " veterinarian Heather Baker , owner of the Wildcat Valley Animal Clinic , told the paper .
The Almost Home Humane Society , a no-kill shelter in Lafayette , acknowledges the problem of unwanted pets is growing and praises veterinarians for standing up for defenseless animals .
Budget cuts forced the humane society to stop accepting animals directly from owners , but the facility still takes in strays and abandoned pets .
An overcrowded shelter in Sylacauga , Ala. , has taken in nearly 4,000 animals since January , the mayor told The Daily Home .
The shelter became so full the newspaper says more than 500 dogs and cats have had to be transferred to the Greater Birmingham Humane Society since April .

The Miami -Dade Animal Shelter said it took in 228 animals -- double the normal number -- on a Saturday and on a typical day only places 24 animals for adoption .
The shelter is forced to euthanize more than 90 animals on an average day .
" People need to realize what happens here , and they need to understand that this is the consequence of what happens in the community out there .
This is what we all do to our best friend , " shelter worker Xiomara Mordcovich told WFOR - TV , Miami .
" We need to realize that we can spay and neuter our dogs to prevent the overpopulation .
I hope people realize there are beautiful animals for adoption and the fact that they should identify their pets and they should come to volunteer . "
In Ashland , Mass. , the MetroWest Humane Society , a 35 - year - old no - kill cat shelter , said it had 160 kitties up for adoption recently , with 75 more on a waiting list for openings , and " there simply is n't any more room here , " The ( Framingham , Mass . ) MetroWest Daily News reported .
" When you take an animal in , you make a promise to take care of them for the rest of their lives , " shelter manager Jackie Walters told the newspaper .
" A lot more effort needs to be made by owners to find a safe place for their pet to live . "
She said people with an unwanted pet should not assume there 's an opening at a local shelter and should call as many as possible .
Our family has donated to a no- kill shelter for years , as well as given food to the city shelter .
The need remains great .
One neighbor provides a foster home for young kittens until they are placed for adoption .
Some of the animals she has hand - raised include pedigreed Himalayan kittens -- with long hair and piercing blue eyes -- that would cost a small fortune in any pet store .

A U.S. survey found dogs and cats can help their owners cope with anxiety .
Nine of 10 respondents said household pets helped them deal with life stresses and 83 percent indicated they valued the steady presence of a pet despite concerns about the uncertain economy .
Ike , a young pit bull that became a Chicago media star in April after he was televised playing in traffic on Interstate 290 in Broadview , Ill. , was placed in a foster home by Precious Pets Almost Home , but has gone unclaimed .
" He 's a very chill dog , " veterinarian Tracy Garza told the Chicago Sun -Times .
" He does n't even bark at cats . "
Petwebdesigner.com , a Web site design firm on Long Island , N.Y. , is teaming up with the award - winning Kent Animal Shelter on AnimalRoulette.com , a Web site dedicated to finding good homes for animals .
The site , which goes live July 17 from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. EST , will link via webcam people seeking a pet in a chat room with someone who has a pet available for adoption .
Other shelters around the United States are expected to join as the online program expands .
" I know how much shelters in this country struggle to find homes for their animals , and I felt that today 's opportunity of real time on the Internet provided the perfect place for pet lovers all over the country to see what 's available , " said Michael Ayalon , chief executive officer of Petwebdesigner.com .
Ayalon , who started his company in 2003 , said in a Facebook interview with the ASPCA he adopted a pit bull named Soco from a shelter in 1994 .
THIS monster crocodile has just proven who 's the king of the swamp .
The 5 m saltwater crocodile made mince meat of a bull shark at Kakadu National Park in the Northern Territory .
A bunch of tourists looked on in shock when they saw the croc chomping on the shark at the upper flood plains of the south Alligator River on Saturday morning .
The shark had already been bitten in two by the hungry beast when this photograph was taken .
But tour guide Dean Cameron , 34 , believed it would have been at least 3 m long and weighed 60kg .
" It would have been amazing to see ( the attack ) - very wild footage , " he said .
" The croc would 've taken the shark at night and then it would 've had to take it to the bank to eat it . "
Two separate tour boats with about 45 tourists on board each were shipping along the river as part of the Yellow Water Cruise about 8.15 am when they saw the wild feast .
Mr Cameron , who was guiding one of the boats , said the visitors were over the moon to see the spectacle .
" Nearly 100 people saw it all up and they were jumping for joy , " he said .
" They said this had made their Kakadu trip .
" But it was not the first time a crocodile has been witnessed feasting on a shark .
Maxine Rawson - Rodriguez was on a jumping crocodile cruise at Adelaide River - about 100 km south of Darwin - when the tourist boat came across a another crocodile eating a shark on March 24 .
And the Northern Territory News reported on January 29 how five fisherman fought off a crocodile to defend a prized shark caught off a Territory beach .
Mr Cameron , who has been a tour guide for two years and a park ranger for several more , said he would come across such a spectacle once a year .
And he said he was not surprised about finding sharks that far into a freshwater river system .
" With the wildlife here you just do n't know what you 'll get to see , " he said .
" That 's the beauty of it . "

Could 've sworn I saw a C - 130 fly over the Linc during the Union - Man U game last night .
Then I attempted to explain to someone that C -130s do n't launch from carriers .
But I guess I was wrong : they did at one point !
Velocity Mozilla believes that its JavaScript engine is n't that far from matching the performance of Google 's Native Client plug - in , which eschews web standards to run native code inside the browser .
Speaking today at the net - performance obsessed Velocity conference in Santa Clara , California , Mozilla open source evangelist Chris Blizzard showed off a Firefox JavaScript demo meant to mimic a test that Google uses to show off Native Client , and he said that even with today 's Firefox , Mozilla comes within 50 per cent of the performance of native code .
In a web video here , Google shows off a Native Client incarnation of a web - based photo editing app that lets you apply filters in realtime .
Blizzard and Mozilla have ported the same app to JavaScript , achieving performance of about seven frames a second versus Google 's 15 frames a second .
As Blizzard said , the JavaScript photo demo was " pretty snappy . "
" We 've started to realize we can do things that would normally be done in native code , " Blizzard said .
" But we can do them in JavaScript . "
Just yesterday , Mozilla vice president of product Jay Sullivan told us that the open source outfit has no intention of bundling a Native Client - like plug - in with its browser , preferring to advance standard technologies like HTML5 and JavaScript .
As Blizzard pointed out , the next version of Firefox – Firefox 4 , due in beta any day now – will include a new extension to the browser 's existing JavaScript engine .
Dubbed JaegerMonkey , the extension will operate alongside TraceMonkey – an extension that debuted with Firefox 3.5 last year – interpreting JavaScript code unsuited to " tracing . "
TraceMonkey speeds performance by detecting code loops and converting them into assembly language .
" We find places where code gets executed more than once , " Blizzard said .
" We basically optimize that code and trace it to native code . "
But there are cases where this sort of thing just does n't work .
This happens with , say , recursion or heavily nested code .
As it stands , when tracing fails , Firefox falls back on an interpreter that runs JavsScript at circa 2007 speeds .
With JaegerMonkey , Mozilla adds a Just - in - Time ( JIT ) engine much like those used by the other major browsers .
The extension is actually based on the Nitro JIT used by Apple Safari .
Firefox will still do tracing – something other browsers do n't do – but it will be able to fall back on the baseline JIT , converting entire methods into assembly language .
" The important thing to realize is that we know we have a lot of things we can to do to optimize for really intensive web apps that will get us within [ striking distance ] of native code speed , " Blizzard said . ®
" The president told Ms. Sherrod that this misfortune can present an opportunity for her to continue her hard work on behalf of those in need , and he hopes that she will do so . "

K2 Spice Synthetic Marijuana BLOG
08 nov What is JWH - 018 ?
JWH -018 , also called a ‘ synthetic cannabinoid ’ , is an emerging drug of choice to replace the use of Marijuana .
Since it provides the same effect or even better than Marijuana , most herbal smoke blends incorporate JWH - 018 as part of the ingredients to achieve a better ‘ high ’ experience .
Nevertheless , the effects of JWH - 018 still vary among individuals .
Usually , novice smokers may undergo a much more profound “ high ” experience compared to regulars .
A few users may or may not show the same signs and symptoms , however , they may experience the same effect of JWH - 018 in general .
Side Effects of Smoking JWH -018
Heightened mood
Enhanced sense of humor
Heightened curiosity and intrigue
Racing thoughts
Time distortion and dilation
Buzzing or humming like a psychedelic experience
Reduced concentration
Relaxed state
Mild euphoria ( phasing in between bouts )
Manic - depressive disorder
Physical Effects of JWH -018
Bloodshot eyes
Droopy eyelids
Drowsiness
Tachycardia
Hallucinations
Heavy sinking feeling
Respiratory suppression
Controlled breathing
Gastrointestinal discomfort
Sensitivity to pleasure
Dangers of JWH -018
JWH -018 mimics the mechanism of THC found in marijuana , thus affecting the functions of the brain resulting in CNS depression .
Since it binds itself to CB1 receptors dominantly found in the brain , expect to notice symptoms of alterations in the control of emotions , motivation , judgment , memory , and learning .
For smoking a regular dose of 3 to 5 mg of JWH - 018 , its psychological effects include :
Like its cognitive and psychological effects , physical effects are obvious upon using JWH - 018 : JWH - 018 also renders some positive effects such as analgesia and anti-anxiety .
These claims are doubtful due to lack of evidence from scientific researchers .
Therefore , the proposal for its medical application as a response to its therapeutic effect is still out - of - the - question .
Although no fatalities caused by JWH - 018 are known , smoking higher doses of JWH - 018 is quite dangerous .
The most extreme side effects of using this drug include short - term memory loss , extreme sedation , induced coma , euphoria , paranoia , anxiety , confusion , and vomiting .
JWH - 018 creates shocking brain effects , life - threatening hallucinations and sometimes seizures .
The drug also impacts the cardiovascular system via increased heart rate and blood pressure .
Withdrawal Symptoms of JWH -018
Users who suddenly withdraw from using JWH - 018 may experience :
Tremors
Nausea and vomiting
Diarrhea
Bouts of headaches
Insomnia
Heart palpitations
Restlessness
Despite the potential negative side effects of JWH - 018 , it is possible to detect this drug via synthetic drug tests .
Perkins : Ending DADT Would Threaten Religious Freedom
Tony Perkins , president of the Family Research Council , uses the venue of CNN 's religion blog to argue that ending the “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell ” policy would undermine religious liberty and subject believers to “ pro-homosexual political correctness ” that he claims pervades the military .
According to Perkins , a Marine veteran , the threat to religious freedom comes from the potential for nondiscrimination provisions to be added to the Department of Defense equal opportunity policy and related human relations training programs .
“ While not in the defense authorization bill amendment approved by the House of Representatives and a Senate committee last week , this goal will undoubtedly be accomplished administratively as part of the ‘ necessary policies and regulations ’ mandated by that amendment .
“ This means that all 1.4 million members of the U.S. military will be subject to sensitivity training intended to indoctrinate them into the myths of the homosexual movement : that people are born ‘ gay ’ and cannot change and that homosexual conduct does no harm to the individual or to society , ” he writes .
Perkins says that the changes pose the greatest risk for military chaplains .
His claims are refuted in a CNN religion blog entry by Harry Knox , director of the Human Rights Campaign ’s religion and faith program and a member of President Obama 's Advisory Council on Faith - Based and Neighborhood Partnerships .
“ In reality , this is n’t about chaplains at all , ” writes Knox .
“ Groups like the Family Research Council continue to characterize religious liberty and equality for LGBT Americans as an either / or proposition , willfully misrepresenting our nation ’s historical experience and ignoring the realities of a nation of many faiths and beliefs that has dealt with such questions for centuries , ” writes Knox .
“ Such groups have claimed that federal hate crimes laws will silence preachers , ignoring those laws ’ robust protections for free speech and religious expression , as well as the experience in the many states with such protections already in place . ”
I released a Haskell library “ has ” , for creating type - indexed records in a casual way .
Its usage is described here .
I will show another usage of this library .
It is too trivial to write in documentation but attracting to me in its strangeness :
{-# LANGUAGE TypeFamilies , TypeOperators , FlexibleContexts #-} import Data .
Has data Any = Any intBool = prjl Any ( Any .> ( 42:: Int ) & Any .> True ) test ::
Int test = if intBool then intBool + 5 else 0
I noticed “ has ” can be used in this way while reading the paper about type - indexed records ( I forgot the title and the author of the paper … )
COMMERCE CITY —
There are times when Kosuke Kimura finds himself alone in the right corner of the Colorado Rapids ’ defense , needing to pounce on an attacker and eliminate the threat with sheer willpower .
But even with the game on the line and his teammates depending on him , those moments are n’t as stressful as his lonely arrival in the U.S. seven years ago when he flew over from Tokyo by himself at age 18 , unable to speak English but sustained by a crazy dream : to play college soccer and someday turn pro .
Rapids coach Gary Smith marvels at Kimura ’s story , calling him “ one in a million . ”
Kimura is the hardest - working player on the team , always the last off the practice field , always driven by the memory of the obstacles he faced getting here .
“ He ’s overcome a lot , ” Smith said .
“ It ’s just a testament to the lad .
He ’s a very determined boy . ”
Kimura said it comes down to mental strength .
“ I just do n’t want to lose , against anyone , ” said the 5 - foot - 8 Kimura .
“ Everybody said , ‘ Kosuke , you ’re so small . ’
I do n’t care , because I ’ve got the biggest heart and I ’m mentally stronger than everybody else .
That ’s what I believe .
I have to prove it to everybody . ”
Kimura , 26 , shares an apartment with teammate Omar Cummings , who is from Jamaica .
A Michael Jackson poster hangs on the wall by the kitchen table , and a jigsaw puzzle of the New York City skyline is pinned to the wall above the television .
They like to watch “ Entourage ” on HBO , “ River Monsters ” on Animal Planet .
They ’re the Odd Couple with a reggae soundtrack , the intense Japanese rolling with the laid - back Jamaican .
“ We ’re different , ” said Cummings , “ but I think it ’s a good balance . ”
In fact , they seem inseparable .
“ That ’s a sitcom , ” one Rapids staffer said affectionately .
Soccer is not a big sport in Japan , although the national team did make it to the recent World Cup .
Professional soccer did n’t come to Japan until 1993 when Kimura was 9 years old , but it captivated him .
“ I played soccer every day , ” Kimura said .
“ I just loved it . ”
He joined the academy of a professional team and got to train occasionally with the pros .
When the team was relegated to the second division , there was no money to sign players and Kimura started looking elsewhere .
A teammate was about to leave with a scholarship to play at an American college , and Kimura saw that as his ticket too .
“ I ’m like , ‘ OK , this is it , I ’m not going to get any better chance if I stay in Japan , ’ ” Kimura said .
“ I knew if I worked hard , I could get there . ”
Except he spoke no English .
He went to the library and researched American colleges , looking for Division I schools that had sports medicine programs .
He sent highlight videos and e-mails in broken English to college coaches , using a Japanese - English dictionary .
He heard from Western Illinois coach Eric Johnson , who was intrigued but troubled that Kimura could not speak English .
It was January 2003 .
Johnson told him he could try out for the team that fall and maybe earn a scholarship , but he needed to come over right away to get into an accelerated English class .
“ I ’m like , ‘ Whoa , I have no visa , I have no passport , I ’ve never been outside of Japan , ’ ” Kimura recalled .
Kimura was already falling behind , because the English class he needed to attend had already begun .
But in the aftermath of Sept. 11 , getting a visa was no longer an easy matter .
“ It used to be , you ’d go to the American Embassy and they would do it right away , ” Kimura said .
“ I got all the documents I needed from the college , I went to the American Embassy , and they were like , ‘ You ca n’t come in here anymore .
You have to do everything by mail , and it will take at least three months . ’
“ I ’m like , ‘ Listen , I have to get there as soon as possible because I need to get into college in September .
If I wait three months , it ’s going to be April , and I ’ll have only five months .
It ’s going to be impossible , because I do n’t speak any English . ’
They kept telling me , ‘ That ’s all we can do .
You have to be patient . ’ “
Ever the tenacious one , Kimura responded by sending the U.S. Embassy two faxes a day for a week , using his trusty Japanese - English dictionary to beg for an expedited visa .
Finally they relented , and he was on his way to Macomb , Ill. , 75 miles west of Peoria and 6,300 miles from Tokyo .
For months he studied English 10 hours a day — did n’t even touch a soccer ball .
He had to take an SAT test for admission and passed — not even attempting to answer the English questions but nailing the math section — and was admitted to Western Illinois .
He started as a freshman , earned a scholarship and served as team captain his final three seasons .
“ One in a billion , ” Johnson said .
Kimura was drafted by the Rapids in the same 2007 class as Cummings , playing mostly on the reserve team that year .
Kimura has been a regular ever since .
In May 2009 , his proud parents came from Japan to see him .
The night they saw him play for the first time as a professional , he scored his first professional goal against Real Salt Lake .
“ I thought I was in a dream , ” Kimura said .
“ My parents , they believe in me , always they supported me .
They never denied me , whatever I wanted to do .
‘ Kosuke , if you want to do it , do it .
Just stick to it and never , ever give up . ’ “

plac , the easiest command line arguments parser in the Python world
by Michele Simionato
June 2 , 2010
Summary
Announcing the first public release of plac , a declarative command line arguments parser designed for simplicity and concision .
Advertisement
I would like to announce to the world the first public release of plac :
Plac is a wrapper over argparse and works in all versions of Python starting from Python 2.3 up to Python 3.1 .
With blatant immodesty , plac claims to be the easiest to use command line arguments parser module in the Python world .
Its goal is to reduce the learning curve of argparse from hours to minutes .
It does so by removing the need to build a command line arguments parser by hand : actually it is smart enough to infer the parser from function annotations .
Here is a simple example ( in Python 3 ) to whet your appetite :
$ cat example .
py def main ( arg : " required argument " ) : " do something with arg " print ( ' Got %s ' % arg ) if __name__ == ' __main__ ' : import plac ; plac.call ( main ) # passes sys.argv [ 1 : ] to main $ python example .
py -h usage : example .py [ - h ] arg do something with arg positional arguments : arg required argument optional arguments : -h , -- help show this help message and exit $ python example .
py usage : example .py [ - h ] arg example .py : error : too few arguments $ python example .py arg Got arg $ python example .
py arg1 arg2 usage : example .py [ - h ] arg example .py : error : unrecognized arguments : arg2
You can find in the documentation a lot of other simple and not so simple examples :
Enjoy !
Michele Simionato
P.S. answering an unspoken question : yes , we really needed yet another command line arguments parser ! ;)

Rumor has it that Microsoft will unveil Hulu ’s streaming video service working on the Xbox 360 at this month ’s E3 convention in Los Angeles .
This info comes from Gear Live who says they heard it from one of their reliable sources .
In theory the Hulu service would work on Xbox just as the Netflix service does .
Xbox Live Gold members would be able to download the application , enter their Hulu user name , and begin streaming videos .
If a subscription is required ( which most sources are hinting towards ) , you might expect to have to use Xbox Live points rather than a credit or debit card .
The Electronic Entertainment Expo runs from June 15 - 17 , 2010 .
We should know for sure if Gear Live let the cat out of the bag when Microsoft gives their media briefing a day before E3 starts on June 14 at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time .
We ’ll keep you posted .
Thermidor of the Progressives
C4SS Research Associate Kevin Carson ’s latest research study is now available .
Download Thermidor of the Progressives : Managerialist Liberalism ’s Hostility to Decentralized Organization [ PDF ] .
Thermidor of the Progressives : Liberalism ’s Hostility to Decentralized Organization .
By Kevin Carson
“ ‘ Progressive ’ intellectuals have become attached to the fortunes of the large bureaucratic organization in the same way that the politiques were attached to the court of the Sun King . …
This general affinity for large - scale organization and hierarchy , more recently , has been reflected in hostility to the new forms of networked organization permitted by the emerging technologies of the late twentieth century .
The reaction to decentralized and networked organization , among conventional liberals , seems to be uniformly and viscerally negative .
The professional vs. the do - it - yourself , the hierarchical vs. the networked , the managed vs. the ad hoc , the large and the hierarchical vs. the small - scale — in every case , the antipathies are predictable to the point of stereotype . ”
This “ ready to print ’ version of Thermidor of the Progressives : Liberalism ’s Hostility to Decentralized Organization was created by Invisible Molotov .
Invisible Molotov is a market anarchist zine distro & publishing house .
Per usual , it seems as if this deal has happened in the dark of the night , but thankfully for the curious among us , it 's a bit difficult to disguise a caravan of humans escaping Québec and fleeing to Cupertino .
According to a report inas well as an independent confirmation on our end , Apple has picked up a small Canadian firm by the name of Poly9 .
As of now , every last employee has been relocated to California , with the couple who declined left to find other work in the Great White North .
Poly9 's official website is also blanked out , but in the past , the company has been credited with developing loads of web - based mapping programs ( primarily in Flash , crazily enough ) as well as APIs for a handful of monolithic clients like Microsoft , Yahoo ! , NORAD and MSNBC .
Generally speaking , Apple tends to integrate its purchases into the workflow at a rather rapid clip , so we 're actually expectingto come of this in the not - too - distant future .
What , exactly , remains to be seen .

After the Charlotte Bobcats backed out of an agreed - to trade with Toronto featuring Tyson Chandler , Dallas moved in to acquire Chandler and Alexis Ajinca from the Bobcats in exchange for Eduardo Najera , Matt Carroll and its vaunted Erick Dampier trade chip as well as undisclosed cash considerations .
Although it was initially believed that Dampier 's $ 13 million nonguaranteed contact could help the Mavs get in the running for dream trade targets such as LeBron James or Chris Paul this offseason , Dallas was forced to revise its expectations when it found the actual pool of players available on the current trade market -- such as Al Jefferson -- to be mostly high - priced players who did n't automatically guarantee a clear upgrade to its roster .
So the Mavericks ultimately elected to part with Dampier 's contract in this deal because the Bobcats were willing to reacquire Carroll , which removes $ 11.7 million in salary over the next three seasons from a contract Carroll originally signed with Charlotte in the summer of 2006 .
The trade thus allows Dallas to fill a major need -- by adding Chandler to the re-signed Brendan Haywood in its big - man rotation -- while maintaining a reasonably good combination of trade pieces and payroll flexibility in the event that a major trade opportunity does materialize in coming months .
" We ran out of options for this summer , " said one Mavericks source .
Chandler and Caron Butler , though , represent two meaty expiring contracts for Dallas to keep offering for Paul to the resistant Hornets , who continue to tell teams that call that they have no interest in surrendering their All - Star point guard .
The Mavericks will likewise be hoping that another certifiable star that is n't currently available surfaces as a potential trade option before the 2011 trade deadline in February .
One source close to the situation said that the Bobcats will consider keeping Dampier for the short term , instead of waiving him immediately , in case another trade opportunity presents itself .
Charlotte still needs a point guard and , according to sources with knowledge of the team 's thinking , has expressed interest in Minnesota 's Ramon Sessions .
But if the Bobcats elect not to trade Dampier , they can release him at any point before the season and instantly wipe $ 13 million off next season 's payroll .
One source close to the situation said Tuesday that Dampier is unlikely to re-sign with the Mavericks , as one believed , in the event that he is waived by Charlotte or another team .
" You have to consider that contract is probably one of the most valuable contracts in the league , " Bobcats general manager Rod Higgins said .
" The flexibility is the beautiful part of having Erick 's deal , maybe not so much for Erick himself as a player , but for the franchise itself . "
On Monday , Chandler believed he was headed to Toronto with Bobcats teammate Boris Diaw and Phoenix 's Leandro Barbosa in a proposed three - team deal with the Raptors and Suns .
The Bobcats had agreed to trade Chandler and Diaw to Toronto for Jose Calderon and Reggie Evans as part of the Raptors ' Hedo Turkoglu - for - Barbosa swap with the Suns .
But sources told ESPN.com on Tuesday that Charlotte withdrew from that trade largely for two reasons : Calderon has a 10 percent trade bonus in his contract ( which has nearly $ 30 million remaining over the next three seasons ) and Bobcats coach Larry Brown was not in favor of the deal .
While Higgins insisted the deal was n't agreed upon , the Raptors seemed to think it was .
Chandler wrote in an e-mail to The Associated Press on Monday night that his agent had told him the deal was done , while Evans thanked Raptors fans on his Twitter page .
" I never talked to Boris .
No one from the Bobcats talked to Boris about him in the trade , " Higgins said .
" I ca n't speak for anybody else . "
When that trade collapsed , Dallas began pursuing Chandler , since it had just lost out to Utah in the trade hunt for Jefferson .
Sources with knowledge of the talks told ESPN.com on Monday that the Mavericks had reached the point in their Jefferson negotiations over the weekend that they were willing to include the Dampier contract as well as up to two conditional future first - round picks , as long as Minnesota also took back the contracts of Carroll and DeShawn Stevenson .
The Wolves , though , were determined to take back as little salary as they possibly could in a Jefferson deal and reached an agreement with Utah that will net them two future first - rounders and require the Jazz to take back no other players .
Dallas believes that Chandler , if healthy , can supply some of the interior defense and around - the - rim athleticism that this team has lacked for some time .
Chandler played in just 50 games after the Bobcats acquired him from New Orleans for Emeka Okafor in the summer of 2009 , averaging just 6.6 points , 6.4 rebounds and 1.1 blocks .
" We could not be more excited to add Tyson Chandler , " Mavericks president of basketball operations Donnie Nelson said in a statement .
" He is one of the most versatile big men in the league today .
He gives our front line a defensive , shot - blocking , athletic punch we have n't had here in a while . "
Ajinca joins the newly signed Ian Mahinmi on the Mavericks ' list of project big men , while Charlotte prepares to either realize an instant savings of $ 13 million or offer around Dampier 's contract to help find a point guard to replace New York Knicks signee Raymond Felton .
" Our main goal this offseason was finding a way to reshape this roster and position ourselves to compete beyond the first round of the playoffs and continue the momentum we have established , " Higgins said .
" While it 's always difficult to give up key pieces of your team , we believe this deal will give financial flexibility and the ability to improve our team at the same time . "
Also Tuesday , the Mavericks signed first - round draft pick Dominique Jones -- the 25th overall selection out of South Florida -- and finalized the deal for free agent Mahinmi , who averaged 3.9 points and 2.0 rebounds last season for the San Antonio Spurs .

Top 10 Female Sex Fantasies
10 Astonishing Things She Secretly Wants To Try In The Bedroom
When you masturbate , or simply have sexual thoughts , you probably have certain fantasies that really get you off .
There are probably sexy scenarios that you return to over and over because of how pleasurable they are .
It might be a specific hookup you have in mind , whether that ’s a celebrity crush , someone you know , or an ex .
It could even be a whole bunch of people at once .
It could also not be about the who , but instead , the how .
Doing something exciting and kinky , especially if you think you might get caught , could really turn you on .
While these fantasies are probably well mapped out in your mind , you may have discussed your fantasies with male friends .
If you watch porn , you 've probably seen certain scenarios play themselves out many times over .
If so , between your own fantasies , your friends ’ , and the ones represented over and over in pornography , you probably have a pretty good idea of what common male sexual fantasies are .
But have you ever wondered about what steamy scenarios and naughty things women fantasize about ?
What goes through women 's minds when they 're masturbating , dreaming about something sexy that they wish would happen to them in real life ?
The awesome thing about fantasies is that since they 're not at all limited by logistics or inhibitions , pretty much anything goes .
Female fantasies can really run the gamut from vanilla sex to hardcore fetishes — and we 're not just talking your typical male stripper scenario here , either .
So which sex fantasies make the top 10 list for women ?
We asked a few real women to dish on their favorite sexual scenarios to imagine , and lucky for you , they spared no detail .
To get down to the reason behind these fantasies , we asked a few professional sex experts for their educated take on what 's so sexy about these scenarios , as well as why they rank so highly .
The basics of SEO are stupidly simple ; and it seems like everyone knows – or at least pretends to know – those basics .
Still I get asked about SEO pretty often .
I do n’t consider myself an expert , but I ’ll share what I know , and hopefully it will help some people .
I ’ll be talking Google - centrically because Google will likely account for the vast majority of your inbound search traffic .
Additionally , if you rank highly on Google , you will probably do pretty well on other search engines anyway .

I ’ve been writing with SEO in mind – and using best practices as best as I can – on kadavy .
net for over 6 years now , and my search traffic has steadily increased .
Consistent use of SEO best practices will lead to lots of free traffic
Why SEO is Important
SEO is the “ location , location , location ” of doing business on the web .
If you have a bicycle shop on a busy street , you ’re going to sell some bikes .
It does n’t matter how high your prices are , or how rude your employees are – you are going to sell some bikes .
Likewise , if you rank highly on Google for “ bicycles , ” you are going to sell a lot of bikes , because a lot of people search for “ bicycles . ”
That is your foot traffic .
I do n’t want to make the mistake of assuming that everyone knows just what it means to rank highly on a keyphrase .
If you are selling a product or service , ranking highly on keyphrases related to that product or service is essentially free money .
If you rank first on Google for “ bicycles , ” ( which is darn near impossible , by the way ) you will get a huge number of visitors on your site looking for bicycles , and it will cost you nothing .
This is called “ organic ” traffic , and it ’s what SEO builds for you .
But , some businesses pay big bucks for such traffic by buying Google ’s AdWords .
In doing so , their site shows up next to Google ’s organic search results , and they pay whenever someone clicks through to their site .
For “ bicycles , ” those businesses pay an average of 71 cents per click .
For “ cambria bicycle ” they pay an average of $ 12.55 .
Paying for traffic like this can be profitable if the campaigns – and conversion within your site – are managed carefully ; but obviously free traffic is ideal , and translates to big sales .
This is why SEO is important .
Choosing the right keywords
Before you make sure you ’re using SEO best practices , it ’s helpful to have some idea what keywords , or keyphrases , you would like to rank highly on .
But , just because you pick a descriptive keyphrase , does n’t mean people will find you .
It has to be a keyphrase they are actually searching for .
I kick ass on “ lump in mouth ” because that ’s what people search for when they have a mucocele .
Most people do n’t search for “ mucocele ” because they do n’t even know what one is – until they get a lump in their mouth – and search for it .
Ideally , each page on your site should compete well on a couple of keyphrases that are descriptive of the content on your site , have reasonable search volume , and on which you stand some chance of competing .
You can find out the volume of keyphrases by using the Google Keyword Tool .
If you ’re just starting a site where you sell bicycles , it would be nice to compete well on the keyword “ bicycles , ” which has a monthly search volume of over 7 million searches per month – but you do n’t stand a chance as a new site .
If your site is for a bicycle shop in Chicago , then you ’d probably have better luck competing on “ bike shop in chicago , ” which has a measly 390 searches .
Once you dominate that keyphrase , then you can start trying to compete on “ chicago bicycle shop , ” which has 1,300 searches .
A good place to start to find keyword opportunities from your site is your existing data .
If you do n’t already have a stats package set up on your site , you should .
Google Analytics is great and it ’s free .
If you happen to already have Google Analytics installed , you can find the keywords that visitors are using to get to your site under Traffic Sources > Keywords .
Here you can see what keywords are bringing in the most traffic , and if you ’ve set up e-commerce or marketing ( such as lead - generation ) goals , you can see what keywords are actually converting into business .
You are likely to find a few keywords you did n’t expect , that you happen to rank pretty highly upon .
It ’s a good idea to aim to build upon this success by targeting these keywords further , or targeting related keyphrases .
Look for synonyms that you may not already be using ( bump ~ lump , mouth ~ lip ) , and update your content accordingly .
Ranking highly for your target keywords / keyphrases
There are endless complex theories on just how a site ranks highly on search engines .
Some of those theories have no basis at all .
The truth is , nobody except little robots at Google knows just how a site ranks higher than another .
What we do know is that 1 ) the content of a page , and how it is coded , and 2 ) the authority of other pages that link to a page – especially for the topic in question – are the most powerful dictators of how well a page ranks on search engines .
Content and coding
The content of a page – meaning the words within that page – have a huge impact on how well a page ranks for given keywords .
If your target keywords do n’t appear on your page , you will have a hard time ranking highly for that keyword .
It ’s not impossible , but I ’ll get to that later .
Relevant content has to be within your page – as code ( meaning not as an image ) – for search engines ’ crawlers ( the robots that read your pages ) to read that content , and rank you for the appropriate keywords .
This is a strong reason why Flash websites do poorly on search engines , and former print designers that just slice up a design on a WYSIWYG program make poorly - performing websites : the real content gets locked away , where crawlers ca n’t access it .
It ’s also essential to use good coding practices in building your pages .
There are standards for writing HTML content , and they help rank chunks of content within a page in order of importance .
This helps search engines know the difference between the important – and less important – information on a page , and thus rank that page for various keywords .
Following is a run-down of important content - based factors that dictate how your pages rank on search engines .
URL
Before a search engines ’ robot can read the HTML on your page , it will read the URL at which that page resides – and the content of this URL has pretty heavy influence on how that page ranks on search engines .
So , if my bike shop is at http://bikeshopinchicago.com, it will rank very highly on “ bike shop in chicago . ”
If I have a page for Cambria Bicycles , I may want to put it at http://bikeshopinchicago.com/cambria-bicycles.
Note that you should n’t automatically pick your top keyphrase to be the domain that you purchase , as branding – and planning for the future expansion of your business – are both important ; but you should have search engine ( and human ) friendly URLs that are in plain english instead of http://example.com/?p=34.
Title Tag
The Title Tag of a web page is the strongest piece of information indicating what a page is about .
Many businesses make the mistake of naming this page “ Home Page , ” or ignoring it altogether ( this is why there are so many pages on the web called “ Welcome to Adobe GoLive … ” ) .
For any given page on your site , your Title Tag should contain the exact keyphrases that you want to rank highly on .
If it is the home page – or if your business name contains your target keyphrases , you could then follow that with your site ’s name .
So , if you ’re business is David ’s Bike Shop , your title should be “ Bike Shop in Chicago – David ’s Bike Shop . ”
This clever title tag is part of the reason this site ranks # 1 for Chicago Graphic Design Firm
Meta tags
The meta tags also contain some information that search engines give strong authority to when evaluating a page .
There are several different meta tags , but the one that you should concern yourself with is the “ description ” meta tag .
This is a very short ( like around 200 characters ) description of what the page contains , and search engines not only use its content to evaluate what a page is about , but also to display to users when your page is listed in search results .
The words under this search result do not appear on the page - they are from the description meta
Headers
Then we have the headers within your HTML document .
These are ranked in order of importance : H1 , H2 , H3 , H4 , H5 , and H6 .
There should only be one H1 , and this should probably be used for the actual title of your page ( which may or may not be the same as your title tag ) .
Some people like to use the H1 for their logo and link to their home page – it depends upon how narrow of a focus your site is .
So , if you have a long document , full of text , it ’s a good idea to break it up a bit by inserting some useful headers that also happen to contain some of your target keywords .
Content – EM , STRONG , IMG
Finally , you have the actual content of your page , which is hopefully helpful , interesting , and – incidentally – contains your target keyphrases .
In addition to your target keywords , your content will probably bring in visitors on a number of “ long tail ” keyphrases that just happen to show up naturally within your great content .
Within your content , you will hopefully have some images , since they are useful for users .
Much like the URL of your page is important to search engines , the file name of your images is also important , and should be descriptive .
So , if you have a JPEG of a mountain bike , your image should be called mountain - bike.jpg , or – even better – include the color and brand : mountain - bike - schwinn - blue.jpg .
The “ alt ” attribute of your IMG tag should also be descriptive , so “ blue schwinn mountain bike ” would do .
Do n’t forget , you can end up with a large amount of traffic from Google Image Search , if you use descriptive alt attributes .
The italic and bold HTML tags ( EM , and STRONG , respectively ) also hold higher authority in an HTML document than your plain content ( which sits inside of P tags ) .
When you italicise or bold words within your content , it lets search engine crawlers know that those words are important and relevant to the point of the page in question , so it ’s a good idea to do a little of this – provided it supports the experience for your human users .
Authority of linking pages
Ranking highly on Google is ultimately all about the authority of your page or site on the keywords in question .
This concept of authority also applies generally to your site just being an authoritative site .
Google uses a ranking called “ PageRank ” to measure how much authority a given page has , on a scale of 1 - 10 .
There is a complex algorithm behind PageRank that you should n’t concern yourself with , but Google does provide a Firefox plugin called Google Toolbar , which shows what the PageRank of a page supposedly is .
7 is considered a very high PageRank .
NYT.com is a PR 9 .
Kadavy .
net ’s home page is a 4 , which is considered to be decent for a personal blog .
Google Toolbar says kadavy .
net is a measly PageRank 4
There are a number of factors that go into determining a given page ’s PageRank .
While the actual algorithm is an ever - changing secret , here are a few factors that are widely accepted to be a part of the algorithm :
Age of domain : how long has the domain been registered ?
how long has the domain been registered ?
Authority ( or PageRank ) of pages that link to the page from other domains .
Date of expiration of domain : is the domain expiring soon , or has the owner registered it a couple years into the future ?
This is in one of Google ’s patent filings .
Content of linking pages , and of anchor text of link
To put it very simply , when other pages on a given topic link to your page of a related topic , search engines generally will rank you higher on that topic .
If the PageRank of the page linking to your page is particularly high , Google will rank you higher for that .
Also important is the actual “ anchor text ” – or the content between A tags – of the link that links to your page .
So , a link that says “ Bike Shop in Chicago ” will do more to rank “ David ’s Bike Shop ” higher for searches for “ bike shop in chicago ” than if the anchor text says “ David ’s Bike Shop . ”
I ’d be remiss to not mention that people once did this on a mass scale before ( known as a Google bomb ) such that the top hit on Google for “ miserable failure ” was once the Wikipedia page for George W. Bush .
Such a Google bomb was implemented by tons of people doing this : miserable failure .
The A tag also has a couple of attributes , such as the “ title ” attribute , which can have descriptive text applied to it .
I have n’t seen anything to make me think that using this title attribute helps with SEO , but it certainly would n’t hurt .
The rel attribute can have a value of “ nofollow ” which tells Google ’s crawlers not to follow the link , and therefore to not give the page any extra authority based upon the link .
Most blogs give all links in comments a rel= ” nofollow ” attribute to discourage SEO - minded spammers from exploiting the comment functionality .
Everything in moderation
So , if you took all of this knowledge literally , you might stuff all of your pages full of keywords to the point that they did n’t make any sense , and contact site owners all over the web , purchasing links , and stuff all of your pages full of links – full of your keywords – to other pages .
You may even obscure these links by making them the same color as your background , or hiding them with CSS .
Using some of these tactics in extreme moderation may even help you a little bit , but anything more than that will be heavily frowned upon by Google .
They supposedly take very sophisiticated measures to detect use of these tactics , and will downgrade a site for doing so – which is something you do not want to experience ( think immediate loss of tons of business ) .
There are tons of shady tactics for getting links .
As a general rule of thumb : if it feels like its deceiving someone , Google probably has some way to detect it , and wo n’t like it .
Getting the content / getting the links
Having a site full of relevant keywords , and being linked to by sites with relevant keywords , is a means to an end , not an end itself .
You achieve this by using good coding practices , generating content , and generating useful and compelling content that others want to link to .
Here are a few legit ways – that Google does n’t frown upon – to get content and links to your site :
Have a blog .
To rank highly on keywords , it ’s pretty much a must to have useful content , rich with your target keywords , that is updated on a regular basis .
A blog is the best way to have these attributes .
Unfortunately , Google still ranks some pretty shitty content really high , so I ’d say that having some not - so - well - written content is better than having none at all ; but hopefully this will change when they improve or someone gets around to building a better search engine .

Directories .
DMOZ is the highest authority directory , and is free – but it ’s nearly impossible to get into .
There are plenty of paid directories out there , but the only ones I know of that are definitely high - authority are Yahoo !
Directory and Business.com .
Be wary of other directories or consult a professional .
Then , still be wary .

Write guest posts on other sites .
Find a high - authority site that your target audience reads , and pitch a guest post to the author .
They ’ll get great content , and you ’ll get links , and exposure to their audience .

Write link bait .
The best way to get lots of links is to write content that other people will link to , share , and talk about .
A really thorough , information - rich how - to ( like this post ) is a good example , but writing posts that are very controversial works well , too ( unfortunately ) .
Such posts then get shared on social news sites such as Digg.com , and on Facebook and Twitter .
Do lots of research and make some pretty graphs , and your chances of getting lots of links increases again .

When you ’ve written really great , useful , and interesting content , get as many people in your target audience to see it as you can .
Submit to a social news site in a category where those people hang out , or buy traffic in your target category on Stumbleupon ( 5 cents per visit , with a chance of unlimited free traffic ) .
Another good tactic is to find an already popular post on your target topic , find other sites that have linked to it , and pitch to the authors of those sites .
See ?
You already knew all of this stuff about SEO , but applying this knowledge is all that you need to be well on your way to ranking highly and having money streaming into your business .
There are probably some very reputable SEO firms out there who are great at applying this knowledge , and more ; but be wary – because there is so much mystery behind SEO , the field is rife with consultants that overcharge and use tactics that will either only work in the short - term , or will get your site downgraded .
I ’m sure there are tons of other great tips I did n’t cover – or maybe I ’m just plain wrong about a thing or two .

LDS anthropologist Daymon Smith has done some fascinating research on the history of correlation in the CoJCoL - dS and has written an entertaining and informative book about working at the Church Office Building ( which I reviewed here ) .
He ’s also been kind enough to do an interview for us here at MSP .
chanson :
In your interviews and writings you indicate that you have a testimony of Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon .
You seem drawn to the spiritual vitality of the early church , especially due to the fact that revelation was a community affair — something not just confined to the top leaders or some anonymous corporate committee .
To me , it seems like the Community of Christ ( formerly RLDS ) would be a perfect fit for you .
Have you thought about joining them , and , if so , what ’s the verdict ?
Daymon : I have considered joining the Community of Christ , but I am admittedly torn between relishing my boredom while staring across the landscape of corporate committees that is the church I currently attend , and actually joining a religious community for the sake of having a community .
In other words , I do like the communal aspects that I see in the early Mormon Church , and which I am told somewhat characterizes the C of C ( and to be fair , also much of the LDS experience as well ) , but I also , honestly , like coasting , not having to do anything but talk to congregants once in a while , which the LDS Church rather conveniently allows .
But seriously , I am hesitant to join any church , in part because I fear blunting with a satisfied sense of community a fading hunger to approach the divine .
Since Durkheim , anyway , it has been all too easy to mistake social relations for heavenly ones , and I am in my heart a social scientist as much as a believer in the unseen .
chanson :
Has the CoJCoL - dS called you in for any church disciplinary actions as a result of your work ?
If so , what happened ?
If not , are you worried that you might get excommunicated over this ?
Daymon :
No , but perhaps my “ persona ” or digital being has been disciplined .
I do n’t worry about excommunication , honestly , because I do n’t really see what the practical ( and “ spiritual ” ) effect would be .
Certain numbers that represent my “ membership ” would be moved to another database in the Church Office Building , but since I am not in fact a member of any church ( after reading the book this answer should make more sense ) , I ca n’t really see how I could be outside that church .
We are all excommunicates , in a literal sense .
I do enjoy speaking in the local chapel on the occasional Sunday , however , and being prevented from public speaking in certain properties would be counted as a real loss ( honestly ) .
chanson :
In your “ Mormon Stories ” podcast interview you emphasized that you are n’t claiming the church is in a state of apostasy .
Yet , in your book , you said
We have abandoned the straight and narrow for the stupid , the vain , the pompous steaming pile of shit . [… ]
If guesses are never put to the test , I suppose , if one need not bother checking with reality every now and then , there can be no way to reckon how far off course a speculation or guess misses the mark , or how deeply a religion has fallen
and many other equally damning things .
So , in what sense is the church not in apostasy ?
Do you think that the CoJCoL - dS is the true church and is being run according to God ’s commands ?
Daymon :
This is a question I ’ve been asked by others as well .
If we approach the problem of “ apostasy ” from a quasi-empirical perspective , and ask , “ How could one know a church / a people is in apostasy ? ” then I can’t seem to find a satisfactory answer , though , perhaps , that there is no “ theory of apostasy ” might well be a sign of apostasy .
Half - joking aside , I do n’t think there is a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints , in short , and so there is n’t anything which could be “ in apostasy . ”
There is an image of a church , a trademark , a sort of play at being a church , but that is n’t in my vague definition a sign of apostasy .
Only a sign that something went missing , and rather than find it , we built a stage and carpentered some scenery and convinced each other that the image is the thing .
The approach I take attempts to open a discussion which is too easily dismissed in summary with the claims “ apostasy ” or “ never in apostasy , ” claims which are typically grounded in personal experiences for the person who says as much .
I thought it wrong to dismiss the personal experiences of Mormons , feelings that confirm “ apostasy ” or “ not apostasy , ” and so worked out another way to speak about “ the Church . ”
On the second part , is the LDS Church the “ true church ” and “ run according to God ’s commands , ” I ’d have to refer to the my first answer , which is , there is no LDS Church which one might say is “ true ” and “ run according to God ’s commands . ”
But seriously , I assume the question really is , “ Is the Corporation the True Corporation and run… ? ” I would have to say , I do n’t think so .
Why ?
Because I would expect more of something as freighted with heavenly deliverables , as it were , more knowledge , more culture and art , more innovation , more practical solutions , more … I do n’t know , more “ Good ” ?
That was , I recall , what Joseph Smith once said was the true meaning of “ Mormon ” .
chanson :
You also stated in the MS interview that you teach Elders ’ quorum out of the correlated manual .
Why ?
Do you think it ’s edifying for the people you ’re teaching ?
Daymon : I believe I said I teach with the manual in front of me ( at least I hope that ’s what I said ) .
I view the obligation to work within the constraints of the questions and scriptural citations given in any particular lesson as part of the the “ letter ” of the law ( which Max Weber wrote about long ago ) ; a real challenge which I take seriously , but also which cannot edify without the “ spirit ” of the law — which is not , in my experience , often inscribed in those little books .
So I teach with the manual before me , but I ’ve also recited Bob Dylan ’s The Ballad of Hattie Carrol ( in reference to Justice and Mercy ) , or the Sounds of Silence by Simon and Garfunkle ( about prophets ) , or a Robert Frost poem , and , of course , regularly summon specters from the Joseph Smith Closet of Wonders .
Is that edifying ?
I hope so .
I do n’t really know from one week to the next what the point of standing up there before the class might be , ‘ edification ’ being far too lofty for my ambitions , but I ’m foolish enough to figure that while there ’s very little I can really accomplish in a thirty minute “ lesson , ” I can always hope my ramblings might strike an elder as maybe worth thinking about , if only briefly .
chanson : I had kind of assumed that you might be attending the services branded CoJCoL - dS for your wife ’s sake .
( There ’s a lot of that going on on our side of the tracks . )
If it ’s not too personal a question , does she play into this at all ?
Is she the person the book is secretly dedicated to ?
( If so , what does she think of it ? )
Even if you ’re not worried about excommunication affecting your eternal salvation , would there be a problem with your family if you were called in for church discipline ?
Daymon :
About my attendance , I show up mainly because I feel some obligation to try to teach others what I know / believe .
And honestly , I do like many of the Mormons at my ward , even those utterly opposed to the theology and politics I espouse , and I enjoy interacting with them .
And every Sunday I ’m presented with a puzzle as an anthropologist , something like “ why would anyone say that ? ” or “ why take that reading from the bible ? ”
In short , I have enough independent reasons to keep going , so that if one fails another comes forward .
My wife , Amber , I suppose , would encourage me to attend if I decided to go inactive , but she ’s also willing to be excommunicated for the sake of the truth .
I am fortunate to be with her .
Do I worry about the eternal prospects of our relationship ?
Of course , just as much as I worry about my own soul , but I do n’t believe that if I am excommunicated my family would be unsealed .
I do n’t think those ‘ sealing powers ’ are in use anymore ( except perhaps as a sort of ‘ play acting ’ ) , and even if they were , a stake president does n’t have the authority to unseal what is done by the Holy Ghost .
As far as I can tell , I ai n’t saved or exalted yet anyway , so I ca n’t really lose what I do n’t have , and which ca n’t be given by a guy in a suit who happens to reside near my home .
chanson : I did n’t mean to imply that you might believe that excommunication would affect eternal sealings or anything like that .
The thing is that we have tons of NOMs in our community ( who practice Mormonism without believing in the CoJCoL - dS ) who attend for their families ’ sake .
That is , the beloved TBM spouse would be very upset ( and possibly threaten divorce ) if less - believing spouse stopped practicing .
I was just curious as to whether there was any element of that in your situation .
I gather that you do n’t have that problem , and that you and your wife are on the same page .
You and your family are very fortunate .
When you say that “ she ’s also willing to be excommunicated for the sake of the truth ” , do you mean that she supports your research and agrees with what you ’re doing ( whether or not she agrees with all of the conclusions in the book ) ?
Daymon : Yeah , she supports my work completely .
chanson :
By the way , I ’m not trying to put you on the spot here — I just want to get an interesting conversation going that will get our readers interested in your book and dissertation .
We like to encourage a civil discussion among a variety of viewpoints ( including faithful ) , but keep in mind that our regular writers and commenters are mostly “ secular Mormons ” ( i.e. atheists and agnostics ) .
Full disclosure : I ’m also an atheist .
Daymon : I know that was n’t a question , but I ’m generally more comfortable among atheists , to be honest , and probably align more closely with atheists than with religious folk .
I figure if religion was started thousands of years ago so that one priest could challenge another priest in a game of storytelling and dialectic , then so long as the dialectic and civility is there , and conducted in a liberal spirit , I ’m happy to dispense with the sacrificial fires and the robes and so forth .
That said , I also would have no problem believing in a god who was also , more often than not , an atheist .
chanson : Have you read Roots of Modern Mormonism by Mark P. Leone ?
What do you think of it ?
Daymon : I read Leone ’s book in grad school , and thought it was pretty poorly done .
He was a functionalist when that was the thing ( late 60s ) , then became a post - structuralist pseudo - Foucauldian ( as a cover for structuralism ) , and last I heard he was ranting about “ exposing liars as liars ” in a talk about modern Mormonism .
In my part of anthropology he ’s generally regarded as a ‘ theory pimp ’ , one who trots out the seeming latest theory to plug up the gaps in his research .
I honestly do n’t recall much about the book , except that there was great emphasis on irrigation ditches , and the claim that Mormons have a ‘ do it yourself theology ’ , which seems like rather lazy ethnography , and provided no sense of how that apparently looseness fit with the rest of Mormonism , including Correlation and the rush to conservativism .
That is to say , a study of culture ca n’t end with “ individual opinions vary ” without also subverting the very foundation of the discipline ( culture , which is supposed to provide those views ) .
Anyway , sorry I ca n’t offer a better critique of the book .
Maybe if I read it again I ’d find something I missed the first time .
chanson :
Your book is subtitled “ a book about a book ” :
What was the original book like , and how is the second one different ?
Daymon :
About the subtitle : the “ first ” book which my book is “ about ” was written by Daemon , a computer person ( a ) .
That book went missing .
So my book is “ about ” that book , in the same way that Jesus is supposed to have said he was “ about ” his Father ’s business ( no pun intended on ‘ business ’ ) when he went missing .
Really ?
Well , no , not really .
I just wanted a ‘ meta ’ book , for various reasons ( some having to do with the absence of the original “ Book of Mormon ” ) , and thought the title sufficiently playful ( or confusing ) to indicate I do n’t take the author all that seriously .
I really did want to give readers every chance to dismiss the book , and then to burden myself with rewarding those that stuck with the story .
In retrospect , the subtitle perhaps makes the book seem like it ’s about ( some other ) Book of Mammon , a missing book of which this text is but an incomplete representation .
Maybe in due time that complete record will spring forth from the concrete of the Church Office Building , and cry for justice .
chanson :
Thanks ,
Daymon , for taking the time to answer these questions for us !
Solar power can light the homes of the off - grid poor , but how can people buy the equipment ?
Pinaki Roy and Katherine Nightingale report .
As night falls , Shafiqul Islam , a teacher in the tiny Bangladeshi village of Saatkuta , can see the electric lights twinkling in Indian villages across the barbed wire fence that marks the border .
But in his own village , 300 kilometres from capital city Dhaka and numbering just 125 households , electricity has been a dream .
In common with 70 per cent of the 140 million Bangladeshis , Shafiqul 's village is not on the electricity grid and people depend mainly on kerosene lamps for lighting .
But recently a few electric lights have appeared in the village .
In 12 of the houses , as dusk sets in , there is now the glow of compact fluorescent lamps powered by solar systems .
Shafiqul was the first to buy a solar home system .
His 50 watt system charges a battery during the day that allows his household to run three or four lightbulbs and a television for at least four hours a night .
It is quietly transforming his life .
He marks exam papers in the evening and then reads , or watches television .
But so many more could be doing the same .
Buying into home systems
Putting reliable solar power systems into the hands of poor and remote villagers has not been easy .
Across Africa and Asia organisations are trying different methods , according to Anne Wheldon , technical director of the UK - based Ashden Awards for Sustainable Energy , which promotes low - carbon , local forms of energy .
The two most promising ones involve making it easier for people to buy the systems and also promote some method of long - term maintenance , she says .
People can take out a microfinance loan from a bank or microfinance institute and buy direct .
Or a non-governmental organisation ( NGO ) or social enterprise installs systems in return for payments spread over an agreed period .
Wheldon says that aid and government programmes have been less successful than these two methods .
" There are lots of government solar programmes around the world that have n't worked particularly well . "
" They 've been done with the best of intentions but usually they do n't have good service .
Solar systems do n't need a lot of service but any equipment needs some level of repair . "
A solar - powered sewing machine : putting reliable solar power systems into the hands of poor and remote villagers has not been easy Ashden Awards
Katie Bliss , programmes manager for SolarAid — an NGO based in the UK that aims to bring solar power to the poor — agrees .
" Part of the reason why solar projects have failed in the past is because there is a lack of ownership .
Aid can create dependency and does n't empower people to do things for themselves , and can undermine the skills and capacity that already exist in countries . "
Microfinance in practice
In Saatkuta , Shafiqul acquired his solar system through a microfinance loan .
" I was not able to pay the whole 26,800 Bangladeshi taka ( US$ 387 ) at one time , " he says .
" But I found they were offering instalments and that was affordable for me . "
For his 50 watt system there was a down payment of US $ 72 and he is now paying US $ 11 a month for three years .
The cost is about the same as using four kerosene lamps each night , he says .
Behind the Bangladeshi solar power scheme is Grameen Shakti , a not for profit venture of Grameen Bank , which created a revolution in microfinance and brought a Nobel Peace Prize to its founder Muhammad Yunus .
Since 1996 , Grameen Shakti has sold 280,000 solar home systems that are benefiting three million people .
Many of its customers are farmers , small grocers and traders .
Fazlul Haque , deputy general manager of Grameen Shakti , says : " We tried to sell them in different ways including cash for the whole cost or instalments over two or six months . "
But most of the rural people are not able to afford much money at once so Grameen Shakti now offers small instalments over two or three years .
Salespeople from field offices collect the monthly instalments from customers with a success rate of about 94 per cent .
Loans wo n't cover all
Grameen Shakti has a big infrastructure — 726 branch offices under 110 regional offices , monitored by 12 divisional offices , plus 45 technology centres .
One benefit is that the loan comes from an established lending organisation that has a large amount of capital to draw on , says Wheldon .
Next door , in India , the Aryavart Gramin Bank , which provides banking for rural areas in Uttar Pradesh , also has a large and successful solar system loan programme for its customers .
But not everyone has access to banking or microfinance .
Although such financing is designed to help poor people , terms can still be impossible to meet for the very poor .
And as Wheldon says , programmes such as equipment loans may be limited to existing bank customers .
" They may also require some sort of collateral — which the poorest people do n't have .
For example , customers with the Aryavart Gramin scheme need a good track record to qualify for a solar loan . "
They also need to make a 20 per cent down payment .
Even in Bangladesh , Grameen Shakti has to insist on evidence that the customer has a minimum regular income before the loan can proceed .
Wheldon contrasts this with the situation for agricultural loans .
" Quite a lot of banks will make loans for agriculture equipment where they can see the potential for earning money , " she says .
" The difference with a solar system is that there may be earning potential [ for example , by working in the evenings ] but it 's not necessarily going to .
" It would help if it became well understood within the banking and microfinance system that solar systems can be creditworthy . "
The NGO approach
Another approach , in which NGOs act as ' middlemen ' to provide the credit and work with customers , is also underway in Bangladesh .
The Infrastructure Development Company Ltd ( IDCOL ) , set up by the Bangladesh government , is working with various NGOs to sell solar home systems With World Bank support , IDCOL also provides a US $ 46 grant to NGOs for each system they sell .
So far , 14 NGOs are taking part in the scheme and a further six have registered .
Solar home systems are benefitting about three million people Flickr / Barefoot Photographers of Tilonia
Monirul Islam , general manger of IDCOL , says that the NGO grants are gradually being decreased as the systems become more popular , because the government wants the NGOs to be self - sufficient .
Apart from the grants , the World Bank is financing IDCOL to provide loans at half the commercial rate to the partner NGOs to help them promote the systems .
IDCOL had , by December 2009 , approved more than 416,000 solar home systems .
Keeping the lights on
Another advantage of the NGO approach is that they can also maintain systems while selling to new customers .
" If somebody is going to collect a payment for a system they can also be trained to do the basic checks that a system is working .
It 's quite a good way of linking service and payment , " says Wheldon .
Aryavart Gramin Bank addresses servicing by paying a small amount to a local entrepreneur to do maintenance .
The money is added to the cost of the system .
" But you need to be doing it on a fairly large scale to do that — it would n't work if you were a small local bank , " says Wheldon .
In Bangladesh , Grameen Shakti provides a one - day training course to all customers about maintenance .
Entrepreneurs step in
Whether run directly by a bank or microfinance operation , or indirectly through an NGO , there is the problem of the sheer scale of collecting payments from thousands of people .
One way to reach more people is to sell solar systems to entrepreneurs .
Sunnymoney , a project run by UK - based NGO SolarAid , acts as a broker , bringing banks and entrepreneurs together and providing solar equipment and know - how for entrepreneurs once they have secured funding .
It was launched in Kenya in January 2009 and is now established in Malawi , Tanzania and Zambia .
It mentors 130 entrepreneurs in the four countries .
Thousands of solar powered lights and chargers are being sold .
Sunnymoney does not provide credit , so the entrepreneurs must buy their own solar products — usually a solar panel that charges batteries to power an LED lantern or a mobile phone charger .
They buy the systems for about US $ 21 each and sell them for US $ 25 .
But SolarAid helps the entrepreneurs find credit by matching them with local microfinance sources such as financing cooperatives , banks or charitable microfinance institutions .
Credit — the key issue
One obstacle for the very poor , however , is that they usually have to buy the entrepreneur 's solar systems with a one - off payment .
Sunnymoney is working on a cheaper solar home system that can be bought in pieces at different times Ashden Awards
" The entrepreneurs themselves are n't really in a position to offer finance , " says Bliss .
" In some cases they will offer a kind of credit scheme but it 's completely of their own doing — they might do it within their community or social network but that 's their decision . "
So , she adds , solar systems probably reach the lower middle classes in rural areas but not those who are much poorer .
To tackle this , Sunnymoney is working on a cheaper solar home system that can be bought in pieces at different times , with consumers adding extra panels , lights and chargers when they can afford them .
SolarAid is now seeking social investment to run the project .
The idea is that companies will invest in ' social enterprises ' that are run like businesses but for which the social outcome is paramount .
NGOs can also help people who can't get credit from banks , notes Wheldon .
The crucial element for the NGOs is the link to a source of credit , as in the IDCOL initiative in Bangladesh .
Rent a light
For those unable to commit to buying a system , renting may be a useful option , says Wheldon .
A market trader , for example , could hire a pre-charged solar lantern for the evening to improve her business at a night market .
The smallest solar systems are becoming increasingly affordable for the poor .
Of all the ways of getting lighting into their homes and businesses — aid , microcredit , NGO projects , rental — Wheldon believes that microfinance through banks is the best option .
" It 's a route that has got the potential to expand — NGOs would find it difficult to scale up because they do n't have large reserves of capital to draw on .
" It would be fantastic if solar power loans became part of regular banking . "
Maybe that would get all of Saatkuta 's homes twinkling at night .
Tavis Ormandy , a security researcher for Google , on Thursday posted a vulnerability report to the Full - Disclosure mailing list , which detailed a vulnerability in Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 .
Later versions of Windows are unaffected .
The flaw is in the Help and Support Center , a relic of the time when Microsoft was trying to make everything on the computer a browser app .
Help , Control Panel , Windows Update , and other components were browser or browser - like apps .
In order to access remote help , the Help and Support Center supports remote links to help using hcp :// addresses .
Windows XP SP2 introduced a model whereby the program , when run with the / fromhcp parameter , runs in a special restricted mode where only links from addresses on a special whitelist can have privileged access .
Ormandy 's vulnerability is an implementation error that allows the whitelist to be bypassed .
Read the FD posting if you want all the gory details , but the end result is arbitrary code execution from links on the Web .
Ormandy notified Microsoft about this bug on June 5 , the Saturday before this last Patch Tuesday .
Thursday afternoon the Microsoft Security Response Center responded with a blog entry , which criticized Ormandy for releasing the information without giving them a fair chance to evaluate it and provide a registry hack to remove all hcp support .
That blocks the vulnerability as well as useful hcp links , such as those in the Control Panel .
Ormandy also created an unofficial hotfix of his own and linked to it from his post , but a Secunia analysis of the issue claims that the hotfix does not sufficiently address the problem .
If you run Windows XP ( and that 's your first mistake ) you will be much better off following Microsoft 's registry mitigation technique , although I think you could probably get away with renaming the key rather than deleting it .
This should make it easier to undo when the patch is available .
Ormandy posted the vulnerability report using his personal e-mail and is probably acting in a private capacity , but do n't expect Microsoft to see it that way .
Microsoft 's initial report on the bug referred to Ormandy as " a Google security researcher " and the tweet announcing it said that the " information on the Windows Help vulnerability [ was ] disclosed by Google . "
People can have reasonable disagreements about the limits of full disclosure vs. " responsible " disclosure , but I doubt Google would take kindly to a Microsoft researcher blind - siding them like this .
For Ormandy to expect turnaround like this during a heavy Patch Tuesday is not reasonable .
In fact , even Ormandy may be reconsidering the wisdom of his move .

In a very interesting report ( Lifting all boats : promoting social cohesion and economic inclusion in the Toronto Region ) published last week , the Toronto Board of Trade addresses some important issues related to the GTA .
Among them is the need to take better advantage of the skills new immigrants bring to this country .
In particular , the study reports that the “ wages earned by Canadian immigrants are lower , while the rates of involuntary part - time work , temporary employment and over - qualification are all higher than non-immigrants . ”
There is no doubt that the skills of many new immigrants are not properly utilized in Canada , in both the private and public sectors , and there is still a lot of work to do .
At the same time , there also is a problem with our immigration system that privileges those with higher education at the expense of those with practical skills .
For example , in an article on this report , the Globe and Mail wrote about the difficulties Yisola Taiwo , an architect who immigrated to Canada from Nigeria three years ago with his wife , is facing in finding a job for which he is qualified .
I do n't know the details of Taiwo 's immigration file , but I do know about many similar cases .
Canada claims to need the services of immigrants with PhDs but , for some mysterious reason , it prevents them from working in their chosen field and pays them unemployment insurance instead .
I 'm sure that there has to be something more to it .
According to the Globe story , back in Nigeria Taiwo “ helped design the athletes ' village for Abuja 's All - Africa Games .
But three years after moving to Canada in 2007 with a pregnant wife and big dreams , Yisola Taiwo has yet to land his first architecture job . ”
Furthermore , “ his wife , Bunmi Sofoluwe - Taiwo , still has n't been able to find work after leaving her career with the Lagos government . ”
So the question is :
Who fools these immigrants into leaving promising careers in their home country to make a jump into the unknown ?
The answer is our immigration system .
It puts a lot of emphasis on education and knowledge of one of the two official languages .
If you have a job offer , it gives you 10 points and the so - called “ suitability ” requirement gives you another 10 .
But if you have a PhD , as was the case with Taiwo from Nigeria , and you speak proper English , you get 49 points .
You get another 21 points if you have up to four years ' experience and another 10 if you are between 21 and 49 years old .
Now , considering that the minimum number of points required to come to Canada is 67 , it 's easy to understand why people like Taiwo are allowed into the country but remain unemployed .
They can easily total 80 points without having a job offer .
This also explains why a bricklayer or labourer from any country in Central or South America or Europe is not allowed to immigrate to Canada .
The results of this immigration madness ( implemented by former Liberal governments under pressure from their Quebec caucus asking them to put more emphasis on language than skills ) is clearly visible on the streets of Toronto these days .
We have highly educated people like Taiwo , humiliated and frustrated and collecting unemployment insurance , while thousands of illegal immigrants , mainly from Central and South America or Eastern Europe , are illegally doing legal jobs .
We do have to take care of people we irresponsibly let into the country but , if we really want to solve the problem , we have to deal with them before they arrive .
I know that the future of our manufacturing sector lies mainly in highly specialized jobs requiring skilled and highly educated people .
But these jobs are not here yet and we should n't lure highly educated people to this country only to list them among the unemployed .
We only have to look at the large number of young Canadians who have just graduated from our universities and are still unemployed to understand that our economic problems are not due to a lack of qualified people .

If we do n't change the points system , we can accommodate all the Taiwos we want but the problem will always be there .
As soon as we find a job for them , thousands more will show up at our airports , along with thousands of others less skilled and less educated .
But the latter , because they do n't speak French and do n't have a PhD , will illegally do a legal job , be underpaid and exploited , while those with the PhDs and language skills will be collecting unemployment insurance in Toronto .

Who wants an early build of Adobe AIR for Android ?
We just got our hands on a copy plus a couple of simple apps that work with it .
You wo n’t be blown away right now because when we say “ early ” we mean EARLY .
Still , who does n’t love leaked apps which will eventually be game changers ?
And what is Adobe AIR ?
In my non -techie talk , here is my take on it .
It essentially allows developers to easily make applications or tools that can be used across multiple platforms / operating systems .
* Works on both Android 2.1 and 2.2
Download : AIR.apk
Install as you would any other application .
Once you have it installed , here are a couple of apps to be used with AIR : air_apps.zip
For information on exactly what Adobe AIR is , check out the official Android site .
And as soon as we have more apps , we ’ll be sure to post them !
Can posting your unpublished novels online for free still lead to a nice book deal , now that the web is saturated with free fiction ?
It worked for author Marta Acosta , whose young - adult vampire novel will come out from Tor Books .

Acosta says she got tired of waiting for her YA novel , The Shadow Girl Of Birch Grove , to get a book deal .
So she posted it online at Scribd , where it became the # 1 selling YA novel and got some rave reviews from vampire sites .
( LoveVampires.com called it " Bloody brilliant . " )
Acosta , who also writes the successful adult vampire series Happy Hour At Casa Dracula , tells us :
My book had been with Tor and a few other publishers since last October .
We had n't heard anything back and I was beginning to despair .
That 's when I put the book online as a free read .
I do n't know that having it on Scribd inspired the offer , but I was able to get reviews that were presented to the editor who expressed interest .
Also showing her the number of reads made a difference .

And now , it 'll be coming out in hardcover as well as paperback .
Of course , it probably helps that her novel includes boarding schools as well as vampire intrigue .
Here 's the description , via Acosta 's blog :
Jane Williams has suffered personal tragedy and learned to survive by hiding in the shadows of life .
She thinks she will never escape the misery of her foster home when she 's offered a full - scholarship at an elite academy .
The school even offers Jane a place of her own to live , the old groundskeeper 's cottage in a dense grove of birch trees .
The very pale and very elegant headmistress , Mrs. Monroe , is especially kind and suggests that Jane earn spending money by tutoring her son , gorgeous Lucky .
A popular group of girls take Jane into their circle , and the challenging classes are all she could have hoped for .
It seems too good to be true .
It is .
We asked Acosta how she went about generating this story .
She says :
“ I say with full conviction that my husband or my family has nothing to do with these issues ( the IPL bids ) ... We always stay miles away from it .
Yes , we are avid cricket watchers , my husband , my kids , my family , all , and that ’s where the buck stops . ” — Sharad Pawar ’s daughter , Supriya Sule , April 20 , 2010
“ These ( charges ) are all a media creation .
Explain the allegations to me and I will definitely reply ...
My conscience is clear ” — Sharad Pawar to TOI on April 28 , when asked if he was involved in one of the failed franchise bids
“ There is no involvement of any member of the family of former BCCI president Sharad Pawar .
The bid documents have been seen by the income - tax department ’s officials . ” — BCCI chief Shashank Manohar , April 26 , 2010
Truth is , Sharad Pawar and his immediate family hold over 16 % equity in one of the bidders for an IPL cricket team .
Documents available with TOI show that the Pawars own 33.6 lakh shares ( out of 2.07 crore shares ) in City Corporation , a Pune - based construction company which bid Rs 1,176 crore for a franchise in March .
The Pawar family ’s shares are held through two companies , Lap Finance and Consultancy Pvt Ltd and Namratta Film Enterprises Pvt Ltd , which are 100 % owned by the NCP supremo and Union agriculture minister , his wife Pratibha and daughter Supriya Sule , also an MP .
When contacted by TOI , Sule said , “ It is in his personal capacity that Mr ( Anirudhha ) Deshpande ( MD of City Corp ) bid .
It had nothing to do with the company .
The company board had passed a resolution saying it would have nothing to do with the bid .
Nobody supported it .
The board meeting was on March 17 , and the resolution was probably passed on March 19 . ”
The second round of IPL bids ended on March 21 , when the franchisees for Pune and Kochi were announced in Chennai .
City Corp was eventually outgunned by Sahara ’s Rs 1,702 - crore winning offer .
When it was pointed out that despite the “ board resolution ” , the bid was in the name of City Corp , Sule said it was for Deshpande to explain .
“ After all , I am a minority stakeholder , ” she added .
Deshpande acknowledged to TOI that the bid document was bought and submitted in the name of City Corp .
But he claimed the " bid was done in my personal capacity " .
He said , " The tender was bought in the name of City Corp .
Subsequently , the board did not agree to the bid , but permitted me to use the company ’s name for bidding purposes . "
If City Corp had won the bid it would have been executed by a " different consortium , comprising Akruti ( a Mumbai construction firm ) , Maharashtra Cricket Association , etc , " he said .
So far , no state cricket association has bid for a team .
Asked about this , Deshpande promised to produce documentary proof to back his claims .
TOI , which has been in touch with him over telephone since May 27 , is yet to receive these documents .
Apart from talking to him , mobile text messages were also sent to him .
Asked about the Pawar family connection with City Corp , Deshpande said he was not sure if they had any shares .
“ They are not involved .
I am the managing director .
There is no control , ” he said .
Documents accessed from the ministry of corporate affairs ’ database on May 30 reveal the Pawar family has a not - inconsiderable 16.22 % in City Corp .
Also , all shares in the company are in the name of just 10 persons / entities , including Deshpande and his wife Sona — and the Pawar - owned Lap Finance and Namratta .
Of the 33.6 lakh shares the Pawars hold in City Corp , 25.6 lakh are through Lap and 8 lakh through Namratta .
Central agencies aware of Pawar ’s IPL bid link
City Corp , the fifth bidder for the second round of IPL franchises , has so far succeeded in avoiding the spotlight , which has been focused on Sahara and Rendezvous , winners of the Pune and Kochi franchises respectively , and the two losers , the Dhoots of Videocon and the Adanis .
It is learnt that central investigation agencies are in possession of this evidence , which appears to undermine the assertion that the Pawars were in no way connected to the IPL .
The details of the Pawars ’ complete control of Lap and Namratta are contained in the documents filed by the companies with the ministry of corporate affairs as of May 30 , 2010 .
Also , Pawar , in his affidavit filed before the returning officer of Madha Lok Sabha constituency in Maharashtra in the 2009 elections , had declared his association with Lap and Namratta .
The affidavit , filed on March 31 , 2009 , shows Pawar holding 1,000 equity shares and 150 preference shares of Lap , and 652 equity shares of Namratta .
The affidavit also shows Pawar having a deposit of Rs 61 lakh with Lap .
In the same affidavit , Pawar ’s wife Pratibha is shown holding 1,000 equity shares and 10,150 preference shares of Lap , and 1,100 equity and 8,425 preference shares of Namratta .
Through Lap and Namratta , the Pawar family also owns , in total , 25,29,375 preferential shares of City Corporation .
This amounts to 16.32 % of the total 155,00,000 preferential shares issued by the company .
In Lap Finance , Sharad Pawar , his wife and daughter have 100 % voting rights , and own all the 3,000 equity shares issued by the company .
Until mid-2006 , Supriya Sule owned 2,980 of the 3,000 subscribed equities .
According to filings by Lap , Sule on September 4 , 2006 , transferred 990 shares each to her father and mother .
The 2008 - 09 annual return shows that the three now have 1,000 shares each of the total 3,000 shares .
In Namratta , Pawar , his wife and daughter together hold all the 2,000 equity shares of the company ( Sharad Pawar — 652 , Pratibha Pawar — 1,100 , Supriya Sule - 248 ) .
Both Sharad Pawar and his wife are directors of the company .
This information was found in the company ’s filings with the ministry of corporate affairs , accessed by TOI between May 20 and 30 .
House Democrats are readying an alternative budget measure that would set next year ’s spending levels without requiring a vote on deficits .
House Budget Committee Chairman John Spratt ( D - S.C. ) said the alternative would be the “ functional equivalent ” of a full - fledged budget .
But because it wo n't be a traditional budget resolution , it will be silent on future deficits , which are expected to average nearly $ 1 trillion for the next decade .

Democrats have expressed concern about voting for a document showing lots of red ink in an election year .
A traditional budget resolution sets the discretionary spending levels and also lays out the majority ’s fiscal policies for future years .
Alternative budget measures , known in past years as “ deeming resolutions , ” set spending caps but lack the statement on future spending and tax policies .
House Republicans have seized on Democrats ’ inability to even bring up a budget resolution for consideration .
Budget rules call on lawmakers to pass a budget by April 15 .
Republicans had control of the House the previous four times Congress failed to approve a final budget resolution since 1974 , when the current budget rules were put into place .
But should Democrats move forward with an alternative budget measure , it would be the first time the House had failed to even propose a budget resolution .
“ We need a real budget to stop Washington Democrats ’ out - of - control spending spree , which is scaring the hell out of the American people , and to create jobs , ” said Michael Steel , spokesman for House Minority Leader John Boehner John Andrew BoehnerLongtime House parliamentarian to step down
Five things we learned from this year 's primaries Bad blood between Pelosi , Meadows complicates coronavirus talks MORE ( R - Ohio ) .
In addition to setting spending levels for 2011 , the alternative budget may have other provisions , such as squaring the pay - as - you - go law signed by President Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaUnseemly brawl unlikely to change a thing
It 's now up to health systems to solve our food problems Testing the Electoral College process against judicial overreach MORE with the similar pay - as - you - go House rule , Spratt said .
Both PAYGO measures require new tax cuts or that entitlement programs be paid for with tax increases or spending cuts , but the House PAYGO rule , in place since before the law was enacted , can be more easily bypassed than the PAYGO law .
Spratt cautioned the work is n’t finished .
" It would have some other provisions we need to deal with , like maybe alignment of the statutory and House rules for PAYGO , " Spratt said .
" But we 're making progress .
I believe we 're going to get to the endpoint .
I do n't want to misrepresent anything by saying we 're there yet .
We are n't .
We 're drawing alternatives . "
Spratt said the budget may be attached to an upcoming supplemental spending bill , which will provide funding for the Iraq and Afghanistan wars , domestic disaster aid and possibly fiscal aid to states and local governments to retain public workers .
Democrats have been trying to figure out how to move forward with the annual budget since April .
Fiscally conservative Blue Dog Democrats have been pressing
House leaders for a 2 percent spending cut to non-security discretionary spending , which would go beyond the spending freeze that the White House has called for .
Rep. Baron Hill ( D - Ind. ) , a senior Blue Dog , said he was “ confident ” the cut would be in place when Spratt ’s budget proposal comes out .
Watch CNN tonight for a discussion on the history of presidential toughness .
Don Lemon asks the question :
How tough should a president be when in the public eye ?
CNN tonight , 8 ET
( CNN ) --
Here 's proof that President Obama has indeed ushered in a new era in race relations .
Who would have ever expected some white Americans to demand that an African - American man show more rage ?
If you 've followed the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster , you 've heard the complaints that Obama is n't showing enough emotion .
But scholars say Obama 's critics ignore a lesson from American history : Many white Americans do n't like angry black men .
It 's the lesson Obama absorbed from his upbringing , and from an impromptu remark he delivered last summer .
Yet it 's a lesson he may now have to jettison , they say , as public outrage spreads .
" Folks are waiting for a Samuel Jackson ' Snakes on the Plane ' moment from this president as in : ' We gotta ' get this $ #@ !!* oil back in the $ #!!* rig !'
But that 's just not who Obama is , '' says Saladin Ambar , a political science professor at Lehigh University in Bethlehem , Pennsylvania .
Some of the same people crying for Obama to show more emotion would have voted against him if he had displayed anger during his presidential run , says William Jelani Cobb , author of " The Substance of Hope : Barack Obama and the Paradox of Progress . "
" It would have fed deeply into a pre-existing set of narratives about the angry black man , " Cobb says .
" The anger would have gotten in the way .
He would have frightened off white voters who were interested in him because he seemed to be like the black guy they worked with or went to graduate school with -- not a black guy who is threatening . "
Obama ready to kick butt ?
Now some critics say that Obama should be a little bit more threatening .
On Monday , Matt Lauer on NBC's " Today " told Obama that critics do n't want him to react to the oil disaster by meeting with experts and being calm .
They want him to " kick some butt . "
Obama responded by saying he talks to experts " because they potentially have the best answers , so I know whose ass to kick . "
Obama 's tough talk comes after criticism mounted over his response to the oil fiasco .
During a White House press briefing last week , a reporter told Obama 's press secretary that most people have n't seen rage from the president .
( That led Obama 's press secretary to say he had seen an enraged Obama 's " clenched jaws " in meetings . )
Obama 's cool temperament even prompted black filmmaker Spike Lee to tell CNN that for at least one time , Obama should " go off . "
Why Spike Lee thinks this is the time for Obama to go off
But Obama has " gone off " before and that did n't work too well for him , says Ambar .
During a news conference last summer , Obama casually said that police acted " stupidly " when they arrested Harvard professor Henry Louis " Skip " Gates in his home for disorderly conduct after a confrontation with a white police officer .
Obama 's comments infuriated many white people , and even some black supporters .
Obama had to have a Beer Summit to calm the public uproar .
" He flashed genuine anger , " says Ambar .
" At that moment , when he touched on the issue of race , he spoke frankly and passionately about what he felt and it got him into a big deal of trouble . "
Evoking the specter of the angry black man almost cost Obama his shot at the White House , says Paul Street , an author and political activist who worked with Obama in Chicago .
Street says videos of Obama 's former pastor , the Rev. Jeremiah Wright , angrily condemning America were so dangerous to Obama 's campaign because it hinted that Obama may have been an angry black man behind closed doors .
" Rev . Wright almost cost him his run for the presidency because of fears of the angry black man , " says Street , author of the upcoming book " The Empire 's New Clothes : Barack Obama in the Real World of Power . "
" What was Rev. Wright but the ultimate symbol of the angry black man who is going to take revenge , " Street says .
That symbol is hardwired into American history and popular culture .
It 's Nat Turner , the slave who inspired a bloody 19th - century uprising .
It 's Malcolm X , the black militant who denounced " blue - eyed devils . "
It 's the hip - hop and rap artists who populate contemporary radio .
Why Obama can't get angry if he tried
Obama , though , has spent a lifetime trying to rewrite that script , says Street , who says he worked with Obama in Chicago .
" He is Mr. Equanimity and Mr. Consolation , " says Street .
" That 's how he negotiated his way through multiple worlds , and reached out across bridges . "
In his 1995 memoir , " Dreams of My Father , " Obama explained why he thought such negotiation was necessary when he met white people as a young man growing up in Hawaii .
" People were satisfied so long as you were courteous and smiled and made no sudden moves .
Such a pleasant surprise to find a well - mannered young black man who did n't seem angry . "
If Obama wants to go down as a great president , though , he may have to discover the political value of rage , others say .
Franklin Roosevelt was such a president , historians say .
During the Great Depression , he went after business leaders who opposed his New Deal policies .
Roosevelt once said that he " welcomed the hatred " of the economic elites .
Could Obama become a 21st - century version of Roosevelt , not only in taking on the oil companies but big bankers as well ?
Ambar , from Lehigh University , does n't think so .
Obama does n't share Roosevelt 's elite background , which inoculated him from charges of being anti-American .
Roosevelt came from a prominent , and wealthy , American family .
" It 's easier to do it if your name is Roosevelt , " Ambar says .
" No one questions your love of capitalism or your patriotism . "
Obama 's challenge ahead
The BP oil spill , though , goes beyond race .
It is so egregious that Obama now has permission to stoke some " pitchfork , populist " anger , says Street .
" He 's now in danger of being perceived as being too soft and conciliatory and too much in the bed of corporations , " he says .
Some forms of rage remain a potent political weapon , says John Baick , an associate professor of history at Western New England College in Springfield , Massachusetts .
Tea Party organizers ; Democratic leader Howard Dean ; former presidential candidate Ron Paul -- all used rage as a powerful organizing tool , Baick says .
" Rage can provide answers to murky questions , rage can provide passion for the dispirited , rage can provide focus , " Baick says .
But race - specific anger is off - limits , Street says .
" He would be politically dead ; it would be over , " Street says .
Yet the call for a black man to show more emotion on subjects outside of race is still a healthy development , says Ambar , from Lehigh University .
" I take it as a sign of progress that people are calling for Obama to be angry , an almost impossible sentiment a decade ago , " he says .
Still , Obama must be careful about getting in touch with his inner-Samuel Jackson , others say .
Just as gushing oil lurks below the Gulf 's surface , all sorts of ugly , racial undercurrents exist beneath the surface of American politics , Baick says .
" Our commander in chief has many burdens , and among them is our history and culture , " Baick says .
" Compared to the weight of that , the current BP crisis and the years of environmental damage and cleanup must seem transient . "
Simple , provocative , to the point : the ad to the left is one Don Draper of Mad Men would ’ve adored .
This signature ad in American Apparel ’s summer campaign could just as easily be from 1962 as 2010 .
As Aviva Dove - Viebahn explains in “ Feminism in a Mad World ” in the latest issue of Ms. magazine , the show Mad Men–which returns to the air for a fourth season this Sunday , July 25 – has become “ a hot topic on the feminist blogosphere and around water coolers everywhere , alternately lauded for its strong female characters and criticized for its nostalgic rendering of the halcyon days of sanctioned workplace misogyny . ”
The show ’s creator , Matt Weiner , has insisted that by realistically depicting women ’s oppression at home and in the workplace , his show ascribes to the feminist agenda .
Mad Men itself might ascribe to the feminist agenda , but thanks to its pervasive impact on pop culture , the show is crafting a whole new generation of would - be Bettys ( Draper ’s stylish wife ) not Peggys ( the show ’s ambitious “ career girl ” ) .
Mad Men has entered the popular consciousness ( and checkbook ) to an almost frightening degree : Last summer , companies as diverse as Banana Republic , Clorox , Vanity Fair and Variety signed with the show .
This July , Mad Men Barbie hit the market , featuring a set of “ key players from the Sterling Cooper Advertising Agency . ”
But we ’re left wondering :
Hey , where ’s the Peggy doll ?
Where indeed .
Consumers have become obsessed with “ the Mad Men look , ” but certainly not with Peggy ’s sensible shoes .
Don knew how to brand at home and in the office , and the show ’s sets and costumes are appropriately visually stunning .
Yet the aesthetic elements that America adores are signs of a world of masculine privilege predicated on sexism , racism , homophobia–those infinite “ isms ” that said it was okay for the boys of Sterling Cooper to drink gin-and - tonics in the mid-afternoon while their maids detail the suede upholstery .
Mad Men consumerism replicates the physical trappings of that era with some disturbing cultural implications .
Take the American Apparel ad , which does n’t overtly reference the show but certainly cultivates the look of the early 60s .
This is our “ Classic Girl , ” complete with starched collar , high - waisted pants and blond locks .
Cute blonde models are old news in advertising , but this one comes with a special retro twist .
American Apparel ads are infamously over - sexualized .
This model ’s childish body and innocent look seemingly strike a cleaner note , but her very prepubescence lends the sexuality she does exhibit an illicit air .
Oh , those tender red lips , those modest curves , a viewer might croon , unconsciously echoing the words of Humbert Humbert , the pedophiliac hero of Nabokov ’s Lolita .
Published in 1955 ( and made into a hit movie in 1962 ) , the novel shed light on the hypocrisy evident in mid-century culture and advertising .
Despite the era ’s sexual repressiveness , Hugh Hefner founded Playboy and Little Lolitas appeared in Coca - Cola ads .
The appeal of the original “ Classic Girl ” appeal derives from her girlishness –Humbert delights in dressing Lolita in tennis skirts and polo shirts ; pleasures he worries will dissipate once she hits puberty .
The wives who tend to their Mad Men are allowed to grow up–but just barely .
Stuck in the suburbs and squeezed into polyester garden party dresses , their emotions denied by their husbands and buried in their beehives , these women have to muffle their sovereignty .
So when consumers reclaim the look of this past , they also emulate the “ Classic ” woman - child it exulted–her signature style of repression and subservience .
( Newser ) – Sensing that there were not enough fart jokes in your life , MTV has decided to resurrect Beavis and Butt - head , network sources confirm for the New York Post .
It ’s been 13 years since the last new episode of the cartoon aired , but it sounds like children of the ‘ 90s can rest easy , because the network does n’t intend to update much .
Mike Judge , the series creator and voice of the leads , is still at the helm , the animation will still be bare - bones , and the boys will still be in high school .
The only real difference will be that the music videos the duo mock will be from modern acts like Lady Gaga .
And yes , that means music videos will actually appear on MTV .
Will wonders never cease ?

CHECKERS ( or draughts , as it is known in Britain ) used to be a fun game of chance .
But in 2007 a group of computer programmers , systems analysts and chess enthusiasts , led by Jonathan Schaeffer at the University of Alberta , published an article in Science magazine with the bold title “ Checkers Is Solved ” .
Using a computer program called Chinook , which was able to crunch through the 500 billion possible positions on a checkerboard , Mr Schaeffer and his colleagues proved that there was a way to play checkers that would ensure either a win or , if the opponent was another theoretically perfect player , a draw .
With checkers thus conquered , Mr Schaeffer moved on to poker .
The University of Alberta 's Computer Poker Research Group ( CPRG ) was building a program called Polaris , which was trying to do for one variety of poker , heads - up limit Texas Hold 'em ( with just two players and limited betting amounts ) , what Chinook did for checkers .
Michael Bowling , the CPRG 's head , says that although the ostensible goal was to build a winning poker program , the real aim was to “ study how to build computers to make decisions in difficult circumstances , especially where there is missing information ” .
It is this missing information that makes poker so complex .
Unlike checkers or chess , at which machines have also had notable success , poker is a game of incomplete information .
You do not know what cards your opponent holds ; information is revealed as the game progresses .
A good player 's tactics will involve deception such as bluffing and slow - playing , both of which create more complexities .
Soon after the article was published , Polaris took on Phil Laak and Ali Eslami , both poker professionals .
Each played a separate Polaris programme running in a different room , using notional money .
The human players could not communicate with each other .
To control for luck , the games were identical and reversed : whatever cards the computer got in one room the human got in the other .
The humans then switched rooms and played the hands previously played by the computers , for a total of four 500 - hand sessions .
The results were surprising : a draw in one match , a resounding win by Polaris in another and two narrow victories for the humans in the remainder .
In 2008 the human field was expanded to six professionals .
Out of six matches the humans won two , Polaris won three and one was drawn .
Mr Bowling attributes Polaris 's stronger performance to a crucial modification that allowed the program to adjust its strategy in response to its opponent 's behaviour during a match .
Polaris has not competed against humans since then , but the CPRG has done some work on another poker variety , heads - up no -limit Hold 'em .
Jack Strauss , a prominent poker player in the 1970s and 1980s , famously described the difference between limit and no limit : “ In limit you are shooting at a target .
In no limit the target comes alive and shoots back at you . ”
Mr Bowling says his no-limit Polaris can compete “ at a low professional level ” .
The more interesting work , however , may be in spin - off applications .
Mr Bowling says that the ability to solve large games in which participants value similar things differently has some applications in auction and negotiation settings .
Some of the game - theory aspects of Polaris have been found to improve networks of sensors that measure variable environmental information , such as heat in a building or chemicals in lakes .
And yet for all its prowess , Polaris is unlikely to become the Chinook or Deep Blue of poker , making humans obsolete .
For one thing , heads - up poker is only one of many kinds of poker played .
A first - rate human player can hold his own in any variation ; a machine might find the transition harder .
Second , most poker is still played socially , whether in casinos or at home , and you can't have a beer and a natter with a bot .
Online an intelligent machine might have a better chance .
But most sites have rigorous anti-bot policies , particularly when it comes to transferring money .
And creating a bot that can defeat multiple layers of security may be harder than playing first - rate poker .
As Mr Laak says , “ anyone smart enough to put a bot down would make way more money operating above board . ”
The first trailer and footage for Fox ’s The Chronicles of Narnia : The Voyage of the Dawn Treader has popped up at the Brazilian website MundoNarnia ( via / Film ) .
It ’s a bit on the small side but more than clear enough to get a look look for how the third trip to Narnia is shaping up .
There ’s no word yet on when Fox will be officially releasing the trailer stateside .
Odds are favorable to expect it between now and The Last Airbender ’s July 1 release .
The Chronicles of Narnia : The Voyage of the Dawn Treader arrives in theaters on December 10th , 2010 , in 2D and 3D formats .
Longtime readers may recall that this is in fact an old comic , but for some reason it never made it to the new site .
Until now , that is , and I think we can agree that all our lives are richer for it .
Drugs commonly taken for a variety of common medical conditions including insomnia , allergies , or incontinence negatively affect the brain causing long term cognitive impairment in older African - Americans , according to a study appearing in the July 13 , 2010 print issue of Neurology , the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology .
These drugs , called anticholinergics , block acetylcholine , a nervous system neurotransmitter , and are widely - used medical therapies .
They are sold over the counter under various brand names such as Benadryl® , Dramamine® , Excedrin PM® , Nytol® , Sominex® , Tylenol PM® , and Unisom® .
Other anticholinergic drugs , such as Paxil® , Detrol® , Demerol® and Elavil® are available only by prescription .
Older adults most commonly use drugs with anticholinergic effects as sleep aids and to relieve bladder leakage problems .
Researchers from Indiana University School of Medicine , the Regenstrief Institute and Wishard Health Services conducted a six - year observational study , evaluating 1,652 Indianapolis area African - Americans over the age of 70 who had normal cognitive function when the study began .
In addition to monitoring cognition , the investigators tracked all over - the - counter and prescription medications taken by study participants .
" We found that taking one anticholinergic significantly increased an individual 's risk of developing mild cognitive impairment and taking two of these drugs doubled this risk .
This is very significant in a population - African - Americans - already known to be at high risk for developing cognitive impairment , " said Noll Campbell , PharmD , first author of the study .
Dr. Campbell is a clinical pharmacist with Wishard Health Services .
" Simply put , we have confirmed that anticholinergics , something as seemingly benign as a medication for inability to get a good night 's sleep or for motion sickness , can cause or worsen cognitive impairment , specifically long - term mild cognitive impairment which involves gradual memory loss .
As a geriatrician I tell my Wishard Healthy Aging Brain Center patients not to take these drugs and I encourage all older adults to talk with their physicians about each and every one of the medications they take , " said Malaz Boustani , M.D. , IU School of Medicine associate professor of medicine , Regenstrief Institute investigator and IU Center for Aging Research center scientist .
" The fact that we found that taking anticholinergics is linked with mild cognitive impairment , involving memory loss without functional disability , but not with Alzheimer Disease , gives me hope .
Our research efforts will now focus on whether anticholinergic - induced cognitive impairment may be reversible , " said Dr. Boustani , who added that " this study offers a new window to change the burden of dementia " for the individual , the caregiver and the healthcare system . "
" This finding of a link between anticholinergics and long term mild cognitive impairment complements our previous work which confirmed a link between anticholinergics and delirium , which is a sudden onset cognitive impairment , " said Dr. Campbell .
Although this study , which was funded by the National Institute on Aging , looked at only African - Americans , both Dr. Campbell and Dr. Boustani believe future studies will find that the results are generalizable to other races .

You hear about movies being leaked via BitTorrent all the time – scene and P2P groups make sure that these are all shared online , whether movies makers and distributors like it or not .
Of course , right now there are n’t many publishers who embrace BitTorrent as a distribution medium .
However , there are folks who willingly share their work via BitTorrent at no cost at all .
Makers of Indie movie Self Helpless belong to that rare segment of movie producers – they have released their independent movie via BitTorrent and encourage torrenters to share it with as many people as they like .
For those who are not into BitTorrent , an online streaming version is available for free through NinjaVideo .
Here ’s how Adam Jaroszewski , a co-director and co-writer of Self Helpless , explained their decision to release the movie on BitTorrent :
Instead of fighting downloaders we 're embracing them .
Basically we want our movie to spread far and wide because we know that the community supports art and content it truly enjoys .
We 're confident there 's a large audience for Self Helpless , and we want to give people the chance to check it out .
By our estimation , the Self Helpless torrents and streamed video on ninjavideo have been viewed about 5000 + times in its first 5 days .
And the community is starting to show some support .
Being avid downloaders , it seems pretty damn clear to my team and me that bittorrent is here to stay and will be playing a major role in the future of content distribution .
This is true irrespective of what the current powers - that - be want .
We 're sort of confused as to why more content creators do n't get this and adapt , but I 'm betting they eventually will .
Given below are download links and other resources related to Self Helpless .
By all means , download it , watch it and share it with your friends :)

The Portland chapter of the Church of Scientology this month purchased the Sherlock Building , where it plans to move .
But something about the location of the building sticks out :
It ’s across the street from a strip club .
Namely , it ’s across the street from a male nude strip club called Silverado .
The club is ostensibly gay ( a rainbow flag hangs outside its door ) , but straight women also go there .
Not to blanket statement all religious organizations , but I doubt many of them would be willing to set up camp next door to a strip club .
Some liberal ones probably would .
I called the president of the Portland chapter of Scientology , the Rev. Steven Crandell , to see if he was concerned about the strip club being so close .
“ If you look around in that neighborhood , it is Old Town and it is what it is , ” Crandell said .
“ Our hope is as various things happen in the neighborhood , we will bring good things to neighborhood . ”
I asked him if he meant stripping was a bad thing , to which he said , “ I do n’t think it ’s what you ’d want your daughter to do . ”
( I reminded him that in this case , it would be your son . )
“ But you have to respect the laws of the land , ” he said .
He did n’t give a clear stance on where the Church of Scientology stood on stripping , but he did say the church has “ a non-religious moral code called The Way to Happiness . ”
You can find more information about it at scientology.org .
Crandell told me he has lived in Portland all his life , and the church has a mission for social change .
“ What you ’d hope would happen is – not through a militant presence – but that through your own philosophical views that kind of stuff ( strip clubs ) would dissipate , ” he said .
As far as homosexuality goes , the Church of Scientology has been criticized in the past for homophobia because of its founder ’s views .
The founder , L. Ron Hubbard , classified it as an illness or sexual perversion .
But the present day church says it does not dictate sexual preferences .
A report from the church in 2005 says :
The Church of Scientology does not dictate sexual preferences .
Scientology is a practical method of improving conditions in life and works to increase a person ’s abilities , give higher IQ and better reaction time , greater ability to solve his problems in life – things of this nature .
What do those at Silverado think about this ?
When asked what he thought of the church moving in , a man who answered the phone at Silverado said , “ Does n’t bother me as long as they mind their own business .
We were here before them . ”

Ferrari announced on Wednesday morning that it has extended its contract with Felipe Massa , who will stay on at the team at least until the end of the 2012 season .
Massa has been with the Italian squad since the 2001 season and his contract was expiring at the end of this year .
The new deal means Ferrari will have an unchanged driver line - up for the next two years , with Fernando Alonso also contracted to the Maranello outfit .
" I am happy to be given the opportunity to drive for Ferrari for a further two seasons , " said Massa .
" Throughout my entire Formula 1 career , I have always raced with an engine made in Maranello and it is a matter of pride for me to be able to continue working with a team that I regard as a second family . "
Massa has competed in 69 grands prix for Ferrari , having won 11 races , 30 podiums and 15 pole positions .
" Felipe has been part of Ferrari for almost a decade and together with us , he has grown as a driver and as a man , going through some very difficult times as well as giving us moments of great happiness , " said team boss Stefano Domenicali .
" We wanted to show proof of stability for the future , believing in the worth of a driver pairing that is without equal in terms of talent , speed and its ability to work together for the good of the team . "
The announcement comes just two days after Red Bull confirmed Mark Webber 's new contract .
Both Webber and Renault 's Robert Kubica had been linked with Massa 's drive .

Internet connectivity has lately been sluggish for many users ( esp. in India ) .
I have been using BSNL and packet loss , Automatic disconnection are very common problems I face .
In this post , I am going to outline some measures you can take to make the most of your Internet connection .
Here are my 5 Tips to make your I.S.P service better .
Get a Better DNS Server Reboot Your Router Use C- Cleaner Upgrade your Router ’s Firmware Check for Hidden Users
These 5
Tips will definitely help you to make your I.S.P ’s service better , probably the best .
# 1. Get a Better DNS Server
DNS is a critical component of how things are located on the Internet , our ISPs DNS servers are usually very basic and do not provide additional security .
Using a Public DNS server like OpenDNS , Google DNS will make your Internet connection stable by at least 20 % than it currently is .
Here are a few instructions on setting up a public DNS on your computer .
[ ad # Google Adsense 468 ]
Go to Start -> Run -> and type in ‘ ncpa.cpl ’ Right Click on your Active Internet Connection and choose properties .
( If UAC asks for credentials , give continue ) Double Click ‘ Internet Protocol Version 4 ’
You should now be able to see the Internet Protocol Version 4 properties .
Click the Check Box ‘ Use the following DNS server addresses ’
Under Preferred DNS server enter 208.67.222.222 and under Alternative DNS enter 208.67.220.220 Click
Okay wherever applicable
Your computer is now assigned to use a public DNS server now .
Restart it and feel the change .
# 2. Reboot Your Router
This might be of no logic , but it seems to work for me .
Restart your Router at least once a day ( or whenever problem persists ) .
If you normally turn it off at night and start it the next morning , you do n’t have to reboot .
# 3 . Use C- Cleaner
Problems with Internet connectivity always need not be with your ISP .
Your computer ’s Registry / Temp Files could become full and reduce your computer ’s performance indirectly affecting your Internet experience .
Clean your computer with C - Cleaner at least once a week to keep your computer up and running also defrag your computer once in a while .
Do make sure that you use a modern browser and not an ancient artifact like Internet Explorer 6 .
Download CCleaner
Here
# 4 . Upgrade your Router ’s Firmware
Upgrading your Router ’s Firmware seems to solve the problem for many .
If you are a BSNL user , you might be getting redirected to a site to update your firmware often .
Visit your Router ’s Manufacturer website for more details .
# 5 . Check for Hidden Users
This does n’t always happen , but if you have a WLAN Router it is possible for users outside your premises to access the Internet from your access point , if that ’s the case they might be eating up your bandwidth which will result in sluggish internet on your computer .
You can prevent this by changing your key to the access point every fortnight and using the strongest encryption method supported by your Router ( usually WPA2 , etc ) .

Antivirus Programs
So who noticed the time never changed on the computer ?
Alt - Text : I need to install a program that protects against the passive aggressiveness of trial antivirus software .
According to Tom Gulitti of the Bergen Record , Devils general manager Lou Lamoriello confirmed he sent one - year offers to potential restricted free agents David Clarkson , Mark Fraser , Rod Pelley and Tyler Eckford .
Any restricted free agent not given an offer by 5 p.m. yesterday would become free agents on July 1 .
The Devils ’ also sent qualifying offers to Patrick Davis and Olivier Magnan - Grenier .
The team decided not to make offers to Brad Snetsinger and Myles Stoez .
Lamoriello expects to re-sign Stoez .
***************
The biggest name on this list is Clarkson .
Lamoriello has made it a priority to re-sign the young winger , and I ’ve debated what Clarkson ’s value , in dollars , would be to the team .
I think he ’ll end up pushing seven figures , possibly eclipsing $ 2 million per year .
Fraser and Pelley are more of a mystery .
Fraser , who played in 61 of the team ’s games this season , gave the Devils solid production night in and night out .
Not known for his goal - scoring , Fraser scored three goals – all against the Pittsburgh Penguins – and also tallied three assists .
With Mike Mottau potentially leaving via free agency , it ’s possible Fraser can receive a slight bonus and a one - way contract .
Pelley , who appeared in 64 games , has tried to find a regular spot with the Devils ’ for the past two seasons .
He ’ll have to compete for a spot , but I ’d be surprised if he was n’t given a one - way contract .
Eckford , Davis and Magnan - Grenier will probably be given two - way contracts .
All three had limited NHL experience this season , but Eckford is expected to contest for a spot on the Devils ’ blue line this season .
Davis and Magnan - Grenier will probably stick around Albany .
There was a discussion on the ADUG list recently about Initialization sections .
During the discussion I mentioned a technique for stepping through all the Initialization and Finalization sections in your project .

Get the Recipe Greek - American Lamb Gyros
Greek - American style Lamb Gyros
This way to Grecian delight :
Here 's the recipe ! »
One of my earliest memories as a New York kid in the 1980s was when the Greek - owned pizza shop down the street first put up a poster featuring an attractive woman eating a Kronos - brand gyros sandwich .
I could n't get the image out of my head .
It was either the dark , alluring Mediterranean eyebrows combined with that come - hither glint in the eye all seductively enveloped in the soft golden 80s hairdo .

Or it was the juicy , alluring strips of pressed - and - formed crispy salty meat combined with that come - hither dollop of creamy yogurt sauce all seductively wrapped in the soft golden pita .
Since then , I 've been fortunate enough to have the opportunity to rigorously sample both women and gyros , and can safely say , it was the gyros that did it for me .
Now , before I go any further , I want to clarify by saying that I 'm not talking authentic Greek gyros here .
I 'm talking Greek - American gyros .
Greek - American gyros employ the same vertical rotisserie method of cooking as authentic Greek gyros , and both come served in rich , fluffy pita bread * with a yogurt - based sauce , tomatoes , and onions , but that 's where the similarities end .
Unlike Greek gyros , which are usually made with whole pieces of thinly - sliced marinated pork skewered in a large stack on the rotisserie before being cooked and shaved , Greek - American gyros are made with a large , sausage - like cone of seasoned minced lamb and beef .
* not the thin type with the pocket , unless you are in Cyprus where they do everything funny )
As great as the real deal is , in all honesty , I prefer the Greek - American style .
When properly cooked , the thinly shaved pieces of meat offer a sublime mixture of textures .
Crispy , salty edges , and moist , tender areas that have the same satisfyingly resilient texture that a good hot dog has .
My goal this week was to replicate ( and improve ! ) the Greek - American style .
Making Gyros Without a Rotisserie
There are two problems with gyros at home .
First is getting the texture of the meat mixture right .
That elusive bouncy - yet - tender bit is not easy to achieve .
The second problem , of course , is that despite watching hours of infomercials for the Ronco Showtime Rotisserie , I never bucked up with my four easy payments of $ 39.95 .
I 'd need to find an alternate way to cook the meat .
I started by looking to a couple of my favorite sources for existing recipes .
Alton Brown 's recipe requires you to puree a mixture of meat and seasonings in a food processor before cooking it meatloaf - style in a loaf pan , followed by compressing it with a brick .
I tried this , and was frankly unimpressed with the results .
While the internal texture was good , the meat ended up stewing in a pool of its own juices in the pan , coming out with a grey , boiled - looking exterior and not a hint of crispiness .
It was also relatively dry .
No thanks .
Cook 's Illustrated takes a different approach by adding a seasoned pita - bread panade to their ground meat before forming it into little patties that then get pan-fried .
They come out exactly as expected : little patties of pan - fried meat with the texture of meatballs .
The results are so vastly different from the real deal that my brain had to work overtime trying to convince my mouth that it was eating gyros ( they also serve theirs in a pocket pita with feta cheese .
I know .
Weird ) .
Back to the drawing board .
I figured , since a Greek - American gyro is essentially a gigantic sausage , my best bet for success was to think of the meat in these terms , and that means controlling three vital elements : salt , fat , and temperature .
A Pinch of Salt
Far from just being a simple seasoning , salt plays a vital physical role in the texture of meat mixtures .
You can think of meat proteins as tightly wound strings of yarn .
When meat comes into contact with salt , over time , the salt acts to dissolve the proteins , causing the ends of the strands to fray out .
These frayed ends can then easily become tangled up with each other , creating a semi - solid matrix .
The result is a mixture that retains resilience once cooked .
Now for some things , like hamburgers , for instance , this is a bad thing .
I want my burger to be fall - apart - tender in my mouth .
But for a sausage , this texture is desirable .
Texture is not the only thing that the meat protein matrix enhances — it also helps to trap in both moisture and fat , resulting in a juicier , tastier sausage .
So how come Alton Brown 's recipe , which contains plenty of salt , still exuded juices as it cooked ?
Turns out that when it comes to salt , time is just as important as quantity .
The two half loaves pictured below were made with the exact same recipe .
The only difference is that I salted the meat on the left two hours before pureeing it in the food processor .
The difference in retained juices is dramatic :
I poured off and collected those juices in cups and found that the meat salted for two hours had lost only about 20 % of the juices that the one salted immediately beforehand had lost , and when tasted side - by - side , the improved moisture level of the pre-salted meat was undeniable .
Just to completely drive the point home , I tried cooking one loaf with absolutely no salt added to it .
Even before cooking , there was a drastic difference in texture .
While the salted meat stuck firmly to itself in a tight ball , the unsalted meat was messy — mushy even .
Upon baking , it released a torrent of juices , along with a mass of pale brown , congealed , jelly - like proteins .
Icky .
As gross as the contents of the cup below look , this is actually all stuff that I want to stay inside the meat .
In addition to just salting , mechanical mixing is absolutely necessary for the proper texture .
Mixing the salted meat by hand just did n't cut it — the meat remained too mealy .
Whipping it with the paddle attachment of a stand mixer worked better , but I found the optimum texture was to use Alton Brown 's method : completely puree the meat in a food processor until it achieves a paste - like consistency .
It 's not pretty while you 're working with it , but the end results are outstanding .
As for fat content , I wanted to bump mine up a bit , and adding a few slices of bacon to the lamb mixture was the way to do it .
I know , I know .
Adding bacon to anything these days seems like a cliché .
All I can say is , in the end , the bacon flavor does n't come through — it 's inclusion has the biggest impact on moisture level and texture ( after all , bacon has been cured by extensive salting — exactly what we want when it comes to achieving the right sausage - like texture ) .
Temperature Matters
Has anyone else noticed that when it comes to sausages , oftentimes , the large nationwide brands have significantly better texture than the ones that come from small - scale artisan - butchers ?
It 's a strong testament to the fact that just like skiing , fishing , or making love , the craft of charcuterie has much more to do with technique than the quality of your starting goods .
You could begin with the greatest meat in the world , but if it 's not salted and mixed properly , your sausage will end up crumbly , dry , and / or mealy .
The other factor that can deeply affect the outcome is temperature .
The following two mixtures were made with the exact same ingredients .
The only difference was that on the one in the right , I kept my meat chilled in the fridge at 38 °F until just before pureeing it , whereas the one on the left was allowed to sit at room temperature and came all the way up to 58 °F before I pureed it .
Astounding , is n't it ?
While the one on the right stayed tight and compact , the one on the left broke apart as it cooked , the fat leaking out , and turning mealy .
It 's all about emulsions .
When pureeing , if all goes well — your solid pieces of fat will get chopped up into tiny pieces that are then suspended within the matrix formed by the protein in the meat — even after it 's cooked .
Let your mixture get too hot , and rather than chopping , your fat ends up melting and smearing , preventing the proteins from forming a tight matrix , and refusing to form a stable emulsion with the meat .
The result is dry , grainy , and all around unpleasant .
Finally , just like a solid piece of meat , the hotter you cook sausage , the more moisture it will expel .
So for optimum juiciness , it 's best to cook the gyro meat at a relatively low - temperature ( say 300 °F ) , and just until it reaches 165 - degrees internally .
So to sum , the four steps for perfect sausage :
Salt your meat in advance and mix thoroughly .
Make sure there 's enough fat .
Keep your meat well - chilled while working with it .
Do n't overcook it
Next up : flavoring
Flavor Fix
The Kronos website indicates that the classic Greek - American gyro meat is made with a mixture of 85 % beef and 15 % lamb .
I do n't know about you , but I prefer to keep my shopping list as minimal as possible .
Since I love lamb , I saw no reason not to make my own gyros our of 100 % lamb meat .
As for seasoning , a 2 % addition of salt ( the standard amount for a sausage ) was necessary , along with a little kick of black pepper .
While some recipes contain a myriad of warm spices and aromatics , I found that all the meat needed was a bit of fresh oregano , some onion , and garlic .
Adding the flavorings directly to the food processor as I pureed the meat made the process a snap .
Getting Crispy
Now that I had my flavoring and texture just right , only one thing remained : replicating the crispy bits that you get with a vertical rotisserie .
At first thought , it seemed like the best answer is to simply broil the loaf of gyro meat until the entire outside is crispy — like a small version of the real deal .
The problem with that is that although the outside gets crispy , you 're still left with an expanse of un-crisped bits on the inside .
With a real gyro , the entire outer surface of the large meat cone gets crisped .
The cook slices the crisp bits off the outside , exposing the next layer of meat to then get crisped - up .
What this means is that in a good restaurant sandwich , your sandwich has a very high percentage of crispy bits , and you certainly do n't get any of the completely soft inner parts .
To replicate that , my goal should be to increase the ratio of crisp - bits - to - soft - bits .
The solution was surprisingly easy .
Rather than broil the whole loaf , I first sliced it into 1/8th to 1/4 - inch thick pieces before laying them flat on a sheet tray and broiling the whole thing .
The tray emerged from the oven a beautiful expanse of sizzling , brown , crusty surfaces .
Grecian delight , indeed !
What 's best about this method is that you can easily cook the whole loaf ahead of time and keep it in the refrigerator .
Then whenever you 'd like a sandwich , simply slice some pieces off the end of the loaf , and crisp them up under the broiler for a couple of minutes .
Even a toaster oven works fabulously for this .
I was able to make a hot gyros lunch for myself and my wife ( who hates tomatoes and cucumber but love lamb ) yesterday in under ten minutes start to finish .
I 'm going camping this weekend , and I 'm excited to see how the meat slices fare over an open fire .
My guess is delicious .
Finishing It Off
While tzatziki — a garlicky yogurt and cucumber based - sauce — might be the topping for traditional Greek gyros , Greek - American establishments tend to favor a sauce made with a creamy mixture of yogurt , mayo , garlic , and parsley .
I like this sauce too , along with a few dashes of hot sauce .
The only other elements are thinly sliced onions , some chopped fresh tomatoes , and a diced cucumber or two .
Of course , just like coke tastes better out of an aluminum can , a gyro taste better when you wrap it in foil and eat it with your hands .
Seriously .
Try it .

DESTIN , Fla .  Dedra Barker raised her hand and took the mood of the room from somber to tearful .
At a meeting last month for residents of Destin to learn about filing claims against BP , Ms. Barker ’s voice quavered as she asked about her options .
As general manager of a small business that rents a dozen vacation homes in town , she was seeing cancellations even though the town ’s white beaches were still unspoiled .
“ I live week to week , ” she said .
“ What do I do in the next week or two , when I ca n’t do my job and ca n’t pay my mortgage ?
Do I live in my car with my 12 - year - old daughter ? ”
The company she works for , Beach Reunion , caters to family reunions and weddings , with a dozen houses that sleep as many as 30 people and can cost $ 8,000 a week .
Normally at this time of year , each home would be packed and the business would be booking reservations for fall weddings .
“ Our phones have quit ringing , ” Ms. Barker said .
Ms. Barker ’s full - time salary of $ 750 a week , with bonuses , has been whittled to an hourly wage that leaves her take - home pay at less than $ 160 a week .

" They built 12 water gates at the mouth of the drain , which help block rising water during the rainy season .
When the river level is lower than the gate , the water from the drainage system flows out , but if the water outside the city rises , the gates snap shut to prevent any of it coming in , " he explained .
“ What is undoubtedly true is that we did not have the tools you would want in your tool kit , ” he told The Financial Times in an interview published Thursday .
It is “ an entirely fair criticism , ” he said , to fault the company for not being fully prepared for a leak one mile below the surface of the gulf .
In the wake of the disastrous 1989 Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska , he said , BP and other oil companies prepared intricate plans to contain oil on the surface of the water .
But BP did not have all the equipment it should have had to stanch a deepwater leak like the one in the gulf .
It will have to find ways to manage such “ low - probability , high - impact ” risks in the future , he said .
The announcement that the riser had been cut was a rare glimmer of positive news
The operation had hit a snag on Wednesday when the saw became stuck .
The riser it was trying to cut is a mile - long pipe that once ran from the wellhead up to the drilling rig , and now lies snaking along the seabed .
The technician involved in the effort said the wire saw had cut less than halfway through the riser when it stopped being effective .
The saw was freed later Wednesday afternoon , but officials then decided to use the shear instead .
The shear , about 20 feet long and nearly 10 feet high , was used to make an earlier cut in the riser about 50 feet away .
Because the cut it made on Thursday was not as clean as the wire saw would have made , the containment cap will have to be modified .
The technician said he still expected the cap to be in place by Thursday .
The technician , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment on the work , said it appeared that the saw had been dulled by material inside the riser  including , perhaps , some of the objects pumped into the well during the failed “ top kill " procedure last week .
The gushing well , 5,000 feet below the gulf ’s surface , might not be stanched permanently until mid-August , when BP is expected to complete the first of two relief wells that will allow the stricken well to be plugged with cement .
Admiral Allen said on Thursday that that effort was ahead of schedule .
Admiral Allen also announced that he had approved a request by the governor of Louisiana , Bobby Jindal , to build five additional sand - barrier islands along the coast to protect sensitive inlets from the spreading oil , and that BP would pay for them .
BP said on Thursday that the project would cost about $ 360 million , on top of the $ 990 million it has already spent so far on the cleanup and on paying claims made by people and companies who have been hurt by the spill .
Slicks of oil were edging closer to the white sand beaches of the Florida Panhandle on Thursday , and emergency workers hurried to link up chains of protective boom , stretching for miles , that could prevent much of the oil from reaching the shore .
The National Center for Atmospheric Research , a nongovernmental research institute based in Colorado , said models showed Thursday that oil could enter the Gulf ’s loop current , go around the tip of Florida and as far north as Cape Hatteras , N.C. According to researchers , oil could threaten East Coast beaches by early July , but they cautioned the models were not a forecast .
I am Gerald Ardito , a doctoral student at Pace University , and have been studying the impact that the XO Laptops and their Sugar software have on the classroom environment of a suburban , 5th grade cohort in The Shape of Disruption .
While my full data analysis is still in progress , the preliminary findings suggest that the use of these laptops and software strongly support these students becoming more independent as learners .
For my research , I defined independent learner in terms of how the students work by themselves or with one another to do what is expected of them .
A little bit about our XO laptop program :
We have about 125 students using the XOs in 5 classrooms .
Each classroom selected 4 - 5 students as a " Tech Team . "
Their job is be classroom " experts , " both in the basics of Sugar and the XOs , as well as in whatever activities the teachers want to use for various classroom projects .
This part of the program has been really successful .
Spontaneous Helping Interactions
From the very beginning , we have observed a ripple effect .
As soon as we introduce to a group of students a new skill or project the same thing happens : the kids that " get it " first , swoop around to show what they have learned , spontaneously , to their fellow students .
We saw this happen over and over again in every classroom .
To quantify this phenomenon , we videotaped a set of XO based classroom sessions , so that we could really look at what I call " helping interactions , " which are occasions when the students either :
ask the teachers for help , ask another student for help , or students offer help to other students without being asked .
What we have seen is that roughly 4 - 5 times as many of these helping interactions take place between students , versus those that take place between teachers and students .
This means that as these fifth graders use the XO 's and Sugar , they spend much less time asking their teachers for help and more time helping one another .
This - effect is greatly enhanced by the teachers ' behavior .
The more the teachers facilitate and empower these student to - student interactions , the better .
This last finding emphasizes that we are looking at a whole classroom ecology , which is too often , I believe , de-emphasized when talking about technology in the classroom .
Again , the entire data analysis for this study is not yet completed , but these initial findings do indeed seem promising .
It ’s mid summer 2010 , and we are already getting trailers for films to be released in 2011 .
Next year is going to start off strong with the release of ‘ The Green Hornet ’ .
Seth Rogen , Cameron Diaz , Christoph Waltz , Jay Chow , Tom Wilkinson , and Edward Furlong .
The film hits theaters January 14 , 2011 .

The Republicans are filibustering a bill that would require political ads to disclose who funded them .
Democrats need only a single vote to break the filibuster , but not a single Republican will support the bill .
This bill is a small thing that would reverse some of the Supreme Court decision ( “ Citizen ’s United “ ) that opened up the floodgates for corporations to spend unlimited amounts of money on political ads , with no accountability .
I do n’t think there could be a clearer signal of who owns the Republican Party , and whose interests they represent .

The article reports that :
McChrystal echoed Bush 's " mission accomplished " PR stunt and claimed a few days later , on the record , that military operations in Iraq were over .
McChrystal either condoned or failed to stop detainee abuse and torture at Camp Nama in Iraq when he was charged with its oversight .
McChrystal was instrumental in the Pat Tillman cover-up .
Shortly after Tillman 's death , he wrote a memo recommending against divulging the findings of internal investigations that showed Tillman 's death was due to friendly fire .
Why ?
Because , as Rolling Stone printed , those findings would cause " public embarrassment " for Bush .
As RS also notes , " Nine days after Tillman 's death , McChrystal was promoted to Major General . "
McChrystal purposely cut the State Dept off at the knees in order to consolidate power for himself :
By far the most crucial – and strained – relationship is between McChrystal and Eikenberry , the U.S. ambassador .
According to those close to the two men , Eikenberry – a retired three - star general who served in Afghanistan in 2002 and 2005 – can't stand that his former subordinate is now calling the shots .
He 's also furious that McChrystal , backed by NATO 's allies , refused to put Eikenberry in the pivotal role of viceroy in Afghanistan , which would have made him the diplomatic equivalent of the general .
The job instead went to British Ambassador Mark Sedwill – a move that effectively increased McChrystal 's influence over diplomacy by shutting out a powerful rival .
" In reality , that position needs to be filled by an American for it to have weight , " says a U.S. official familiar with the negotiations .
McChrystal is a COIN man ( explanation below ) .
He is not interested in leaving Afghanistan anytime soon .
And , as a COIN man , McChrystal , as well as other top Pentagon officials , are essentially insurgents at the highest levels within their own government .
To quote the article :
COIN , as the theory is known , is the new gospel of the Pentagon brass , a doctrine that attempts to square the military 's preference for high - tech violence with the demands of fighting protracted wars in failed states .
COIN calls for sending huge numbers of ground troops to not only destroy the enemy , but to live among the civilian population and slowly rebuild , or build from scratch , another nation 's government – a process that even its staunchest advocates admit requires years , if not decades , to achieve .
The theory essentially rebrands the military , expanding its authority ( and its funding ) to encompass the diplomatic and political sides of warfare :
Think the Green Berets as an armed Peace Corps .
In 2006 , after Gen. David Petraeus beta - tested the theory during his " surge " in Iraq , it quickly gained a hardcore following of think - tankers , journalists , military officers and civilian officials .
Nicknamed " COINdinistas " for their cultish zeal , this influential cadre believed the doctrine would be the perfect solution for Afghanistan .
All they needed was a general with enough charisma and political savvy to implement it .
As McChrystal leaned on Obama to ramp up the war , he did it with the same fearlessness he used to track down terrorists in Iraq : Figure out how your enemy operates , be faster and more ruthless than everybody else , then take the fuckers out .
After arriving in Afghanistan last June , the general conducted his own policy review , ordered up by Defense Secretary Robert Gates .
The now - infamous report was leaked to the press , and its conclusion was dire :
If we did n't send another 40,000 troops – swelling the number of U.S. forces in Afghanistan by nearly half – we were in danger of " mission failure . "
The White House was furious .
McChrystal , they felt , was trying to bully Obama , opening him up to charges of being weak on national security unless he did what the general wanted .
It was Obama versus the Pentagon , and the Pentagon was determined to kick the president 's ass .
General McChrystal was most definitely a " Bushie , " and he is , for some stupid reason , strongly backed by Hillary Clinton .
The war in Afghanistan is a pointless money pit with no end in sight and no discernible standard of victory , and both the soldiers on the ground and even McChrystal himself do not deny the likelihood of this reality .
The war in Afghanistan is therefore a huge political - albatross - in - the - making for Obama here at home .
Well , take your pick .
Any of those is more important than a couple of personal remarks , one being a lukewarm disapproval and the other a bad joke by an aide .
This is a perfect example of why we at Daily Kos blast the traditional media so much .
Let 's not fall into the same trap ourselves .

Vice President Joe Biden introduced the Joint Strategic Plan to combat intellectual property theft today .
In his speech Biden declared war on ' pirate ' websites , both foreign and domestic , arguing that piracy is theft and a potential threat to national security .
The United States Government has made up its mind on how to tackle copyright infringement related issues in the coming years .
After having consulted the public and a wide range of experts , the first Joint Strategic Plan of Obama ’s administration to combat intellectual property infringement was unveiled today .
“ Piracy hurts , it hurts our economy , ” was one of the first lines Vice President Joe Biden spoke today , setting the tone for his grim speech .
According to the new plan , piracy is a major threat to the US economy and a global crackdown is needed to save businesses from going bankrupt .
Interestingly , Biden ’s statement stands in contrast with what the Government Accountability Office told US congress earlier this year , as it concluded that there is virtually no evidence for the claimed million dollar losses by the entertainment industry .
“ Lack of data hinders efforts to quantify impacts of counterfeiting and piracy , ” was one of the main conclusions from their report .
In fact , copyright infringements may also benefit the entertainment industries and third parties , the Government Accountability said , adding that piracy could actually benefit the economy .
Nevertheless , Biden said that the US was going to “ lead by example ” and crack down on websites that allow the public to download and share copyrighted works .
In addition , the US will ‘ push ’ foreign governments to do the same in their countries .
Whether this ‘ push ’ would include threats similar to the ones the US made against Sweden over The Pirate Bay was left in the dark .
To top it off the Vice President reiterated the words commonly uttered by pro-copyright lobbyists such as the RIAA and MPAA .
“ Piracy is theft , clean and simple , it ’s smash and grab , ” Biden said , comparing unauthorized downloading to robbing a jewelry store .
Although semantically incorrect , since ‘ theft ’ implies that something is taken away and not copied , the message is clear .
Aside from digital goods the US is also going to crack down on counterfeit products .
According to Biden these may even be a threat to public health or national security , referring to the dramas that could come from soldiers wearing fake Kevlar vests .
On the digital side no websites or file - sharing applications were specifically named by Biden , nor are any listed in the Joint Strategic Plan .
However , we expect that quite a few BitTorrent sites will be targeted , directly or indirectly .
A History of Major Oil Spills
Oil slicks have historically been the most vivid examples of the risks inherent in both oil shipping and offshore drilling .
While the industry has drawn on lessons from each successive spill , advances in extraction techniques present new challenges .
' Equal pay now !
Equal pay now ! " , the chant echoed up to my hotel window in Oslo , as strikers and their supporters marched past the Norwegian parliament .
How could this be ?
Are there strikes even in paradise ?
By most comparative measures , < a href = " http://www.theguardian.com/world/norway " title= " < 00 ad > Norway " > Norway is something close to a paradise on Earth .
Per head of population , it is one of the world 's richest countries .
It is also one of the most equal .
It has a welfare state that is the envy of social democrats everywhere .
Mothers get 10 months ' maternity leave on full pay .
Last year , the country led the world in the well - respected human development index , which combines measures of life expectancy , literacy and standard of living .
Norway is free , rich , peaceful , safe , healthy and , so far as anyone can measure these things , happy .
Oh yes , and in these times of fiscal hardship , it has a budget surplus of more than 9 % .
And it gives more than 1 % of its gross national income in overseas aid ; so it 's virtuous , too .
No wonder all sorts of people cite it as proof of all sorts of things .
Conservative Eurosceptics like MEP Daniel Hannan and the newly elected , aptly named , MP Mark Reckless hold it up as an example of how well Britain could do if it left the European Union .
" Sovereignty evidently suits the Norwegians , " Hannan wrote a few years ago , suggesting that Britain could fare equally well if it joined Norway in a free - trade area linked to but not part of the EU .
How wise the Norwegians were to vote no to EU membership in two referendums , in 1972 and again in 1994 .
If only we had voted no , we too might be as rich , safe , healthy and happy as they are .
For Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett , by contrast , Norway is an example of the benign effects of equality .
In their influential book The Spirit Level : Why More Equal Societies Almost Always do Better , they several times cite Norway , along with other Scandinavian countries , to illustrate the many good things that come with greater equality : welfare provision , fewer teenage pregnancies , high levels of literacy and social trust .
" In Norway , " they write , " it is not unusual to see cafes with tables and chairs on the pavement and blankets left out for people to use if they feel chilly while having a coffee .
Nobody worries about customers or passers - by stealing the blankets . "
" Humbug , " cry others .
The key to all this is simply oil .
The whole egalitarian social democratic model is actually sustained by the country 's vast exports of oil and gas , the revenues from which it has been stashing away into what is now the world 's second largest sovereign wealth fund .
With a value of around £ 300bn , that will be more than adequate to keep the country 's fewer than 5 million people in the pampered social democratic manner to which they are accustomed .
If the fund goes on growing as it has been , it will even – uniquely in Europe – almost cover the future pension obligations for an ageing population .
So , according to these hard - nosed hydrocarbonists , the only way you can continue to enjoy such an old old - fashioned statist model of social democracy is to " drill , baby , drill " .
Norwegian happiness is , to so speak , paid for by global warming .
Or then again , perhaps the key to Norway 's success is just being , well , Norwegian .
Maybe it is their unique traditions of sturdy self - reliance , hard work and community pulling together , celebrated in history and legend , with imaginative reference back to the Vikings .
After all , the country was doing quite well with its exports of fish , timber and manufactured goods , and its shipping industry , even before it struck oil in the 1960s .
Marvelling at the functional beauty of the Viking ships in the Oslo museum , it is easy enough to imagine a narrative of successful national exceptionalism .
The Scandinavian Airlines plane on which we flew back from Oslo was called The Peaceful Viking .
I know far too little about Norway to judge what is true or false in any of these versions – and what is missing from all of them .
But Norway – or perhaps I should say " Norway " – is a good illustration of the danger of drawing too - simple lessons from the experience of other countries , or of projecting on to them lessons you want to draw for your own .
Norway is outside the EU , Norway is rich and happy ; ergo , leave the EU , and you , too , will be rich and happy .
Often you end up falling into the old fallacy of confusing correlation with cause .
Some years ago , people argued for a big expansion of the number of students in higher education in Britain .
They pointed to Germany .
It had more students in higher education , they said ; Germany was doing well economically .
But the sheer number of students in higher education had very little to do with Germany 's economic success .
The spread of the Massenuni , the mass university , did however have quite a lot to do with the way Germany 's universities were sliding down the international league tables , and actually impelled some of their brightest students to come and study in Britain .
What Britain should have emulated was Germany 's historic focus on high standards of technical education , at all levels .
That does help to explain why Germany continues to make things – whether cars , dishwashers or machine tools – that other people want to buy .
So the point is not that you can't learn from other countries ' experience .
The point is to learn the right lessons .
Even then , you need a detailed , granular understanding of how any particular tool or element will fit into your own national mix .
Charter schools in New York may have something to teach those who wish to develop academies in London , but the context is very different .
By the time it reached eastern Europe , the privatisation pioneered by Margaret Thatcher resulted in the empowerment of old communists – not what she had in mind at all .
While I was thinking about these traps of translation or imitation , another demonstration pulled up under my Oslo hotel window , also on its way to the parliament .
It was much smaller and messier , without the union stewards , and at first I could n't catch the chant .
Then I made it out : " Boycott Israel , Free Palestina ! "
The night before , Israel had attacked the aid flotilla to Gaza .
So far as I could see , the police turned up only after the demonstration had moved on .
So even distant , fortunate Norway is not entirely immune from the shockwaves of world politics .
It has struggled , like most European countries , to integrate its growing population of Muslim faith or origin .
It depends on European markets to take its exports .
Its massive national pension fund has to be invested somewhere , so it also depends on the performance of global stock markets .
If things go really pear - shaped in the rest of Europe , Norway may yet face a reverse wave of modern Vikings – " peaceful Vikings " , to be sure – coming to look for work and welfare on those happier northern shores .
I 'm told EU citizens can go and live in Norway for up to three months while job - hunting .
Tempted , anyone ?
What happens if your state government shuts down ?
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
State budgets are so squeezed that some governors are threatening to shut down state operations if lawmakers can't address massive spending shortfalls .
States are facing the threat of shutdowns because of the dismal condition of their finances .
Governors and lawmakers have been reluctant to make deep and unappealing cuts , particularly to education , health and social services , but have also been loath to raise taxes .
" We 're in an intractable fiscal situation at the state level , " said Sujit CanagaRetna , senior fiscal analyst at the Council of State Governments .
If they can't come to an agreement , the governor may raise the specter of a shutdown either to kick start budget negotiations or to signal that the state cannot continue operating without a new fiscal plan .
New York came close to shuttering state services on Monday before lawmakers passed a weeklong emergency spending plan .
The Empire State has been operating without an annual budget since April while officials contend with closing a $ 9 billion deficit .
Next door , New Jersey 's governor mentioned the " s " word late last week .
Gov. Chris Christie asked his cabinet on Friday to prepare for the possibility of a shutdown if he and lawmakers can't come to terms on a budget for fiscal 2011 , which starts July 1 .
And the governors of Kentucky and Minnesota warned of possible government shutdowns earlier this spring , but they did not come to pass .
What would close
Each state handles a shutdown differently , but emergency and essential services are rarely cut off .
The first thing to go are often state employees , said Steven Kyle , professor of applied economics at Cornell University .
Tens of thousands of workers are told to stay home when states hit a financial impasse .
The same would likely happen in New York , which has not suffered a shutdown in recent memory despite having perennially late budgets .
State departments , such as the motor vehicles bureau and lottery , would stop operating , experts said .
Unemployment offices would close and road repairs would idle .
Businesses would not be able to get licenses and parks would be shuttered .
" We would realize it , " said Robert Ward , deputy director of the Rockefeller Institute of Government , based in Albany , N.Y .
" If you are trying to open a business , having the state licensing bureau shut down could be a big deal to you . "
New Jersey 's governor , meanwhile , asked officials to determine the essential activities of their departments in case he and lawmakers do n't agree on ways to cut $ 10 billion out of the Garden State 's budget .
Only a limited number of workers directly related to the " preservation and protection of life , safety and property " would remain on the job , according to Christie 's memo to his cabinet .
A state shutdown would be nothing new for New Jersey residents .
The government shuttered non-essential operations for eight days in 2006 before coming to a budget agreement , according to the National Conference of State Legislatures .
Some 45,000 employees were put on unpaid leave , and Atlantic City 's casinos closed for the first time ever because inspectors were not on hand .
Other states , including Michigan , Minnesota and Pennsylvania , have had partial government shutdowns in recent years .
Though Michigan went dark for only four hours in 2007 , highway rest stops were barricaded , traffic cameras turned off and state parks emptied .
Also , fewer state troopers patrolled the highways during the brief disruption , which temporarily laid off 35,000 of the state 's 53,000 workers .
One of the more dramatic shutdowns took place in Tennessee in 2002 .
The three - day long impasse resulted in the suspension of classes at state universities , the closing of state parks and the ceasing of road construction .
However , essential operations , including highway patrols , public health and child support services and prisons , were not affected .
Municipalities would also take a hit since they would stop receiving state aid during the shutdown .
This could affect schools and social services , which depend on state funding .
Oftentimes , the threat of a shutdown is mainly political gamesmanship , experts said .
Neither governors nor lawmakers want to take such a step , which does not sit well with residents .
It also wreaks havoc on state operations .
" It 's just so costly and disruptive , " said Michael Drewniak , a spokesman for New Jersey 's governor , who believes he and lawmakers will come to a budget agreement before July 1 .
" It 's just not worth the trouble . "
A major association representing ethanol manufacturers is furious that the Environmental Protection Agency has delayed making a decision on whether to allow the ethanol content in gasoline to be increased to 15 percent , from 10 percent .
But those worried that the increase will damage existing engines applauded the agency ’s decision .
The request was made in March 2009 by Growth Energy , an ethanol lobbying group .
Originally a decision by the E.P.A. was expected last December .
However , in December the agency said more study was needed and a decision would come in “ mid-2010 . ”
In a statement released Thursday , the agency said all the necessary tests are not finished and a decision is not expected until this fall .
In response , Growth Energy ’s chief executive officer , Tom Buis , sent an angry letter to President Obama .
“ As you would expect , we find this further delay unacceptable , ” Mr. Buis wrote .
“ The fact that the federal agencies involved here cannot meet their own deadlines — on a decision that means so much to our nation — reinforces a public perception that government bureaucracy does not work in the best interests of the public .
With fossil fuels getting dirtier , costlier and riskier to extract , as we are witnessing with the epic catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico , now is the time we should move on expanding the production and consumption of clean , renewable fuels like ethanol . ”
But associations representing engine - makers applauded the delay .
Their concern has been that increasing the amount of ethanol will damage hundreds of millions of existing engines , ranging from chainsaws to automobiles .
Charles Territo , a spokesman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers , said Friday that the group applauded the agency “ for listening to our concerns and waiting until testing is complete before making a final decision .
Ultimately it must be based on sound science , not political expediency . ”
Kris Kiser , executive vice president of the Outdoor Power Equipment Institute , a trade group , has estimated that a change could damage small engines in everything from chainsaws to weed trimmers .
Mr. Kiser said in an interview that even if the pumps were labeled E15 , “ We are very concerned about the wrong fuel getting into legacy products . ”
But Growth Energy has told the E.P.A. that studies prove E15 will not damage engines and will result in cleaner air while reducing the nation ’s reliance on oil .
Groups doing those studies included the Energy Department , the State of Minnesota , the Renewable Fuels Association , the Rochester Institute of Technology , the Minnesota Center for Automotive Research and Stockholm University in Sweden .
But those assertions have been criticized by others , including Mr. Kiser , who say Growth Energy “ cherry - picked ” the data or misrepresented some statements .
For example , in one document Growth Energy mentions “ Ford ’s endorsement of blends up to E15 . ”
While that statement might be interpreted as suggesting that Ford approves the use of E15 in its vehicles , last year a company spokeswoman , Jennifer Moore , said that was not true .
She said Ford favored the use of biofuels but still had concerns about E15 because not enough research had been done .
Growth Energy has denied any effort to mislead people about the studies .
Glenn Fleishman shares a treat with us :
I was lucky enough to attend the last scheduled table reading ( where a script is read by the voice actors ) for Futurama , the animated cartoon show revived twice now after Fox 's broadcast network failed to kill the show .
Featured at the reading were piles of delicious brain slug cupcakes .
I LOVE THE BRAIN SLUG CUPCAKES , TRY ONE .
The final script is quite hilarious , naturally , and it was a pleasure not just to hear it read in person by the actors , but to watch how much of a family the show is , cast , crew , and their friends and families .
That feeling comes through in the show , which was created by Matt Groening and David " X " Cohen , through whose good offices ( and my dear friend , his sister ) I garnered an invite .
It was especially neat to watch Billy West talk to himself , cycling through Fry , the Professor , Zoidberg , and Zap Branigan , sometimes one right after the other .
Also , John DiMaggio , who voices Bender , is 100 - feet tall , and breathes fire .
At a time when many countries are becoming more critical of Israel 's policies , Canada seems to be moving in the opposite direction .
A general reluctance to engage in open debate about the Palestinian issue is exacerbated by pro-Israel groups ' efforts to shut down discussion and the federal government 's unprecedented penchant for defending Israeli actions .
Since the beginning of 2010 , the federal government has systematically cut funding to Arab - Canadian organisations and to UN relief works in Gaza .
In March , the Ontario provincial legislature issued a unanimous condemnation of Israeli Apartheid Week , while the federal government considered introducing a similar motion .
However , self - censorship reached new heights last month when Toronto 's Pride Committee – which organises one of the world 's largest gay pride celebrations – announced it would be banning use of the term " Israeli apartheid " at the festivities .
Pride week in Toronto is a loud and highly visible public event , with a long tradition of activists linking their own campaigns for sexual rights to other struggles for liberation and social justice ; however , this year the organisers caved in to pressure from pro-Israel groups and Toronto city council .
The main effect of the decision is to bar one group in particular – Queers Against Israeli Apartheid ( QuAIA ) – who have marched in the parade since 2008 .
The reason given is that the phrase " Israeli apartheid " violates Toronto 's anti-discrimination policy .
But when asked , neither Pride Toronto nor Giorgio Mammoliti – the Toronto city councillor mainly involved – could explain in detail what was discriminatory about describing Israel 's privileging of its Jewish citizens over others as a form or racism and apartheid .
" It 's absolutely bizarre the way they are trying to use the language around diversity and inclusiveness to exclude people , " QuAIA activist Tim McCaskell told me .
" It was so 1984 . "
Accompanying the onset of a Canadian McCarthyism dressed up as anti-discrimination , the mainstream left in Canada has been unwilling to take a clear political and moral stance on Palestine .
Instead it has sought the approach of least resistance , trying to appease rather than take a stand against the silencing of Palestinian voices in Canada and Israel .
Writing in NOW Magazine , a progressive Toronto weekly newspaper , news editor Ellie Kirzner contended that Palestinians and their supporters should simply drop the term " apartheid " .
" It 's a vulnerability the movement does n't need , " she wrote .
McCaskell , on the other hand , says QuAIA is bringing the fight against Israeli apartheid to pride because that is what Palestinian LGBT organisations have requested , and because Israel tries to present itself as queer - tolerant in an attempt to distract from its ill - treatment of Palestinians .
The two Palestinian LGBT groups , Aswat and al - Qaws ( both based in Israel ) , issued a joint statement saying : " Pride parades started as political marches , and we firmly believe that solidarity should be with human rights first and foremost . "
They continued :
We believe that as queers , one of the most disadvantaged and oppressed minorities in human societies , we should protest against all forms of oppression and struggle together to promote the rights of minorities and oppressed groups .
As Palestinian queers , our struggle relates to social injustices caused by the discrimination that is deeply rooted in Israel 's policies and practices against the Palestinian people , straight and gay alike ...
Over the past decades , Pride parades around the world have been a platform for queers , not only to increase public awareness for [ LGBT ] rights , but also a platform to promote and defend causes like the feminist struggle , and the fight to end apartheid in South Africa .
Trying to smother this debate in relation to Israel at Toronto pride could easily backfire , according to Ayala Shani , a queer activist with the Boycott , Divestment and Sanctions campaign .
She points out that banning a term will only multiply its use and adds : " We are expecting to see ' Israeli apartheid ' written and spoken all over pride parades around the world , including a parade in Tel Aviv . "
However , with the Canadian mainstream left dodging defence of Palestinians and the country at large continuing its polite silence on the Middle East , Toronto 's establishment may be taking more pride in silencing discussion of Israeli apartheid than even Tel Aviv .

Last - minute legal challenges from pot shop owners and patients seeking temporary restraining orders were denied Friday by Superior Court Judge James Chalfant , paving the way for officials to enforce the long - awaited law that will slash the number of dispensaries to somewhere between 70 and 130 .
Last month , the city attorney 's office mailed more than 430 letters to pot collectives , saying the operations must close by June 7 .
So far , the agency has not received any calls from owners indicating they plan on shutting down .
The only calls have come from landlords indicating businesses have closed or will no longer be open come Monday .
" We definitely get the sense they do n't want to go away , " Assistant City Attorney Asha Greenberg said of the dispensaries .
" They are engaging in a lucrative business .
Who is going to want to walk away from that without a fight ? "
Judge Chalfant rejected requests to stop the ordinance from going into effect , but there were still unresolved issues from a host of lawsuits , including whether it 's discriminatory to allow some dispensaries to stay open while shuttering others .
" The patients who are being discriminated against are not going away , " said attorney Eric Shevin , who represents a group of patients who claim their access to medical marijuana would be severely restricted under the ordinance .
Hundreds of pot shops cropped up across Los Angeles in the past several years , as the City Council wrestled with creating an ordinance with strict guidelines .
Dispensaries that registered before a 2007 moratorium can stay open if they adhere to the new guidelines , which include being 1,000 feet from schools , parks and other public gathering sites .
The dispensaries also must pay more than $ 1,000 in administrative fees .
Violating the ordinance could result in six months in jail and a $ 1,000 fine .
A daily penalty of $ 2,500 also could be assessed for every day a non-qualified collective remained open after Monday .
Felony criminal charges could be filed if it 's shown that dispensaries were profiting by selling pot , which District Attorney Steve Cooley says violates state law .
The city ordinance , however , does provide for cash reimbursements for pot sales .
Greenberg said the city will decide what course to take once police tally how many dispensaries defy the law by remaining open .
Criminal charges are more likely if a large number of pot shops try to stay in business , she said .
" In two weeks we 'll have a better idea of the numbers we are dealing with and the direction our prosecution will take , and whether Los Angeles will be a lot better , " Greenberg said .

BRAIN RULE RUNDOWN
Rule # 1 : Exercise boosts brain power .
The human brain evolved under conditions of almost constant motion .
From this , one might predict that the optimal environment for processing information would include motion .
That is exactly what one finds .
Indeed , the best business meeting would have everyone walking at about 1.8 miles per hour .
Researchers studied two elderly populations that had led different lifestyles , one sedentary and one active .
Cognitive scores were profoundly influenced .
Exercise positively affected executive function , spatial tasks , reaction times and quantitative skills .
So researchers asked :
If the sedentary populations become active , will their cognitive scores go up ?
Yes , it turns out , if the exercise is aerobic .
In four months , executive functions vastly improve ; longer , and memory scores improve as well .
Exercise improves cognition for two reasons :
Created by Codey Wilson and his elite step team of volunteers .
The video is an EXAGGERATED act of a possible future military that is open to any sexual preference .
Please do n't try to cause us any problems .
We 're just a few good guys trying to enjoy ourselves and get this deployment over with .
No one in the video is gay ... that we know of , nor am I .
Sorry guys .
Not that there is anything wrong with that !
( political correctness ) I am NOT saying it IS ok to be gay in the military .
I am not saying it 's NOT OK .
As a wanna be student actor and film maker I was forced to release this early due to our friend in Afghans lip sinked music video .
I have to admit I feel a bit more creative but he has my respect .
Making these things around here is really scary because we 're taking major risks .
You know you love it .
Enjoy it .
Spread it .
Lastly , ignore the copy cats that will soon follow and keep your taste for original creativity .
If you see anyone using this video for the wrong reasons please help out Thanks for watching .
Next one is coming out in two weeks when I get home !
US Soldiers stationed in Afghanistan decided to put their own spin on the " Do n't Ask , Don't Tell " debate heating up back home .
To be fair , they are not engaging in the debate .
Soldiers are supposed to be apolitical .
And they make that very clear .
But this video begs to be read in the context of the larger social policy debate back home .
At the end , there is a screen shot that says , " ... Just be honest with yourself .
You loved it ! " I did love it .
It is nice to see that our soldiers are able to find a way to have fun in such a terrible situation .
Particularly at the expense of those who have not come to terms with reality -- our soldiers are more than capable of handling the reality of serving with gay and lesbian service members .
They have already moved on to humor .
Some in our leadership need to remember , our soldiers have been serving with openly gay men and women for years .
Our allied forces have been allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly for the entire duration of the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars .
Thank you for the laugh guys .
Good luck over there .
I hope you make it home safely .

This is the English translation of the principle piece of evidence in an anti-terrorism case in France .
Nine people were arrested in 2008 , mostly in the village of Tarnac , under the charge of sabotaging overhead electrical lines on the French railways .
With only little circumstantial evidence available , the French Interior Minister has associated them with a ultra - left insurrectionary movement and singled out this book as a “ manual for terrorism . ”
It is not that , but is it a manual for revolution ?
There is something I like to call “ Daily - Mail - Land ” , in which “ political correctness ” has gone mad , an Englishman ’s castle has been squatted by gay asylum seekers in burqas claiming benefits from “ our ” apparently “ generous ” benefits system while , simultaneously , stealing “ our ” jobs and all the while New Labour and their caviar quaffing and Champaign guzzling public sector workers have organised legions of dole scroungers to stealth - tax “ middle ” England and ban them flying the “ racist ” English flag .
Suffice to say , any relation to reality is purely co-incidental .
The left has its own version of this : “ Situ- Autonomist - Land . ”
Here , we are always just moments from social revolution .
The masses are not only alienated and exploited , they consciously know it and act on that knowledge .
Workers are just dying to go on strike and if they do n’t then it ’s the union - bureaucrats holding them back .
If they cross picket lines , it is because the Labour movement is too moderate and they are simply showing their contempt for safe reforms .
Every development , no matter how apparently bad , is really ( when looked closely enough ) a good sign and an expression of proletarian consciousness .
Again , reality is a passing acquaintance .
“ The Coming Insurrection ” is firmly part of that world .
While I would like to think fellow workers crossing my picket lines was really an expression of their ( unconscious ) contempt for reformism , a more realistic assessment would suggest 30 years of ruling - class victories ( neo-liberalism ) have eroded even basic levels of class consciousness .
While things are somewhat different in France , reading “ The Coming Insurrection ” on my way to work made me wonder at times whether it was an elaborate hoax or satire .
One thing is true , it does not describe the world as I know it .
While this may be a reflection on me , I doubt it .
I ’m not sure that many people would recognise the world it describes .
But perhaps I ’m just past it , as the text proclaims there “ remains scarcely any doubt that youth will be the first to savagely confront power . ” ( 17 ) Still , my age does allow me to remember that “ I AM WHAT I AM ” is not “ marketing ’s latest offering to the world , ” the “ final stage ” in its development ( 29 ) but a hit - single from the early 80s and , half a century before , Popeye ’s catchphrase .
To proclaim this as “ a military campaign , a war cry directed against everything that exists between being ” ( 32 ) seems to be clutching at straws , seeking meaning in the meaningless .
Not the best way to start a book on the current crisis we face .
Still , good points are often made , just as the striking and imaginative turn of phrase we come to expect of social protest in France is exercised .
They note that work under capitalism is based on both exploitation and participation ( 45 ) something all too often glossed over .
On ecology , it correctly notes that capitalists “ hired our parents to destroy this world , and now they ’d like to put us to work rebuilding it , and – to add insult to injury – at a profit ” ( 75 - 6 )
So bits and pieces , rarely developed , are of interest but over all the work is lacking in real analysis and strategy .
No attempt is made to synthesis the proclamation that work has developed to the level “ that they have almost reduced to zero the quantity of living labour necessary in the manufacture of any product ” by means of , amongst others , “ outsourcing ” and rising productivity .
( 46 ) Work is still being done , just in other countries .
As for raising productivity , they seem to forget they denounced that as the cause of “ [ s] ickness , fatigue , depression ” so making France “ the land of anxiety pills . . . the paradise of anti-depressants , the Mecca of neurosis . ” ( 33 ) Still , we are “ living the paradox of a society of workers without work ” ( 46 ) so are we getting stressed being over - worked to produce things we do n’t really need .
Yet is this that new ?
Much labour under capitalism has been wasteful , related purely to the needs of the profit system , rather than meeting human needs .
Similarly , the “ flexible , undifferentiated workforce ” hardly produces “ the worker who is no longer a worker , who no longer has a trade ” ( the temp ) ( 48 ) but rather the 19th century wage - slave returned .
Is there a quantitative difference to suggest a new era and so radically new tactics and strategies ?
Destruction is a theme of the book .
Thus a “ day will come when ” Paris and “ its horrible concretion of power will lie in majestic ruins , but it will be at the end of a process that will be far more advanced everywhere else . ”
( 132 ) It talks about “ sabotaging the social machine ” and ponder “ [ h ] ow can a TGV line or an electrical network be rendered useless ? ”
( 112 ) That sort of irresponsible rhetoric will , undoubtedly , be quoted by the Interior Minister but that does not stop it being stupid .
What of the people dependent on said train - line and electricity ?
Unlike a strike , such infrastructure cannot be easily repaired once destroyed .
This is a recurring theme , ultra - revolutionary rhetoric ( with the occasional suggestion which will keep the Interior Minister happy for selective quotes ) and a remarkably reformist and quietist practice .
The book does present the vision of dropping - out and tending your allotment .
It urges us to organise “ apprenticeship , and for multiple , massive experiments ” including “ understand plankton biology ” and “ soil composition ; study the way plants interact . ”
( 107 ) Comments like understanding “ plankton biology ” do provoke thoughts of a sophisticated satire .
We also discover that the commune “ needs money ” and that they will “ have their black markets .
They are plenty of hustles ” ( 103 ) Yet people fiddling welfare are less likely to cause trouble simply to avoid the state taking too great an interest in their goings on .
The collective direct action of the Argentine piqueteros they also point to on the same page is the opposite of hustling the system .
That they cannot see this suggests they favour doing something ( “ to no longer wait is . . . to enter into the logic of insurrection ” ( 96 ) ) but this seems more like action for actions sake , with the hope that something positive will come from it .
As a comrade once said in reply to an animal rights activist ’s proclamation that “ thought without action means nothing ” , action without thought means Bar - L ( the prison said activist was in at the time ) .
There is a central paradox of the work .
They demonise organisations and milieus while promoting their own .
They proclaim that we must “ [ f ] lee all milieus .
Each and every milieu is oriented towards the neutralisation of some truth ” as they “ are the old people ’s homes where all revolutionary desires traditionally go to die . ”
( 100 ) Their solution ?
“ Form communes ” ( 101 ) And their communes are , what , exactly ?
Yet another milieu , surely ?
No , apparently , because the commune only “ degenerates into a milieu the moment it loses contact with the truth on which it is founded . ”
( 102 ) Which is nice and vague , as well as sounding deep …
As for organisations , they are “ are n’t needed when people organise themselves . ”
( 122 ) So organisations are not needed until people need them …
And yet their communes do sound like organisations for they “ come into being when people find each other , get on with each other , and decide on a common path . . .
Why should n’t communes proliferate everywhere ?
In every factory , every street , every village , every school .
At long last , the reign of the base committees ! ” ( 101 ) Yet we are also informed that an “ assembly is not a place for decisions but for talk ” and that decisions “ are vital only in emergency situations , where the exercise of democracy is already compromised . ”
( 122 ) So general assemblies are out , until the very next page when the book points to the example of “ the sections of the Paris Commune during the French Revolution ” !
( 123 -4 ) They seem aware of this obvious contradiction , noting that we must seek “ to set aside the fantasy of a General Assembly and replace it with an assembly of presences . ”
( 123 ) What that actually means and how they differ are left to the reader , as is how “ we must commit ourselves to their coordination ” ( 127 ) while the traditional libertarian means of co-ordination , the mandated delegate , is dismissed out of hand ( “ people with mandates are by definition hindered ” ( 123 ) ) .
Yet , who can deny that “ [ e] very wildcat strike is a commune ; every building occupied collectively and on a clear basis is a commune .
The action committees of 1968 were communes ” ?
( 102 ) Or deny that such organs of working class power have general assemblies ( or sections ) , discuss and make decisions , federate and mandate delegates for the coordination of their struggles , and so on ?
To denounce organisation while urging the creation of new organisations is not that convincing , no matter the lovely expressions used .
Is “ fucking it all up ” ( 112 ) really a revolutionary strategy ?
No , it is just a cry of nihilistic alienation at a system which appears to beyond influence , beyond change .
Denouncing everything and postulating the most radical of spontaneous jolts based on pan-destruction and ruins may sound extremely revolutionary but it is just shows that they have no real awareness of how to transform society or how a free world could function .
In the end , this rhetoric is more often than not a disguise for reformist practice ( at best ) or inaction ( at worse ) .
And this is reflected in the book , with wishful thinking about global insurrection sitting side by side with tending your allotment , fiddling welfare and studying the finer points of plankton cultivation .
Revolution does not mean destruction .
It means taking over and transformation , constructive change .
It means recognising where we are now and developing strategies to get to a freer society while recognising , and preparing for , the difficulties social movements ( never mind a social revolution ) will face .
Kropotkin ( correctly ) argued ( in “ The Conquest of Bread ” and elsewhere ) that a social revolution would face economic disruption and would need to face those challenges .
The centralisation and industrialisation of production has continued apace since those days , so it is really not sufficient to glibly suggest “ [ w ] e must start today , in preparation for the days when we ’ll need more than just a symbolic portion of our nourishment and care ” ( 107 ) as provided by allotments and such like .
Yes , “ a blockade is only as effective as the insurgent ’s capacity to supply themselves and to communicate , as effective as the self - organisation of the different communes ” ( 125 ) but the aim must be to spread out the struggle and ensure what can be restarted can be done so quickly ( something difficult to do if you ’ve destroyed key parts of the social infrastructure ) .
Ironically , it proclaims mainstream environmentalism as a means of ensuring “ Voluntary austerity ” ( 77 ) while , at the same time , urging us to acquire “ skills to provide , over time , for one ’s own basic subsistence . . . . it seems pointless to wait any longer . ”
( 125 ) Basic subsistence sounds remarkably austere …
External shocks figure large in the book , as “ the suspension of normality . . . liberate[s ] potentialities for self - organisation unthinkable in other circumstances . ”
( 119 ) That our struggle as a class within capitalism may create such potentialities is not the focus .
Liberation , if it comes , will come as a result of external forces .
Yet this is just the old Marxist focus on capitalist economic breakdown as the motivator for socialism ( which raises the question , if socialism is so wonderful why does it need even more misery to make people want it ? ) .
This is applied to history , as the “ revolutionary workers ’ movement understood it well , and took advantage of the crises of the bourgeois economy to gather strength . ”
( 119 ) Except economic crisis has usually resulted in a massive weakening of labour ’s power .
It is harder to strike facing mass unemployment , as can be seen from the organising drives in America during the 1930s starting over 4 years into the Great Depression .
Unions in the UK have not recovered from the mass unemployment of the early 1980s recession .
They point to the Paris Commune to show “ the unique attraction of the power of fire ” ( 55 ) , apparently forgetting that the burning of Paris was a product of defeat .
Similarly , they point to Genoa in 2001 as a positive example while failing to note that the movement was kicked off the streets by the state .
( 127 ) Is “ harassing passersby in the street ” really the same as “ playing cat and mouse with riot police ” ?
( 38 ) Is it really above reproach and a sign of leftism if you do note the difference ?
Tellingly , the book seems to confuse Sergei Eisenstein ’s film with the actual revolution , proclaiming that “ Winter Palaces still exist but they have been relegated to assaults by tourists rather than revolutionary hordes ” ( 131 ) Yes , it is a cliché that “ Nothing appears less likely than an insurrection , but nothing is more necessary ” ( 96 ) The Russian Revolution broke out shortly after Lenin proclaimed that he would not live to see it .
Yet a riot does not equal an insurrection and the book provides no real clue as to how to go from a riot to ( social ) revolution beyond the vaguest of rhetoric .
Rest assured though : “ The impasse of the present , everywhere in evidence , is everywhere denied . ” ( 28 )
That someone may not be convinced of the evidence does not seem to be entertained .
Over all it just feels like wishful thinking , but written in a stylish French way and full of striking expressions .
The Coming Insurrection

series 1
The offensive by the Congressional Democratic leadership against the Gaza humanitarian aid flotilla has now moved beyond just rhetorical support for the Israeli attack on the unarmed convoy .
Rep. Brad Sherman ( D - CA ) , chair of the House Foreign Relations Committee ’s subcommittee on terrorism , nonproliferation and trade , has called upon U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to prosecute U.S. citizens who were involved or on board the flotilla .
Because the Gaza Strip is currently ruled by Hamas , according the Sherman , any humanitarian aid to the people of that territory is “ clearly an effort to give items of value to a terrorist organization , ” which is prosecutable under the 1996 Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act .
Despite the active support of the humanitarian aid effort by a number of pacifist organizations in the United States and Europe , Sherman insists that the organizers of the flotilla have “ clear terrorist ties , ” dismissing critical analysis of such charges as part of the ideological agenda of “ the liberal media . ”
Sherman also announced he would be working with the Department of Homeland Security to ensure that the more than 700 non-U.S. citizens who took part in the flotilla would be permanently barred from ever entering the United States .
This would include European parliamentarians , Nobel laureates , as well as leading writers , artists , intellectuals , pacifists , and human rights activists , virtually none of whom are in the least bit sympathetic with Hamas or with terrorism .
Given the very real threat of terrorism from Al - Qaeda and other groups against the United States , it is very odd that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democratic Party leaders would choose — out of 255 Democrats in the House of Representatives — a paranoid right - winger like Sherman to chair the critically important terrorism subcommittee .
Rather than focus on the real threats from Al - Qaeda and other dangerous organizations , it appears that Sherman is putting his energy into going after the motley group of Quaker pacifists , left - wing Jews , and other like - minded activists who boarded the ships attempted to bring medicines , school supplies , toys and other humanitarian aid to children of the Gaza Strip .
Indeed , it raises serious questions about whether the Democratic Party Congressional leadership is really concerned about international terrorism or , like the Bush administration , is attempting to use the threat of terrorism as an excuse to suppress nonviolent dissent against the policies of the U.S. government and its rightist allies .
Organizers and endorsers of the flotilla include such reputable American peace groups as Code Pink , Jewish Voice for Peace , Pax Christi , the American Friends Service Committee , Women ’s International League for Peace and Freedom , the Resource Center for Nonviolence , War Resisters League , Women in Black and others .
Supporters of this nonviolent effort to bring humanitarian aid to the people of the Gaza Strip also include such Israeli groups such as Yesh G’vul , Coalition of Women for Peace , New Profile , and the Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions , among others .
Despite this , Rep. Barney Frank ( D - MA ) , insists that these groups are “ pro-Hamas people . ”
Rep. Elliot Engel ( D - NY ) claims that the organizers of the flotilla have “ links to Hamas and reportedly played a role in the attempted Millennium bombing in Los Angeles . ” Rep. Ron Klein D- FL ) insists that the real agenda of these peace and human rights organizations is “ to bolster the terrorist Hamas government in Gaza . ” Rep. Jerrold Nadler ( D - NY ) argues that Israel ’s attack on the unarmed flotilla laden with humanitarian supplies part of an effort to “ defend herself against terrorism . ”
When prominent Democrats — including the head of an influential House subcommittee concerned with national security — begin implying that leading America and Israeli peace groups are linked to terrorism , it is no longer simply an issue of over - heated rhetoric in support of an allied right - wing government , but a McCarthyistic attack on nonviolent dissent .
Indeed , it could only be a matter of time before we see Medea Benjamin , Mitchell Plitnick , and other leading nonviolent activists who have supported the flotilla hauled before Sherman ’s subcommittee regarding these alleged ties to terrorism .
In many respects , however , Israel ’s attack on the unarmed flotilla last weekend could be a “ Kent State moment . ”
At the time of the 1970 shootings , National Guardsmen and police had been killing African - Americans and Hispanics with some regularity for years .
When white middle class students were gunned down on a college campus , however , it woke up a whole new segment of American society , goading them into active resistance .
Similarly , while the Israeli military has been killing Arab civilians for years , now that they have attacked European and American peace activists — with the support of Congressional leaders — it has created a whole new dynamic , one I witnessed personally this past Friday evening , at the annual dinner of the Resource Center for Nonviolence in Santa Cruz , California .
Roughly 150 people gathered in the fellowship hall of a local Congregational Church this past Friday evening , including prominent liberal members of the city council and county board of supervisors , area clergy ( including a local rabbi ) , professors , small businesspeople and other community leaders .
The main speaker was Nomika Zion , founder of kibbutz Migvan in Sderot , Israel , a community which had suffered from relentless bombardment for many months from Qassam rockets fired from the Gaza Strip .
Zion — a leader of the Sderot - based peace group Other Voice , which opposed Israel ’s war on Gaza — argued that it was the ongoing siege of Gaza which was the biggest threat to the security and called for an end of the Israeli blockade RCNV staffperson and former Santa Cruz mayor Scott Kennedy then called on the city to come together to organize a boat to send relief supplies to Gaza Strip in an effort to end the siege , adding that he would write Rep.
Sherman and Attorney General Holder and dare them to investigate and prosecute the hundreds of people in this coastal community who would support such an effort .
Israel ’s rightist government and their allies in the U.S. Congress have clearly miscalculated .
By claiming that the hundreds of dedicated peace and human rights activists on board those ships — most of whom in no way support Hamas or any terrorist group — as supporters of terrorism , they are mobilizing what could become a major backlash .
It is a particularly bad calculation for the Democratic Party , which is going to need the support of the peace and human rights community — a key constituency of the party ’s base — going into the mid-term election this fall .
There are already plans for additional ships to try to run the blockade , most of which will have active participation from nonviolent activists here in the United States .
We ’ll see if Rep. Sherman and other Congressional leaders can stop them .
There is a comic here to celebrate
Wes bursting forth from his cage while Tony actually stayed dry through the night .
Asked to design a fitting repository for a client ’s valuable collection of J.R.R .
Tolkien manuscripts and artifacts , architect Peter Archer went to the source — the fantasy novels that describe the abodes of the diminutive Hobbits .
“ I came back my client and said , ‘ I ’m not going to make this look like Hollywood , ’ ” Archer recalled , choosing to focus instead on a finely - crafted structure embodying a sense of history and tradition .
The site was critical too — and Archer found the perfect one a short walk away from his client ’s main house , where an 18th - century dry - laid wall ran through the property .
“ I thought , would n’t it be wonderful to build the structure into the wall ? ”
Not only did the wall anchor the cottage , but stones from another section were used in the cottages construction .
“ It literally grew out of the site , ” Archer said .
Perhaps stranger things have happened in Tolkien ’s world , but few houses in this one go to such lengths to capture a fictional fantasy in the context of architecture .
Here are some details .

Making Games On The Side : Development In The Real World
By Andrew Webster
Gaming might be a multi-billion dollar industry , but that does n't mean that everyone can eke out a living by making games -- or even that everyone who makes games wants to .
With the rise in popularity and accessibility of smaller , downloadable games , a number of developers are able to make the games they want on the side , in addition to other work .
Some do so with the intention of eventually turning development into a career ; others simply do it for the love .
Somehow , however , they all manage to make the time to create games on top of other responsibilities , from hobbyist developers like Benjamin Rivers to those trying to turn what they love into a career like Jim McGinley and Andy Moore .
Developing Games As A Hobby
Toronto native Benjamin Rivers is a busy man .
In addition to running his own web design company , he also does freelance illustration work , creates and sells independent comic books , and sometimes teaches at the Ontario College of Art & Design .
But despite his clearly busy schedule , Rivers was able to get into the world of game development thanks in large part to Toronto 's active indie development community .
Events like the Artsy Games Incubator and Toronto Game Jam ( better known as TOJam ) , as well as social organizations like the Hand Eye Society , serve as both a learning opportunity and a source of inspiration .
" I would say ( the sense of community ) is extremely important and likely more so than if , say , I was working at an actual developer , because I would have support there , " says Rivers , who recently created a game called Drunken Rampage as an experimental title .
" The Hand Eye Society socials are obviously great because you have the opportunity to show off a game , which is fantastic , being able to share that with other people .
But also just to meet other people and find people who are smarter than you , which is what I found , and being able to ask questions and get technical help , and also just inspiration help , and just figure out what 's going on , and what people are doing . "
Of course , the obvious question is how exactly he is able to find the time to create games in addition to all of the other work he does .
In Rivers ' case , the fact that game development is n't his primary career has actually been beneficial -- it allows him to create at his own pace .
" I guess my main thing is I try never to force it , I do n't try to stress myself out doing it , " he says .
" If I feel like I have something to say or a game that I really want to make , I 'll take the steps to do it , but I 'm not 20 anymore so I do n't really feel like spending 24 hours of my weekend jamming on a game so much .
I do have a wife , so she would n't be too happy with that .
" I try to give myself a whole bunch of limitations : say I can make a game that only uses one button , maybe it's a one - screen game , something that I can realistically do in one weekend and is n't going to require weeks of art production .
And then I sort of work within my own time capabilities and produce something that way , rather than trying to shoehorn a year - long project into a couple of weekends . "
And unlike a lot of developers who hope to one day be able to quit their fulltime jobs in order to dive straight into the world of game development , Rivers is happy where he is , creating games not for financial gain , but simply because its something he enjoys doing .
When it comes to his games , Rivers has no business plan or any real expectations of earning any money .
" I sort of have reluctantly come to grips with the fact that I guess , to be fair , I should call myself a ' hobby developer ' , because I 'm not like a lot of people who actually pour in 60 hours a week to this kind of thing , " he says .
" So that 's probably where I 'll stay . "
Juggling Work and Play
Not everyone is content with being a hobbyist , however .
Jim McGinley , another native Torontonian , has made a career out of building large scale corporate websites .
It 's something he did fulltime for over a decade until his company folded a little over two years ago .
Since then , he 's been doing the same work on a contract basis .
But building websites for the government is n't what McGinley always wanted to do .
After graduating nearly 15 years ago with a degree in computer science , McGinley was unable to find a job in the game industry , which had a much smaller Canadian footprint .
In spite of his inability to find fulltime work as a game programmer , McGinley continued to create small games on the side with the hope of eventually selling one to a web portal like RealArcade or Pogo .
There was little interest , however .
He describes his game Juggling as having been too hardcore for the portal market and too small to be a retail release .
" I had a game but there was no place for it , " he explains .
But McGinley continued to make games , most recently creating IGF 2010 entry Restraining Order , and believes that there are two major factors that allowed him to find the time to develop games while still working a fulltime job .
" One is you 've got to keep the game smaller , " he says .
" There 's no way around that .
So if you look at the games I 've made , if you go to the YouTube videos , they 're very obviously smaller games .
It 's not like you go and say ' Oh , the art is amazing . '
So they 're very small , that 's key .
I think that 's the secret .
" And then the second thing is , if you actually want to do something , you make time for it .
I do n't go out as often with friends , you do n't go see movies .
You do have a lot of free time even with a fulltime job , if you can focus .
You have to basically come home , eat , work on your game .
That 's what I do . "
Like Rivers , McGinley is an active member of the Toronto indie scene , and actually helps organize and run the annual TOJam .
And while he admits that a sense of community can be an incredibly positive thing , he also warns that it has the potential to be a distraction .
" You have to be able to build games without that community , " he says .
" That 's key .
If you need the community to do that , you 're doomed because the community is sort of a distraction .
However , if you 're already able to build games by yourself , having a community around of just people who are either trying to do that or who are interested in games , it just keeps you motivated ...
" What I find on the flip side is people who can't build the games by themselves , if they get involved in the community , what you 'll find is it 's just more of a social outing for them .
Meaning , it 's great , they 'll come out , they 'll talk , they enjoy themselves but they 're not actually getting any games done .
So community is sort of a double - edged sword , meaning if you 're making games by yourself it can help you inspire , if you 're not able to make games by yourself it 's actually more of a distraction . "
Now that he 's working in web development solely on a contract basis , McGinley is using the opportunity to attempt to finally transition into the world of fulltime game development .
This is thanks in large part to the " nest egg " he was able to save up while working his previous job , which gives him the freedom to not have to worry about living expenses ... at least for a little while .
His goal is to start earning money making games within the next two years , and if that does n't happen , he 'll be forced to go back to working fulltime .
At this point , McGinley says he 's working on games about 75 percent of the time , while continuing to take on contract web work the other 25 percent .
Eventually he hopes to do away with the contract work all together , though , due largely to a fear of falling behind the competition .
" Any month you put towards this contract stuff is taking away from you getting better at building games . "
Taking Flight in a Steambird
Andy Moore was able to make just that transition , moving from being a software developer to a fulltime game developer in late 2008 .
Up until then , Moore worked fulltime developing web - based productivity software .
However , he later picked up a part - time job as community manager for the successful Flash game Fantastic Contraption , which spurred his eventual decision to tackle game development as a career .
Moore made what he describes as a " gradual " transition , from his day job to part - time community manager , before finally landing in game development .
He also made some " minimal " contributions to the development of Fantastic Contraption and he says that the key to making the shift a successful one was the ability to sacrifice .
" Despite living in the very - expensive Victoria , British Columbia , I 've managed to keep my expenses very low , " Moore explains .
" I did n't own a vehicle and rarely went out to eat or to see movies or anything like that .
I really just hunkered down and eliminated all the expenses I could from my life .
I sold off most of my possessions ; I even got rid of my phone .
" I guess it was pretty easy for me because I enjoy simplicity and keeping things minimal .
I guess if someone out there wants to be an indie dev striking out on their own , and driving their Hummer to Taco Bell every day , they might end up having a harder time than I did .
" I guess it amazes me how many people are willing to shell out over $ 100 / month for their cellphone bill , then turn around and say how they can't afford to make games .
What 's more important ? "
As it turns out , this sacrifice was n't quite enough , and , like McGinley , Moore ended up taking on several contract jobs in order to help subsidize his burgeoning career as an independent game developer .
Surprisingly , despite the fact that these jobs had little to do with creating games , they ended up being more than just financially beneficial for Moore .
" I did two major contract jobs : one was making more productivity software , and one making a YouTube - like application for the U.S. Military .
So no , not related to gaming at all ...
But they were very educational .
I look at contract work as being ' paid to go to school . '
I could have taken courses or bought some books on how to make a streaming video application , but being paid to sit down and actually make one ?
I have way more knowledge now on how to do that kind of thing .
" I 'm actually thinking about how to roll those features into new games ; have embedded tutorial or walkthrough video clips , things like that .
Same thing with the productivity software .
I learned a bunch about optimizing SQL queries , and I can use that to help drive multiplayer games in the future .
I made sure each contract would n't last me much longer than a month though , I always had my goal in mind : games . "
Moore also views these breaks from game development as positive because he believes " it 's healthy to take the occasional break ... to clear your mind a bit . "
The work also essentially helped fund what would turn out to be Moore 's biggest success : Steambirds , a turn - based aerial combat game .
He managed to sell the licensing rights to Armor Games -- a process documented in a recent Gamasutra article .
He is hoping to continue to build off of the success he 's already achieved with the game , with an iPhone port already in the works and plans to possibly bring Steambirds to the Xbox 360 , Nintendo DS , and WiiWare .
Steambirds !
As of this writing , Moore was currently close to completing a cross-Canada road trip , a vacation funded by his deal with Armor Games .
But his hope is that he 'll be able to continue making games for a living , though he is conscious of the fact that his success might not last forever .
" It 's definitely my goal to make games for the rest of my life .
I 'll do what it takes to make that happen !
If I have to go back to a desk job , so be it , but I 'm going to try to get my feet solidly under me to continue as I am now .
" I think Steambirds is really going to pull through for me .
It was designed from the outset as a market test -- to see what people might think , to see if the market was accepting .
Turns out they are , which means I can continue work on ' the big version ' of Steambirds !
" Of course , there 's a chance it can flop .
And maybe it wo n't keep paying the bills for me , and I 'll have to start something new .
But that 's what us indie devs are best at : agility . "
In Conclusion
Clearly , there are many different routes available to someone with the desire to become a game developer outside of the traditional studio model , and these are just a few examples .
Not every developer will have the patience of a Jim McGinley and be able to save a nest egg for over a decade , just as not everyone can juggle month - long contract jobs alongside developing games , like Andy Moore .
But the takeaway from these three examples is clear : if you want to make games , you 'll find a way to do it .
Sacrifices will need to be made , but it is possible .
" It 's all about priorities , " says Moore .
" I wanted to make games bad enough , that I did what was necessary to make it happen . "

Stone currently exports a limited amount of its beer , but doing so does n't make much sense .
It creates a huge carbon footprint , exposes the beer to harmful heat and light , and , when all the shipping and taxes are added in , the beer is outside most European consumers ' price ranges — assuming they 're willing to try an American beer in the first place .
" It changes it from something you could enjoy regularly to something you only drink on special occasions , and that 's not the way to win skeptical potential customers , " Koch says .
Koch makes a convincing case , but he openly admits that Stone has done almost no research on markets and consumer demographics ; that , he says , is for the big commodity brewers .
" Most Americans do n't even drink our beers , " he says .
" We do n't make beer for everyone . "
It 's a fair point , though he 's being a bit coy .
American - style craft beer is slowly gaining a foothold on the Continent .
In only a few years Denmark 's Mikkeller has become one of the craft world 's hottest brewers , and Norway 's Nøgne Ø is close behind .
After decades of settling for the likes of Peroni , Italy is experiencing a veritable beer renaissance .
All these brewers are taking their cues from the Americans , cooking up IPAs , porters , Flemish sours , and saisons .
So far , outside their local markets , these beers are doing better in the United States and the U.K. than anywhere in the rest of Europe .
But that 's likely to change as their distribution networks expand and consumers in Germany and elsewhere get to experience what real IPA tastes like .
The way Koch sees it , why should the European craft brewers have all the fun ?

Presenter , BBC HARDtalk
Venezuela 's President Hugo Chavez intends to inject new urgency into his socialist and anti-imperialist revolution , claiming " capitalism is destroying the world " .
In a combative 60 - minute interview with the BBC HARDtalk programme in the Miraflores Presidential Palace in Caracas , Mr Chavez blamed Venezuela 's deepening recession on the irresponsible economic policies of the United States .
He also expressed disappointment with President Barack Obama 's " very negative signals " towards Latin America .
" In Colombia ( the Americans ) are building seven military bases ; that is one of the very negative signals that Obama sent just after taking office , " Mr Chavez said .
" Bush decided to reactivate the US Fourth Fleet to operate in Latin America .
Obama , instead of suspending or getting rid of the Fourth Fleet has seven military bases planned in Colombia .
What for ?
Is it to go to war , to dominate the Latin American continent ? "
Colombia has signed a deal to give the US military access to seven Colombian bases with the aim to combat drug trafficking and rebels .
It caused alarm among some of Colombia 's neighbours , including Venezuela , who object to an increased US military presence .
" I wish Obama would focus on governing the United States and would forget his country 's imperialist pretensions , " Mr Chavez said .
While there was no repeat of the insults he hurled at George W Bush , such as " donkey , " " devil " and " terrorist " , President Chavez indicated that the high - profile handshake he and Obama shared at an Americas summit last year had not resolved fundamental differences .
Red carpet
The 55 - year - old Venezuelan president rarely grants extended interviews to the Western media .
This one was arranged to coincide with the premiere in Caracas of a new documentary by Oscar - winning director Oliver Stone .
The film , South of the Border , portrays Latin America being transformed by Leftist radicalism .
The leaders of Brazil , Argentina , Bolivia and Ecuador all get walk - on parts , but it is to Mr Chavez that Stone gives the starring role .
The director and the president shared a limousine to the red carpet launch of the film in Caracas 's national theatre .
President Chavez is a key figure in Oliver Stone 's film South of the Border " What 's been going on in Venezuela for the last 10 years is amazing - a piece of history .
The least I can do is introduce this man and this movement to the American people , " said Stone , with a beaming Chavez by his side .
Whether many Venezuelans will ever see South of the Border remains unclear .
The premiere was full of Socialist party bigwigs and activists who hooted with delight as their president was seen lambasting Bush , beating off a coup attempt in 2002 and generally adopting the mantle of a 21st Century Castro .
But no amount of support from the American filmmaker can disguise a simple truth ; domestic support for President Chavez 's " Bolivarian " socialism ( named in homage to Latin America 's 19th Century liberator Simon Bolivar ) is being sorely tested by a second consecutive year of economic recession .
Venezuela possesses the biggest reserves of oil outside the Middle East and supplies more than one - tenth of US oil imports , but still the economy has woefully underperformed against others in Latin America in the last two years .
Inflation has leapt to 30 % and seems likely to rise further .
The Venezuelan currency has been devalued and is still sinking amongst Caracas 's black market money changers .
' Road to hell '
In the capital 's sprawling hillside neighbourhoods , jobs are scarce and Mr Chavez 's Socialist party is looking electorally vulnerable just three months before National Assembly elections .

In his HARDtalk interview , the president blamed his country 's economic woes squarely on America 's " rampant , irresponsible capitalism " which was taking the world " on the road to hell " .
" In England and in Europe you should know this , " Mr Chavez went on .
" ' You have more problems than we do . "
He quoted a stream of economic statistics to illustrate his claim that 11 years of socialism had " begun to redress the balance between a very rich Venezuelan minority and a very poor majority . "
He said unemployment had been halved , extreme poverty was down from 25 % to just 5 % .
Domestic critics of Mr Chavez 's nationalisation programme - which has turned the oil , power and agriculture sectors into vast state bureaucracies - accuse him of creating a " Bolivarian bourgeoisie " of corrupt officials and cronies .
But Mr Chavez emphasised he intended to go further with his socialist model .
Privately owned enterprises are now being expropriated with increasing frequency - a recent controversial example involved the French - owned Exito supermarket chain after allegations of profiteering and currency manipulation .
" Eleven years ago I was quite gullible , " the president said .
" I even believed in a ' third way ' .
I thought it was possible to put a human face on capitalism .
But I was wrong .
" The only way to save the world is through socialism , but a socialism that exists within a democracy .
There 's no dictatorship here . "
Angry exchanges Mr Chavez became visibly agitated when faced with a set of specific questions about his government 's respect for the independence of the judiciary , the freedom of the press and the rights of political opponents .
Baduel has become a rallying point for Venezuela 's opposition
He was asked about the imprisonment of one of his fiercest critics , former defence minister Raul Baduel , and the pending charges filed against former opposition candidate Oswaldo Alvarez Paz .
The Venezuelan president responded : " You do n't know what you 're saying .
Wow , does the BBC in London defend corruption .
You are being used .
You really do n't know what you 're saying . "
As the tension in the presidential palace rose , Oliver Stone who was seated in a corner listening intently to the exchanges - along with a host of presidential aides and one of the president 's daughters - gestured to the president with both hands .
The message was easy to read : Calm down .
Venezuelans are used to seeing an angry president .
Last week he went on television to vent his fury on a judge who ruled that a wealthy businessman should be freed from detention after three years of imprisonment without trial .
Mr Chavez accused the judge , Maria Afiuni , of behaving worse than an assassin and he demanded that she be jailed for 30 years .
Judge Afiuni is now in prison facing corruption charges .
' Axis of unity '
It is not President Chavez 's domestic record that most concerns Western governments , it 's his determination to create an " axis of unity " with countries he sees as fellow strugglers against American and Western imperialism .
He lists the leaders of China , Russia , Syria and Belarus as " good friends " , along with President Ahmedinejad of Iran .
I am not Obama 's enemy but it 's difficult not to see imperialism in Washington .
Those who do n't see it , do n't want to see it
President Chavez
In the last three years Tehran and Caracas have strengthened military and intelligence cooperation while deepening their trade ties , and Mr Chavez responded indignantly to the latest round of UN sanctions on Tehran .
" Venezuela is a free country and we will not be blackmailed by anyone , " he said .
" We will not accept being told what to do over Iran , we will not accept being anyone 's colony " .
But he categorically denied claims frequently aired in the US that Venezuela is supplying Iran with uranium .
His disappointment with Barack Obama was expressed in highly personal terms .
" I shook Obama 's hand and I said , ' I want to be your friend ' .
My hand is still outstretched .
" I am not Obama 's enemy but it 's difficult not to see imperialism in Washington .
Those who do n't see it , do n't want to see it , like the ostrich . "
The Venezuelan President did have a dialogue with the last Democrat in the White House , and that memory seems to have sharpened his disillusion with Obama .
" I said to Hillary Clinton in front of President Obama , ' I wish I could enjoy the same relationship with a US president that I had when your husband was in power . ' "
President Chavez refused to say whether he would seek another term in elections scheduled for 2012 .
Though few doubt that he will , having pushed through the abolition of term - limits in a hard - fought referendum .
" Fidel has spent his whole life on his ( revolution ) , " Chavez reflected .
" Whatever life I have left I will dedicate to this peaceful democratic revolution in Venezuela . "

As weird and scary as it sounds , there may be a time when you 'll be able to blame your server going down on the current U.S. President instead of your internet provider .

A new U.S. Senate bill known as the " Protecting Cyberspace as a National Asset " Act , would enable the president to access a " kill - switch " that would essentially allow him / her to pull the plug on portions of the internet in a cyber security emergency .
According to Senator Susan Collins ( R - ME ) , " …we cannot afford to wait for a cyber 9/11 before our government realizes the importance of protecting our cyber resources . "
What portions of the internet would this affect ?
That 's up to Homeland Security , according to a report on the proposed bill from CNET .
Essentially , any company that " relies on the internet , the telephone system , or any other component of the U.S. information infrastructure " could be required to operate under the command of the National Center for Cybersecurity and Communications ( NCCC ) , a new division of Homeland Security that would be put into operation if the bill passes .
These companies would be required to keep their security measures up to NCCC standards .
If they chose not to abide by the emergency shut down procedures put in place , they would be subject to a fine .

For online gamers , this may seem to be an attack on our recreational time .
In many cases , we are paying for the online services we utilize , such as Xbox Live or subscription games .
In turn , we rely on them to run ‘ round the clock ( with the exception of regularly scheduled maintenance periods ) .
If these networks were to all of a sudden go down for a lengthy period of time , would we get our money back ?
If we were at a pivotal point in our game , would our items and status at the time of the shut down be returned upon the server 's revival ?
It would be a nuisance more than anything else , especially seeing as many online games cannot be played offline ( such as WoW , EVE , Guild Wars and EverQuest ) .
A compromise mentioned in the bill states that companies would be reimbursed for money lost while their networks were forced to go offline .
However , in the midst of whatever crisis has caused the internet be shut down , the game networks themselves may lose subscribers , which would affect business in the long term .
Roping online game networks into this group of internet outlets that could be involved in a security breach if hacked may seem unfair , seeing as online gaming networks really do n't leave their users room to store potentially valuable data , aside from perhaps credit card information ( unless you count an item that drops .001 % of the time that you desperately need to complete your gear set ) .
Sure , they 're social networking outlets as well .
I suppose you could see a group of orcs or gnomes hanging out and argue that they could be real - life terrorists planning an attack , but it 's unlikely that your speculation could be proven true .
Gaming networks are not where the threat of national security compromise lies .
People log on to them to play a game - to socialize , and nothing more .
The idea of disconnecting all of our nation 's servers seems like a knee - jerk reaction , and perhaps too much power for one person to hold .
A better idea might be to beef up security on the sites that truly do have sensitive information , allowing the plug to be pulled on those sites in the event of a " cyber emergency . "

My only questions are what exactly could be considered a " cyber emergency " and what is the likelihood that such an event will actually occur ?

A document has been making the rounds showing that the RIAA paid more than $ 16 million to its lawyers while recouping only a fraction of it through settlements .
While some might grin at this seemingly unfavorable outcome for the music industry representatives , the RIAA told TorrentFreak that the overall result of their efforts in court are in their favor .
It is no secret that the RIAA has been putting more money into their legal campaigns than they could ever get back from individual settlements or fines from file - sharers .
Yesterday this was illustrated once again by a document that revealed how they spent millions of dollars on lawyers while they recouped just a few hundred thousand .
The question is , however , whether this is a laughing matter as some seem to think .
The true aim of the RIAA has never been to gain financially from lawsuits against individuals , they wanted to make a statement and used the United States legal system as their ultimate anti-piracy campaign .
TorrentFreak contacted the RIAA to find out more about their side of the story and how they justify the millions of dollars spent in legal costs .
Jonathan Lamy , Senior Vice President Communications at the RIAA , was kind enough to give us some insight .
“ Before we announced the lawsuits , we spent years on various educational campaigns .
PSAs .
Magazine advertisements .
Artists speaking out .
Instant messages to millions of Kazaa users .
You name it .
We made extensive efforts to engage fans and inform them about the law .
It made a little difference , ” Lamy told TorrentFreak .
So , the next step for the RIAA was to go after people who shared songs online , to send out a clear message that they were breaking the law .
Since everything else had failed thus far , they believed that suing thousands of people was a good way to communicate their message to the public .
“ But it ’s simple human nature that for some people – and I ’m not suggesting everyone – when tempted to do something that is easy and anonymous and perhaps they do not appreciate that it is illegal , it is very difficult to their change behavior WITHOUT introducing the threat of consequences , ” Lamy told us .
“ Do you think people would not speed if there were no cops ?
You slow down more often than not because you think you might get caught . ”
“ I remember sitting in a focus group of college students and the moderator kept asking the students what would it take them to stop downloading illegally : more than one said , ‘ You have to sue me or my roommate .
We need to see first hand that getting caught could lead to trouble ’ , ” Lamy said .
So the real question that should be asked is whether the RIAA actually got any bang for its bucks .
If you look at the expenditure as an investment in an anti-piracy campaign it might actually not be as bad for them as it looks .
Over the years tens of thousands of news reports carrying their anti-piracy message have been published in the mainstream media .
No PR agency could have ever given them the massive exposure they ’ve got from these lawsuits .
But was it worth it ?
The question still stands whether this PR has been an effective deterrent .
Although there are still a lot of people who share music illegally it would be hard to make the claim that the message had no effect on the piracy rate .
The well - informed might not be scared as easily , but we can safely say that for quite a few people the press about million dollar fines might have been a scary enough reason not to pirate .
Whether the big music labels actually profited from the few percent less file - sharers is yet another question , especially when one doubts that there are any losses at all .
The bottom line is , however , that the RIAA made a conscious choice to spend all these millions of dollars on lawsuits and that they believe that the money was well spent .
Luckily for those who kept on sharing the RIAA has stopped their actions against individual file - sharers .
They claim that the music piracy rates have decreased enough and studies show that more people buy music instead of pirating it .
Nevertheless , the legal campaigns have been quite costly , and not only for the RIAA .
In the process , the music labels hit thousands of people financially with settlements and the two file - sharers whose cases made it all the way through court are pretty much financially ruined .
The RIAA does n’t seem to hold much compassion for these victims though , and appears to see them as collateral damage .
“ Well , there are thousands of folks who have been laid off because of the decline of the music business .
That was n’t pleasant experience for them either , ” Lamy said .
Ouch …
Other services that must be offered at no charge include counseling to help people stop smoking ; screening and counseling for obesity ; and tests for infection with the virus that causes AIDS .
“ Getting rid of cost - sharing is a long - overdue step in the right direction , ” said Kenneth E. Thorpe , a professor of health policy at Emory University in Atlanta .
“ But we will have to do a major public education campaign to get people to take advantage of these clinical preventive services . ”
The rules stipulate that no co-payments can be charged for tests and screenings recommended by the United States Preventive Services Task Force , an independent panel of scientific experts .
The rules apply to new health plans that begin coverage after Sept. 23 and to existing health plans that make significant changes after that date .
The administration said the requirements could increase premiums by 1.5 percent , on average .
Kathleen Sebelius , the secretary of health and human services , said the rules would extend benefits to 31 million people in new employer - sponsored plans and 10 million people in new individual plans next year .
In many cases , insurers will be allowed to charge for goods and services needed to treat a condition detected in a screening .
For example , consumers can receive free screenings for depression and high cholesterol , but they might be charged co-payments for antidepressants and cholesterol - lowering drugs .

Acid Reflux Medications – Cause Serious Side Effects .
Posted on July 19 , 2010 .
Filed under : Digestion , General Health , Men's Helath , Specialty Needs , Women 's Health | Tags : acid reflux , Archives of Internal Medicine , Clostridium difficile , Dr. J.V. Wright M.D. , Dr. Mitchell Katz , heartburn , Prilosec or Nexium , Serious Side Effects |
I have suffered from heartburn and or acid reflux for many years .
Never finding any real solution to the problem .
Perhaps reading the information below will give you some clues as to why I never really found any answers .
All drugs carry side effects … they are chemicals that we are pumping into our bodies on a regular basis .
Foreign to our natural makeup and unwanted .
Just because it has been prescribed by a doctor does not mean we really need it .
Take control our your health today .
If you do not , who will ?
- Luther Brotherton Pharmacist -
Dear Reader ,
Source : Dr. J.V. Wright M.D .
All the commercials are pretty much the same .
A guy pushes away a plate and slams his fist into his chest , which explodes into animated fire as the chili - dog and fries he just wolfed down hit home .
“ Heartburn , ” he frowns to his friend , who pulls out a bottle of Prilosec or Nexium or some other miracle of modern medicine and smiles .
“ I never have to worry about that ! ” he exclaims as he shoves half a cheeseburger in his mouth … .

Proton pump inhibitors .
Watch enough TV and you ’ll learn you can eat whatever you want , as long as you have a bottle of these handy .
Well , hopefully that line of thinking is about to come to an end .
A recent report on five studies , appearing in the Archives of Internal Medicine , has some news that I ’d like to hope could ( finally ) stop the PPI party .
The bottom line ?
Proton pump inhibitors can cause some serious side effects .
One of the studies followed 161,806 women between 50 and 79 for eight years .
Researchers found that women who took the drugs were at a greater risk for fractures , especially of the spine and wrist .
Two of the studies uncovered a link between PPIs and a deadly bacterial infection .
One study found a 74 % increase in cases of infections with Clostridium difficile , a sometimes - deadly cause of diarrhea , among people using PPIs on a daily basis .
Dr. Mitchell Katz , director of the San Francisco Department of Public Health , dropped a particularly big bomb on PPIs , saying that a full 60 to 70 % of people who take them probably do n’t need them .
So that ’s it , right ?
No more PPIs ?
Well , now let ’s not be too hasty !
We would n’t want anyone getting the wrong idea here — just because a drug raises the risk of fractures and might cause deadly bacterial infections , that ’s no reason to stop taking them !
After all , as the mainstream press is quick to say , “ the drugs are a great help to the right patients . ”
They say the answer is “ appropriate use . ”
And what does that mean , exactly ?
It ’s kind of hard to tell when the commercials are telling me to pop a pill every time I ’m feeling the effects of a spicy meal .
Sorry , guys , but as much as you try to gloss over the dangers here , it ’s just not working .
Any negative words against these drugs are negative words against the $ 13.9 billion a year in sales raked in by the companies that sell them .
It ’s pretty obvious they ’re not going to go down without a fight .
But that does n’t mean we have to sit around and wait for the main streamers to wise up .
Especially when there ’s some pretty convincing evidence that these drugs actually CONTRIBUTE to the problem of heartburn and other stomach woes .

In the public ’s imagination , the classic hate crime is an assault born of animus against a particular ethnicity or sexual orientation , like the case of the Long Island man convicted in April of killing an Ecuadorean immigrant after hunting for Hispanics to beat up .
But in Queens since 2005 , at least five people have been convicted of , or pleaded guilty to , committing a very different kind of hate crime  singling out elderly victims for nonviolent crimes like mortgage fraud because they believed older people would be easy to deceive and might have substantial savings or home equity .
And this month , Queens prosecutors charged two women with stealing more than $ 31,000 from three elderly men they had befriended separately .
The women , Gina L. Miller , 39 , and Sylvia Johns , 23 , of Flushing , were charged with grand larceny as a hate crime .
This approach , which is being closely watched by prosecutors across New York State , has won Queens prosecutors stiffer sentences , including prison for criminals who could otherwise go free , even after draining an elderly person ’s savings .
Without a hate crime , theft of less than $ 1 million carries no mandatory prison time ; with it , the thief must serve for a year and may face 25 .
Those rumors about Google ‘s Facebook - rivaling social network just got a whole lot more interesting .
A former Facebook exec has been quizzing contacts inside Google and discovered that it ’s all real , with large numbers of Google staff busy on task .
The leak comes from Adam D’Angelo , cofounder of Quora ( a cloud - sourced community question - answer forum ) , and it ’s interesting as he was formerly chief technology officer at Facebook .
Given the size and complexity of Facebook ’s operations , this was no small job , and probably places D’Angelo on the contacts directory of a significant number of colleagues in competing high - tech businesses .
In other words , when D’Angelo says he spoke to “ reliable sources , ” we ’re inclined to believe him .
Digg ’s founder Kevin Rose was responsible for the first part of the rumor , and it piqued D’Angelo ’s interest enough that he did some of his own digging –turning up some data from his inside sources .
He learned that it ’s “ not a rumor ” and there are a “ large number ” of folks inside Google working on it , and this news is convincing enough that he ’s “ completely confident ” about its veracity .
Unlike other projects inside Google , “ this is a high priority ” one .
While interesting , these points do n’t necessarily teach us anything new about the project .
But D’Angelo also learned that Google really feels it dropped the ball on the whole social networking phenomenon , particularly where it concerns Facebook .
“ They had assumed Facebook ’s growth would slow as it grew , and that Facebook would n’t be able to have too much leverage over them , but then it just did n’t stop , and now they are really scared ” is the most telling phrase , because it implies naivety about several aspects of the world inside Google ’s management .
Firstly , by the very nature of social networking it ’s a phenomenon that tends to grow virally –the more people on Facebook , the more people get attracted to Facebook since more of their friends are already there : For Google ’s team to not understand this is surprising ( and possibly explains the weak success of Google Buzz ) .
There ’s also a hint in here that Google ’s management does n’t have a good grip on how people are interacting socially on the Web , and that they underestimated how people liked the friendly interactivity offered by Facebook –another indication why Buzz , with its slightly obfuscating interface , is n’t as much of a success as it could be .
Essentially , it seems that Google ’s management had assumed that Google Buzz would leverage off Google ’s enormous reach online , and its brand name , and easily compete with Facebook .
This proved such a disastrously bad move that the new Google social net will actually be modeled “ off Facebook . ”
While we do n’t know exactly what this means , we can guess that Google may be intending to emulate Facebook ’s interface more than the way the site ’s social interaction tricks work , since Buzz was actually an attempt to do this .

Yesterday I gave a demo of the clj - plaza Clojure library for working with RDF data at the Jena User ’s Group meeting during Semtech .
This demo was REPL - only so I do n’t have any slides to post but I thought perhaps an annotated version of the script I used would be useful for someone .
Many thanks to Antonio Garrote for writing the library .
For the purposes of the demo , I used Netbeans and Enclojure and defined my classpath using a Maven pom .
I wo n’t go into details on it as it ’s pretty straightforward ( but still > 100 lines long ) .
It pulls in the plaza dependencies and uses the Maven clojure plugin .
Once I opened this project in Netbeans , I just started a REPL from the project .
You can find the pom here if you want it .
Clojure
Because many people in the audience were not familiar with Clojure , I did a short intro to Clojure itself .
Clojure is a dynamically - typed Lisp dialect that runs on the JVM .
I was drawn to it because of :
Lisp – excellent capabilities for abstraction , flexibility , and functional programming JVM – able to leverage all of the features of the JVM like garbage collection , dynamic performance optimization , portable environment and its embrace of Java interoperability to get access to the vast wealth of portable Java libs .
concurrency – Clojure starts from a base of immutable persistent data structures and builds a managed way to provide identity over time pointing to an evolving snapshot of immutable data .
Changes are made through explicit state - changing functions that occur in the context of a software transactional memory system .
Reads can be done at any time by just getting the current snapshot .
This demo will just work from the REPL starting with some basic Clojure syntax .
The REPL is kind of like the shell you might use in Ruby or Groovy or whatever other non-Java language you use except that in Clojure , the REPL is much closer to the heart of what Clojure ( or any Lisp ) is .
REPL = read - eval - print loop .
The reader reads and creates Clojure data structures , eval evaluates those data structures , and print can output Clojure data structures .
Clojure uses prefix notation that starts with a function and is followed by it ’s arguments :
user= > (+ 2 2 ) 4 user= > (+ 1 (* 3 5 ) ) 16
You can define variables in your current namespace :
user= > ( def v 5 ) # 'user / v user= > v 5 user= > (+ v v ) 10
Lisps are inherently dependent on the list data structure where you can think of a list as a linked - list where new items are added to the head .
A list is represented by the ubiquitous parentheses : ( 1 3 5 ) .
You can try to put a list at the REPL but it wo n’t work because Lisp wants to read that list * and evaluate it * , treating the first item as a function .
However , you can use other functions to explicitly create lists :
user= > ( 1 3 5 ) #<CompilerException java.lang.ClassCastException : java.lang .
Integer cannot be cast to clojure.lang .IFn ( NO_SOURCE_FILE:2 ) > user= > ( list 1 3 5 ) ( 1 3 5 ) user= > ( quote ( 1 3 5 ) ) ( 1 3 5 ) user= > ' ( 1 3 5 ) ( 1 3 5 )
A $ 5 word you might hear is “ homoiconic ” by which people mean that Clojure * code * is represented in terms of Clojure * data structures * .
This is in opposition to most languages people use today where code is represented with a bunch of syntax understood via an abstract syntax tree .
This allows us to generate code as data and execute it :
user= > ( def foo '(+ 5 5 ) ) # 'user / foo user= > ( eval foo ) 10
This is deep and important and you should read something more useful than this blog to understand why . :)
An extremely important part of Clojure is its set of core data structures , so we ’ll take a brief look at a few of them .
I ’ve already mentioned lists and how to create them .
You can also add things to them with conj ( in which case they are pushed on the head ) , grab the first thing or the rest of the things in the list :
user= > ( def a ' ( 1 2 ) ) # 'user / a user= > ( conj a 3 4 ) ( 4 3 1 2 ) user= > ( first a ) 1 user= > ( rest a ) ( 2 )
Vectors are denoted by [ ] and differ from lists in that they are more like ArrayLists in Java and things append to the tail , not to the head .
Because they are not eagerly evaluated as code , it is often more convenient ( and common ) to use vectors to build intermediate data structures that you pass around in Clojure .
user= > [ 1 2 3 ] [ 1 2 3 ] user= > ( def v [ 1 2 3 ] ) # 'user / v user= > ( conj v 4 ) [ 1 2 3 4 ] user= > ( first v ) 1 user= > ( rest v ) ( 2 3 )
Maps are denoted by { } and are kind of like HashMap in Java .
The representation consists of “ key value key value … ” .
If you like you can use commas to separate key - value pairs as commas are treated as whitespace in Clojure .
The first and rest functions work over a sequence of key - value pairs from the map .
In Clojure , maps * are * functions of the key that return the value so you can use the map as a function .
user= > { 1 2 3 4} { 1 2 , 3 4} user= > ( keys { 1 2 3 4} ) ( 1 3 ) user= > ( vals { 1 2 3 4} ) ( 2 4 ) user= > ( first { 1 2 3 4} ) [ 1 2 ] user= > ( rest { 1 2 3 4} ) ( [ 3 4 ] )
There are also sets and queues if you need them .
A key aspect of Clojure is functional programming and it has a rich set of functions for doing FP type stuff .
fn is a special form to create a function which can be named and used .
Most commonly , you ’ll use the helpful defn macro to do this though .
user= > ( def f ( fn [ a ] (* a a ) ) ) # 'user / f user= > ( f 5 ) 25 user= > ( defn f [ a ] (* a a ) ) # 'user / f user= > ( f 5 ) 25
If we define a new function , we can call it just like any other function by passing it some arguments .
Some classic FP functions we might want to call are map ( which applies a function over a sequence , reduce to reduce a sequence to a result , and filter to pull matching elements of a sequence based on a criteria function ) :
user= > ( defn x10 [ a ] (* a 10 ) ) # 'user / x10 user= > ( def r ( range 10 ) ) #'user / r user= > r ( 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ) user= > ( map x10 r ) ( 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 ) user= > ( map * r r ) ( 0 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81 ) user= > ( map #(* % %) r ) ( 0 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81 ) user= > ( reduce + r ) 45 user= > ( reduce * r ) 0 user= > ( filter odd ? r) ( 1 3 5 7 9 )
The #( … %) business is syntactic sugar for an anonymous function where % is the item being evaluated .
You might also have caught that you can walk multiple sequences at the same time with map and apply the items to the function .
clj - plaza
Ok , so enough basics , let ’s look at the clj - plaza library , written by Antonio Garrote .
clj - plaza has a bunch of useful semantic web functionality , including I/O , creation and observation of rdf data , and querying .
Additionally there is support for creating a triple space ( akin to the classic tuple space ) and creating semantic RESTful services .
I ’m focusing just on the basics of working with RDF here .
To use plaza , we make the plaza namespace known to Clojure , and then import a file of Elvis impersonator data in RDF ( thank you Internet ) into a model :
user= > ( use ' plaza.rdf.core ) nil user= > ( def e ( document - to - model " http://www.snee.com/rdf/elvisimp.rdf " :xml ) ) #'user / e
If you wanted to load from a file instead , you might do this :
user= > ( import java.io.FileInputStream ) java.io.FileInputStream user= > ( def e ( document - to - model ( new FileInputStream " data/elvisimp.rdf " ) :xml ) ) #'user / e
In both cases here we end up with a plaza model , which is actually just a Clojure agent protecting access to a Jena model :
user= > ( class e ) clojure.lang .
Agent user= > ( class @e ) com.hp.hpl.jena.rdf.model.impl.ModelCom
If you ’re hearing the hype about RDFa , you might be interested in scraping some RDF data out of web pages .
Jena supports this already and plaza makes it really trivial to scrape the web for the data .
Here I scrape a slideshare .
net page for one of my presentations :
If you then want to save it somewhere you can convert the model to a string in n3 format and dump it to a file with the clojure core function spit :
user= > ( def rdfa -str ( with - out - str ( model - to - format rdfa : n3 ) ) ) #'user / rdfa - str user= > ( print rdfa - str ) @prefix dc : < http://purl.org/dc/terms/> .

The clj - plaza lib also includes ways to easily create new RDF data , including resources , literals , and typed literals , from which we can create triples :
user= > ( rdf- resource " http://example.org/foo " )
#< ResourceImpl http://example.org/foo> user= > ( rdf- literal " abc " ) #< LiteralImpl abc^ ^http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#XMLLiteral> user= > ( rdf- literal " abc " " en " ) #< LiteralImpl abc@en > user= > ( rdf- typed- literal 5 ) #< LiteralImpl 5 ^ ^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#int> user= > ( d 5 ) #< LiteralImpl 5 ^ ^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#int>
Here you can use a function l as a synonym for rdf-literal and d as a synonym for rdf - typed - literal .
We can make triples by just creating vectors of triples ( also defined as vectors ) .
We can then also define namespaces in a namespace registry to make this a bit more readable and writeable .
Once you ’ve built some triples in Clojure data structures , you can easily drop those into a model if you want to work with them from there :
user= > ( make - triples [ [ " http://example.org/Alex " " http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type "
" http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person " ] ] ) [ [ #< ResourceImpl http://example.org/Alex> #< PropertyImpl http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type>
#< ResourceImpl http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person>]] user= > ( register -rdf-ns :ex " http://example.org/ " ) { " http://example.org/ " :ex , " http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema# " :rdfs , " http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns# " : rdf} user= > ( register-rdf-ns : foaf " http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/ " )
{ " http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/ " : foaf , " http://example.org/ " :ex , " http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema# " :rdfs , " http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns# " : rdf} user= > ( make - triples [ [ [ :ex : Alex ] [ :rdf : type ] [ : foaf : Person ] ] ] ) [ [ #< ResourceImpl http://example.org/Alex> #< PropertyImpl http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type>
#< ResourceImpl http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person>]] user= > ( alter - root - rdf-ns " http://www.example.org/ " ) " http://www.example.org/ " user= > ( def t ( make - triples [ [ : Alex [ :rdf : type ] [ : foaf : Person ] ] ] ) ) #'user /t user= > ( def m ( defmodel ( model- add - triples t ) ) ) #'user / m
There are also a bunch of helper functions for looking at triples and parts of triples and getting the information back out :
user= > ( def et ( model - to - triples e ) ) # 'user / et user= > (s ( first t ) ) #< ResourceImpl http://www.example.org/Alex> user= > ( p ( first t ) ) #< PropertyImpl http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> user= > ( o ( first t ) ) #< ResourceImpl http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person> user= > ( resource - uri ( o ( first t ) ) ) " http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person " user= > ( literal - datatype-uri ( d 5 ) ) " http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#int " user= > ( literal - value ( d 5 ) ) 5 user= > ( literal - language ( l " abc " " en " ) ) " e n "
Since we can deal with triples in terms of basic Clojure data structures , we can then also apply all of the basic Clojure functions to them as well .
For example we can grab all the predicates by just applying the plaza p function to every triple in the set ( and take the first 10 here for simplicity ) :
user= > ( take 10 ( map #( p %) et ) ) ( #< PropertyImpl http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/description>
#< PropertyImpl http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/title>
#< PropertyImpl http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/title>
#< PropertyImpl http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/title>
#< PropertyImpl http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/title>

#< PropertyImpl http://www.snee.com/ns/epinfluences>
#< PropertyImpl http://www.snee.com/ns/eppay-range>
#< PropertyImpl http://www.snee.com/ns/epyear-established>)
Here we ’re seeing the Jena Property Impl class wrapping those predicates but we can easily extract the uri from within the Property Impl too :
user= > ( take 10 ( map #( resource - uri ( p % ) ) et ) ) ( " http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/description " " http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/title "
" http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/title "

" http://www.snee.com/ns/eppay-range "
" http://www.snee.com/ns/epyear-established " )
We can see lots of duplicates here , so it ’s easy to use the built - in clojure functions distinct ( for duplicate removal ) and sort to clean up our list of predicates in the data set :
user= > ( sort ( distinct ( map #( resource - uri ( p % ) ) et ) ) ) ( " http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/creator " " http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/description " " http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/rights "

Plaza has a mechanism to easily create a simple or complex predicate for finding matching triples in a triple set .
This is done using the triple - check function ( also a shortcut version called tc ) .
Inside triple - check there are a set of predicate functions that can be combined using and ? , or ? , etc .
For example , we can create a predicate that searches for any triples that have an object literal that contains the word “ impersonator ” in our Elvis data :
user= > ( filter ( triple - check ( object - and ? ( is-literal ? ) ( regex ? # " impersonator " ) ) ) et ) ( [#< ResourceImpl http://www.all4funchgo.bizland.com>
#< PropertyImpl http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/description>
#< LiteralImpl providing Elvis impersonators for parties , singing telegrams , and corporate events serving the Chicago metro area . > ] ...etc... )
If we wanted we could take that output set of triples and further manipulate it either with predicates or built - in Clojure functionality .
Plaza also has a mechanism to create patterns ( basically SPARQL graph patterns ) and filters ( SPARQL filters ) and ways to apply these patterns and filters directly to a model or a set of triples in vector form .
user= > ( use ' plaza.rdf.sparql ) nil user= > ( def elvez ( make - pattern [ [ :?s :?p ( d " El Vez " ) ] ] ) ) #'user / elvez user= > ( pattern - apply et elvez ) ( [[#<ResourceImpl http://members.aol.com/elvezco>
#< ResourceImpl http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/title>
#< LiteralImpl El Vez^ ^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string>]])
You can also use plaza syntax to create full sparql queries .
You can dump those as a string or apply them to either a model or a set of triple vectors .
user= > ( def q ( defquery ( query - set - type : select ) ( query - set- vars [ :?s :?p ] ) ( query - set - pattern elvez ) ) ) # 'user / q user= > ( query - to - string q ) " SELECT ?s ?
p
WHERE
{ ?s ?p \ " El Vez\ " ^ ^ < http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> . }
" user= > ( model - query e q ) ( {:? p #< ResourceImpl http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/title>, :?s #< ResourceImpl http://members.aol.com/elvezco>})
Note that the results here are a sequence of maps where each is keyed by selected variables .
If we want to work with sparql directly instead of building these queries , it ’s easy to also go from a sparql string to a query that can be used directly as well :
user= > ( sparql - to - query " SELECT ?s ?p WHERE { ?s ?p \ " El Vez\ " } " ) {:vars [ :s :p ] , : filters ( ) , : pattern ( [ :?s :? p #< LiteralImpl El Vez > ] ) , : kind : select}
I ’m really just scratching the surface of both Clojure and the plaza library here , but hopefully I ’ve given you a taste of what ’s interesting about using them to easily read , write , and manipulate RDF data .
On Cursing
“ See if people are gonna hate just cause I say the word m — — — – , then f— them , I do n’t have time to worry about marketing and shit , in my last fight my hair looked like shit cause all I did was train …
I have other letters but i’m not that good of a reader . ”
“ If people ca n’t handle watching me or they ca n’t handle the intensity of my life or they can’t handle me cussing saying f— this and f —- , then you know , I think people really need to become a little more mature , kinda grow up a little bit … ”
“ I do n’t mean to sound like … this is … you know … people need to grow up and be mature enough to handle this shit .
If they ca n’t and their eyes are not old enough to handle my cuss words and to handle the reality of what my life is really about , then do n’t f —– watch .
Because I ’m tired of hearing about this and that about how I ’m a f —– punk and I ’m this and that and I ’m f —– stupid because I did n’t go to school and I do n’t know how to talk without fuckin cussing and say the F - word every five minutes .
If you ca n’t handle it , then do n’t listen to me .
I do n’t give a f — . ”
On Computers
“ After my last fight I bought one , I have no clue how to work it nor have any intention of chatting on here with you whores . ”
On rock stars
“ I do n’t know about you guys , but I like my rock stars choking on their own vomit and uh , you know , what ’s it matter anyways ? ”
On Girls
“ Back in the day , a Ninja did n’t have his girlfriend sitting in the tree waiting to kill shit . ”
“ If I have a girlfriend , I do n’t bring her to flaunt her .
She does n’t get to reap the benefits of me being famous . ”
On painted toenails and chocolate
Jesse Holland :
Who paints their hair and toes ?
“ Dude everybody .
C’mon man .
Even Hermes Franca .
One day he comes in with that goofy haircut .
You got Jens Pulver , f — — Mayhem Miller .
Some bitch he was talking to tried to offer me this piece of hydrogenated chocolate .
What the f— are these guys into ?
Give me some real chocolate .
Real fighters eat real chocolate . ”
“ We dont really do painted toenails on the mat here … at our gym ”
On his hometown of Stockton
“ Fighting in Stockton is going to be great for me .
Stockton is a great fight town because if you drive long enough on some of these roads you ’ll probably see a pretty good street fight . ”
“ My job is to come and whoop your f — — ass so can get paid to take care of my family and take care of my business …
I do n’t have time and to walk around and pose and act happy and fucking paint my hair up …at the end of it it ’s Stockton , there ’s nobody around for that s— … there ’s nothing to distract you there are no hot chicks , the butt - ugly one ’s think that they ’re the shit … everybody thinks it ’s all about moving to Vegas if you ’re a f — — fighter– yeah , if want to be f — — poser … ”
On Vegas
Vegas is a f — — theme , dude , that s— does n’t fool me . ”
“ Every fighter I know wants to move there and wants to live there .
You gotta be kidding me .
These f —— a — —-.
I mean — I love it , because they ’re that dumb , I ’m like , “ I ca n’t wait to fight ’em , they ’re so stupid . ”
“ They thrive off these big f — — fake - titty mutant chicks that are f — — disgusting whores , every last one of them .
They ’re all trying to do something to get somwhere , or if they ’re out there they ’re trying to f — — do it up with their old man somewhere else . ”
“ It ’s just like , and regardless , you ’re there — if I were there , I ’d be there to meet some people , you know , like some endorsement deals , some things or whatnot .
These people , they end up wanting to live there and move there .
All they do is go out and drink and they ca n’t — they all drink .
Even the ones that — even athletes there that do n’t drink , the other ones force them into drinking and they do n’t go out and stand around drink water like I do .
I ’ve seen ’em and they all f — — move to Vegas and they go to these clubs and it ’s just like , “ Dude you are f — — kidding me . ”
You know , I feel like I can go out there and live somewhere in a place like that — probably not that place , ever , I can hardly stay there for a f — — week , I hate it there , honestly — and then you know , make some money for myself , move back here , to some little spot , you know what I mean , where there ’s f — — a vineyard on the side of it and I can shoot rabbits outside of my door with a shotgun and nobody ’s gonna say s— to me .
That would make me happy .
On Rich Franklin
“ He just lost again right ?
See what I mean ?
You are promoting Rich Franklin and this m — — — – , here he is , letting it ride and he ’s just trying to uphold his image .
The guy ’s a f — — teacher .
He ’s a school teacher – that ’s what he is .
If I was going to fight him I ’d be pretty damn confident .
I ’m going to fight a teacher not a fighter .
There are plenty of teachers I wanted to beat up . ”
On Diego Sanchez
Rogan : “ So now do you have respect for Diego ? ”
Diaz : “ Naw , not really . ”
On Frank Shamrock
“ I feel like I ’m a lot bigger than Frank is .
He lifts a lot of weights , ya know ?
We were at a photo shoot , the other day , ya know ?
I figured he oiled himself up real good .
I did n’t get no oil . ”
On KJ Noons
“ My car pulled up in front of the hotel and he and his girlfriend and his mom and dad were there , ” Diaz said .
“ Right away , he put his mug on me .
He was staring me down and trying to give the impression that he ’s hard core .
I flipped him off , but he ’s standing over there like he ’s flashing .
I go , ‘ What the f— are you doing ?
I ’m not the one doing s — . ’
I could n’t understand why this guy is putting his mug on me , but he had to act like he was some kind of a f — — tough guy in front of his girlfriend and his Dad .
This is war , this is life , and I take this very seriously , ” Diaz said .
“ I ’m not the one bringing my family into the ring and showing them off .
I ’m not the one who ( showed up to the pre-fight news conference ) in a f — — suit trying to act like I ’m some kind of tough guy a — — rich kid .
This is war to me and we have a serious situation on our hands now . ”
On Takanori Gomi
“ He kinda just put his head down and looped some fucking punch out there that smacked me …I was like what the f —-?!?!?!? ”
“ That little f — — hit me with a Hadukan or something . ”
“ I beat his ass .
But you know , that little f — – .
Man that f—– is tough .
I mean I hit him , but then he comes out with this karate s— and little dude can bang .
I mean he f —– up my eye and s — …
That ’s why I went to the ground and go go ’d him .
You dont see that s— in MMA .
Who in MMA go go ’s anyone cept me . ”
On the Joe Riggs hospital brawl
Trigg : “ You should have just closed the door Nick . ”
Nick : “ How the f — am I gonna close the door ?
I ai n’t no b— -. ”
“ He started that shit dude .
I was like “ Come over here then if you want some , b— - .
You ca n’t see me you fucking p — - “ .
So he started walking towards me and threw his hands up so he took an ass whooping .
I told him he was gonna get smacked if he came over .
He kept saying “ Get your brother !
Get your brother ! ”
My brother was standing right there we could have jumped him but we ’re not like that .
I ai n’t no b— - and I ai n’t no punk and I do n’t want to be a poor sport but I feel like I won that fight .
I ’m definitely better than that guy . ”
On fighters
“ I ’m trying to fight Sakurai , I ’m trying to fight K.J. Noons , I ’m trying to fight Anderson Silva , I ’m trying to fight everybody .
I ’m trying to fight Georges m — — — —
St. Pierre .
I ’m trying to fight … I did n’t mean to call Georges a m — — — – , but I ai n’t got no problem getting there and fighting the best people in the world .
Georges is a nice guy .
I ’m trying to fight Jon Fitch , I ’m trying to fight Silva , I ’m trying to fight K.J. Noons , I ’m trying to fight everybody .
I ’m trying to fight Takanori Gomi , Sakurai , I ’m trying tof — everybody up .
F— this s — .
This is fucking gangster fucking warfare .
I do n’t give a f — .
You know what I mean ? ”
On his team
“ If you ’re not on my team , then F — YOU , cause if you ’re not with us , then your against us ”
On steroids
“ W” hen you do n’t want to go , when you feel like s — and you fucking do n’t want to train anymore — if you go ahead and get loaded , then you might not give a s — what you ’re about to go do , you just go do it .
So you know , for all you fighters out there , it might be what you need , instead of f — — sticking that needle in your ass . ”
“ Because I ’m telling you right now , these people that f — — do steroids , you know what I mean ?
I ’m like , I wish everything was legal , because that would give them the chance to go out there and make their mark and then burn the f— out .
And that ’s when I come in with my consistency , because I ’m coming . ”
On marijuana
“ Hell yeah !
The s— has healing powers .
I would recommend pot for any fighter .
Especially the ones that drink .
You ca n’t get bombed and expect to be 100 % the next day but if you had a joint you would be 110 % .
Most of those fucking guys are popping Vicotin and drinking and before you know it they ’re crashing . ”
“ Because you get high all the time , you ca n’t find people that train all the time .
But if you get high and train , you will get high and train all the time together and it will be f — — massive - takeover - smoke - weed - and - kill - people s — . ”
“ Making weed illegal is a little bit paranoid , do n’t you think ?
It ’s like saying God made a mistake , you know what I mean ?
It ’s like , you ’ve got the whole world and Earth and all its holy creations , right ?
And God is like , Hmm , lookit , my whole world in all its holy ways , and he ’s like , Oh - my - me - oh - shit , I left weed in here .
Yeah right , I left weed in here .
Oh , should n’t have smoked that joint on the third day . ”
“ ” For the record , right now , I think someone needed to come out and say it : I think smoking pot is good for mixed martial artists .
It ’s a new day and age , this is , uh , the year … F — year is it ?
I do n’t know , because I ’ve been training and smoking pot like I should , instead of paying attention to other bullshit , which I do n’t do . ”
“ The fact of the matter is , if you go home — okay , I ’m gonna tell all you fighters out there something right now , from my experience — if you have friends that you get high with , get ’em to train with you . ”
“ And then , not to mention , when you ’re done , you know , you guys are probably all going to get high together at whoseover house ’s cool , and probably all go and get a whole shitload of groceries at the store , go home and cook ’em .
Instead of trying to make it out of the gym early to the club before it closes — or for instance we close around here around 2 o’clock — so people will be taking off trying to go early , trying to make it to meet whoever , whatever , this and that , yadda yadda , drinking a little bit of alcohol , ca n’t go there without drinking — it could be a little bit easier to just f — — smoke a bowl and then crash out until you wake up and do it all over again , see what I mean ? ”
“ So my bottom line is I wanted to get a bunch of this stuff off my chest is … is that … you know … I ’m not no chump .
I ’m not going to just talk shit or whatever .
I ca n’t remember where I was really going with that . ”
So Nick , would you agree your marijuana smoking has got in the way of your fight career ?
“ Actually , on the contrary , my fight career has gotten in the way of my marijuana smoking . ”
Asked if he was high ?
“ Maybe i am , maybe i’m not …. maybe f—you ”
last words
“ I do n’t have nothing to say but f— this f— that at this point and time , so . ”

Try refreshing your browser , or Comment : Streetcars running off rails Back to video
Toronto ’s dysfunctional love affair with its streetcars is hurting the environment .
Each day , scores of streetcars block the progress of thousands of vehicles that , as they idle , spew tonnes of toxic exhaust fumes into the atmosphere .
Streetcars bring with them other major problems as well .
Do you ever wonder why you do n’t see them grinding through Manhattan and other major North American centres ?
They ’re a disaster in mixed traffic , slow - moving and costly to operate .
Those deficiencies do n’t stop the TTC from running streetcars even where they do n’t belong .
Let ’s examine the issue of speed , or lack thereof .
Consider the rider who gets on the 501 streetcar at the corner of Queen Street East and Kingston Road , en route to Queen Street West and University Avenue , a distance of 6.2 kilometres .
On a good traffic day the trip takes 27 minutes , a speed of about 13.5 kilometres per hour .
You can run faster .
In fact , the 501 streetcar would have finished 202nd if it had been entered in a well - known Toronto half - marathon last year .
I ’ve written before about the ongoing schism within the Episcopal church , but those posts only concerned the goings - on in America .
Now that battle has spread across the Atlantic and into the heart of Anglicanism , and it ’s looking more and more likely that the church will be cloven in two at its roots .
As reported by the Telegraph , the Anglican General Synod has rejected a last - ditch compromise brokered by Rowan Williams , the Archbishop of Canterbury and nominal head of the Anglican church , to prevent conservative members from breaking away .
Conservative and evangelical Anglican sects have been growing increasingly angered by the appointment of women and gay men to be bishops .
They exerted their muscle last week to block the promotion of Jeffrey John , a gay man , to the post of Bishop of Southwark .
But the conservatives were n’t satisfied with that victory – in fact , as is usual with the religious right , it only led them to make further demands .
The conservative faction of Anglicans do n’t like women serving as bishops , and they especially do n’t like being subordinate to women bishops .
What they wanted was , in effect , religious apartheid – a certain number of bishop positions reserved for men , with the assurance that conservative congregations would n’t have to report to or deal with a female bishop if they did n’t want to .
Rowan Williams backed the proposal – though a liberal himself , he ’s apparently willing to compromise with bigots , as is also shown by his revolting remarks on sharia law .
But the larger Anglican Communion would n’t go along with the deal , and in a shock vote , Williams ’ proposal was defeated by a narrow margin .
What ’s next ?
The likely result of the vote is that hundreds of conservative clergy and parishes will split off from the Anglican Communion , defecting to the Roman Catholic church , which has offered to accept them and their prejudices with open arms ( no surprise there ) .
Personally , I do n’t see why the liberal Anglicans are going to such effort to keep them .
Why would you want to share a church with a bunch of bigots ?
If I were a liberal Anglican , I ’d not only be welcoming the conservatives ’ exit , I ’d be encouraging them .
Yes , they ’ll diminish the church ’s numbers and prestige ; yes , the money they contributed will be lost .
But are those the most important things ?
This ridiculous effort to preserve unity at any cost , even if it means coddling the feelings of homophobes and misogynists , suggests that the Anglicans are n’t ready to move into the 21st century after all .
I say to them , kick the bigots out and move on with your lives !
Show the world that you really value justice and equality .
And while you ’re at it , you might want to consider reevaluating that book that gave them those ideas in the first place .
Get rid of that , and you ’d really have a religion worth believing in !
Technical prose is almost immortal .
— Frederick P. Brooks , Jr.
Although programming is a form of literary expression , the relationship between code and its documentation is uneasy at best .
As Figure 1 shows , among the thousands of projects that FreeBSD maintainers have considered important enough to port to the platform , the number of comments per 100 lines varies substantially .
Clearly , as developers our views on how we should document our code are anything but consistent .
Yet , there are universal principles , nifty tools , and useful practices that can benefit us all .
Figure 1 . Comment density in third - party projects ported to the FreeBSD platform .
The code of 307 projects has less than one comment per 100 lines .
The wide distribution of the numbers shows the variance in code documentation practices .
Principles
The golden rule of programming — DRY ( do n’t repeat yourself ) — particularly important when we document our code .
When commenting , we ’re always a couple of keystrokes away from disaster : restating the code ’s function in English .
And that ’s when problems start .
When the code changes , and change it will , the comment is likely to be left behind .
At that point , we have an apparently helpful comment stating something other than what the code does .
Enter confusion .
Developers are more likely to respect and maintain comments that carry their weight , comments that help them navigate the code by outlining an algorithm , elaborating a data structure , or documenting unexpected edge cases .
Useless comments are worse than missing ones , because they occupy screen real estate and sidetrack developers .
It ’s much easier to follow the DRY principle when the code and its documentation live together in the same file .
This was the original idea behind the literate programming movement .
Some might claim that movement failed to gain traction .
The truth is that its main principles are now part of modern programming platforms .
Languages and libraries supporting higher levels of abstraction bring code closer to our design by hiding unneeded implementation details .
Look at legacy software and you ’ll find it riddled with code implementing ( often substandard ) data structures and algorithms .
Modern code simply reuses efficient containers , databases , and services .
Self - documenting code is sometimes a tasteless joke , yet the principle is sound .
Comments should be our last resort for documenting code .
In particular , bad code should be rewritten , not documented .
This reduces evil duplication and spreads the benefits throughout the code .
For instance , although the comment above the zgedi Linpack subroutine explaining that it “ computes the determinant and inverse of a matrix ” is useful , a descriptive name would make all the instances where it ’s called more readable .
The same goes for development processes : these should be automated rather than documented as manual steps .
A Readme file outlining the 15 steps required for releasing a software ’s new version is useful , but build rules that automate those steps would be divine .
This brings me to one last important principle : comments are n’t only for code .
Any software artifact we produce deserves our love and comments .
This includes shell scripts , makefiles , link specifications , batch files , debugger scripts , and configuration files .
As I ’ve seen with my students , following this principle is an indication of a maturing developer and an early sign of professionalism .
Tools
We developers are , by definition , always trying to offload boring work to a computer .
Therefore , there ’s no shortage of tools to handle the documentation ’s drudgery .
Most useful are those that create online documents by extracting code from specially formatted comments .
The use of javadoc is now standard practice in the Java world .
For other languages , doxygen offers similar functionality , and many C and C++ programs rely on it .
Interestingly , both tools ( javadoc via the UMLGraph plug - in ) can also reverse engineer the code to create class diagrams .
This is a case where we get valuable documentation , the proverbial picture worth a thousand words , for free .
Sometimes the problem is so complex that code must take the back seat .
In such cases , instead of extracting readable prose from our source code , we must go the other way around and embed source code into a larger body of explanatory text .
Here , we need tools to format source code in the most readable way .
The choice of tools depends mostly on our text formatting system .
On troff we ’d use vgrind ; on LaTeX , the listings package ; and with DocBook , the programlisting tag .
There are also many tools that will format code for HTML display ; see the list in Wikipedia ’s syntax highlighting article .
Whenever your code contains the definitive version of facts that must be documented , consider using a custom tool to automate the generation of that documentation .
I ’ve used this approach for creating lists of error messages and their explanations , an outline for a product ’s manual , and documentation for a database ’s schema , while colleagues have thus created contracts for complex financial products .
You can follow this path by processing specially formatted code or comments , by coming up with a domain - specific language that will generate both code and documentation , or even by having your code create the documentation at runtime .
The concept is always the same : DRY .
Best Practices
We can easily determine what makes code documentation great by looking at successful software platforms .
Completeness and consistency are by far the most important attributes .
Consider the original Unix manual pages , which documented every system call and library function using the now classic structure : Name , Synopsis , Description , See Also , Diagnostics ( later morphed into Return Values and Errors ) , and Bugs .
The C++ standard template library ( STL ) upped the ante by documenting — apart from concrete entities — definitions , semantics , complexity guarantees , invariants , and models for abstract concepts , like an associative container .
The documentation of Microsoft ’s universally adopted open database connectivity ( ODBC ) specification distinguishes itself by listing all possible error codes for every function ; information that is sadly still not available for other parts of the Windows platform .
Effortless accessibility is another best practice we find in successful platforms .
Again , the Unix manual pages are notable here , because users could view them online on any character terminal ( even a Teletype ) , but also read them in high - quality typeset form .
Perl ’s POD ( plain old documentation ) markup is also a chameleon of sorts , as it can be easily transformed into every imaginable output format .
The documentation of Sun ’s Java platform is remarkable due to the extensive use of hyperlinking .
Its most recent version contains more than 800,000 links .
Finally , we see that successful platforms produce their documentation automatically using a low - overhead process .
Java and Perl include the documentation in specially formatted sections of code ; a valuable practice in itself that most modern languages have adopted .
Using such comments , javadoc processes the 7,000 Sun JDK ( Java development kit ) source files to create more than 12,000 HTML pages containing over 218,000 named elements .
Automated builds ensure that the documentation is always current and consistent .
IDEs such as Eclipse rely on this infrastructure to provide API help during program editing .
In his classic book The Mythical Man-Month : Essays On Software Engineering , Fred Brooks describes how , six months into the IBM OS / 360 implementation , he realized that stacking the 100 five - foot thick copies of the project ’s documentation would tower above Manhattan ’s Time - Life building .
He also found that the maintenance of documentation changes would take a significant part of each workday .
Luckily nowadays , the tools we have at hand make Brook ’s problems sound quaint .
We therefore owe it to our past , present , and future colleagues to create brilliant code documentation .
NEW YORK - Manhattan ’s LGBT pride march , the largest and oldest in the nation , and one of the largest in the world , capped off a the June 19 - 27th Pride Week , which acted both as a celebration of the LGBT community and the fight for LGBT equality .
In many ways , from signs on display to the grand marshals , to the week ’s theme - “ Liberty and Justice for All ” - Pride 2010 took on a more militant stance than in recent years .
A wide cross section of the city ’s LGBT community and its friends were out , from those dressed in business suits to the scantily - clad and flashy .
A wide array of political leaders , Sens. Charles Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand , and celebrities were on hand .
The march ’s grand marshals highlighted some of the most prominent issues facing the community .
Constance McMillen , the Mississippi high school honors student who came to prominence when her school refused to allow her to take her girlfriend to the prom , acted as one of the march ’s grand marshals .
“ I never dreamed so many people would support my fight to take my girlfriend to the prom , ” McMillen said before the march , “ much less that I ’d end up being asked to be grand marshal . ”
Lieutenant Dan Choi , the decorated army veteran who has defied the military ’s notorious anti-gay Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell rule by coming out upon his return home from Iraq served as the was the first - ever openly gay member of the U.S. armed services to lead a pride march .
Choi carried a sign reading , “ Gay by birth , soldier by choice . ”
The final grand marshal was Judy Shepard , founder and president of the Matthew Shepard foundation .
Shepard founded the organization after her son , Matthew , was murdered in the notorious 1998 hate crime at the age of 21 .
This is the first pride march held since the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd , Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act was signed into law by President Barack Obama on October 28 , 2009 .
The bill , a significant victory , finally expanded protection under current hate crime laws to gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgendered people .
Governor David Paterson , who has fought to legalize gay marriage in New York was also prominent at the front of the march .
Heritage of Pride , which organized the week of activities as well as the march , estimated that more than 350 groups , and half a million people , attended the march .
The first pride march in the city was in 1970 , exactly a year after the Stonewall Riots .
The riots were sparked when police attacked the Stonewall Inn , in Greenwich Village , without provocation , as was common at the time .
However , this time the gay community fought back for the first time in U.S. history , marking the birth of the modern American LGBT rights movement .
Other events included a kickoff rally on June 20th , the annual LGBT street fair PrideFest , and a dance on Pier 24 .

The economic downturn has shown , again and again , that global investors and foreign governments turn to the safety of U.S. Treasury securities in a crisis .
The same apparently goes for other foreigners , who socked away $ 100 bills at a rapid pace after the financial crisis struck in late 2008 .
As much as two - thirds of U.S. currency in circulation is held abroad , according to Federal Reserve estimates .
In prepared testimony for a House subcommittee hearing this afternoon , Louise Roseman , director of the Fed ’s Division of Reserve Bank Operations and Payment Systems , laid out the stats :
The foreign component of currency holdings “ increased significantly ” starting in the late 1980s .
In the 1990s , U.S. currency in circulation world - wide grew at a 7.7 % average annual rate primarily due to increases in foreign demand and a demand surge at the end of the decade , she said .
But annual growth rates began to fall in 2001 and fell below 1 % in 2008 , through August .
Among the reasons for the slower demand over the past decade , Ms. Roseman said : “ the value of the dollar decreased against many other major currencies ; international markets gained trust in their own economies and national currencies ; electronic payments displaced some cash usage ; and the effect of the recent recession . ”
That changed in September 2008 , when Lehman Brothers and AIG failed and financial markets went into a downward spiral .
U.S. currency growth went from 0.8 % year - to - date through August 2008 to a whopping 7.7 % for full - year 2008 .
Strong growth continued in 2009 , pushing currency in circulation to almost $ 900 billion by the end of that year from $ 775 billion at the end of 2007 .
As of May 31 of this year , the value of U.S. currency in circulation stood at $ 902.2 billion , or roughly 96 % of total currency and coin in circulation .
The source of the growth was mostly foreign .
Domestic demand for U.S. currency increased in the fall of 2008 , as Americans rushed to their banks , but the federal government ’s expansion of FDIC deposit insurance and other actions quickly brought it back to normal levels .
With the higher international demand , the Fed asked the Bureau of Engraving and Printing ( which executes printing orders from the central bank ) to accelerate production of $ 100 notes during the financial crisis to meet the global needs .
Most of that currency remains in circulation today , the Fed says , even though demand for $ 100 notes from abroad has returned to normal levels .
CHICAGO ( AP ) — Minutes after a suburban Chicago police officer was charged with striking a motorist with his baton , prosecutors handed out copies of a video showing the beating — taken by a dashboard camera on the officer 's own squad car .
In California , after a transit cop and an unruly train passenger slammed against a wall during a struggle and shattered a station window last fall , video from a bystander 's cell phone was all over the Internet before the window was fixed .
The same cell phones , surveillance cameras and other video equipment often used to assist police are also catching officers on tape , changing the nature of police work — for better and worse .
Some say cameras are exposing behavior that police have gotten away with for years .
But others contend the videos , which often show a snippet of an incident , turn officers into villains simply for doing their jobs , making them targets of lawsuits and discipline from bosses buckling to public pressure .
" We tell our officers all the time you 've got to assume that everything you do is going to be videotaped , " said Chicago Police Superintendent Jody Weis .
" Everyone has a cell phone and almost every cell phone has a camera . "
Cook County State 's Attorney Anita Alvarez said the video her office gave to the media on Tuesday shows police officer James Mandarino , from the Chicago suburb of Streamwood , hitting motorist Ronald Bell 15 times after a traffic stop last month .
In the video , Mandarino is seen firing a Taser at a passenger in the car and then striking Bell , who is on his knees with his hands on his head .
Bell suffered a concussion and cuts that required seven stitches .
" It 's a wonderful tool , " Alvarez said of the video , which she says suggests that both men posed no threat to the officer .
Though police - behaving - badly videos have become popular staples of cable news shows and the Internet , Weis said he does n't believe his officers are overly cautious out of fears they 'll be videotaped — and their superiors are not advising them to be .
Quietly , though , some officers say the prospect of being videotaped makes them hesitate even if they know they should act .
" I 've heard from officers who are sent to break up a fight in the street and see a group of people leaning out windows with handheld video cameras ... they go slower and are less aggressive , " said Tom Needham , a Chicago attorney who has represented several police officers .
But University of Chicago law professor Craig Futterman , who has studied police brutality , said videos are helping hold police accountable .
" My own view is that YouTube has done more to expose the reality of police abuse than all the blue - ribbon commissions combined , " said Futterman .
A Chicago police officer who was arrested three years ago in the videotaped beating of a female bartender never would have been charged much less convicted if not for the video , Futterman said .
Anthony Abbate initially was charged with a misdemeanor until the video played across the world .
Ronald Bell 's brother , Stacey Bell , said he doubts the Streamwood officer would have been charged with felony aggravated battery and official misconduct without the video and his brother still would have faced charges of drunken driving and resisting an officer , which were dropped .
" I believe it would have been six witnesses against an officer and it would have been a different story , " said Stacey Bell , who witnessed the alleged beating .
The officer 's attorney declined to comment .
But some caution that incidents caught on tape can misrepresent police work .
" The work of a police officer , even when done properly is ... not pleasant to watch , " said Al O'Leary , spokesman for the Patrolmen 's Benevolent Association in New York City .
" We 've had situations , circumstances where an officer doing his job by the book is caught on video is tagged as brutal .
Sometimes the work is brutal but necessary . "
In California when the Bay Area Rapid Transit officer slammed into a window with a suspect during a violent arrest , the cell phone video — viewed more than 160,000 times on one clip posted on YouTube — ended up exonerating the officer whose actions brought claims of excessive force , a union official said .
" It was n't the suspect 's head that caused the glass to break , " said Jesse Sekhon , BART police officers union president .
" When you freeze the video and enhance it you see it was the suspect punching it with his hand . "
What 's more , video viewers rarely hear the frantic 911 call for help , rocks hurled at an approaching squad car or the countless times police have been called to the same house .
In New York City in 2008 , a man died after falling from a building ledge when police jolted him with a Taser .
Video of the last few moments , including Iman Morales ' fall , was posted on newspaper Web sites and played over and over again on local TV .
But before the cameras were running , " this guy was stark naked , running up and down the fire escape , he tried to get into a woman 's apartment by tearing out the air conditioner , terrifying the woman , " and swung a fluorescent light bulb at police before Lt. Michael Pigott ordered him shot him with the stun gun , said Tom Sullivan , president of the NYPD 's Lieutenants Benevolent Association .
Eight days later , Pigott — stripped of his gun and badge and demoted — committed suicide , leaving a note saying he was trying to protect his men .
His widow , who is suing the police department , said the discipline humiliated her husband .
The department declined to comment .
There is little chance that the videotaped scrutiny of police will slow .
In fact , groups with video cameras follow police in cities all over the country , including Orlando , Fla. , where George Crossley launched Orlando CopWatch in 2006 .
" If we come up on law enforcement , the whole shift knows immediately , " said Crossley .
" They get on the radio ( and say ) ' Watch out for CopWatch . ' "

Two escape from an Argentine jail guarded by a dummy Published duration 20 July 2010
image caption
There are 15 guard towers , but only two are manned
Two prisoners have escaped from a jail in Argentina , reportedly while it was using a dummy to man one of its guard towers .
Prison staff said a lack of resources meant that only two out of their 15 guard towers were occupied at any given time .
They told a local newspaper they put a football with a prison officer 's cap in a third , to create the illusion of an extra guard .
The escaped convicts are on the run .
Walter Pozo and Cesar Andres , who were serving sentences for armed robbery , escaped from the prison in Neuquen province on Saturday .
A prison official , Nestor D'Abramo , said the two had been nearing the end of their respective sentences and were therefore housed in a part of the jail with fewer security measures .
Desperate measures
Mr D'Abramo said Mr Pozo and Mr Andres jumped over a wire fence and climbed over the perimeter wall .
An unnamed prison source quoted by local newspaper Diario Rio Negro on Tuesday , said a lack of resources was to blame for the escape .
According to the source , video cameras monitoring the wall stopped working months ago .
And due to a lack of personnel , only the two towers at either end of the prison were being manned by the guards .
" We 've made a dummy out of a football and a prison officer 's cap , so that the prisoners see its shadow and think they 're being watched , " the source told Rio Negro .
" We named him Wilson , like in the film Cast Away , and put him in one of the towers , " the source added referring to the volleyball Tom Hanks ' character uses for company .
i Phone and iPod Tricks
May 3 , 2010 at 12:11 am Chad Upton
Apple has sold 50 million iPhones and 35 million iPod touch devices , so there are a lot of people who can benefit from these secrets .
This is by no means a complete list , but I wanted to provide some of the most useful and least well known iPhone tricks .
Most of this list also applies to the iPod touch ; if you know someone with one of these , be sure to send them a link to this article .
Double Click the Home Button
The button on the front of the phone is called the “ home ” button .
You can choose what happens when you double click it .
Mine is set to go to my phone favorites , making it quicker to dial my people .
You can get to this screen by going to Settings > General > Home .
As you can see on the option screen above , there is an option for “ iPod Controls . ”
When those are on and the phone is in standby mode ( blank screen ) , you can double click the home button to see the current song / artist / album cover and show audio controls ( volume / forward / back / play / pause ) — see below for example .
If you want to fast forward or rewind , hold the forward / back buttons respectively .
Add a Phone Number Pause
When you enter a phone number in contacts , you can choose an alternate keyboard and click the “ pause ” button , but when you ’re on the dialing keypad , there is no such button .
If you hold down * a comma will appear .
This is a pause , which tells the phone to wait before dialing the numbers that follow .
This allows you to enter your voice mail password or other automated phone system entry before the call .
I discovered this one last night and I have n’t seen it documented anywhere else .
Snap Screen Shot
This is extremely useful if you want to write a post on your blog about iPhone secrets and you need screen captures .
It ’s also great if you want to make wallpaper based on a written note or a anything you display on your phone .
Basically , hold down the home ( front ) button and then press the standby ( top ) button .
You ’ll know it worked because the screen will flash white .
The image will be added to your camera roll .
Power Down and Reset
Your iPhone is a small computer and like a computer , it sometimes requires a restart when it ’s behaving poorly .
Occasionally it freezes or it ca n’t find the network after resuming from airplane mode , remedy this by holding the home and standby buttons for about 10 seconds , until you see a slider to shutdown or an apple icon appears on the screen .
Word and Paragraph Selection
Double - tap a word to select it for cut / copy / delete .
Quadruple - tap a word to select the entire paragraph for cut / copy / delete .
Easy Period
At the end of a sentence , double tap the space bar to get a period and a space .
Apple stole this one from Blackberry and I ’m glad they did .
Quick Punctuation
When typing on the iPhone ’s qwerty keyboard , you obviously need to press the “ .? 123 ” button to get the punctuation keyboard .
After you type a punctuation mark , you have to press the “ ABC ” button to get the qwerty keyboard back .
But , if you press the “ .? 123 ” button and keep your finger down while you slide over to your punctuation mark , and then lift up on that mark , it will add that punctuation mark and switch back to the qwerty keyboard , saving you a couple taps in the process .
Tap title bar to scroll up
When you want to navigate to a new web page , refresh the current one or perform a new search , you have to get back to the top of the page .
The fastest way to do that is tap the title bar , it ’ll take you up .
Fit to Screen
If you liked the space bar secret , you ’ll love this .
Double tap a block of text in Safari to zoom in on that column and fit it to the screen .
This makes it much easier to read text in web pages .
Two finger scrolling
Some web pages have scrollable objects embedded in them , such as large text fields .
If you want to scroll that item without scrolling the whole page , use two fingers on that item to scroll it .
Thanks to Ryan Harper for suggesting some of the tips .

Based on our report about the UVA super - awesome - happy law student , a lot of people seem to be confused about how the internet works .
So , as a public service , let ’s go over the rules :
Rule 1 : If it ends up on the internet , everybody can see it .
Rule 2 : If everybody can see it , it ’s possible everybody will see it .
Rule 3 : After everybody sees it , all bets are off .
Are we clear ?
Okay then .
Tonight we have a story about a couple of kids in California who understood these rules .
They tried to keep their beer pong exploits off the internet .
But the internet never loses , and now they ’re suing …
THR , Esq. reports on a lawsuit filed by people who seem to have just learned about “ globalization . ”
The plaintiffs , Scott Tipton and Christopher Kolb , seemingly play a lot of [ beer pong ] , a sport the complaint notes has “ tremendous appeal to the demographic most coveted by TV programmers and advertisers . ”
Tipton was a law student at the time he filmed the commercial .
He did n’t want prospective employers seeing him execute complex tricks like ricocheting the ping - pong ball four times off various uneven , angled surfaces and into the beer cup with back - spin ( video after the jump ) .
He also did n’t want his conservative grandparents watching .
So the duo agreed to film the commercial , but producers allegedly agreed to restrict it to Danish airwaves .
Oops .
THR has the full commercial .
The guys are amazing .
The Danish commercial ended up on The World ’s Funniest Commercials , and from there went viral .
Scott Tipton ( no relation to state representative Scott Tipton ) is a graduate of Southwestern School of Law .
Arguably he could have filed the suit himself .
But Tipton ’s no fool .
He hired a lawyer , Perrin Disner ( Michigan ’ 06 ) .
Here ’s how Disner described the claims to Above the Law :
Checking the release granted by a performer in an original work — and supplementing it if necessary — is so simple and obvious a step that it should be automatic for any producer putting together a derivative work like this .
Plaintiffs were n’t celebrities but , of course , in addition to an expectation of privacy , private individuals are entitled to the same right of publicity that celebrities enjoy .
The fact that the defendants here were so cavalierly dismissive of plaintiffs ’ rights leads us to wonder whether they cleared the rights of any of the performers whose foreign commercials made it onto the show .
Well , maybe these guys will recover some money .
But the whole “ do n’t want potential employers to see it ” thing ?
Yeah , that ’s pretty much gone .
See “ the rules , ” supra .
Anybody up for a game ?
Ten -cup , player ’s choice consolidation , single shot redemption .
Keep your elbows back and meet me at Whiskey River this weekend .
Beer pong players sue over inclusion in ‘ World ’s Funniest Commercials ’ [ THR , Esq. / Hollywood Reporter ]

Rocks examined by NASA 's Spirit Mars Rover hold evidence of a wet , non-acidic ancient environment that may have been favorable for life .
Confirming this mineral clue took four years of analysis by several scientists .
An outcrop that Spirit examined in late 2005 revealed high concentrations of carbonate , which originates in wet , near - neutral conditions , but dissolves in acid .
The ancient water indicated by this find was not acidic .
NASA 's rovers have found other evidence of formerly wet Martian environments .
However the data for those environments indicate conditions that may have been acidic .
In other cases , the conditions were definitely acidic , and therefore less favorable as habitats for life .
Laboratory tests helped confirm the carbonate identification .
The findings were published June 3 by the journal Science .
" This is one of the most significant findings by the rovers , " said Steve Squyres of Cornell University in Ithaca , N.Y .
Squyres is principal investigator for the Mars twin rovers , Spirit and Opportunity , and a co-author of the new report .
" A substantial carbonate deposit in a Mars outcrop tells us that conditions that could have been quite favorable for life were present at one time in that place . "
Spirit inspected rock outcrops , including one scientists called Comanche , along the rover 's route from the top of Husband Hill to the vicinity of the Home Plate plateau which Spirit has studied since 2006 .
Magnesium iron carbonate makes up about one - fourth of the measured volume in Comanche .
That is a tenfold higher concentration than any previously identified for carbonate in a Martian rock .
advertisement
" We used detective work combining results from three spectrometers to lock this down , " said Dick Morris , lead author of the report and a member of a rover science team at NASA 's Johnson Space Center in Houston .
"
The instruments gave us multiple , interlocking ways of confirming the magnesium iron carbonate , with a good handle on how much there is . "
Massive carbonate deposits on Mars have been sought for years without much success .
Numerous channels apparently carved by flows of liquid water on ancient Mars suggest the planet was formerly warmer , thanks to greenhouse warming from a thicker atmosphere than exists now .
The ancient , dense Martian atmosphere was probably rich in carbon dioxide , because that gas makes up nearly all the modern , very thin atmosphere .
It is important to determine where most of the carbon dioxide went .
Some theorize it departed to space .
Others hypothesize that it left the atmosphere by the mixing of carbon dioxide with water under conditions that led to forming carbonate minerals .
That possibility , plus finding small amounts of carbonate in meteorites that originated from Mars , led to expectations in the 1990s that carbonate would be abundant on Mars .
However , mineral - mapping spectrometers on orbiters since then have found evidence of localized carbonate deposits in only one area , plus small amounts distributed globally in Martian dust .
Morris suspected iron - bearing carbonate at Comanche years ago from inspection of the rock with Spirit 's Moessbauerpectrometer , which provides information about iron - containing minerals .
Confirming evidence from other instruments emerged slowly .
The instrument with the best capability for detecting carbonates , the Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer , had its mirror contaminated with dust earlier in 2005 , during a wind event that also cleaned Spirit 's solar panels .
" It was like looking through dirty glasses , " said Steve Ruff of Arizona State University in Tempe , Ariz . , another co-author of the report .
" We could tell there was something very different about Comanche compared with other outcrops we had seen , but we could n't tell what it was until we developed a correction method to account for the dust on the mirror . "
Spirit's Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer instrument detected a high concentration of light elements , a group including carbon and oxygen , that helped quantify the carbonate content .
The rovers landed on Mars in January 2004 for missions originally planned to last three months .
Spirit has been out of communication since March 22 and is in a low - power hibernation status during Martian winter .
Opportunity is making steady progress toward a large crater , Endeavour , which is about seven miles away .
NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , manages the Mars Exploration Rovers for the agency 's Science Mission Directorate in Washington .

The White House said Wednesday that stimulus act spending finally has kicked into high gear and as of June 30 had grown the economy by up to 3.2 percent and created up to 3.6 million jobs .
The report , the fourth quarterly analysis from the White House , comes as President Obama is trying to rehabilitate the image of the embattled $ 862 billion spending bill .
“ The Recovery Act has played a key role in the turnaround of the economy that has been occurring over the past year , ” the White House Council of Economic Advisors said in the report .
Republicans argue that the economy is still sluggish and that the stimulus has failed to meet even the administration ’s original goals .
Before the law passed , the White House said unemployment would peak at 8 percent if Congress passed the stimulus .
Instead , it rose past 10 percent and now stands at 9.5 percent .
Meanwhile , polls show voters do n’t credit the stimulus with helping much .
Trying to turn those perceptions around , the administration is engaged in a summer - long effort to highlight projects being funded by the Recovery Act .
On Thursday Mr. Obama will travel to Holland , Mich. , for groundbreaking of a new plant that will build batteries for electric vehicles .
The report says that as of June 30 , $ 480.3 billion had been either paid out in spending or allocated as tax cuts .
Of the 3.6 million jobs the White House says were created , just 800,000 of them are from public works projects such as building roads and bridges .
The report says $ 86 billion has been spent on those projects , which works out to about $ 107,500 per job .

The Government is reportedly looking at making the nation 's prisons smoke free from next year .
Corrections Minister Judith Collins was expected to announce a 12 - month preparation plan , leading up to smoking being banned in prisons by next July , the Herald on Sunday reported .
The Corrections Department was concerned taxpayers could be liable for legal action from prison officers exposed to inmates ' second - hand smoke an also the potential threat of lawsuits from non-smoking prisoners , bunking with prisoners who do smoke .
Other than Top Gun , no movie molded my childhood moreso than the Karate Kid .
Thanks to Daniel - san and Mr. Miyagi , I spent a good portion of my early years attending Karate classes , practicing the crane kick in my back yard on tree stumps , and cleaning the windows of our house only using the “ wax on , wax off ” motion .
To say I was obsessed with the Karate Kid would be an understatement .
Why did this movie leave such a lasting impression on me ?
Let ’s see : a skinny , out - of - shape kid goes against the popular crowd ( Cobra Kai ) , trains in an unorthodox manner ( thanks to Mr. Miyagi ) , and ultimately levels up his life while winning the girl of his dreams ( and kicking the crap out of the town bully ) .
That ’s pretty much every nerd ’s dream , and I LOVE a good underdog story .
Sure , the new Cobra - Kai show on YouTube is absolutely incredible , but nothing will ever top the original in my eyes .
Here are five life lessons we can learn from Mr. Miayagi , Daniel - san , and the Karate Kid .
“ Either you karate do ‘ yes ’ or karate do ‘ no . ’
You karate do ‘ guess so , ’ * squish ! * ”
When Mr. Miyagi asked Daniel if he was ready to learn Karate , Daniel ’s response of “ I guess so ” pissed him off to no end .
The old man compared Daniel ’s half - assed response to walking down a road : walking on the left side of the road is fine , walking on the right side of the road is fine , but walking down the middle of the road will eventually get you squished .
Like Yoda has taught us , “ Do or do not .
There is no try . ”
The people who “ try to get in shape ” or say “ I guess I ’ll get in shape ” will most likely fail .
If you want to lose weight and level up your life , you need to attack it with 100 % of your heart and mind .
Giving it a shot for a week or two is n’t going to get you results , and thinking about it only half of the time is n’t going to get you where you want to be either .
This journey needs to become part of who you are :
Mentally , you ’re focused .
You have specific goals in mind that you want to accomplish , and then you set out to do them .
Whether it ’s win the All - Valley Karate Tournament , lose 50 pounds , and / or run a marathon , you must recognize the fact that every day is an opportunity for you to get one step closer .
You have specific goals in mind that you want to accomplish , and then you set out to do them .
Whether it ’s win the All - Valley Karate Tournament , lose 50 pounds , and / or run a marathon , you must recognize the fact that every day is an opportunity for you to get one step closer .
You ’re not “ on a diet . ”
Instead , you ’re making conscious decisions every day to eat healthier food and follow a plan that you can stick with indefinitely .
Instead , you ’re making conscious decisions every day to eat healthier food and follow a plan that you can stick with indefinitely .
You ’re training with conviction .
Half - assing it on a treadmill while chugging a Gatorade does n’t count as a workout .
When exercising , be focused and efficient – if you pushed hard enough there should be sweat dripping off of you by the the time you ’re done .
“ First learn stand , then learn fly .
Nature rule , Daniel - san , not mine . ”
Daniel desperately wanted to learn how to do the crane kick after just a few lessons .
Miyagi responded that there ’s a specific order of things in Karate just like in nature .
It is nature ’s progression that allows animals to survive in the wild , and it ’s Karate ’s progression that would ultimately allow Daniel - san to succeed as a student .
Had Miyagi put the kid up on the stump and forced him to learn a Crane Kick before anything else , he might have failed miserably and given up .
Instead , he taught Daniel progressively more difficult strikes , balancing techniques , and blocks , built up his confidence , and only then did he allow Daniel - san to learn the Crane Kick .
Your life is no different .
If you ’re 200 pounds overweight , do n’t try to run a marathon tomorrow .
Instead , you must learn to walk a mile , then two , then learn to run a 5 k , 10 k , half - marathon , and finally a full marathon .
Baby steps !
If you want to get stronger , do n’t go into a gym and load 300 pounds onto a bar to bench press .
Instead , start with an small amount of weight , learn the proper movement , and progress steadily each week , getting stronger and building momentum until you reach your goal .
If you want to acquire a new skill – Parkour , Capoeira , Rock Climbing , whatever – check your ego at the door .
Take the beginner class , do n’t overestimate your skills , and advance from there .
Who cares if you ’re taking a Karate class with a bunch of 6 - year olds , at least you do n’t have to wait for your mom to come pick you up after ( hopefully ) .
“ In Okinawa , all Miyagi know two things : fish and karate . ”
Growing up in Okinawa , Mr. Miyagi learned two things from his father : fishing , and karate .
How did he find time to become a great Karate master AND a great fisherman ?
Because he found a good balance in his life and recognized the importance of having both .
[ Side note : a great fisherman who happens to also be in incredible shape … sounds a lot like my Ninja Warrior hero , Makoto Nagano ! ]
Personally , I enjoy fitness and exercise , but I am no gym rat .
In fact , I only go to the gym three times a week for about an hour each time .
Being in shape is part of my life , but it ’s not the only thing that makes me happy .
I consider myself more of a gamer / nerd / writer / piano player / gambler / artist / reader who happens to also be in pretty good shape .
I encourage you to find that balance in your life as well .
You can still be a great …
father , husband , wife , mother , friend , employee , and / or boss while having fun …
playing video games , taking photography classes , and / or going to the movies …
while ALSO living a healthy lifestyle .
Good time management and a solid balance of work and fun is crucial to your happiness .
As I ’ve said previously , find a way to incorporate a healthy lifestyle into what you are , but not at the expense of who you are .
Mr. Miyagi said it best : “ Lesson not just karate only .
Lesson for whole life .
Whole life have a balance , everything be better . ”
“ Hey , what kind of belt do you have ? ” “ Canvas .
JC Penney , $ 3.98 .
You like ? ”
When asked by Daniel - san what kind of belt he had , Miyagi gave a smart - ass answer that was also quite deep philosophically .
How the hell does one of the best Karate teachers out there not have any idea what level belt he is ?
Because at the end of the day it just does n’t matter .
Competitions , contests , and achievements are great motivators to help you move forward , but never forget that the only person you ’re really competing with when it comes to your health is yourself .
Who cares if you ran in a 5 k race and got beat by a 10 - year old girl ?
Who cares if you can only bench 20 pounds while the cute girl next to you is putting up 135 for a set of 10 ?
After you ’ve checked your ego ( a common theme today ) , think of it like this :
So you got beat by a 10 year old in a 5 k .
Suck it up , remember your time from this race , and make sure you run your next race at least one second faster .
If you ’re getting faster , that ’s all that matters .
Suck it up , remember your time from this race , and make sure you run your next race at least one second faster .
If you ’re getting faster , that ’s all that matters .
So you ’re getting ‘ outlifted ’ at the gym .
Suck it up , remember how much you lifted and how many times you lifted it , and then next time make sure you either lift more weight or the same amount for more repetitions .
If you ’re getting stronger , that ’s all that matters .
Suck it up , remember how much you lifted and how many times you lifted it , and then next time make sure you either lift more weight or the same amount for more repetitions .
If you ’re getting stronger , that ’s all that matters .
So you only lost one pound this week while your cubicle - mate lost 5 pounds .
Suck it up , remember that you still lost weight , and continue to find ways to level up your life and the success will follow .
If you ’re making progress , that ’s all that matters .
Having a class system to determine your level is nice , but do n’t let it be the only benchmark you use to determine your success .
No matter how big , slow or weak you are compared to those around you , it really only matters if you ’re getting healthier , faster , and stronger compared to the You from yesterday .
“ You mean there were times when you were scared to fight ? ” “ Always scared . ”
Mr. Miyagi , the guy who could single - handedly defeat six Cobra Kai at once , was always scared to fight .
And yet , he still took care of business when necessary .
This might be the most important lesson of all and one I ’ll always remember .
We ’re surrounded these days with images and movies of heroic men who march bravely into battle without an ounce of fear :
Thanks to these heroes , it ’s tough to not feel inadequate when that initial fear sets in , no matter how inconsequential the action you ’re afraid of might be .
Maybe you ’re scared to go to the gym for the first time , try rock climbing , eat sushi , wear a bathing suit , run a marathon , ask out that cute waitress , whatever .
Do n’t worry ; it happens to everybody .
What ’s not okay is to allow that fear to become so irrationally over - sized in your mind that it paralyzes you from taking action .
Courage is not being fearless , but rather carrying on to perform the action despite being afraid .
As Miyagi said in Karate Kid III : “ It ’s okay to lose to opponent .
It ’s never okay to lose to FEAR ! ”
Unless it ’s going to actually kill you , sometimes you just have to get out of your head , turn off your brain , and go for it .
What movie defined your childhood ?
Hopefully I ’m not the only one around here that practiced the crane kick in his back yard .
Sure The Karate Kid Parts II and III were n’t nearly as good , but Part II gave us Peter Cetera and The Glory of Love , and Part III gave us the psychopath that is Terry Silver .
What ’s not to like !
This is one movie from my childhood that I ’ll never forget .
What was yours , and what did you learn from it ?

A naked man armed with a gun caused chaos on a section of I - 80 in Wyoming , ending with at least three people injured and the suspect under arrest , police said .
Armando Cano , 26 , of Moroni , Utah , was arrested Wednesday night on suspicion of attacking several motorists on a desolate stretch of highway between Rawlins and Green River , according to a media release from the Wyoming Highway Patrol , which referred to the incident as a “ bizarre series of events . ”
Cano , who is being held at the Sweetwater County Detention Facility in Green River , faces multiple criminal charges including : attempted manslaughter ; driving under the influence ; reckless driving ; resisting arrest ; and promoting obscenity .
During the far - flung spree , shots were fired , vehicles were intentionally rammed , one person was cut with shattered glass and another was stabbed in the leg before authorities were able to subdue the agitated and mobile suspect .
Highway patrol dispatchers started getting calls about 9 p.m.
Wednesday about a white car that had been “ swerving all over the highway and had run off the road ” about 33 miles west of Rawlins , the highway patrol said .
The driver of the car , later identified as Cano , got out of the car and ran across the highway several times in front of passing vehicles .
Dispatchers then started fielding reports that the man was “ standing out in the roadway and was wearing no clothes . ”
Before troopers could arrive , a nude Cano got into a fight with a motorist who had stopped .
He then jumped into his own car and started driving east on the highway .
About 17 miles away , Cano “ intentionally ” rammed a vehicle with a couple from Cheyenne in it .
When both vehicles stopped , Cano , still naked , attempted to get into the couple ’s vehicle .
Meanwhile , a woman driving by who saw the crash stopped to help .
Cano forced his way into her vehicle and “ found a 9 mm semi-automatic handgun in the female ’s vehicle and began firing it from inside the vehicle out the closed windows , ” the highway patrol said .
Cano fired one round , narrowly missing the female driver .
He fired a second round out the side window of the vehicle , and allegedly fired at the vehicle he had rammed , police said .
The woman fled her vehicle , from which he was firing shots , on foot .
The couple from Cheyenne , still in their rammed vehicle , tried to drive away from the chaotic scene , but Cano jumped back into his car and began chasing them .
He caught up and rammed the couple ’s vehicle once again , police said .
Still armed with the gun , Cano then drove his own car about three miles down the highway , stopped , got out and lay down naked in the road .
At some the gun jammed .
He then got up and threw an unknown object at a passing vehicle , shattering the driver ’s window .
As a passerby tried to shepherd Cano off the highway , the suspect stabbed the passerby in the leg with an unknown sharp object .
Several passing truck drivers and motorists stopped and Cano , now armed with a pipe , began breaking out windows of vehicles .
A truck driver suffered cuts at this point , police said .
A trooper caught up with the rolling mayhem , attempted to take Cano into custody , and a struggle ensued .
Truck drivers helped the trooper wrestle Cano , who stands 6 - feet - tall and weighs 240 pounds , to the ground , and he was handcuffed .
A Sweetwater County Sheriff ’s deputy and other law officers arrived a short time later .
The female driver who owns the handgun had difficulty breathing after the incident and was taken by ambulance to Memorial Hospital in Rawlins .
Cano was also taken to the hospital to be treated for “ minor ” injuries .
Troopers found the handgun taken from the woman in Cano ’s vehicle .
Toxicology results on Cano have not been completed .

Here ’s a low tech demo of the power of web workers .
A hundred flies will swarm randomly .
Ones that get too high get sleepy , ones that sink too low get re-caffeinated and ones that cover the least distance will perish .
Sourcecode is gisted on GitHub
I should start by saying this was not trivial to write .
As we will see the web workers API is disarmingly simple but the tripwires are many .
The biggest issue is the lack of useful debug support because the global worker object exists in a vacuum .
The basics
Your browser can be serviced by one or more web workers .
A worker will perform non-DOM related tasks in a separate thread .
This means worker processes are performed asynchronously with respect to the browser ( in fact the worker has no access to the browser ’s window object , the equivalent global object being self which references the worker ) .
The implications are exciting .
Lengthy computational tasks can be undertaken with no effect on browser responsiveness .
A web worker is a .js file which you set as an attribute of a worker object .
var worker = new Worker ( " buzzWorker.js " ) ;
The browser and the worker speak the same language .
Messages are sent and received using postMessage and onMessage respectively
// on the browser worker . onmessage = function(e ) { updateThing ( e.data ) ; } var invokeWorker = function ( action ) { worker .
postMessage ({ ' action ' : action , ' things ' : things } ) ; }
// on the worker { //.... updates.maxDy = 2 ; updates.symbol = '*' ; postMessage ( updates ) ; } var onmessage = function(e ) { things = e.data.things ; actions[e.data.action ] ( ) ; }
By these means data and instructions can be passed to and fro between browser and worker .
Data streaming is by value not by reference .
The data is serialized in transit and rebuilt as a new but ( hopefully ) identical object on the other side .
In theory any serialize - able non-DOM object can be streamed .
Mozilla , Chrome 5 and Safari 5 support posting of complex objects to workers ( thanks to Rick Waldron and Charles Lehner for pointing out bugs in my code which webkit browsers objected to )
IE8 has no web worker support .
The app
The crazy flies app makes use of a web worker to analyze and acting upon the latest data pattern ( i.e. which flies are where ) while the browser focuses on buzzing them around the screen as fast as possible .
Each fly is an instance of a Thing object which recursively moves itself around the screen in a random fashion .
Every second the browser posts four instructions to the worker :
intervals [ 0 ] = window.setInterval(invokeWorker.curry('updatePaths '),1000 ) ; intervals [ 1 ] = window.setInterval(invokeWorker.curry('makeHighestSleepy ') ,1000 ) , intervals [ 2 ] = window.setInterval(invokeWorker.curry(' makeLowestBuzzy ') ,1000 ) ; intervals [ 3 ] = window.setInterval(invokeWorker.curry (' killSlowest ' ) ,1000 ) ;
The first instruction updates the approximate total distance traveled by each living Thing .
The other three perform further analysis on the state of Things and then send back the appropriate data to the browser so that it can modify the flies .
The web worker does make a difference .
Every second it uses Pythagoras ’ theorem to increment the net path - length of each fly and every second it is sorting arrays three ways to find the highest lowest and least traveled flies .
When I prototyped the app I first had all processes running in the browser .
It limped along with a lengthy freeze every second .
In contrast , with a web worker employed the scene plays out seamlessly on my computer ( though the fluency may vary based on your processing speed ) .
Conclusion
JavaScript web workers are in their infancy and the use cases are limited ( top of my wish - list is worker partitioning of the browser itself so that DOM events could run in separate threads ) .
Browser support varies from patchy to non-existent and debugging is tough .
It ’s too early to claim web workers as an industrial strength solution but the outlook is promising , and in the meantime they ’re fun to mess around with .
Oscar - Nominated Director , Andy Abrahams , along with award - winning production company , Open - Eye Pictures , has joined the fight against the barbaric Dog Torture Trade across South East Asia .
Dog
War is the first of its kind , a film currently in production that looks set to take the world by storm .
It follows a team of American Special Op Veterans who travel to South Korea , joining forces with Korean dog lovers and employing commando tactics to put an end to the brutal , yet booming , practice .
Often working undercover , they enter the shadow planes of this dark industry in a desperate quest to make change .
“ They believe that the more torture the dog goes through , the stronger their viagra , ” says one of the vets in the film , commenting on why dog meat is such a popular dish among the more middle - aged man of South Korea .
Courageous and controversial in equal measure , Dog War will undoubtedly create a stir among both the international community and across South East Asia , where every year over thirty million dogs are stolen from their homes and subjected to unimaginable torture , including being burned , boiled and skinned alive .
The fight against the Dog Torture Trade appears to be growing among the international community as more and more stories emerge from the Far - east which provoke outrage .
In China , ripping dogs from their owners ’ arms and beating them to death in front of them is the norm ; in Vietnam , Christmas and New Years are the worst time for dogs as the Catholic Church pays a lot of money to eat pets and strays that have been stolen and killed ; in Cambodia , mass Chinese settlers have crossed over the border , bringing inhumane slaughtering methods with them , butchering local dogs , pets and strays alike .
But the outrage and indignation are growing .
The US government ’s focus on the matter grew substantially in 2018 .
House Resolution 401 in the United States sees the US government openly objecting to this cruelty .
Only a few weeks ago , President Trump banned the consumption of dogs and cats , making the USA ’s position very clear and sending a loud message to the Far-east : eating companion animals is wrong .
In the UK , pressure is on Theresa May to enact a similar ban , notably from the likes of Sir Alan Duncan of the Foreign Office and Dr Lisa Cameron MP .
Now , with the Dog War film set to explode on our screens , outrage among our media sector appears imminent .
Is it cultural ?
This is the excuse given by many when challenged on the Dog Torture Trade .
Could culture be justification for something that provokes such astronomical outrage among society and governments alike ?
Is culture ever an excuse for cruelty ?
Millions of people across South East Asia want this cruelty to come to an end , just as much as internationals do .
Millions of them would be deeply offended if we suggested it was in their culture to torture dogs ; millions more would be shocked if they knew just how much of an uproar this practice is generating across the world , for many of them do not know .
The Far - eastern continent is in a civil war over dogs – it ’s up to us to decide whose side we want to be on .
Watch Dog War to decide for yourself .
Some viewers may find the following scenes upsetting .

As one of the pioneers of a ' 3 strikes ' mechanism for dealing with P2P piracy , France is moving closer to its full implementation .
In order to warn and punish alleged file - sharers , it will first be necessary to monitor them whilst engaged in infringement .
The scope of that monitoring has just been confirmed .
As reported earlier this year , anti-piracy outfit Trident Media Guard has been chosen by the entertainment industry to track and report illegal file - sharers in France .
The company , previously better known for its pollution of file - sharing networks with fake data , will be providing evidence for use under the country ’s 3 strikes ‘ Hadopi ’ legislation .
From the sidelines of a conference , Thierry Desurmont from rights collecting group SACEM has just confirmed the scope of TMG ’s upcoming monitoring regime .
TMG ’s tracking systems are able to monitor several different file - sharing networks , but the priority will undoubtedly fall on BitTorrent , eD2 K ( eDonkey / eMule ) and Gnutella ( e.g LimeWire ) .
Fears that TMG would be monitoring so - called cyberlocker sites ( e.g Rapidshare ) were not true .
Even if they could , the company does not have permission to do so .
TMG will concentrate purely on P2P .
“ We reached an agreement with TMG and [ the company ] will monitor the IP addresses used for illicit file - sharing from a basic reference work , ” explained Thierry Desurmont from rights collecting group SACEM .
“ There is the music industry and the audiovisual sector .
For the music industry ( SCPP , SPPF , SACEM , SDRM ) , there will be a base consisting of 5,000 works [ from a back catalogue , described as ‘ golds ’ ] and 5000 which will be for renewal .
For broadcasting , the base formed by [ anti- piracy group ] ALPA will be 200 works . ”
The monitoring process will see TMG working up to capacity , tracking an eye - watering 18,250,000 infringements per year – that ’s 50,000 per day , every day .
“ Our agreements provide that TMG should be able to provide 25,000 incidents per day for music , 25,000 for audiovisual .
This goal will be preceded by a phase of increasing power to calibrate the process , ” explained Desurmont .
Quite how the paperwork side of the operation will hold up to such lofty goals remains to be seen .
The French will be hoping that the initial ‘ first and second strike ’ warnings work or the judges dealing with the fines and disconnections could be in for a hell of a lot of overtime .
Fans angry that ' sexiest journalist in world ' was behind his goal when winner was scored
After widely being blamed for the haphazard manner of Switzerland 's winning goal in Spain 's opening World Cup match , goalkeeper and captain Iker Casillas faced a further backlash when fans claimed he was distracted by his TV presenter girlfriend who was seen lingering behind the goal during the match .
But if that was n't bad enough the stopper was then harangued by Sara Carbonero live on television .
The glamorous sports presenter - voted the sexiest journalist in the world - demanded to know exactly what had gone wrong in the shock defeat by Switzerland .
[ caption ]
' How did you muck that up ? ' , she asked , leaving Casilllas squirming in embarrassment .
' I do n't know what to say , ' he said , unable to look her in the eye .
' I do n't know if this defeat will have consequences .
The dressing room is fed up .'
Casillas then slunk off abashed to console himself after the 1 - 0 defeat which came when former Manchester City man Gelson Fernandes bundled home early in the second half .
But he was n't the only one facing questions .
His 25 - year - old girlfriend , a reporter for the Telecinco channel , soon found herself the subject of another Spanish inquisition .
[ caption ]
Casilllas 's attempts to stop Gelson Fernandes 's goal proved futile
Irate fans claimed her presence on the sidelines - directly behind Casillas - had distracted him .
Websites were inundated with comments claiming his mind may have been on ' other things '
Casillas and Carbonero started dating at the Confederations Cup in South Africa last year .
Her presence at this year 's World Cup prompted controversy as Spanish WAGs - known as ' esposas y novias ' - typically do not travel with the national side .
[ caption ]
Some claimed she could onyl be a distraction to Casillas .
But the brunette , the most high - profile Spanish WAG and a tabloid favourite , was quick to rebuff the criticism .
' Can I destabilise the team ?
I think it is nonsense , ' she said in an interview on Telecinco .
Spain , the joint favourite championship favourite with Brazil , now faces a difficult path in the World Cup .
Only three countries have ever reached the final after losing their opening match .
Shock : Spanish goalkeeper Iker Casillas looks shocked as his girlfriend Sara Carbonero , a TV journalist , asks him how he managed to ' muck it up ' after the side 's 1 - 0 World Cup loss to Switzerland
Banks around the world must refinance more than $ 5 trillion of debts in the coming three years , a massive rollover that poses threats to financial stability and growth .
The need to replace these debts , which are medium and long term , will place pressure on bank profit spreads and in turn may either prompt deleveraging , where banks sell assets that they can no longer economically finance , or simply lead to a bout of credit rationing , where borrowers must pay more to borrow , thus crimping investment and economic growth .
For banks in the UK , according to the Bank of England Financial Stability Report , the refinancings amount to about $ 1.2 trillion by the end of 2012 .
If banks in Britain raise funds at the same pace they have been this year , they will only collect half of their needs in time .
This is even before the fact that the banks need desperately to turn some of their riskier short - term funding into more reliable funding with a longer maturity .
“ If funding costs increase dramatically , which is perfectly possible in what could be pretty febrile market conditions , that will hit profitability ( and the banks ability to raise capital organically ) until they are able to re-price loans and facilities , ” according to Richard Barwell , an economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland in London .
“ And to the extent that banks are unwilling or unable to roll over funds that would trigger forced deleveraging .
Both outcomes imply a sharp contraction in credit conditions for those within and outside financial markets , putting considerable downward pressure on activity and asset prices . ”
Banks outside of Britain are perhaps doing marginally better in meeting their needs , but still face an uphill struggle .
U.S. banks have issued $ 230 billion of debts in the first five months of the year , about 60 percent of the rate they need to achieve over the three year period .
Euro zone banks have issued $ 133 billion , or about 70 percent of their needed run rate .
One easy to see consequence is that , all things being equal , the cost for banks to issue debt should rise , as should competition among banks for consumer deposits .
It is possible that a global desire to save more helps to blunt this effect , but even so the macroeconomic effect and the effect on asset prices will both be strongly downward .
BANKS WILL HAVE THEIR FUNDS
The track record of the past three years tells us one thing is likely : the banks will get their money , courtesy of government support if needed .
Unless there is a profound sovereign debt crisis , we can count on governments taking the needed steps to see that the banking system does not fall over for lack of funding .
So , if liquidity or support schemes need to be extended or invented anew , they will be .
But a banking system that has not fallen over , while a precondition for strong economic growth , is not in and of it self sufficient to cause strong economic growth .
Expensive funding and a rising term premium will stunt growth and they will impose a haircut on risk asset prices .
Viewed another way , however , higher funding costs for banks is really nothing other than the market demanding a different capital structure from banks .
It is not simply that a lot of money needs raising all at the same time , but rather that the people who have in the past supplied the money have a new appreciation of the risks in lending to banks , or should that simply be of the risks of lending .
The Financial Stability Report also looks at the costs and benefits of higher amounts of capital in banking .
The benefits are straightforward : a reduced chance of systemic crises .
Costs are thornier , but also quite high .
The BOE used an assumption that for every 7 basis points of additional lending spread charged by banks should create a 0.1 percent permanent reduction of GDP .
On their estimates upping capital in banking by one percent then equates to present value cost of about 4.0 percent of UK GDP .
This puts into perspective not just how challenging it will be to create growth going forward , but just how artificially growth during the boom was goosed by very loose and easy lending .
For the UK and for Europe , this will be happening at the same time that fiscal austerity programmes will be dampening growth .
Something has to give , and it will probably be monetary policy .
Look for extraordinarily low rates for a very long time , and for new and bigger quantitative easing programmes .
A note from your editor
This article brought to you by LWN subscribers Subscribers to LWN .
net made this article — and everything that surrounds it — possible .
If you appreciate our content , please buy a subscription and make the next set of articles possible .
Running a subscription - oriented publication on the net is an interesting challenge , to say the least .
Here at LWN , thanks to the generosity of our readers , we have actually made a qualified success of it .
Even more challenging , though , is asking those readers to pay more in uncertain economic times and in an industry where prices normally fall .
Please read on for a discussion of what we 're doing and why .
But first !
Let us try to distract you with shiny stuff .
We have added a few new features to the site :
The much - requested comment filtering feature has been added for subscribers at the " professional hacker " level or above .
When filtering is enabled , comments posted by selected readers ( and any replies ) will be replaced by a small placeholder indicating how many comments have been hidden .
Click on the " + " icon to expose the filtered subtree .
Please note that JavaScript support is required to un -filter specific comment subtrees .
JavaScript was really the only way to support that functionality well ; please rest assured that we remain as determined as ever that JavaScript will never be required to read LWN 's content .
Filtering options ( including the list of readers to filter ) are managed in the My Account area .
Subscribers at the " project leader " level can now request email notifications for comments posted anywhere - including all comments posted to a given article .
These subscribers will see a new " receive comments as email " button below each article which can be used to populate their inboxes with LWN discussion .
Note that comment filtering , if active , is applied to comments sent via email .
Tired of advertisements ?
Subscribers at or above the " professional hacker " level can now turn off all ads on the site .
LWN moved to the subscription model in September 2002 , well over seven years ago .
The basic individual subscription rate was established at $ 5 / month then , and has not changed since .
Over that time , baseline inflation in the US has added up to just over 20 % ( according to the US government , which would never lie to us about a thing like this ) , so that $ 5 buys rather less than it did then .
The value of the dollar has also declined significantly since 2002 , so the large portion of our readership which pays in other currencies has seen a nice price decrease .
That 's even still true for people in the Euro zone .
Additionally , official inflation rates become totally irrelevant when it comes to large expenses like health insurance , which went up 40 % last year alone .
Much to our surprise , the current US administration has not actually fixed that problem for us .
All this explains why LWN lost an editor in March despite the fact that our readers have been incredibly loyal to us during the whole economic roller coaster ride .
We have stabilized our finances , but we find ourselves in a position of working at a pace which will certainly lead to eventual burnout .
Something needs to change to enable us to address those problems and not only keep LWN alive but continue to make it better in the coming years .
So we will be increasing our subscription rates as of June 14 , 2010 .
The new individual " Professional Hacker " rate will be $ 7 / month , with the other rates scaled accordingly .
This increase , we hope , will offset the increases we have seen , enable us to rebuild our finances , and , eventually , allow us to bring staff back to its previous level .
But that only works if our subscribers do not leave in disgust ; needless to say , we will hope you will stay with us .
In return , we 'll make the best of the increase and , with any luck at all , not do it again for a very long time .
To answer a couple of anticipated questions : prepaid subscriptions remain valid for the purchased period ; the increase only affects subscriptions purchased on or after June 14 .
Monthly subscriptions are a bit more complicated .
We have never believed that our readers wanted to give us permission to charge their cards forever , so monthly subscriptions have always had a maximum number of authorized charges associated with them .
All monthly subscribers will continue to be charged the old rate for the number of months they had authorized before this announcement was posted .
Only when those subscribers explicitly authorize further charges will the new rate come into effect .
Rates for group subscriptions will change by a roughly proportional amount ; we will be contacting our group subscribers at renewal time to discuss the new rates .
We 're a little nervous about this change ; it 's hard to ask for more from the people who have already supported us so well for so long .
But we cannot really find a way around it .
We very much hope that you will stick with us as we work to build an even better and more interesting LWN in the future .
The Luna Ring : Electric power generated by a belt of solar cells around the lunar equator would be transmitted and beamed to the Earth from the near side of the Moon .
Image credit : Shimizu Corporation .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
The Shimizu Corporation , a Japanese construction firm , has recently proposed a plan to harness solar energy on a larger scale than almost any previously proposed concept .
Their ambitious plan involves building a belt of solar cells around the Moon ’s 6,800 - mile ( 11,000 - kilometer ) equator , converting the electricity to powerful microwaves and lasers to be beamed at Earth , and finally converting the beams back to electricity at terrestrial power stations .
The Luna Ring concept , the company says , could meet the entire world 's energy needs .
Shimizu envisions that robots would play a vital role in building the Luna Ring .
Teleoperated 24 hours a day from the Earth , the robots would perform tasks such as ground leveling and assembling machines and equipment , which would be done in space before landing them on the Moon .
A team of astronauts would support the robots on - site .
Due to the massive amount of solar panels and other materials needed for the project , Shimizu proposes that lunar resources should be used to the fullest extent possible .
The company ’s plans call for producing water by reducing lunar soil with hydrogen imported from Earth .
Lunar resources could also be used to make cementing material and concrete , while solar - heat treatments could help produce bricks , glass fibers , and other structural materials needed for the project .
The Luna Ring itself would initially have a width of a few kilometers , but could be extended up to 400 kilometers wide .
The electric power generated by the solar cells would be transmitted by electric cables to transmission facilities on the near side of the Moon , which is constantly facing Earth .
After the electricity is converted into microwave beams and laser beams , 20 - kilometer - diameter antennas would beam the power to receivers on Earth .
A guidance radio beacon would ensure accurate transmission to the receivers .
The energy would then be converted back to electricity and supplied to grids , or possibly converted to hydrogen for fuel or storage .
Shimizu points out that one of the biggest advantages of the Luna Ring is that , since the Moon has virtually no atmosphere , there is no bad weather or clouds that could inhibit the efficiency of the solar panels .
As such , the Luna Ring achieves 24/7 continuous clean energy generation , potentially ending our reliance on limited natural resources .

Meet the latest marijuana martyr .
​ A 30 - year - old Nevada man on Wednesday chose a month in jail instead of probation which would have meant he could n’t use medical marijuana for one year .
The Record - Courier .
Charles Ray Balzer of Gardnerville , Nev. , told East Fork Justice Jim EnEarl he was unwilling to give up pot for a year , and he would do 30 days in jail after he pleaded guilty to harassment , reports
Balzer has a legal medical marijuana card from the Nevada State Health Division .
He told EnEarl he smokes cannabis and takes a prescription painkiller for a back injury .
If Balzer had accepted probation , he could have avoided the jail term , but one condition would have been that he not use “ drugs or alcohol ” for one year .
In an unaccountable quirk of the law , use of doctor - recommended medical marijuana is considered violation of probation , despite the fact that it is legal in Nevada .
​ After serving 30 days in jail , hemp hero Balzer wo n’t have any probation restrictions .
Judge EnEarl seemed to be totally oblivious to the fact that Balzer ’s marijuana use is legal ; beyond that , the judge seemed completely unsympathetic to the patient ’s medical plight .
“ You ’d rather do 30 days in jail than have me tell you you ca n’t smoke dope ? ” the ignorant judge fumed .
“ Does n’t that sound a little sick ? ” the judge asked , seemingly too dumb to get the irony of his dumbassery .
“ No , sir , ” Balzer said .
“ It ’s what the marijuana does for me . ”
“ I think if I sat around smoking dope all day , it would probably help me out , too , ” the proudly ignorant judge replied .
Balzer said he only smoked marijuana at night , to ease his pain .
Balzer ’s lawyer , Richard Davies , reasonably pointed out that his client was legally entitled to have the medical marijuana card .
“ It ’s the will of the people and the Legislature recognizes that , ” Davies said .
“ Some people marijuana probably does help , ” Judge EnEarl said , not bothering to mention how he suddenly became a medical expert .
“ I am not necessarily convinced Mr. Balzer is one of them . ”
Balzer agreed to turn himself in at 8 a.m. on June 11 .
EnEarl advised him he could have no alcohol or drugs in his system when he checks in .
( Or what — they ’ll put him in jail ?
Sheesh . )
When Balzer was arrested for harassing an acquaintance , officers discovered a marijuana grow system in his home , but he produced his Nevada medical marijuana card .
How much longer must seriously ill and suffering medical marijuana patients suffer indignities and insults from dim- witted , self - righteous judges like EnEarl who make medical decisions for which they are completely unqualified ?
Stay tuned .
AT&T announced Wednesday that the company was drastically changing their data plans , including cutting its unlimited data plans completely .
If you own an Apple iPhone , iPad , or another smartphone , here are the nine critical elements you need to know about the new AT&T pricing plans .
AT&T that the company was drastically changing their data plans , including .
Of course , this all occurred before Apple 's Worldwide Developer Conference ( WWDC ) on Monday , when Apple is to announced a next - generation iPhone .
While some customers are crying foul that their unlimited plans are being axed , the changes might .
Since more than 90 percent of users do n't use over 2 Gbytes of data per month , moving from $ 30 per month for unlimited data to $ 25 per month for a 2 - GB cap could actually be a good thing .
When we studied six PCMag.com i Phone owners ' data use , we found that every one of them used less than 2 GB a month .
Of course , if you tether your laptop or watch video on an iPad , you might use a lot more than that .
Here are answers to some common questions on the new plans .
When do the changes go into effect ?
Monday , June 7 .
How much do the new plans cost and what do I get with them ?
There are two options for data plans and one add - on option for tethering .
Plan Option # 1 : DataPlus .
Customers get just 200 Mbytes of data for $ 15 per month .
Additional 200 - MB blocks cost $ 15 each .
If you use more than 200 MB a month , the DataPro plan becomes more affordable .
Plan Option # 2 : DataPro .
Users get 2GB of data for $ 25 per month .
Overages are billed in 1GB increments for $ 10 each .
Tethering :
Anyone who wants to use their phone as a laptop modem including iPhone customers  can do so for an additional $ 20 per month .
Keep in mind that you still have the 2GB cap and tethering will make hitting that cap a lot easier .
Can I keep the AT&T data plan I currently have ?
Yes .
Current AT&T customers can keep the data plan they have .
As long as you do n't opt - in to one of the new plans , AT&T will let you continue to use an older data plan .
Once you change plans , you cannot return to an older plan .
How does this change iPad data pricing ?
Previously , the iPad had a $ 30 per month unlimited plan .
That is going away and being replaced with the DataPlus and DataPro plans .
If you had the $ 30 per month unlimited plan before June 7 , you can keep it until you do n't want it anymore .
Can I tether my phone to a laptop on the new plans ?
Yes , but you 'll have to pay more to do it .
i Phone tethering will cost $ 20 more a month on top of your $ 25 for 2 GB of data .
You will still be using the same data allocation for tethering .
How can I keep track of my data usage ?
Customers will receive text message notifications as they hit 65 percent , 90 percent , and 100 percent of their allotted data , as well as e-mails if desired .
A free myWireless app will let users check data usage .
Should I be worried about going over my 2 GB data cap ?
AT&T has been pointing out that 98 percent of current smartphone users consume less than 2GB per month , and 65 percent consume less than 200 MB per month .
But as consumers become reliant on the benefits of mobile e-mail , Web access , and so on , they do it more often .
At the PCMag offices , we how much data six employees with iPhones were using per month .
We found that 200 MB per month wo n't work for most tech - savvy smartphone users .
However , we were surprised to find that all six used less than 500MB of data per month , mostly thanks to having Wi -Fi connections at work and home .
Other users might have different results .
How can I cut down on my data use if I use more than 2GB per month ?
Generally users would need to use more Wi -Fi , if possible .
All data plans include free AT&T hotspot access over Wi-Fi .
Are other carriers going to change their data plan pricing as well ?
At this point , no other carrier has said they are changing their data plans .
But usually when one carrier makes changes that will improve its bottom line , all of them change in some way or another to be competitive .
Concerning data plan prices , Sprint chief executive Dan Hesse recently said in an e-mail that " one can never say ' never , ' but [ the company ] has no current plans to change our pricing . "
I ’ve mulled over whether to say anything at all , but if you ca n’t say what you think about the games industry when you own your own company , when can you ?
I was part of a panel yesterday at Develop , the games conference for developers in Brighton UK .
I was speaking about ‘ microstudios ’ with Robin Lacey ( Beatnik ) , Sean Murray ( Hello Games ) and Mark Morris ( Introversion ) , all of whom are good guys .
As a one - man outfit , I ’m the real baby studio there , but at 13 years of experience , also the grandfather , so I guess that makes me middle aged .
Anyway … all was cool , and there was much joking and mutual silliness .
Apparently I am the Barry Manilow of game development , and a mug to spend £ 75 on jeans .
And the topic then came up of how indies can respond directly to gamers on stuff like messageboards .
Basically I started making the point , and mark was also agreeing about how someone can email you as an indie dev , and you can reply personally back to that potential customer , and hopefully , that way you have converted that guy to buying the game .
At this point , there was this derisive snort from this guy in the front row , who said something to the effect of ‘ one guy ?
who cares , that ’s a waste of time ’ .
He then started to lecture us on how that ’s a silly way to do it .
I ’m 95 % sure that all four of us on the panel thought ‘ what the fuck ? ’ as well as ‘ who is this guy ’ ?
compounded by Robin asking him if he worked in marketing .
Anyway … it turned out this guy was Mark Rein from Epic , although he seemed to assume everyone within earshot knew exactly who he was , and why he must obviously be right .
I got the impression he was there to laugh at the little guys , or to just inform us how we are all wrong .
Interestingly , it seemed there was someone from sports interactive ( one time indies , as I recall ) there , who seemed more on the indie wavelength than Mark .
It would have been cool to chat with him .
So …
I ’ve given this a lot of thought , and weighed up the pros and cons of just putting this down to misinterpreting someone , and so on , and I have reached this conclusion .
Mark Rein is a jerk .
Now I suspect this is not groundbreaking news , although it is to me , because I ’ve never met him or even seen him before .
However , this experience seems to confirm my opinions on Epic and companies like them in general .
Now Mark may well look down on humble indies like me .
He may well think I ’m doing it wrong .
he may laugh when me and Mark discuss the pitiful money our companies make , and giggle at the fact that we reply to gamers on a one - on - one basis …
But fuck him .
I would rather earn minimum wage making indie strategy games for the PC , as my own boss , with an original game , satisfying a hardcore niche of friendly customers ( the one - thousand - true - fans - philosophy ) , without a publisher telling me what to do , and without having to leave my house to go to work , without having to do ‘ crunch time ’ ( because , dude … its like so macho to work until 3 AM and never see your family ) …
Than I would work at epic for megabucks .
The sheer overwhelming stench of testosterone would probably give me a headcahe , combined with the dizzy excitement of exactly what shade of grey our next game ’s space - marine would wear as he kicked alien butt .
( I feel bad working on Gratuitous Space Battles for almost 2 years , but it seems like that old ‘ wisecracking space marine with big muscles and chisel - jaw ’ idea has been stretched out longer than the hundred years war ) .
I have absolutely no doubt mark would just naturally assume me feeling like that is jealousy , which , as anyone who knows me personally would testify , is just fucking funny .
I really do n’t care about Epic , and their games , as they are way way too macho and ‘ dude ’ for my liking , and do n’t have demos , so I just assume they have n’t changed since Unreal Tournament .
I try not to comment on games I do n’t like , as each to their own tastes etc .
The only reason I ’m moved to give a damn enough to state my opinion , is that I resent having some triple - a studio jerk come and tell someone whose run a microstudio for thirteen years that he is doing it all wrong .
If Mark from introversion suggests I ’m doing it wrong , thats cool , he does what I do , and has some serious experience , ditto anyone on that panel , or anyone with long indie experience .
And I listen carefully , often over lunch .
But Triple - A studio bosses trying to lecture me on how to communicate better with gamers ?
Fuck off .

The mystery cult of football has one of its great festivals coming up .
It is amusing to hear John Humphries , leader of another national cult , the BBC 's morning news program , trying in all good humour to undermine the competing religion through superior dismissal .
But the conversation that followed was dreadful , and dreadful in a way that I think is quite representative of a dangerous anti-intellectualism in British thinking .
Compare the emptiness of what Tim de Lisle ( The Economist ) and Julian Norridge had to say about why football is so popular to the answers you got to the question on Finkielkraut 's France Culture Replique program , " Le désamour vis à vis de l'équipe de foot de France " , with sociologist Paul Yonnet and sports journalist Karim Nedjar .
de Lisle and Norridge were happy to nod gently as they agreed that more marketing expenditure creates more demand for sporting events .
That was about the extent of their explanation of the world football phenomenon .
On the other hand you know you 're going to learn something from Paul Yonnet when he matter - of - factly reminds us of Durkheim 1.01 ( minute 11.50 ) : football is a sacred ritual in which a community expresses itself and dramatises its understanding of the social world .
Society makes its values real in the moment of the national football match .
The invisible unity of the nation becomes visible .
We need the sociology of religion to understand football .
Why is this the character of popular world religion today ?
Will the synecdoche by which the team represents the nation be trumped by x-factor or ... got talent communal individualism ?
Are we at a football peak ?
How do screens and technology change the metaphor of society that sport represents ?
And , of course , is the religion manipulated by the powerful ?
de Lisle and Norridge seem to refuse anything but the most mechanical account of social phenomena .
Their content , the quality of what is lived , is utterly absent .
And yet that is what is important and interesting .
And this intellectual blindness is not just sad in itself .
It leads to a mechanical view of the world in which incentives replace understanding , causes replace meanings .
And the way we understand the world eventually shapes it .
I want a different cult for my morning ritual .

SAN JOSE , Calif . --
Picking up a point in every game during the first round of the playoffs qualifies as a hot streak for most players .
Not Johan Franzen .
He set a high standard for himself during the Detroit Red Wings ' playoff runs in 2008 and '09 .
So when he emerged from the series against Phoenix with only one goal , it was surprising to some and alarming to others .
Many wondered why he was n't driving to the net with authority , why he was n't using his 6 - foot - 3 , 222 - pound frame to win more physical battles , and whether he had a setback from the torn knee ligament that idled him for the first three - quarters of the season .
Franzen acknowledged he was pressing against the Coyotes .
He is hoping his second goal of the playoffs , during
in Game 1 of the Western Conference semifinals , gets him jump - started .
" I 've had some really good chances lately , could n't get it in the net , '' Franzen said .
" I started to squeeze the stick way too hard .
Hopefully , this goal will help me get going .
" When you miss a lot of chances , it just gets harder and harder .
It felt good to get one and hopefully get some confidence back . ''
Franzen accumulated an NHL - best 25 goals in the '08 and '09 playoffs combined .
That 's one more than teammate Henrik Zetterberg and Pittsburgh 's Evgeni Malkin , the last two Conn Smythe Trophy winners as playoff MVP , each scored .
Secondary scoring from Franzen , Dan Cleary and Todd Bertuzzi will be even more vital for the Red Wings against a Sharks club that is much more potent than the Coyotes .
Game 2 is Sunday at HP Pavilion .
" It 's important for his confidence knowing the puck can go in for him , '' Red Wings captain Nicklas Lidstrom said .
" He 's got to continue to shoot the puck and work hard .
It 's important when you get guys who have n't scored to chip in and get the confidence up a little bit . ''
The Sharks hope a sleeping giant did n't wake up in Game 1 .
" A lot of times power forwards just bowl their way to the net and jam away , but he has a touch with the puck , '' said San Jose coach Todd McLellan , a former Red Wings assistant who worked with Franzen for three years .
" He 's got a point in all eight playoff games , so he 's been a factor in each of the games at some point and probably will continue to be . ''
Sharks defenseman Rob Blake knows how difficult it can be trying to contain Franzen .
" He 's got a lot of skill , he 's big , he 's strong , he moves well , '' Blake said .
" He 's got quick hands and he can shoot the puck , too .
So he 's got a great combination and he 's got ( Pavel ) Datsyuk feeding him . ''
As much as Datsyuk talks about needing to shoot more , he knows he must get the puck to Franzen , especially when he 's feeling it .
" It 's really good he scored if he ( was frustrated ) , but I think he ( does n't ) have to be frustrated , he had points every game , '' Datsyuk said .
" I think he can get going now .
My job now is more to deliver the puck for them ( Franzen and his other winger , either Tomas Holmstrom or Dan Cleary ) .
Make sure they shoot . ''
Diminutive Sharks center Scott Nichol said it 's up to the team 's big forwards to contain Franzen .
" You just got to get good body position and do n't give him much time and space with the puck , " Nichol said .
" He 's kind of like a carbon copy of Clowie ( San Jose forward Ryane Clowe ) , big and strong and hangs onto the puck , and it 's tough to ( take it away ) .
No use just diving in on him because he 'll just outmuscle you . ''

After a protracted debate , delegates to the National Education Association voted on Sunday to take a position of " no confidence " in the U.S. Department of Education 's Race to the Top guidelines and in the use of competitive grants as a basis for the reauthorization of ESEA .
It was a symbolic slam on the Obama administration .
But as with NEA President Dennis Van Roekel 's keynote speech , it stopped short of actually calling out the U.S. president , a supporter of the program .
And the debate over the item provided the clearest picture yet of both the internal and external difficulties the NEA faces pushing against an education agenda promoted by a Democratic administration , rather than a Republican one .
For one , the item passed by a razor - thin margin .
Most pass with a simple voice vote .
New Business
Item 2 required a standing vote , where delegates pro and con stand , in turn .
The room looked to be divided almost in half , and the item very nearly moved to a roll call vote .
One delegate who opposed it noted the Tennessee and Delaware state unions ' participation in their states ' winning Race to the Top applications , and feared that the item 's sentiment did n't accurately represent the diversity of opinion about the program .
" A number of our state affiliates have signed on to the Race to the Top , as have a number of local affiliates , " she said .
" To make a blanket statement that we have no confidence in Race to the Top is a conflicting message , and a disunity message . "
Others worried about political ramifications .
" I agree with the principle of the resolution but not with the term ' no confidence , ' " the delegate said .
" I 'm not sure that 's the way we want to go into reauthorization , throwing punches . "
Yet others felt that it was time for the NEA to come out more strongly against the administration .
" The worst thing that can happen is that we are divided on this , because our opposition will seize on [ it ] , " said one delegate .
Even then , the resolution did not actually name or blame President Barack Obama for the policies .
At least one delegate said he felt that those omissions were disingenuous .
" Arne Duncan was not on the ballot .
The policies of the Department of Education are the policies of the Obama administration , " the delegate said .
" We have to step up and say that the policies of the Obama administration , we do not agree with those . "
Another delegate seemed to agree , saying that even if NEA would n't connect the dots , the media and public would have no problems doing so .
" The one line the press will pull from this convention is that we have ' no confidence ' in RTTT , which translates to the Department of Education , which translates to Barack Obama , " she said .
For the NEA , Barack Obama is quickly becoming the equivalent of Voldemort : He - Who - Must - Not - Be-Named .
Still , the delegates were on the whole worked up enough that they rejected an amendment to strike out the " no confidence " language and replace it with a softer phrase .
The author of the NBI 2 , Phil Rumore , president of the Buffalo , N.Y. , affiliate , got applause when he was introducing the resolution : " Some people are going to be mad at us if we pass this .
Well let the word get out , " he said .
The program , he added , would exacerbate policies that " brutalize our students with standardized tests , which in my opinion is like giving someone blood tests until they die . "
From another supporter : " The Race to the Top is a gun with bullets in it to take out teachers , public education , and the union itself . "
Camille Zombro , the head of the San Diego affiliate , seemed to have the last word .
" Teachers would never have put together a program like Race to the Top , " she said .
" Even in states that are trying to make lemonade , ... you were still given a lemon . "

Cyborg
Ivy is a science fiction novel under development centered on the adventures of three friends .
The narrative begins in 1899 … an alternate 1899 … wherein mankind has discovered certain technologies that allow them to travel from planet to planet without having to brave the perils of outer space .
Their space folding cuts an opening in between two worlds , and because this opening must invariably occur above the ground due to great destruction it causes to land and buildings , airship development has emerged as the primary inter -world method of transportation .
It is a world where mankind has expanded their influence across hundreds of habitable worlds and their population , and dominion over the human aboriginal races of those worlds , has increased exponentially .
This blog is intended to track the progress of that novel and as an encyclopedic resource to the alternative work .
This narrative references many individuals from history with the intention of creating a realistic feeling divergent alternity with personalities that have acted and responded to a different historical continuum .
The intention is not to slander or insult any of these figures , but to manufacture and interesting and engaging fiction .
Any similarity between the characters in this web fiction and real people , living or dead , is purely coincidental .
Be prepared , it 's not pretty .

Miami , Florida ( CNN ) --
A weather system moving over the southern Bahamas has been upgraded to a tropical storm , with sustained winds now reported at 40 miles an hour , as it heads toward the southern tip of Florida and the Gulf of Mexico .
The system has been named Tropical Storm Bonnie .
At 11 p.m. ET , it was moving northwest at 14 miles an hour as it approached the northwestern Bahamas , according to the National Hurricane Center .
It could pick up strength as it moves over the long stretch of open water in the Gulf of Mexico , but the latest computer models do not show it becoming a hurricane , according to CNN meteorologist Chad Myers .
Forecasters had predicted that it would cross over central Florida , but the models now show it passing farther south , over the Florida Keys or the Straits of Florida and then into the Gulf .
The storm is expected to pass the southern tip of Florida on Friday afternoon and then make landfall Sunday between New Orleans and the Beaumont - Port Arthur area in southeastern Texas .
Myers said it 's more likely to bear down on Louisiana .
And on that path , it could push oil in the Gulf from the BP oil spill to shore .
But at this point , no oil has spilled into the Gulf for the past seven days , with BP 's crippled well contained with a cap that appears to be bearing up under " integrity " tests .
BP 's chief operating officer , Doug Suttles , said Thursday that skimmers had been able to recover only 56 barrels of oil the day before , because that 's all they could find .
With the weather turning bad , BP has suspended work on a relief well to permanently seal the damaged well .
And late Thursday , the federal official overseeing the effort , retired Adm .
Thad Allen , ordered ships in the area to come to shore .
That could delay operations at the well site for 10 to 14 days .
But Allen said there 's enough confidence in the well that it will be left capped and closed during the rough weather .
Ships used to skim oil off the surface are likely to have to come ashore as well .
Currently , 215 are operating off the coast of Louisiana .
Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal has issued an emergency declaration , intended to speed state help to parishes that need it , when the storm hits .
He said mandatory evacuations are not expected , but parishes might call for voluntary evacuations in some low - lying areas .
The weather system is drenching the Bahamas and has caused flooding in Puerto Rico , Haiti and the Dominican Republic .
Tropical storm warnings have been issued for Florida 's east coast , from Golden Beach south to the Keys , and along the west coast , northward to Bonita Beach .
In Monroe County , Florida , which comprises the Keys , officials warned boaters to secure their vessels and remain in port until winds and seas subside .
They warned drivers to use extreme caution on the Overseas Highway , especially on exposed bridges .
The hurricane center predicted that the storm would bring 2 to 4 inches of rain to south Florida , with isolated areas receiving as much as 6 inches .
The central and northwest Bahamas are likely to receive slightly more , the hurricane center said .

This research assessed the efficiency of Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket ( UASB ) reactor operating under typical temperatures found in regions with temperate climate .
A pilot plant constituted by three 19.2 L anaerobic reactors was operated .
Sludge from an UASB reactor treating residuals from a gelatin industrial plant was introduced in each prototype .
The initial biological load in each reactor was 0.11 kg CODkg TVS - 1.d - 1 .
The reactors treated a synthetic wastewater formed by glucose , acetate , micro and macronutrients , with COD concentration compatible with urban sewage .
Reactor ’s operation was divided in two phases .
In the first , start - up , reactors operated at 35°C .
In the second phase , temperatures within reactors were 15 , 20 , 25 , 30 , and 35°C .
During the start - up and acclimatizing period , COD removal efficiencies were high , around 90 % .
In the second phase , it was observed that organic matter removal was slightly affected by temperature .
Generally , there was a decrease in COD efficiency with temperature reduction ( 95,7 , 91,0 , 94,2 , 90,6 and 87,2 % removal for 35 , 30 , 25 , 20 , and 15 °C , respectively ) .
However , soluble COD removal was unaffected by temperature , an observation confirmed by statistical analysis .
Methane gas volume , calculated by COD mass balances and bioenergetics , was similar .
Electric power shortages occurred in some small periods during the experiments .
As a consequence , the reactors endured unintentional 5 °C and 10 °C temperature shocks .
Reactors that suffered 5 °C shocks recovered very well as soon as they returned to their initial operational temperature .
However , the reactor that had a 10 °C temperature reduction did n’t recover to its initial efficiency upon return to the original operating temperature .
Organic matter removal and biogas production dropped significantly , with a corresponding increase in the volatile organic acids concentration in the reactor effluent .
In parallel with the laboratory experiments , it was monitored a full scale UASB reactor operating in Caxias do Sul , a city characterized by cold winters .
For the full scale reactor , it was not possible to verify the effect of temperature on efficiency .
This was due to the interference of variables other than temperature on the quality of the effluent .
The COD removals obtained in the prototype reactors were significantly higher than those measured at the full scale reactor .
It has to be considered that the prototypes operated under controlled temperature and constants concentrations and flowrates .
On the contrary , the full scale reactor received complex substrates ( domestic wastewater ) , with variations in concentrations , flowrates and temperatures .
The results of the research suggest that is feasible to operate UASB reactors in regions where temperature varies significantly around the year , with cold winters and warm summers .
Although the experiment showed a small decrease in organic matter removal with temperature , the efficiencies were still high to warrant the application of UASB at lower temperatures .
In full scale reactors , a careful operation of the reactor will probably compensate for a small decrease in organic matter removal due to lower temperatures .

A porn actor suspected of fatally stabbing a former co-worker and wounding two others during a violent rampage died Saturday after he jumped off a cliff following a dramatic , daylong standoff with police in which he threatened to kill himself with a samurai sword .
Stephen Clancy
Hill , 34 , spent about eight hours on the edge of a rocky cliff in West Hills surrounded by police and talking to crisis negotiators .

With dusk approaching and Hill continuing to threaten to kill himself , members of the Los Angeles Police Department ’s elite SWAT unit tried to subdue and apprehend him , using a less - than - lethal weapon , said Deputy Chief Kirk Albanese , who oversaw the incident .
Hill , however , threw himself over the cliff at 5:30 p.m.
Waiting paramedics rushed him to a nearby hospital , where he was pronounced dead from the injuries he suffered in the roughly 50 - foot fall .

Albanese declined to discuss details of the weapon police used and the plan that had been devised to capture Hill , citing the internal investigation that is launched after every serious use of force by officers .
It was unclear whether the projectile that officers fired had struck Hill or missed .
“ He was bent on taking his own life , ” Albanese said .
“ It ’s very unfortunate .
We wanted this to end a different way . ”
Advertisement
Mental health experts on the scene throughout the day had come to the conclusion that Hill ’s suicide threats were serious , Albanese said .
With the rough terrain making it difficult to bring in lighting for the nighttime and Hill ’s level of anxiety rising , Albanese gave the go - ahead for the attempted apprehension .

“ We were in a race against time , ” he said .
The idea of placing a large inflatable mattress at the base of the cliff was rejected by fire officials as unworkable given the rough , steep landscape , Albanese said .

The standoff began about 9:30 a.m. when a caller alerted police after spotting Hill ’s blue 1998 Toyota RAV4 in the 8800 block of Azul Drive , said Officer Bruce Borihahn .
Officers called the SWAT team and negotiators after Hill made his way up the cliff , where he stood with a sword in hand , pointing it at his chest , Borihahn said .
It was not known whether the sword was the weapon used in Tuesday ’s attack .

Hill had been at large since he attacked several employees at Ultima DVD Inc. , a video distribution facility in Van Nuys where he did production work and apparently lived , police and prosecutors said .
Investigators said Hill attacked one man in a back room of the business and then turned toward two colleagues who had rushed over to help the man .
Hill allegedly swung the weapon repeatedly and gashed both of them .

The three victims were rushed to Northridge Hospital Medical Center , where Herbert Hin Wong , 30 , of Canoga Park was pronounced dead , police said .
A second man was treated and released , while the third victim remains in the hospital , Borihahn said .
Wong , a native of China , acted in adult films under the name Tom Dong and appeared with the accused killer in several films .

Investigators are trying to determine if Hill was angry with his colleagues after being informed that he was being fired from his job and evicted from his living quarters .
Hill , of Riverdale , Md. , was charged Friday with one count of murder and five counts of attempted murder in connection with Tuesday ’s attack , according to the Los Angeles County district attorney ’s office .

Hill , who performed under the name Steve Driver , had been convicted of assault with a firearm involving an instructor on a Maryland college campus in 1998 , according to sources familiar with the investigation .
He had threatened a teaching assistant with a handgun if he did not get an A in a class , according to a 1999 article in the Washington Post about the incident .

Hill allegedly told the instructor he was “ a mobster and would dismember the instructor ’s body if he did n’t get the grade . ”
During the trial ,
Hill testified that he threatened to kill the instructor after the teacher requested oral sex , which the instructor denied , according to the article .

Republican Congressman Apologizes To BP For White House “ Shakedown ”
Doug Mataconis · · 38 comments
The Congressional hearings on the BP oil spill are just starting , but we ’ve already got the first headline of the day :
WASHINGTON – A leading House Republican accused the White House Thursday of a “ $ 20 billion shakedown ” of oil giant BP by requiring the company to establish a huge fund to compensate those hurt by the Gulf Coast oil spill .
Rep. Joe Barton made the assertion at the outset of a House hearing where BP ’s chief executive officer , Tony Hayward , was appearing for the first time before Congress .
Facing Hayward at the witness table , the Texas Republican congressman said , “ I ’m ashamed of what happened in the White House ” on Wednesday .
Barton was referring to the agreement that President Barack Obama announced with BP for establishment of a $ 20 billion relief fund .
Rep. Ed Markey sharply disagreed with Barton .
Markey said the compensation fund was “ not a slush fund , not a shakedown .
…
It was the government of the United States working to protect the most vulnerable citizens that we have in our country right now , the residents of the Gulf . ”
“ It ’s BP ’s spill , ” the Massachusetts Democrat said , “ but it is America ’s ocean , and it is America ’s citizens who are being harmed .
…
No , this is not a shakedown of the company . ”
Video :
Already , the White House is out with a statement :
What is shameful is that Joe Barton seems to have more concern for big corporations that caused this disaster than the fishermen , small business owners and communities whose lives have been devastated by the destruction .
Congressman Barton may think that a fund to compensate these Americans is a ‘ tragedy ’ , but most Americans know that the real tragedy is what the men and women of the Gulf Coast are going through right now .
Members from both parties should repudiate his comments .
This strikes me as an incredibly stupid statement on Barton ’s part .
As I noted yesterday , there are plenty of legitimate questions that need to be asked about the escrow fund that was announced by the White House .
However , there are no apologies necessary to BP , or to Tony Hayward .
Ultimately , there are responsible for the damages resulting from the destruction of the Deepwater Horizon and that seems to be what the escrow fund is intended to cover .
More importantly , though , the sheer political stupidity of apologizing to a company that is responsible for the worst environmental disaster in American history .
Barton is unlikely to pay a political price himself since he has represented the same Texas Congressional District since 1985 , but I doubt you will see any other Republicans joining Barton in his apologia , aside from the Rush Limbaugh ’s of the world .
Update :
At the start of the afternoon session of the hearing , Barton retracted his earlier statement :
“ I apologize for using the term ‘ shakedown ’ with regard to yesterday ’s actions at the White House in my opening statement this morning , and I retract my apology to BP .
As I told my colleagues yesterday and said again this morning , BP should bear the full financial responsibility for the accident on their lease in the Gulf of Mexico .
BP should fully compensate those families and businesses that have been hurt by this accident .
BP and the federal government need to stop the leak , clean up the damage , and take whatever steps necessary to prevent a similar accident in the future .
I regret the impact that my statement this morning implied that BP should not pay for the consequences of their decisions and actions in this incident . ”
Well okay then .

Hot on the heels of the 2.2 release of KOffice -- the first release we feel that users can give a try and use for real work -- the KOffice developers met in Essen - Horst in Germany , in the wonderful Linux Hotel .
Thanks to sponsorship by the KDE e.V. and the hard work by Alexandra Leisse and Inge Wallin , we could spend three days discussing and hacking .
With the weather being perfect , the hotel hospitable and the surroundings leafy and all a - twitter we not only hacked and discussed .
There was time to relax over a beer , get to know each other a little better and stroke the hotel cat .
Friday was mostly spent hacking , reviewing each others ' code and sitting outside and discussing the state of KOffice until very late in the night .
The next morning , Saturday , saw the start of a very long and rather gruesome meeting .
No hacking , only a few coffee breaks and one pizza break .
This day was devoted to three main topics :
Dangerous animals !
Dangerous animals !
How can we reach out and gain a real userbase
How can we gain more developers ( keep in mind that many applications of KOffice have only one , or even no , regular developer working on them ! )
How can we keep our work on KOffice relevant in what promises to become interesting times
The meeting notes are on the developer wiki .
Nokia sponsored not just the Saturday dinner but also the Sunday lunch , which was pizza again , for which many thanks from everyone present !
Saturday night again was most spent hacking , comparing notes , benchmarking ODF loading and similar things and drinking Slovakian peach liquor .
Group photo Group photo
Sunday was a lot more technical than Saturday : we discussed text rendering , which is still a sore point , a new architecture for file filters , text layout problems , charting issues and separating the user interface from the core even more .
This is something that Nokia has quite some experience with , having developed a completely new user interface on top of the KOffice applications , and we 're keen to pursue this path even further .
All in all , the attendants agreed this was a really positive sprint in a relaxing atmosphere .
Many decisions have been made and a lot of work got done !
In the realm of marketing , Gatorade is probably best known for splashy commercials featuring some of the world ’s most famous athletes .
However , a new effort behind the scenes of the PepsiCo - owned sports drink maker is putting social media quite literally at the center of the way Gatorade approaches marketing .
The company recently created the Gatorade Mission Control Center inside of its Chicago headquarters , a room that sits in the middle of the marketing department and could best be thought of as a war room for monitoring the brand in real - time across social media .
Mission Control
The room features six big monitors with five seats for Gatorade ’s marketing team to track a number of data visualizations and dashboards –- also available on to employees on their desktops — that the company has custom built with partners including Radian6 and IBM .
Below are a few of the visualizations that we got to check out in an interview last week :
This monitor is a visualization of tweets that are relevant to Gatorade ; the company is tracking terms relating to its brand , including competitors , as well as its athletes and sports nutrition - related topics .
This monitor measures blog conversations across a variety of topics and shows how hot those conversations are across the blogosphere .
The company also runs detailed sentiment analysis around key topics and product and campaign launches .
This video from Gatorade shows all of the different types of data being monitored from Mission Control .
Mission Control in Action
While certainly impressive visually , the first question that came to mind when being introduced to Gatorade Mission Control was how it ’s actually being used on a day - to - day basis , and if its lead to product and marketing changes at the company that might not have happened without it .
Gatorade ’s Sr. Marketing Director , Consumer & Shopper Engagement Carla Hassan offered a few examples , starting with the company ’s monitoring of its “ Gatorade has evolved ” campaign .
The commercials featured a song by rap artist David Banner , which , Mission Control quickly saw was being heavily discussed in social media .
Within 24 hours , they had worked with Banner to put out a full - length version of the song and distribute it to Gatorade followers and fans on Twitter and Facebook , respectively .
On a day - to - day basis , Gatorade ’s tools are also being used for more conventional marketing tactics –- like optimizing landing pages and making sure followers are being sent to the top performing pages .
As an example , the company says it ’s been able to increase engagement with its product education ( mostly video ) by 250 % and reduce its exit rate from 25 % to 9 % .
The Future
The goal of the project , says Hassan , is to “ take the largest sports brand in the world and turn it into largest participatory brand in the world . ”
To that end , the company ’s not only monitoring its brand on social media , but giving its fans increased access to its athletes and scientists .
During the Super Bowl , for example , Gatorade let fans interact with a number of its NFL stars through Ustream as they tested out the new Gatorade G Series Pro .
More recently , Hassan told me the company has been doing more regular small - scale live events , such as having a sports nutritionist answer questions from fans through Ustream and Facebook .
If that strategy is successful , expect to see the Mission Control approach applied to other businesses within PepsiCo says Bonin Bough , director of global social media at the company .
“ We believe what we ’re building here is an example of a sandbox of tools and processes we can use across the organization , ” he said .
" This is what the American dream has come to ?
Your founders warned you about this .
Warned you that standing armies and unrestrained banks would cost you your freedom .
And the sad thing is that most Americans are ok with it . "
( Ian Welsh , today -- see below )
-- Ian Welsh , in a recent blogpost ,
Obama has to stay in Afghanistan because war spending is one of the only reliable forms of stimulus he has .
The economy is in bad shape , and it needs that stimulus .
Since he ca n’t get a new large stimulus through Congress that means he MUST keep the Afghan war going if he does n’t want an economic disaster , which would then lead to an electoral disaster .
This is the sad truth of America : the only acceptable form of Keynesian spending is military Keynesianism .
Instead of hiring tens of thousands of teachers , building a high speed rail network across the country , refitting every building to be energy efficient and doing a massive solar and wind build - out to reduce dependence on oil , well , the US would rather turn Afghans and Pakistanis into a fine red mist .
That fine red mist is what ’s keeping the American economy from going under entirely .
And so , even if it ’s the wrong thing to do , even if it ’s the graveyard of America ’s Empire , the war will continue .
I recently wrote that Obama has chosen to stay in Afghanistan because war spending is one of the only reliable forms of stimulus he has .
I am baffled by many of the responses to that article .
What do readers think would happen to the US economy if all that spending stopped and was n’t replaced by anything ?
I do n’t primarily care about the US because of Canadian interests , I care about the US because I care about the American dream .
I sometimes think that many of us who are n’t Americans believe in American ideals more than American citizens do .
We imbibe , in other countries , a particularly pure form of the American civil religion .
We hear about doing the right thing , about always giving the accused a day in court , about freedom of speech , about division of power and about rights that are rights not because they are given by government to its subjects , but because they are inalienable human rights .
America ’s ideals , and its striving towards them , were what gripped the world and gave others hope .
If the American experiment in freedom , in rights , could succeed , then perhaps it could succeed in other places .
But what we see today is the American Dream dying .
Not just the dream of every generation being better off than the one before , though that ’s dying , but the dream of a country where the citizens actually had rights , where they actually were free .
I ’m not so sure that banks are more dangerous than standing armies , but certainly the two of them together have brought the US to where it is .
The problem with standing armies is simple enough : if you ’ve got one , politicians are always tempted to use it .
When it ’s a professional standing army , so the majority of the population is not effected by its use , that temptation increases .
When the army is the most powerful ( though not the most effective ) in the world , well , that temptation increases even further .
This is America ?
This is what the American dream has come to ?
Your founders warned you about this .
Warned you that standing armies and unrestrained banks would cost you your freedom .
And the sad thing is that most Americans are ok with it .
Are Americans who do n’t believe that everyone is endowed with inalienable rights still Americans worth the name ?
That is my question to you on July 4th .
Happy Independence Day .

Yesterday Ian was writing about RNC Chair Michael Steele 's surprisingly unstupid comments about the president and Afghanistan , which reminded him of " my favorite definition of a gaffe : ' saying the truth in the worst way possible .
'" After making the point that , much as Chairman Michael said , our involvement in Afghanistan is " a war of choice for Obama , " even if it had first been a war of George W. Bush 's choosing , and noting that " being the RNC chairman , Steele is n’t allowed to say things that make sense and contradict Republican warmongering , " Ian proceeds to " a truth that Steele did n't tell .
" I should note once again that I 'm one of the few people I know who does n't claim to have implacably opposed the idea of an invasion of Iraq , and who similarly is n't reflexively opposed to the idea of military intervention in Afghanistan .
In both cases , though , I do require a believable understanding of purpose : what we hope to accomplish and , at least roughly , how we expect to accomplish it .
The Bush regime tried several substantially different explanations for why we had to invade Iraq , but all of them were so far from credible that it seemed clear the regimistas did n't believe any of them either .
( Even with the shoddy job most of the Infotainment News media were doing " reporting " the issues , it was hard not to see that even if you tried to take any of the regime justifications for war seriously , the " evidence " presented was dubious , to put it mildly . )
What was clear was that , for reasons we were free to speculate about , the various subspecies of the Far Right that made up the regime were of one mind that an invasion was a splendid idea , and all that remained to determine was how to sell it to , or slip it past , a somewhat cranky American public .
It 's well to remember that , until the actual invasion , the most persistent objections to the idea came not from the Left but from the Right .
( It surely did n't help that Chimpy the Presidential Candidate had sought so often to score cheap political points by denouncing soft - headed Democrats ' inclination to " nation - building . "
Perhaps in retrospect some of the regime strategists may have appreciated that the essentially isolationist rhetoric of the campaign may not have been the ideal way to prepared the country for a foreign policy that was going to feature unilateral American intervention anywhere and everywhere in the world that the regime felt like . )
In the case of Afghanistan , I believe that the original American intervention made sense and produced some real accomplishments , starting with the removal from power of the Taliban .
That those accomplishments were shallower and less durable than they may have appeared at the time is undeniable .
Could they have been built on , if the Bush regime had chosen to stay the course in Afghanistan rather than instigate a war in Iraq ?
I guess we 'll never know .
At the same time , that does n't mean that the case for military involvementis in any way established .
It has seemed increasingly clear that if the Obama administration actually has a defined plan of action for Afghanistan , it is afraid or simply unwilling to share it with the American people .
And given the cost to the country in so many ways , if we do n't have a reason for being there , we should n't be there .
Except that perhaps we can ' tto leave , becausequeasy economic disequilibrium depends on the money the war is pumping into it .
As Ian puts it in an addendum to the above post he offered today ( " American War Economics 101 " ) : Today Ian has some thoughts -- " American cannot be America at perpetual war " -- as a Canadian on Fourth of July :
He recognizes that we have n't been terribly assiduous about living up to those lofty ideals , but argues that " both people and countries are defined not just by their failures , but by the ideals they strive towards .
" Then he invokes Thomas Jefferson 's " prescient " warning " that banking establishments are more dangerous than standing armies .
" War by necessity concentrates power in the executive , Ian cautions , which leads to the multitude of basic rights tramplings we 've talked about so much here .

It takes one level of comics fandom to plot out locations from " DMZ " and " Freakangels " or set up an entire Google Map about " The Walking Dead . "
One reader who felt bad about missing " Scott Pilgrim vs. The World " while it was filming in Toronto took things ( and her camera ) a step further , though , and amassed a collection of informatively captioned photographs documenting locations used by Bryan Lee O'Malley in his epic Oni Press series , " Scott Pilgrim . "
Dundas Square , the Wychwood Branch of the Toronto Public Library and Second Cup can all be found in the " Scott Pilgrimage " gallery on mad5l5in5 's Flickr account , complete with side - by - side comparisons of O'Malley 's illustrations and the way the sites currently appear .
The lengths she went to and the accuracy with which O'Malley was able to depict Toronto 's city blocks are both impressive .
In fact , there may be a legion or two of Scott Pilgrim fans out there who would love to see something like this gallery compiled into a companion volume .
Ex-IRS agent pleads guilty
A former IRS tax specialist admitted in federal court in Maryland that he owes more than $ 789,000 in overdue taxes , federal authorities said .
John Venuti , 62 , of Harwood , Md , pleaded guilty Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Baltimore to three counts of failing to file a federal income tax return , according to the U.S. Attorney 's Office in Maryland .
Venuti worked at the accounting firm KPMG LLP from 2002 until January as a tax consultant and principal , court documents state .
He worked for the IRS from 1974 to 1983 , including three years during which he was chief of the Tax Treaty and Technical Services Division .
According to the plea agreement , Venuti did not file federal tax returns from 2001 to 2006 .
Each year , though , he requested and was granted a six - month extension , and made a total of $ 97,060 in payments along with the extension requests .
Authorities said he owes more than $ 789,000 in back taxes .
In July 2008 , after he was told he was under criminal investigation , Venuti submitted tax returns for the tax years 2001 to 2006 , authorities said .
Venuti faces a maximum sentence of one year in prison for each of the three counts .
He is scheduled to be sentenced Nov. 2 .

It ’s ironic that Christians even use technology , such as cellphones and computers , let alone washing machines and microwaves , since it was n’t that long ago that their churches were condemning science and everything it wrought , including medicine .
These days , Christians are not only using modern technology , they ’re creating apps for it .
As in software for the iPhone that helps them continue in their beliefs when confronted with the rational world around them .
Atheists are n’t far behind .
We , too , have our own apps that explain in logical terms why the Bible and the tenets of Christianity are about as credible as a Disney fairy tale .
It ’s become a war of apps .
Christians have their “ One- Minute Answers to Skeptics ” and “ Answers for Catholics , ” while atheists are downloading “ The Atheist Pocket Debater ” and “ BibleThumper ” from the iTunes store .
The latter app is billed as the “ perfect Atheist bible companion , ” according to promo materials .
“ Next time one of those bible thumpers starts proselytizing , you will be able to answer in kind with the juiciest quotes straight from the holy bible . ”
There ’s so many silly , irrational , bloody , crazy quotes to choose from , such as Psalms 137 : “ Happy shall he be , that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones . ”
And you thought that killing kids was immoral !
Or that old English was out of fashion .
“ The Atheist Pocket Debater ” is a more comprehensive app for arguing with those stubborn believers .
It contains three sections , Skepticism , Humanism and Atheist Debater .
Topics include “ Lack of Historical Evidence for Jesus , ” “ America Was NOT Created as a Christian Nation , ” and “ God Is Too Hidden to Be Real . ”
Seems like every atheist will find something useful in this app .
Its creator , Jason Hagen , whom the New York Times describes as an “ average guy ” from Queens , came up with the idea for the app after buying an iphone and finding nothing for atheists .
“ I know what people go through , growing up in the culture I grew up in , ” Hagen , the son of a fundamentalist preacher , said .
“ So I tried to give people the tools they need to defend themselves , but at the same time not ridicule anybody .
Basically , the people on the other side of the debate are my parents . ”
There ’s more , many more apps , far too many to cite in this article .
Two of interest : for those who like to quote others , there ’s “ mAtheist , ” which contains 700 bits of wisdom from “ the world ’s best known freethinkers , ” and “ Atheist , ” which includes over 200 quotes from disbelievers such as Freud , Daniel Dennet and Sam Harris .
Making the Internet godless .
Now there ’s a worthy goal .

For years , Robert Twilley has worked to bridge the traditional academic divides between oceanography and coastal science .
" They really are not two separate systems , " says Twilley , a coastal scientist from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge .
" Whatever you do offshore certainly has implications to the shoreline and bay estuary environments . "
Now , Twilley is watching this lesson unfold before his eyes .
As London - based BP continues to pour vast quantities of dispersants into the Gulf of Mexico , Twilley and many other scientists are growing increasingly concerned about the chemical soup that may be creeping onshore , as well as the poorly understood effects of dispersant in the water column at sea .
Initially , BP and the federal agencies involved in the spill response made the decision to use dispersant offshore to limit the amount of viscous oil washing up on beaches and into the wetlands , says Ed Overton , an environmental chemist at Louisiana State University .
The idea behind the use of dispersants offshore , says Overton , " is you hold your nose and accept damage offshore to try to prevent damage onshore " .
So far , more than 6.6 million litres of dispersant have been applied : more than 4 million litres offshore and more than 2.5 million litres at the site of the leak .
On the surface , dispersants are sprayed from planes over the surface of the oil .
To reach oil at depth , dispersant is pumped from a vessel at the surface down to a wand pointed into the oil flowing from the broken wellhead , some 1.5 kilometres deep .
Before the Deepwater Horizon spill , dispersants had only been used to treat surface oil .
Therein lies the worry , says David Valentine , a geomicrobiologist at the University of California in Santa Barbara .
" It 's an experiment that 's never been performed before — to dump that much of an industrial chemical into the ocean . "
" My hunch is that when this thing started they wanted to keep the oil off the beaches , so they used the dispersants , " says Samantha Joye , a biogeochemist at the University of Georgia in Athens .
" But no one thought it would go on this long . "
Now there are fears that that dispersed oil is making its way into shallow waters even as questions abound about the impacts on the water column at depth .
We are trying " to unravel what 's truth and what 's purely speculation , " says Twilley .
Increasing toxins
BP has been authorized to use dispersants only in waters deeper than 10 metres and no nearer to shore than five kilometres .
So far , its closest application has been 14.6 kilometres from shore , and the vast majority of the dispersant has been applied at 28 kilometres or further , according to Arden Ahnell , BP's Director of Global Product Stewardship .
The US Environmental Protection Agency announced on 30 June that its initial round of toxicity testing on eight dispersants , including Corexit 9500 , produced by Nalco of Naperville , Illinois — the product that BP is using to help break up the oil — found no " biologically significant " endocrine disrupting effects on the small estuarine fish and mysid shrimp that they tested .
However , the EPA noted that it still needs to do further testing on the effects of the dispersants mixed with oil .
" We already know that dispersants are less toxic than oil if you compare the two , " says Susan Shaw , a marine toxicologist and director of the Marine Environmental Research Institute in Blue Hill , Maine .
" But because Corexit contains a petroleum solvent , we 're actually putting petroleum solvent on top of a petroleum spill .
So it 's increasing the hydrocarbon in the water column . "
Corexit 9500 is composed primarily of detergents that break globs of oil into tiny microdroplets , as well as a propanol - based solvent that is used in household cleaning products .
Dispersion is thought to speed up oil degradation because tiny droplets can be more readily metabolized by oil - eating microbes .
Joye does n't buy that claim : " It assumes that the dispersant does n't impact the microbial community , and we have no idea if that 's true or not , " she says .
" There 's just as good a chance that this dispersant is killing off a critical portion of the microbial community as it is that it 's stimulating the breakdown of oil . "
Delivery system
Furthermore , says Shaw , the dispersant can increase the toxicity of the oil for those marine organisms that encounter it .
" It 's like a delivery system , " says Shaw .
" The [ dispersed ] oil enters the body more readily and it goes into the organs faster . "
ADVERTISEMENT
" The real issue we 've got in this spill is the massive amount of oil that just keeps coming , " says Overton .
" We 've gone past any normal use of dispersants . "
Still , Overton is not convinced that dispersed oil is making its way to shallow waters .
" The whole idea of dispersing only offshore is to do it only where there 's so much water that it gets dispersed below dangerous levels very quickly , " says Overton .
Twilley is part of a science and engineering review team that is providing guidance to the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority of Louisiana , and he says the lines of communication are open with the EPA to develop a unified position for a bioremediation plan .
Meanwhile , Twilley says , more field testing is needed to monitor the actions of the dispersants and oil , alone and in combination .
" The complication here is the trade - offs , " says Twilley .
" There are certain things with dispersants that are of benefit , and there are negatives , and we 're having problems evaluating those trade - offs . "

The ban on some naked short - selling last week sent markets tumbling
Germany is considering widening a ban on " naked " short - selling on some financial stocks to cover all German - listed stocks , proposals have shown .
Short - sellers usually borrow shares , sell them , then buy them back when the stock falls .
" Naked " short - selling is when a trader sells financial instruments he has not yet borrowed .
Last week Germany banned naked short - selling at its 10 most important financial institutions .
But the draft proposal from the Finance Ministry now suggests the ban will be extended to shares and derivatives in all companies .
According to the Wall Street Journal , the proposal states : " Naked short - selling of stocks and the debt of eurozone states that are listed on a domestic exchange in a regulated marketplace will be forbidden . "
The proposals are expected to be discussed by the German cabinet next week .

A lot of scifi transports us to a future world of high - tech plenitude .
But in Carrie Vaughn 's short story " Amaryllis , " we get a more realistic future where human life is restricted to preserve the environment .
The central conflict in this story is ancient - a young woman wants a child , but she and the potential father do n't have the means to support it .
But that 's where the familiar outlines of this story erode .
In a few deft strokes , Vaughn introduces us to an eco-friendly society where all the rules of family and child - rearing have changed so radically that " family " and " marriage " are almost unrecognizable .
And yet they are .
Here 's an excerpt from the first section of " Amaryllis , " posted this week at Lightspeed magazine :
I never knew my mother , and I never understood why she did what she did .
I ought to be grateful that she was crazy enough to cut out her implant so she could get pregnant .
But it also meant she was crazy enough to hide the pregnancy until termination was n't an option , knowing the whole time that she 'd never get to keep the baby .
That she 'd lose everything .
That her household would lose everything because of her .
I never understood how she could n't care .
I wondered what her family thought when they learned what she 'd done , when their committee split up the household , scattered them - broke them , because of her .
Did she think I was worth it ?
* * *
It was all about quotas .
" They 're using cages up north , I heard .
Off shore , anchored , " Nina said .
" Fifty feet across - twice as much protein grown with half the resources , and we'd never have to touch the wild population again .
We could double our quota . "
I had n't really been listening to her .
We were resting , just for a moment ; she sat with me on the railing at the prow of Amaryllis and talked about her big plans .
Wind pulled the sails taut and the fiberglass hull cut through waves without a sound , we sailed so smooth .
Garrett and Sun hauled up the nets behind us , dragging in the catch .
Amaryllis was elegant , a 30 - foot sleek vessel with just enough cabin and cargo space - an antique but more than seaworthy .
She was a good boat , with a good crew .
The best .
" Marie - " Nina said , pleading .
I sighed and woke up .
" We 've been over this .
We ca n't just double our quota . "
" But if we got authorization - "
" Do n't you think we 're doing all right as it is ? "
We had a good crew - we were well fed and not exceeding our quotas ; I thought we'd be best off not screwing all that up .
Not making waves , so to speak .
Nina 's big brown eyes filled with tears - I 'd said the wrong thing , because I knew what she was really after , and the status quo was n't it .
" That 's just it , " she said .
" We 've met our quotas and kept everyone healthy for years now .
I really think we should try .
We can at least ask , ca n't we ? "
The truth was :
No , I was n't sure we deserved it .
I was n't sure that kind of responsibility would be worth it .
I did n't want the prestige .
Nina did n't even want the prestige - she just wanted the baby .
Due to receiving more than 300 letters thus far from those who submitted letters to the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Income Security and Family Support , I need to create multiple posts .
The House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Income Security and Family Support held a hearing on June 10 titled : Hearing on Responding to Long - Term Unemployment .
I asked readers of Rochester Unemployment Examiner to send me letters they wrote to the Committee that they also wanted to have published here .*
Below are some of those letters .
I ’ll be posting other letters as I receive permission .
While you can no longer submit letters to House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Income Security and Family Support hearing you can send your letters to me at mike@layofflist.org and I ’ll publish them here or at Rochester Unemployment Examiner .
Your stories are important and hopefully those clueless ones in Congress read them to see how their actions , or inaction , can harm Americans from all corners of the nation .
You can read letters that were submitted to the Committee at : Witness Statements
I want to thank all of you for including me in your letters to the Hearing .
I will do my best to reply to each and everyone of you .
From KM in CO :
I have been unemployed since August of 2008 .
I started working for a mortgage company back in 2004 .
When the housing market took a crash , the owner of the mortgage company closed the company and bought a collection agency out in Fort Collins , CO where I was the sales manager .
I traveled monthly to Colorado from Dallas making sales calls .
Eventually he closed the Dallas office and that is when I was laid off along with the rest of my office here in Dallas .
I have been actively searching for work ever since .
I have applied for many jobs with little to no feed back from any .
I recently have started applying for part time work along with full time work .
I sent my resume to a company called AEROTEC .
They had a part time job opening at a mtg .
company and thought I was very qualified for this position .
The next day Molly from AEROTEC called AND emailed me saying that I was a great fit for this position .
When I called her back and I told her that I have been out of work since Aug. of 2008 she told me that she would not be able to help me as all the companies that AEROTEC does business with will not hire anybody that has been unemployed for longer then 6 months .
I stated to her that I thought that was strange since the job market is and has been so hard hit by the recession .
She said that she was sorry but there is nothing they could do to help me .
I have even applied for work and grocery stores , gas stations and my children ’s school full and part time to even try to make ends meet .
My husband is now looking to find a part time evening job as well to keep from losing everything we have worked so hard to get .
Today I have applied for the loan modification program that my mtg.
company offers .
I hope that I “ qualify ” for this modification .
I was also able to skip a car payment for this month .
The sad thing is that when next month rolls around I am back to square one .
Is it that the unemployed issue is “ out of site out of mind ” for our government ?
Until you are in a position where you are struggling to feed your children , one can not fully understand how devastating this can be on ones life .
We need to get this out in the opened so people can see that this is a true issue and not a case of people mooching off our government ’s money !
They were so compassionate when the big companies were in the red …. where is the compassion for us ???
While they , our government , and the CEO ’s of the bailout companies sit back a collect a huge bonus … .
the hard working Americans are losing EVERYTHING !
I hope my story will help in the fight to make new hiring laws and to help the long term unemployed !
From BA in SC :
Hearing on Responding to Long - Term Unemployment 99 WEEKS ~
My Downward Spiral Into Destitution and Hopelessness Mr. McDermott and Committee Members :
The last real home I remember having was a wonderful little beach block condo on Brigantine , NJ , outside of Atlantic City , NJ , in the fall of ’07 .
It was sunny and wonderful and mine , with my little miniature schnauzer , Mandy , my only family that is left .
And although Mandy has battled congestive heart failure throughout these last 5 years , when I would arrive home from work from my TWO jobs at the ShowBoat Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City , NJ , most evenings we would walk on the exquisite beach and collect seashells , laughing and running on the beach , as if we had not a care in the world .
The nightmare that has ensued since I lost both of my jobs at the ShowBoat , I could never ever have imagined in my worst dreams .
My heart breaks at the thought of how I have lost count of all the addresses I have had since , just to keep a roof over my head .
I had previously attended a University - Coastal Carolina U. in SC , and remembered how inexpensive the winter rentals were on the beach there to live in .
This is where I landed for the most part of the last three years .
Living in a quaint , but old and quite run-down motel , called The Vancouver in Myrtle Beach , SC .
I had lost my condo , and my car has needed some major repairs the past couple of years , which I could not afford .
It ’s a ’ 97 Nissan I purchased new , and was also hit by a few people in accidents , but never was fixed - I had to use the insurance checks for living expenses and bills .
Even my unemployment did not come quite close to all the money I had earned at work– I worked full time in my department at the ShowBoat , and also part time and over - time .
I also held a secondary job in another department at the ShowBoat .
I was hoping to buy a new car , and also return to school to finish my 2nd degree in Elementary Education - Communications ~ but it will never happen now .
I am possibly only 5 or so classes away from my B.A. Degree in both .
At least with my Tiers of Federal Unemployment Compensation , ( my Tier IV ran out almost 4 months ago ) , I was able to sustain somewhat of what was my life .
Although in the summer season I have had to move from The Vancouver , and find room - mate situations – most in not very pleasant circumstances , to live with complete strangers , often drug and alcohol abusers .
I have moved over and over , dozens of times , just to make sure I was in a safe situation .
It has been really one of the most terrible experiences of my life .
I do n’t even know where to get my mail anymore .
After making a multitude of trips up and back to NJ , to try to be eligible for a NJ State Grant to re-train to be employed again , that I never was given - although I had tested and was told I was eligible for , and looking for any and every job I might find in - between ; my Nissan has accumulated so much wear and tear and mileage , I ’m afraid it will go to pieces at any time now .
My brakes went out twice two days ago , and the car over - heats every time I drive it .
Since my benefits have been completely cut off 4 months ago , I have nothing left and am at a point of almost complete destitution , and definitely desperation , whereas the hopelessness has begun to set it in .
My car has had no horn for at least 2 years now .
My front brakes need replaced , and I cannot even afford an oil change .
All my tires are bald , and I am having problems with the transmission .
The air conditioning is no longer working , and the heat indexes here in SC are up to 110 degrees today and on many days .
The past two or so years here in SC , I have had 3 jobs– first as a Front Desk person in an in - door children ’s ‘ playground ’ , that was supposed to add an after school drop - off program , and tutoring , which my was one of my concentrations in school– Elementary Education .
After about a month , I was laid off , and then the business closed and went under .
Last year at Christmas , I was hired as a Front - end Cashier at a big sporting goods store as seasonal help .
I was told I was being kept after the holiday season , but when the schedule would come out , my name was on it every week with zero hours .
Presently , the ONLY job I have been able to find is part - time .
I am a time - share TELE - MARKETER .
It is so hard to believe that with an A.A. Degree , and almost my B.A. Degree in Communications - English and Elementary Education AND 10 plus years of Customer Service experience , plus Marketing and Sales , this is the only employer that would hire me .
It is beyond depressing .
It is an insult .
I spent six years studying in school , trying to finish and working , but then had to stop to take care of my Mom for 2 years , before she died .
And I have nothing to show for all the hard work I did .
Now I have $ 40,000 .
in student loans in default .
I ’m not eligible to receive anymore financial aid because of this .
I am deeply in debt and barely have a roof over my head .
I ca n’t pay my car insurance - it has gone to almost cancellation several times , and I barely was able to save it .
My cell phone is months past due , and will be shut off .
What will I do without a phone ??
This is the only number I have to put on my resume .
The commute to the PART TIME tele - marketing job I have is one hour plus each way , from where I am living - quite south now of Myrtle Beach , SC .
Do the math - I have 143,000 .
miles on my car .
How many more times can I even make it to a job that is barely paying $ 100 .
and something PER WEEK given the poor condition my car is in ??
Now you may think I am just another ordinary ‘ constituent ’ of any of you , but I am not .
I grew up in an upper - middle class family .
I went to private school and graduated with a 3.8 .
My Father was a Ph.D. Professor at Purdue University , and a famous scientist who wrote for The Scientific American , among other publications , and a published author of a college textbook ; Biology ; The Science of Life .
His Biography is published in THE Library of Congress ; my name being there as well .
He was killed in a car accident when I was three , and my Mother had to raise me alone .
My Mother was a Kindergarten Teacher and a Model .
My ancestors were traced by her to Great Britain - Wales specifically .
Now just how do you think I feel ??
My whole life , and all my hopes and dreams are gone .
I am mid-aged .. EDUCATED .. OVER - EXPERIENCED , AND OVER - QUALIFIED .
My dream was to become an Elementary Education Teacher .
I studied hard and did all the right things .
I have been working in this country since I was 13 years old .
I am a woman , alone , and no one will hire me , and I can no longer support myself .
I have a stigma attached to me now , because I have been unemployed so long .
I am ashamed of how my parents ~ though now gone , must think of me .
My life everyday day is a NIGHTMARE of emailing resumes and cover letters to unknown places and people , who do not even respond with an acknowledgement , and going on useless interviews , only to follow - up the next day and told I was not hired ( they chose inexperienced 20 year olds over me - I have noticed this first hand ) .
I feel useless and old , and as though there is no future .
It ’s hard to wake up every day to this .
Very hard .
Please ~ I beg you to help us .
We do not want to live this way … wearing people ’s old clothes .. begging the vet for another bottle of expensive heart medication for my little schnauzer , that I can no longer afford ..
I have begged and borrowed from everyone I know and am out of friends – many have simply turned their backs on me , I guess out of ignorance and not knowing what else they can do for me .
All I want is what I had .
I want my dreams back .
I want to finish school , and I still want to work with children - the second love of my life aside from Mandy ~ my 12 year old sick little schnauzer , who is solely responsible for me not giving up .
Without her , I do n’t think I would still be here .
She is the light of my life and such an inspiration , ( with congestive heart failure ) , and is filled with so much joy and happiness every day of her life .
But I ’m afraid all the stress will take it ’s toll on her too .
Last year because I could not find work after putting in hundreds of applications and resumes , I apparently started to grind my teeth in my sleep - talk about stress !
By the time I realized the problem - it was too late .
I now need thousands of dollars of dental work .. but of course no longer have any insurance or money for it .
I am down to 100 pounds as I have lost weight , most days having very little appetite .
I look like hell .
People say I was quite beautiful before all of this started , but with no money for clothes or make - up or just the minor things like a hair - cut !!
I know I really look terrible and thin .
I am aging long before my time .
We can not , and will not stand idly by , and watch what is left of our hopes .. our dreams , and our futures be desecrated by your inability to perform the jobs you were elected by us to do .
You no longer represent us .
After all , WE ARE THE POWER OF THE PEOPLE , and the people who put you where you are .
So PLEASE Mr. McDermott and Your Committee Members– Please understand how dire and serious our plight as ’ 99 ’ers ’ is .
I have recently read , which is even more disparaging , that we will now be the very last to find work or be wanted by employers .
This recent news is devastating .
In fact , CNN - cnnmoney.com released an article just last week titled , ‘ Looking for Work ?
– Unemployed ?
Need Not to Apply ‘!
Is this all some kind of really bad joke ?
Because I fail to find the humour in it .
But until the time comes ; and I do believe it is not just around the corner , that we can all be employed full time again , and in things that we struggled years in school to achieve ~
PLEASE , please , Congressman McDermott , and Committee Members– let us keep what is left of our dignity , and at least do more than just try to survive .
We DESPERATELY need a Tier V until this economic nightmare is over , and we can all get back on our feet again .
This unemployment situation is not our fault ~ and we deserve more than to have you turn our backs on us in our darkest hour .
After all ~ WE ARE the constituents who put you where YOU ARE .. and gave you all that YOU HAVE ~
And now we have NOTHING .
Sincerest Regards ,
From JG in IN :
Ladies and Gentlemen , I am urging you to take the actions necessary to extend Federal Unemployment Benefits .
While I understand the argument that extending benefits reduces the overall search for employment , there is a large segment of us who do not fall into this category and require closer examination … this is the group of unemployed over the age of 50 .
At age 57 , my situation is similar to many others across the country .
My husband has a PhD and I , a BSME as well as an MBA and NEVER did we think that we would be reduced to near penury at this stage in our lives .
After a 30 year career as a productive ( and continually employed ) engineer in the automotive and construction businesses , I was laid off in November 2008 .
At that time , my company laid off 25 % of its workforce , ALL of whom were over the age of 50 .
Along with many others , my company found that they could substantially reduce their group health insurance costs by lowering the average age of its workforce … 50 + year old employees are no longer welcome .
I did not lose my job because of lack of productivity or attendance - mine was double that of my younger counterparts .
My attendance was better , my skills and knowledge of myriad software programs , educational background and willingness to work flexible hours was better .
Like my laid off co-workers , I was let go solely due to my age .
Since November 2008 , I have applied for hundreds of jobs and have been interviewed several times .
Those interviews went well except for the fact that face to face , my age became obvious .
The grim reality is that in every sector but academics , 50 + year old employees need not apply .
From a career high salary of $ 150,000.00 per year , I am reduced to applying for temporary jobs at $ 10.00 and $ 11.00 per hour hoping to get my foot in the door where I can demonstrate my capabilities in hopes of obtaining a full time position .
I am hoping that my obsessive attention to diet and exercise resulting in perfect health becomes sufficiently obvious to some employer to induce him / her to give me a chance to demonstrate what I did very successfully for 30 years .
Ironically , I do not even need health insurance benefits - those are carried by my husband .
My husband is a teacher ( albeit at the collegiate level ) whose income is not enough to enable us to live comfortably on one income .
In the past 2 years , we have lost our home to foreclosure ( the bank felt that they would rather foreclose than to drop our interest rate ) .
We have given up our second car , gone through most of our savings and are now in debt to the IRS and State of Indiana because we cannot afford the additional income taxes on my unemployment benefits .
My husband ’s medical insurance family deductible is $ 5,000 which has become unaffordable and we are now limiting our medical care for the few routine visits we have .
I have forgone my mammogram and bone density tests this year as my husband postponed his routine EKG … our deductibles for those tests are now unaffordable .
I do not WANT unemployment benefits … I want just ONE company to give me a job doing anything .
It is alarming that with my exceptional background and references , the 21st century America , the only option to me is to be “ on the dole ” and even that can not be counted on .
I find it contemptible that YOUR government has bailed out banks , insurance companies and the automotive industry NONE of which have yielded any more jobs … simply higher deductibles to me and larger executive bonuses for a privileged few .
The situation is a disgrace - and every one of you who went on vacation without forcing the Senate to vote on additional benefits should be ashamed .
.. Switch places with me for just for one week and you will not be so eager to rush off on vacation when there is serious and much needed work to be done .
I assure you - unemployment is not an experience I would wish on ANYONE and right now , the benefits are the only thing keeping us in an even marginal existence .
Best Regards ,
From RS in GA :
TO : Representative Jim McDermott Chairman , Subcommittee on Income Security and Family Support of the Committee on Ways and Means I am one of the thousands of Americans that has exhausted the maximum 99 weeks of unemployment benefits .
These numbers are growing at an alarming rate every week .
I am 58 years old and unemployed since November , 2007 .
My savings have been depleted ( so much for retirement ) , and foreclosure of my home is looming ahead .
Unemployment benefits enabled me to barely keep my head above water , so I am very thankful for the extensions of Tier 1 - 4 .
However , the job situation in our country is not improving fast enough to help the millions of unemployed Americans who want to work .
A Tier 5 or extension to an existing tier would be a life line for thousands of hurting American families .
This is not the American dream I envisioned when I joined the work force 35 years ago .
I am from the generation that identified ourselves by our careers .
Now , no one wants to hire us or even give us the courtesy of a reply to our job applications today .
There are so many applications for every available position .
I have been told by hiring representatives that they receive 100 plus resumes for one position .
And , these are often for entry level positions .
I am totally helpless and scared about what the future holds for myself and our country .
I am not alone .
However , in this situation , there is no comfort in numbers .
Yes , I agree that in an ideal America , 99 weeks of benefits should be enough .
However , we are no longer living in a country where jobs are available to all who want one .
Washington seems to have turned it ’s back on us just when we need them most .
Contrary to what some members of Congress and the public may think , the vast majority of us would prefer a job to begging for help .
I know I certainly do .
My resources are exhausted , not to mention my pride and self - esteem .
We are all American citizens with still a lot to contribute to our society when jobs become available again .
Our current situations will definitely have a negative effect on the recovery of the economy .
I am unable to comprehend how this has been allowed to happen to so many American citizens and to our country .
Please heed our call for help by voting for a Tier 5 extension immediately .
We are desperate for your help to survive this terribly frightening situation .
We are counting on you and know you will do the right thing for us and for our country .
Thank you for your attention .
Sincerely ,
From JB in FL :
TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN : I AM WRITING THIS LETTER IN REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL LONG TERM UNEMPLOYMENT .
I HAVE BEEN UNEMPLOYED NOW FOR OVER TWO YEARS .
I HAVE APPLIED FOR EVERY POSITION AVAILABLE WITH MY SKILL SETS , BUT TO NO AVAIL .
THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN MY COUNTY IS THE HIGHEST IN OUR STATE AT 14.2 % , AND THERE DOESN ’T SEEM TO BE ANY RELIEF IN SIGHT .
I HAVE READ WHERE THOSE OF US WHO HAVE BEEN UNEMPLOYED FOR THE LONG TERM ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE EMPLOYED DUE TO OUR INABILITY TO KEEP UP WITH THE TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES OR CHANGES IN FEDERAL RULES .
I HAVE ALSO READ WHERE EMPLOYERS ARE TELLING RECRUITERS NOT TO HIRE THE LONG TERM UNEMPLOYED .
THIS SOUNDS LIKE A DEATH SENTENCE FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE AMONGST THE LONG TERM UNEMPLOYED .
I DON ’T THINK WE SHOULD HAVE TO FALSIFY OUR RESUME TO SHOW THAT WE ARE WORTHY OF EMPLOYMENT .
THE GOVERNMENT LIKES TO PAINT A POSITIVE PICTURE THAT THE ECONOMY IS TURNING AROUND , BUT IF THEY TAKE THOSE OF US WHO NO LONGER SHOW UP ON THE UNEMPLOYMENT ROLES INTO CONSIDERATION , THE PICTURE WOULD LOOK MUCH DIFFERENT .
WE DON ’T WANT A HANDOUT .
WE WANT A HAND UP .
( IE : JOBS ) PLEASE BRING OUR COUNTRY BACK TO THE STRONG AND CARING NATION THAT IT ONCE WAS .
SINCERELY ,
From SB in PA :
I am writing in regards to the unemployment situation in not only in my area but also in my own home .
My fiance and I were both on unemployment and have been for almost a year plus but my fiance just found out that he is out ….. and it does n’t look like either of us will be finding jobs anytime soon .
So at this point , for a family of 3 , we make a little over $ 800 a month with about $ 1200 in bills .
At times I have to wounder if I ’m going to have enough to pay for the lights never mind all the other necessities .
We are going to lose our car and house soon enough .
I wounder if you have ever had to tell your son or daughter “ I ’m sorry but mommy and daddy can not afford to throw you a birthday party this year because we do n’t have the money ” .
We turned to the Welfare Office for help because I was under the impression that ’s were people turn to when they need help the most and we were told “ I ’m sorry you make to much to get any other help then food stamps ” .
How am I supposed to keep a roof over my families head with food stamps ???
I was told by my caseworker that Reading Pa ( which is the area I live ) has an unemployment rating of a little over 12 % that ’s over most states .
I happen to live in an apartment building that holds 4 families and what is really sad , only two people in the entire building work ….
that ’s right I said two and that ’s out of 8 adults over the age of 18 .
We go on job interview after job interview and hear the same thing at each one , there are usually more the 5 other people applying for 1 job .
I am so frustrated , disgusted , and fed up with living like this anymore .
I WANT A JOB and can not find one .
I WANT TO PAY MY BILLS and can’t .
I want to be able to sleep at night knowing my family will have a place to sleep tomorrow .
I am begging you to listen to the real people and help us out like we are helping so many other countries .
Charity starts at home .
You have said “ Our first step to respond to long - term unemployment is obvious — continue the emergency federal unemployment programs to prevent millions of workers from losing their benefits .
If we can afford wars , tax cuts , and bank bailouts , then we can certainly afford to maintain programs for workers who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own .
But we also need to think about additional steps to help those trying to return to work .
An increasing number of Americans who have worked hard and played by the rules are now finding themselves with no job , no savings and no support .
We must not abandon these workers and their families . ”
You hit the nail right on the head and I / we the real people really hope you meant it .
From DA in CA :
Chairman McDermott
I am responding to problem with unemployment .
I have been unemployed since June 13 , 2008 .
I worked in the Car Dealerships for 20 years .
I loved my job .
When I took vacations with some of my family , it was not a vacation .
When I got back to work I felt I was on vacation .
I loved my job in the Car Dealerships so much that when I worked it built energy in me , so that when I got home after 8 hours of work at the Car Dealership I still had energy to work at home .
I first became unemployed in Oct. 2006 when Ojai Ford in Ojai , Ca. was shut down by Ford Motor Company because it was a small Ford Dealer .
I then went to work for Mel Clayton Ford in Santa Barbara , Ca. in Nov.2006 and was I let go buy Mel Clayton Ford in April 2007 because again Ford Motor Company shut Mel Clayton Ford down because it was not selling enough new Vehicles .
Then in July 2007 I went to work for Cars 101 in Oxnard Ca .
I worked for them for a couple of weeks just to find out they were shutting down .
Then in Oct. 2007 I went to work for Todey Chevrolet in Oxnard , Ca . I was let go there in June 2008 because Vehicle sales had slowed way down .
The Senators say we are lazy so they are removing our unemployment .
We are not lazy as you can see from my jobs as Dealers closed their doors .
The banks , Car companies , and other finance houses received bail out money from our tax money that we did not Ok .
Wall Street and these companies are the reason we are out of jobs and we get called lazy .
I went back to school taking classes on line while looking for work June 2009 and finished the class in Medical Billing in April 2010 , because I knew I had to get into a line of work that I would not be losing because of shut downs , and now I am told I need to know Spanish to get in the Medical Office ’s .
This is not right our language is English , and people coming here should learn English not us being told I am sorry but you do not speak Spanish so we can not use you .
We do not enjoy not having jobs .
We want to work ; unemployment is not going to prepare us for retirement .
The ones of us in our 50 ’s may not be able to retire thanks to Wall Street and the banks .
From SS in PA :
I am one of the many of Americans who are part of the 99ers needing a Tier V . I would like to share my story of how I became unemployed .
At the time of my unemployment I was a 25 Year old mother of 1 .
I worked for a great company , great pay , great employees .
I loved my job .
My son has the disability of Autism .
To make a long story short , I requested a new work schedule to deal with my child care problems and was denied .
I ended up losing my job for missing time at work , wether being late or having to leave early to care for my child .
I applied for unemployment is August of 2008 .
At first I was denied unemployment compensation from the employer .
After winning my case with the referee I was granted my benefits .
I have been on 26 Job interviews since I was forced to leave my previous job .
Thats right 26 job interviews .
After every interview I was told we will follow up with you .
After not getting any of the jobs the reasons explained to me are not enough experience , too much experience , over qualified , under qualified .
All the same .
I am currently 27 years old .
I have been unemployed for almost 2 years now .
I have worked almost everyday of my life since I turned 16 .
I worked through high school , through college , through pregnancy .
For over 10 years of my life I had a stable life , a stable paycheck .
Since receiving unemployment , life has been on pins and needles .
Not knowing if come the next time I will file , I will receive my benefit payment .
It is the most horrible feeling in the world .
Not knowing if I will be able to pay my bills , not knowing if I will be able to feed my child .
Some members of the political party are stating that unemployment has become the new welfare .
If you speak with any person who has been unemployed throughout this entire time , you will find out we are WANTING and WILLING to work .
As compared with the Welfare system , majority of the people on welfare believe , why work when the government will pay my bills , buy me groceries , give me free health care , and even a free cell phone .
I as an American receiving unemployment and soon I will run out of my benefits after I reach my final tier , am begging for help .
I have worked and payed taxes , as well as your salary with my tax money , for over 10 years .
Do n’t let us Americans who are trying fall through the cracks because of some limitation of numbers .
From LG in CA :
To Whom It May Concern :
My name is LG and I reside at xx in xx , Ca .
I am 58 years old and I have been out of work for over a year .
This is not due to my not trying , I promise you .
I had a good job with a solid company , Sears , but I was laid off last year in February .
My intention was to work for this company until I retired , but that was not to be .
I have applied for over 200 positions since then , but have only been called for a few interviews and have had no offers , even though I was a top supervisor in my previous job and had a lot of experience .
I find myself competing for even entry level positions with a mass of people who are also overqualified , but willing to start at the bottom for a chance to advance .
At 58 , I am thinking more about my retirement than about climbing the corporate ladder again , but it does not matter , because I am not given a chance .
I have depended on the unemployment provided to me to live day to day , but if I lose that money , I am very fearful of being unable to find employment to meet even my basic needs .
I am not alone in this problem !!
Please do not let down the people who have played by the rules and worked hard all their lives because you think the money would be better spent elsewhere .
Where can it be better spent than in support of Americans who have lived their lives by our laws and now find themselves with financial problems NOT of their own making ?
I do not know if this letter will do any good , but PLEASE be aware that what happened to me could and HAS happened to many Americans , and I do not believe putting us on the streets is a viable solution to the problem .
Please continue unemployment benefits until the economy improves , no matter how long it takes .
This is only fair to those of us not responsible for the economic mess we are in .
Thank you ,
From BF in MI :
I would like to share my personal story on behalf of over a million of long term unemployed Americans .
We currently are referred to as the “ 99ers ” .
I have been unemployed since this recession began and I do not like being referred to as lazy , looking for an excuse not to work .
I have responded to thousands of ads in our local paper that I am qualified to do the work employers need done .
There is rarely a response or interview .
Some employers even insert in their ads that they prefer no follow - up phone calls , “ we will call you if you match our requirements ” .
I am from Michigan and as you all know , Michigan remains the state of highest unemployment .
I have always paid my taxes so Congress and the states can enjoy the good life .
In west Michigan , the healthcare field is predominant and they too have politics .
The largest healthcare employer here only hires from their preferred school of choice .
Having a stellar career record , holds no weight when it comes to the healthcare politics in west Michigan .
The President ’s stimulus package was for “ shovel ready jobs ” , this is no help to women in Michigan .
Yes , we appreciate the extension of Federal unemployment benefits .
But , in Michigan this is not enough .
If there are no jobs , Michigan will and has remained the highest in unemployment in the nation .
I ask the Ways and Means Committee to please understand how things really are .
I am willing to be underemployed , employed part - time or what ever it takes .
If employers are not hiring I feel they are afraid of all the taxes they are now required to pay .
If you do n’t have dependent children , you ca n’t even get State help .
So , please , see my situation as urgent and understand that I and thousands of others need help until we can get jobs .
PLEASE SIGN A BILL TO HELP US TILL WE ARE EMPLOYED AGAIN .
From LS in CT :
Dear Committee on Ways and Means : I am the first generation Lithuanian American from parents born in Lithuania .
My parents were “ DP ’s ” ( displaced persons ) during WWII .
Because of this War based upon differences in Religious beliefs , my parents were forced to flee Lithuania and give - up their homeland as teenagers .
My parents became United States citizens through Elis Island legally .
I have a passion for science since I was little .
My first exposure to Chemistry was in the fifth grade during a demonstration of Volcanoes .
I excelled in the Sciences through middle school with self teaching utilizing a Chemistry Set .
My first formal exposure to Chemistry was in High School .
I achieved a D+ in that course .
The teacher stated to my parents during open house “ I would NEVER be a good Scientist ” .
In my college years , I pursued the sciences and now hold three degrees : B.Sc. Organic Chemistry B.Sc. Biotechnology M.Sc. Organic Chemistry After College , I became employed in industry with a Starting Salary of only $ 28 K in the late 1980 ’s – early 1990’s .
I was employed by the Pharmaceutical Industries where I passionately preformed my art of Synthetic Organic Chemistry of potentially new Drugs for various therapeutic areas .
I held bench chemistry positions within Bristol - Myers Squibb , Purdue Pharma , Peptimmune , Pfizer , and recently at Vion Pharmaceuticals .
My last position ended with a lay - off as “ A Thanksgiving Holiday Gift in 2007 ” where my salary peaked to $ 77 K for my entire career .
Because the management at Vion is inept and EXTREMELY INTELLECTUALLY CHALLENGED , Vion is NOW IN BANKRUPTCY .
During my 23 year career , I now hold over 18 US and foreign Patents in the area of dyes and new drugs .
I also have product on the market ( 5 US patents obtained & a Work related M.Sc. Degree ) with Bristol - Myers Squibb .
I do not gain any royalties from this product as all rights to the Intellectual Property are waived to the Corporation with the first day of employment .
There are many in the Sciences that are passionate about this work .
One has to be passionate because we clearly DO NOT DO THIS TYPE OF CAREER for the MONEY !
We pursue such careers because we are extremely passionate about Science and we have high goals for achievement .
If there are any Saints Left in the USA , it is the people in the Science and Medicine fields because our goal is to ultimately help humanity .
Unfortunately , corporate management at any level does not require much education .
I my experiences in Corporate Sciences Industry , management is only required to hold a minimum Bachelor of Arts degree and maybe an MBA for higher levels .
The Scientist must possess greater intellect and higher education credentials to be in research .
Management most often is intellectually challenged .
This is obvious in their education and credentials .
However , Intelligence is NOT REWARDED WITH MONEY unlike management which has no clue to the Sciences .
I have seen and been included in several lay - offs .
In the recent past , the lay - offs at Pfizer are an abomination of the Intellectually Gifted .
A true example of where our country is headed was with the passage of NAFTA .
The sciences are sourced out overseas .
EVIDENCE : A scientist with a B.S. or M.S. in China will earn $ 2 K to $ 3 K per year .
A Sciences Ph.D. in China will earn you $ 7 K to $ 8 K per year .
A current Sciences Ph.D. graduate in the USA will earn you $ 80 K per year if you can land the position in this economy .
From the intellectually challenged management , why pay for One Scientist here in the USA when we can have 10 slaves overseas doing the job .
This is a fantastic business decision with the potential for Intellectual Property Theft overseas .
It appears you are better off being Intellectually Challenged to make the real money and high positions in the USA .
Example : Former President Bush “ do n’t worry – anyone with a C- from Yale can become president ” .
Need more be said ?
Current President Obama : “ we need more students in math and sciences ” .
The problem is we already have the best Intellects in the USA but NO WORK !
Political “ leaders ” have a great life with all the fringe benefits .
Until a fatal medical condition strikes one of these Political “ leaders ” , we then need a serious cure for that ailment .
STOP WASTING TAXPAYERS HARD EARNED MONEY AND GET US BACK TO WORK !
In the meantime , we unemployed need financial support for this a depression in the USA .
In 2009 , I was hired at Pfizer as a contractor for a supposed three month contract with potential for transitioning into a full time permanent position .
This was a bait and trap scheme .
I have determined this not to be the case .
There are “ temporary employees ” that have worked for Pfizer for up to 4 to 5 years .
This is a “ temporary position ” ?
It is an abuse and nothing more than MODERNIZED SLAVERY .
Needless to say , my position was temporary .
I had worked for Pfizer a total of 12 business days in 2009 .
As a result , a new “ UI benefit year was established ” and my weekly Unemployment Insurance Benefit had been reduced from $ 501 per week to a NOW $ 22 per week .
The unemployed are supposed to work and take anything they are qualified for and ultimately be abused .
THIS IS TRULY MODERNIZED SLAVERY IN THE USA !
The $ 22 per week UI benefit is insufficient to support me .
Therefore , I now teach Organic Chemistry Laboratory for a local University to supplement the menial UI benefit .
However , this position is also just part - time varying from 3 to 9 hours a week .
Academia is far more than industry strapped for funding .
Academic instruction really can be viewed as COMMUNITY SERVICE / VOLUNTEER WORK – the compensation is extremely low .
My students ask about obtaining employment in this field after graduation .
Unfortunately , I tell them as it is – good luck .
What else can I tell my students ?
Move to China as was told to me from a colleague at Pfizer .
We see what comes from China : Poisoned Milk with melamine ( Formica process chemical – if ingested causes Kidney failure ) , tainted Heparin causing death , lead painted toys , poisoned sea food , etc .
Our entire family life has drastically changed in 2009 .
My older brother died of a heart attack in 2009 .
His daughter ( my “ ex- nice ” ) tried to steal my deceased brother ’s estate without going through probate – OF WHICH I RECTIFIED for my Mom .
Late 2009 , my dad was diagnosed with Alzheimer ’s , and our family dog of 16.5 years passed away prior to Thanksgiving .
The death of my older brother prompted the rest of us to obtain physicals .
I have no health insurance since my lay - off of 2007 .
For health reasons , I spent $ 1200 out - of - pocket for a standard physical .
A potential indication may have arisen pertaining to my heart .
My doctor insists upon a heart evaluation and stress tests — I cannot afford $ 7000 for the tests .
Who knows perhaps I will be next in the family to unnecessarily perish .
The Obama “ insurance for everyone ” plan is a farce .
We are going to be forced to pay for insurance when we have NO MONEY – WE ARE IN DIRE STRATES .
This appears to be a favor for big Insurance Corporations .
I am a registered Independent Voter without any Political Party affiliation .
Stop labeling and quarrelling between “ Republican ” vs. “ Democrat ” titles .
You are all elected to work for the voters and legal citizens of the USA .
We are Americans with Rights .
Here is a little History lesson for all of you : IN CONGRESS , JULY 4 , 1776 The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America
We hold these truths to be self - evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are Life , Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness . —
That to secure these rights , Governments are instituted among Men , deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed , — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends , it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it , and to institute new Government Unfortunately , the majority of lawmakers are Attorneys .
Where are the morals and ethics ?
It appears to me lawmakers at every level are condemning the Declaration of Independence for which our forefathers shed much blood .
Are there NO RULES OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT AND ETHICS TO UPHOLD FOR ATTORNIES ?
Yes , there are State Grievance Panels to discipline Attorneys that DO NOT UPHOLD THESE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT !!!
It is ultimately cause for DISBARMENT !
Therefore , STOP the BICKERING and Pass H.R. 4213 immediately .
The unemployed are in EXTREME FINANCIAL DISTRESS !!!
I would like to Thank - you in advance for your attention into this matter .
Regards ,
From DH in OH :
Dear Senator McDermott , Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee In 2008 when I was laid - off , I had full expectations of being in a new position within 90 days .
I had an excellent job record of 27 + years , good references , and above average test scores on most organizational screening exams for hiring .
Networking included meetings , Linked - in , friends and family referrals , and even extended to previous employers .
At the point of my lay - off I was financially caring for my 83 year old mother , caring as well for my husband who returned to work after a stroke and was living with prostate cancer .
We were paying on our home .
And while the Department of Education had garnished 15 % of my wages , we were doing our very best to keep afloat .
However , the job did not come in 90 days .
Increased resume sending returned no interviews , nor any offers .
I reverted back to the old method of knocking on doors .
And then one very kind potential employer told me the facts no one else had even bothered to bring up : “ You have all the right packaging however you do not have a degree .
Without a degree today , it is quite possible that you will not be able to return to an executive position in any company . ”
You see , I had returned to college to complete my degree and then my husband was diagnosed with Thyroid Cancer .
I left school to resolve this family health emergency .
The months that followed exceeded the limit for my Federal Aid deferment and I was urged to consolidate my loans .
At that time our finances due to no insurance landed us , with deep humility , on the welfare rolls .
In error I did the consolidation because I believed it would get me back in school .
Over the years I tried here and there to make payments as I could .
After all , I was only three to five courses away from my degree .
Yet , my efforts fell short when , in 2007 , my wages were garnished .
I filed a lawsuit against the Department of Education for the sole purpose of getting a court to look at my finances and set a repayment amount that I could afford – one that would allow me to return to school to complete my degree .
Before I could complete this court case , I was laid - off .
The emotional trauma of no longer being able to support my mother , who was at that point dealing with terminal cervical cancer ; the economic shock of the combined garnishment and lay - off now showing its impact in our home being foreclosed on ; and the painful physical impact of the stress upon my body as a 61 year old Fybromyalgia sufferer , did not sway me from diligently looking for work .
Unemployment benefits became our life - line .
Not enough to go out to a movie , yet enough to buy medicine and groceries .
We found a different place to live .
We stood - up , dusted ourselves off , as Americans do , and we gave the hard knocks our best fight .
In August 2009 my beloved mother passed away from cervical cancer .
In October 2009 , my husband , the only one working , was diagnosed with Lymphoma cancer .
As an armed guard working at the Federal building , a new union had cancelled insurance benefits 5 months earlier , even though the premiums continued to come out of his pay .
So here we were :
He could not go back to work ; we had no insurance ; and all that we had as income were my unemployment benefits .
I asked our lender for a loan modification that still has not been approved – almost one year later .
Chemo started .
I applied for SS Disability for him through the hospital .
Pages after pages of Dr. ’s reports and data , and more data were submitted .
Then , the Dr. ’s found bone marrow cancer .
This meant my husband had three active cancers in his body .
( Prostate , Lymphoma , and Bone marrow ) .
Two slow growing ; one in stage IV .
I remember the day we were told that my husband would not be returning to his job .
His work days were for all intensive purposes , over .
We desperately awaited the decision from the Social Security Administration .
Early this year the answer came ; DENIED .
We then had to hire an Attorney .
The unemployment benefits were being stretched , yet they were still available due to an additional tier active through March 2010 .
In the midst of all of this , I continued job searching , going to meetings , sending resumes and doing whatever a potential employer asked of me , all to no result .
Then in March 2010 , after scoring high on a pre-employment exam , I was given a chance to compete for an executive position against five other persons .
I made the cut of top three .
The problem however , was that I did not have a degree .
I was informed that if I enroll in a degree program to complete my BA , I can be hired as an Administrator in training at 50 % wage ; then when I complete my degree , I would be placed at the full 100 % salary .
This position allows me to transition my skills set from organizational management to healthcare administration with a focus on Adult Family Care .
It appeared that my prayers were about to be answered .
I went to the local offices entrusted with dispersing WIA funding .
I brought in my pre-registration papers from UIU , and a letter from the Ohio Department of Jobs and Family Services saying that I had been identified as one of a certain group that should be given priority help regarding Pell grants and other funding .
WIA allotments total a maximum of $ 5000 / person .
I thought if I could get them to pay for the first semester , then I would be working and I could pay the amount that the DOE demands and then be eligible for Federal Aid to complete the final term .
On paper it looked so perfect .
Then WIA rules dictated that they could only pay ½ of the $ 5000 / semester ; they also required a financial aid letter which could not be given because my student loans are in default meaning I am not eligible for financial aid and a letter from the potential employer .
The school was asked to allow me to enroll and pay later .
The school wanted a letter from the potential employer stating that they understood that if I could not pay the school back , the BA proof would be withheld .
The potential employer asked for proof of financial ability .
And this is the circle I am on as I write .
So there you have my story .
All the programs out here are circular .
One depends on the other , depends on the other , depends on the other etc .
The potential employer has given me until August 15th to enroll in school .
And if I can not solve the challenges to obtain WIA funding , I will have no way to get into school .
No enrollment in school , =no job .
Due to a Federal extension of State benefits , my last unemployment check was last week .
Without a new Tier V , my family , already in both economic and health crisis will go under .
I literally have no idea what to do .
I had even thought of writing President Obama to get help on allowing financial aid for the severely unemployed even with default history , with a new definition of hardship deferment .
This letter to you is from the heart .
I humbly pray that you are wise in your oratory in conveying that living destitute is bearable so long as the American spirit remains intact .
Where do I find hope ?
Where are the doors of opportunity for me ?
Am I to become one of the wasted ?
Let me tell you what I have learned :
If you feed a man for a day , he lives for a day ; – this is the welfare system ; however , if you teach a man to fish , you feed him for a lifetime .
Unemployment benefits are helping me to fish for a lifetime – This is protecting human capital .
I end with the words today by Pope Benedict XVI :
The pontiff says “ finance and the economy are nothing more than a means to help people realize their full potential and keep their dignity ….
that human “ capital ” is what any financial rescue plan must save … those shaping economy need to make the needs of families central to their planning . ”
I pray for mercy .
For every day I did not live up to the expectations of my country , I worked ; I contributed to society and to my community .
Poverty does not define character .
I pray the blessings upon my leaders in congress that they may see within their own current rules and restrictions ( WIA , DOE , Loan Modifications , and SS ) that restructuring toward the greater good will help , not hinder the economy .
And will bring stability once again to the working , yet unemployed masses .
The power to help in this moment , in this time rests in the hands of congress .
May God make it so .
From LM in IN :
Senator McDermott ; I am asking that you please put in a Tier V for us long term unemployed .
I am a 61 year old woman who has been unemployed since November 2007 .
Since that time I have sent hundreds of resumes , gone to a few interviews and have pounded the pavement in search of a job .
When I was lucky enough to get a face to face interview I was told I was over qualified or as better said to old to waste our time with .
Since being unemployed I have had to file bankruptcy , lost my home , my vehicle , my savings , my retirement fund .
But mostly Senator I have lost my pride .
At 61 I thought I would be getting ready to plan for a comfortable retirement , not fighting for survival .
With another Tier I ’m hoping that I can at least get to Social Security age so that I can then have some income in case the powers that be decide that we ” 99ers are undeserving of more help because we are only using unemployment benefits to keep from looking for work . ”
That we are really getting “ Funemployment ”
Tell that to my grandchildren whom I can no longer spend any money on because I can barely buy food .
Please Senator McDermott help us .
Sincerely ,
From SR in NV :
I live just outside Las Vegas , Nv. , I had a good job for two and a half years with no expectation of termination for quite awhile based on the nature of my profession .
I was let go during the economic downturn .
Within 6 months of being let go the company I worked for went bankrupt and closed .
I am a 55 year old worker and the unemployment extensions that have been provided by the federal government has allowed me to stay floating .
I have n’t had insurance since my last day at work .
Jan. 16 , 2009 .
My bills were greater than my ability to obtain Cobra .
I have looked for work since being laid off but the market is very bleak .
I am very concerned about my future at this age .
Many college graduates are out of work and taking the jobs of those of us that were given the opportunity to work even though we did n’t have Bachelor degrees .
When the market turns around those of us in my age bracket without a B.A. are going to have a much more difficult time gaining full - time employment .
In Nevada , we are told the Tier 4 and the State extended benefits have been discontinued .
So my 3rd tier Federal extension is over in a couple of weeks and I will be in a very difficult financial position if I am unable to depend on the federal benefits .
Please help us , pass this bill , we would work if we could find a job .
From JH in MA :
To Whom it may concern ;
My name is JH , A life long resident of xx Massachusetts .
I have worked jobs since I was 12 .
My first job being a paper route !
I am a 38 year old single mother of 2 boys .
ages 19 and 9 ..
My last job began back in 2005 .
I got a job as a supervisor in a Bakery / Cafe in Acton Mass .
It was called Country Harvest Bakery aka G&T Enterprises .
I worked there for 2 years .
I loved my job !
Right before Christmas in 2007 the company closed .
Business just was n’t good enough to keep going I guess .
The economy was struggling back then !
I was forced onto unemployment .
It was bad enough having to wait almost 2 months to get approved for unemployment and then start receiving checks !
My children suffered at Christmas time with very little gifts and food .
I was able to get a little help from a local church in town !
Since I have been unemployed , I have searched for jobs high and low .
I was even told I was too over qualified to work at McDonalds !
Are you kidding me ?
What will they think of next ?
And Minimum Wage JOB WILL NOT keep a roof over our heads !
I was barely making it back then .
Since all of this has happened .
And i have to say ..
There was a time when I had exhausted all benefits and I had NO help from anyone ..
I lost custody of my children .
My youngest son is now legally adopted and living with people who CAN afford to have children !
It ’s pretty sad when our government can take away our families and create poverty !
They all sit sit there ( getting paid ) I might add .
to make decisions for OUR Financial Security !!
If you can say yes to bailing out Banks and everyone else that needs it .
Than why ca n’t you say YES to help your Fellow Americans .
Who have worked their whole lives and paid Taxes and pay for people on WELFARE .
WHY CANT YOU HELP US ?????
Desperately Seeking a Tier 5 !!!
From VL in IL :
My name is VL and I have been unemployed since August 2008 .
I was laid off and then the company I worked from based out of Columbus Georgia went out of business .
I have been looking for work ever since .
I have gone on multiple interviews but when I walk into the door I know that I am not want they want .
First I am a woman who has a lot of experience in the field I am applying at and I am not a model who can type .
I ’ve tried every venue to apply for jobs in every area just to get some work and I have been unable to find anyone who will hire me .
They say my resume is great and when I get there I know I am not what they want .
I have now exhausted all my benefits and the sad thing is my husband was laid off in 2006 and he is only working on an as needed basis .
We have a home but I do not know for how long .
I do not have family to help in this situation and I am afraid that if our government does not step in I will be living on the street sooner than later .
Please , please pass some type of bill that will extend benefits and help us long term citizens continue to look for work and remain in their homes , apartments , etc .
Thank you for taking the time to listen .
From DC in MD :
Dear Sirs , I was laid off on Dec 31,2007 .
My job as service manager was eliminated and eventually , the company that I worked for , I.C. , Inc ) closed it ’s business .
I am 63 years old now and I have not even been able to find employment since that time .
I worked diligently for 39 years ( combined between Lucent technologies and I.C. ) and I need 5 years of full time employment so that I can have retirement .
All my retirement savings are depleted since my unemployment benefits exhausted in March 2010 .
Please help folks like me , whose long time efforts have helped make this country great !
Respectfully ,
From DW in NY :
To Whom It May Concern : I was fired from the NYPost February 13 , 2008 .
While waiting for my unemployment benefits to kick in I began looking for work .
I went on a few interviews , nothing came of them .
My 26 weeks of original benefits ended around August or so .
Before I had a chance to worry , the first extension came into being .
This took me to about October , when I went on what was to be my last interview for quite some time .
While waiting to find out whether I got that job the government came to the rescue with the second extension .
This one lasted until mid-January , when I found out that the job I had interviewed for in October no longer existed due to job cuts .
Between mid-January and all of February I lived on a credit card hoping to buy time while continuing to look .
The third extension was enacted .
I decided to take some classes in an effort to enhance my skills and make me more employable .
These classes I put on my credit card .
I lost track as to when that one ended but , thankfully , there was a fourth extension .
This one ended in the beginning of April .
For the first time since October 2008 I went on an interview later that month .
As I do not qualify for the 5th extension that was passed in May after collecting for 99 weeks I have been living on some money I came into , all the while waiting to hear from the latest job I interviewed for , which is on hold .
The money I am currently living on will run out in July / August .
While I would prefer to work , a new extension would once again buy precious time so the job search can continue .
I hope that you can help us “ 99ers ” with a new extension so that we can continue to look for work without having to worry about where our next meal will come from and to keep a roof over our heads .
Thank you for listening .
From KD in MI :
To Whom it May Concern : I writing today to encourage you the law makes to help the long term unemployed , either by adding a Tier V level or adding more weeks to the current Tiers of emergency Unemployment extensions .
I personally happen to be one of the so called 99ers that will be running out of unemployment benefits soon unless something is done .
I live in Michigan and as you are well aware that this state has the highest unemployment rate in the nation .
I am a college graduate with a four year degree and I have always work hard and have give it 100 % in everything I do .
Over the past two year that I ’ve unemployment I have applied to hundreds of jobs .
Jobs that are in my field of work and jobs that are minimum wage however I never hear a thing back , I also do follow up calls and e-mail still with no prevail .
I am not a lazy person nor am I the type of person that uses they system I just happen to be one of the many people who our being affected by what is being call “ The Great Recession ” .
I hear news reports that the economy is turning around and that company ’s are hiring again which is great for everyone .
However , it ’s not back to where it was when the recession started .
This is indicated by the high unemployment numbers that are still being reported in the news .
In closing I want to thank you for taking the time to review and have hearing about this highly sensitive topic that is effecting a large number of hardworking Americans .
Also ,
Thank you for taking the time to review and consider my letter .
From SF in GA :
Dear Committee Members :
As I follow the proceedings on C - Span and through the national news , I am very thankful when unemployment benefits are extended , however it has come to my attention that recent extensions were not approved for all unemployed Americans , but only for some .
How can that be ?
How can lawmakers discriminate against the thousands of unemployed Americans that have exhausted their 4th tier unemployment benefits ?
I am one of those Americans that have exhausted all benefits and my question today is ; how is the decision made to help some but not others ; to be eliminated from the only financial lifeline that we currently have ?
The exclusion decision reminds me of those doomed individuals on the Titanic .
A decision was also made for them as to who was to be saved and whose only chance for survival was eliminated .
Are our elected officials so out of touch with reality that they do n’t know that there are no other financial means for me and thousands of unemployed Americans that have exhausted our 4th tier unemployment benefits ?
That just because they feel the “ time is right ” to remove our only source of income , that jobs are just going to magically appear ?
It is my belief that they are indeed informed , leaving me with the conclusion that perhaps they – just – do n’t – care .
The key point that I am trying to make today is that : it is through no fault of our own that we lost our jobs ( I lost my job due to outsourcing ) and through no fault of our own that we cannot find jobs due to the recession that America has slid into .
We the people were busy going to work every day and going home to our families , participating in our communities , but apparently we were not watching closely enough to what decisions lawmakers in Washington were making ; important decisions , some of which that carried the very ramifications that has put America in this quagmire .
Out of all of the men and women serving as America ’s elected officials , sent to Washington to champion for America and Americans , is there not enough that care what happens if our only financial lifeline is eliminated ?
It is my opinion that this very important decision , if not correctly made , is going to enable yet another domino to fall in the domino - effect scenario which may very well take America from a recession into a depression .
Perhaps those in disaster relief positions should be ready to begin setting up preparations to help feed and house millions of Americans , if America ’s elected governmental champions choose to discontinue financial support to unemployed Americans while they are making every effort to find employment .
During this horrible recession , I feel it is an absolute necessity as part of a recovery plan , that there is implementation of a temporary moratorium prohibiting companies from running a credit check on new job applicants .
For those of us that have been desperately trying to pay our bills on time , with our only source of income being unemployment , and as you know has thus far been unpredictable with regard to its regularity , has ruined our credit .
Incomprehensible to me , but there is a stigma attached to people ; if you have bad credit , you are therefore a bad person !
If companies are tossing resumes due to a credit report prior to looking at a person ’s qualifications , those of us unemployed Americans that have exhausted our unemployment benefits and have no other source of income therefore resulting in bad credit , will never get back to work !
In closing , I must tell you that as I reread my letter , I find that it screams desperation and frankly that provokes a touch of anger in me , which prompts me to reiterate what millions of Americans are asking … if our Federal Government can produce funds to bailout multi-million dollar banks , and produce billions of dollars to fund wars , why ca n’t it produce funds to help unemployed Americans until such time that we can all get back to work ?
It angers me enough to swallow what little pride I have left , and further add that since exhausting my unemployment benefits , I have lost my home and rely totally on housing and financial support from my 80 year - old mother , whose only source of income is her monthly Social Security check .
Sincerely ,
From KK in CA :
Thank you for your efforts to get our voices heard .
I am 40 and live in the Bay Area in CA , where the published unemployment rate is 11.7 % , but in reality I would guesstimate , that if you included the people like me that have exhausted their benefits that have now dropped off the official published unemployment rate , that the actual real unemployment rate is 13 - 17 % .
I have an MBA from a top 50 school , international business experience , an entrepreneurial background , and yet have been unemployed for over the 99 months , not for lack of trying .
I have been networking within over 10 large organizations , attending industry conferences , and have been retraining myself using my unemployment benefit funds to take classes from our local utility company , as well as earning certifications in energy efficiency , green building , and energy / sustainability management because this is a long term personal passion of mine .
Also , I have been a long - term part - time volunteer for over 8 non-profits during the time I was receiving the unemployment benefits .
I feel like I have been doing a very valuable service to the community and region where I live , and I have been utilizing this time of unemployment benefits well preparing myself for a wonderful career in a growing industry .
Unfortunately , I have made it to a number of interviews , even including a few positions that I was told had over 1000 applicants , but not gotten any offers .
I have made it to the final round of interview for multiple positions , but when it comes down to the final round , the employer would rather pick someone who has n’t been unemployed as long as I have even though I have worked hard to become a Certified Green Building Professional , a Certified Energy Plans Examiner , a LEED Green Associate , and have taken over 50 free energy efficiency courses from the one of the best utility companies in the nation .
Also unfortunate , I have learned that these positions seem to be offered to younger people , typically with little to no experience , but many times without a stigma such as long - term unemployment , and an undergraduate degree in environmental science / engineering , even though I have offered to take an entry level job and entry level pay just to get my foot in to the energy efficiency industry .
This whole experience has been a nightmare for my family !
It has led to depression issues for both myself and my wife .
My wife is a public school teacher and since my benefits ended in April we ’ve had to scrounge our cupboards for food by the end of each month , have wracked up over $ 11,000 in credit card debt , exhausted all of our savings , upset family members and friends because of having to borrow from them to help pay the rent , our car payments , all of which has had a negative impact on our credit - which leads to a longer term problem for me in terms of employment credit checks , etc. , etc … ..
This all has also affected my wife and my marriage of 15 years so much so that we had to seek marriage counseling , but then could n’t afford it any more after April when my benefits ran out .
Even though my wife has tenure and makes a decent salary , it is not enough in the Bay Area as we barely scrape by every month because the cost of living is EXTREMELY HIGH here in the CA Bay Area , and her salary is higher than the national poverty average which of course further prevents us from receiving any public assistance such as welfare , food stamps , etc .
All of this has led to tremendous stress for my wife and I , and our children , and she has threatened to divorce me multiple times because of not having a job , even though I am doing the best I can do taking care of our 2 children and our household , cooking , cleaning , doing all of the homework with my kids in the afternoons , applying to hundreds of jobs while my kids are at school , and never getting any offers except for minimum wage jobs , but then who will take care of our children and how can we afford that when after school care is in excess of what I would make at a minimum wage job ?
Additionally , when I was receiving benefits my 2 kids were able to participate in after school sports , but since April we have had to discontinue any extras like after school sports that cost money , when food and keeping the electricity and gas on is a higher priority .
I don ’ understand why AREAS SUCH AS NYC OR THE BAY AREA HAVE TO COMPLY WITH A NATIONAL AVERAGE anyway when it absolutely does not reflect reality where we live and THAT IS probably MINIMUM WAGE HERE , AND NO ONE BUT someone living on the street or out of their car in this area could afford to live on .
Thank you again for helping Congress to hear pleas from the struggling long term unemployed .
It would be great if Congress could further incentivize employers to hire people like me ( similar to the SF Jobs Now type programs ) which I do n’t qualify for because my wife ’s public school teacher salary is higher than the national poverty average , and penalize employers who do n’t give people like me priority for positions .
I really feel discriminated against , not so much for my age because I do n’t look 40 , but more so because of the terrible effects of long term unemployment .
Very sincerely ,
From RC in CA :
My story is similar to many others that I have heard .
I was laid off December 2007 as part of a company - wide layoff .
Since then I have been unable to get hired in the industry where I worked for 27 years up to my layoff .
That industry is property & casualty insurance .
I am 53 years old so I ’m nowhere near retiring .
When I first started applying for jobs , I was more selective about jobs located in Southern California .
For the last year and a half , I have applied in many other states .
I have also applied for any job for which I may be remotely qualified .
I have n’t counted all of my applications , but there have been hundreds .
I have had only a few interviews and maybe slightly more telephone interviews .
The result is always the same ; they find someone who is already working full - time .
The simple fact that I have been out of work , makes it nearly impossible to get hired .
Recently , I accepted a part - time job which will pay about $ 200 a week .
I was making $ 1,500 + a week .
My wife and I have survived and kept our house based on her income supplemented by savings .
We have now burned through most of our savings .
We are faced with losing the home we have owned for 19 years because we can’t afford the mortgage and we ca n’t sell as the value is now below our mortgage balance .
My two sons are relying on us for a place to live while they go to school .
One of my sons works part - time while my oldest son has the same problem I do .
He ca n’t get hired as he has been out of a job since Circuit City went out of business .
I have been laid off before , but I have always found comparable work .
Every day , I see vacant business locations or signs on another business closing their doors .
This situation is unprecedented and it will ruin our family financially .
I hate asking for help , I have never had to consider this type of long - term assistance .
It ’s humiliating .
I along with millions of other people need your help to stay afloat .
Please do the right thing and help me , help all of us by extending unemployment benefits .
Thank you .
From TH in OH :
My story is not unlike many others that have lost their UEC benefits .
I have been without benefits for 10 weeks now .
I have had to use my income tax refund which came from unemployment benefits .
I had $ 1,139 in my savings from my refund and now I am down to $ 200 and that will be gone after this month .
I am using these funds to pay for bills and food .
I was laid off from the American Red Cross in February of 2008 .
I have a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Cincinnati , Ohio .
This does me no good in applying for work .
I have applied , applied and applied with few interviews and no call backs .
I am even applying for minimum wage jobs but no results there .
I have never in my life had such a hard time to find a job .
I am 48 and have worked since I was 14 .
My fiancée is retired and has to file for bankruptcy from using credit cards since my unemployment and that ’s even with my benefits .
I know things are worse for those with children and those that are single and have had to move back home with a relative or those who lose their homes and become homeless .
Our food pantries cannot keep up with the demand .
The homeless are wandering the streets because our homeless shelter is full .
There are so many of us that have exhausted their Tier IV benefits and I plead with the congressional party to help us , save us and keep us on our feet until we can find any work that is available .
I am depressed , frustrated and feel I am about to completely lose myself .
I have no health care and I have to pay to see my Doctor $ 65 a visit just to get my blood pressure medicine and another Doctor $ 60 just to get my anxiety medicine I have had to obtain since I was laid off .
I was n’t even able to afford my son and my grandbabies Christmas gifts last year and cannot afford to send presents for their birthdays .
He has done one tour already and re-enlisted because he knows he would not be able to find work if he left the Army .
He is stationed in Grafenwhor , Germany .
I have not seen them in 2 years .
This is a shame .
What will it take for the government to wake up and help those who were hard working AMERICANS and want to be hard working AMERICANS working again ???
God Help Us !
From DC in FL :
I worked at a Fortune 100 company for 4.5 years .
Promoted 3 times in that period .
I had a family tragedy occur , two deaths within 10 days , and as anyone can imagine it affected my work performance and attitude .
Instead of being forgiven for this situation , and offered help to cope , I was reprimanded .
That obviously is not going to encourage someone to strive to do better after a tragedy .
I was to be monitored for performance and attitude for 3 months and be coached bi-weekly .
I sucked it up afraid of losing my job and went through it .
I was never monitored or coached , even though I repeatedly asked for it .
Afterwards as I was appalled at the treatment I received , I followed chain of command and told the next person what happened anonymously .
There was great concern from this higher up person about the situation .
I kept my identity anonymous out of my fear to lose my job , but I could not let the mistreatment I suffered stand .
I could n’t let it become the status quo for the future either .
Once it came time to reveal my identity to the higher up , the manager that mistreated me managed to speak with the higher up first .
When I spoke to the higher up he was no longer concerned , instead he was dismissive .
You can draw your own conclusions about the dramatic shift in attitude .
A week later , when we came into work , our computerized time clock was down .
I went straight to work , then to lunch , knowing that I would use a manual time sheet later .
I am a big guy , I eat a big lunch , and I do n’t know about anyone else , but when I eat a big lunch , I am pretty sleepy afterwards .
I came back from lunch , and was asked to clock in for the earlier time that the system was down .
I wrote in the time I believe that I arrived that day .
I also clocked out and in from lunch .
Mind you technically the whole day that I was off the clock , including whenever I filled out any paperwork , because I was not technically clocked in .
A couple of hours later , I was called into the manager ’s office by his underlings .
They stated that based on the security cameras timecode that I had misstated my clock in time by 5 minutes .
So I said , I ’m sorry , I do n’t exactly remember and I must have estimated incorrectly .
Instead of allowing me to fix the issue , they instead sent me home , suspended with pay , while they did a thorough investigation .
Thorough being less than 24 hours , I got a phone call from the manager informing me that I had been terminated , he did n’t have the human decency to terminate me in person .
Neither did he have the courage to look me in the eye and terminate me for that reason .
To me it seems like after I complained , they started to look for a reason .
They called my termination reason fraud .
When I applied for unemployment I explained the whole story .
Including the fact that I used to take a train 6 hours each way on my own dime to work part time on weekends .
I busted my hump to make it in that company .
I also brought forward evidence that I found out only after I was terminated .
I found out that the security system ’s timecode was not linked to a realtime hardware clock and was instead run by software and was not monitored for accuracy .
I found this out from a manager who has investigated theft at the store , but could not prove it because the timecode fluctuated hours at a time .
Because of that I was granted unemployment .
The company decided to not appeal the decision , if it was really fraud , would they not have decided to make an example ?
I appealed to the company ’s HR department .
They said they would investigate the whole situation .
During the ensuing 6 months , I found out that the manager who terminated me , was also terminated , then rehired but not at his original level .
Luckily he got to go back to work , even though he had been there less time than I had .
At that point I again inquired about the status of my appeal .
I was told , that they forgot to do the investigation .
Then as quickly as the initial decision was made , they did a thorough investigation and still denied me .
I took it to someone on the board of directors , and then the same HR person who denied me , called me to deny me again .
It ’s a conflict of interest in my opinion to have the same people do the same investigation a second time .
Unfortunately for me , my job was common but not , and everyone knows me from my previous employer .
They also know what happened , because when I went to look for work , I had to be honest with them .
I ’m an honest person , plus , if I lied , and they found out later , I ’d be unemployed again .
My work experience also disqualifies me for a lot of jobs , as they often wo n’t hire a person at half the wage they were previously making in another job .
Again , I could lie and pretend I never had a good paying job , but if they found out I would again be unemployed .
I do not have a college degree , though I am close .
I hope when it I get it , I will be able to find employment in another field , in the meantime I continue to search .
Until this day , I will not bad mouth the company in public or private .
Until this day I endeavor to get my job back .
I would n’t be trying to get back in or unwilling to badmouth , if I did n’t believe that I was wronged , or if I was guilty .
I ’m not yelling fire , I ’m trying to put it out and make peace .
they say the truth will set you free .
In my case , it has imprisoned me
From JS in MN :
To Whom It May Concern :
As one of many , many thousands or even millions of long - term unemployed United States citizens , I am writing to BEG , PLEAD , GROVEL , APPEAL , AND POINT BLANK ASK , for your assistance .
I have been out of work since February , 2008 .
I , on average , send out anywhere from 8 - 12 resumes and applications each week and have heard absolutely nothing .
My wife Sherri and I are trying to survive on my wife ’s disability , which is $ 1055.00 per month .
This barely covers our rent , let alone the monthly utilities .
Since my unemployment ran out approximately 6 months ago , we have applied for assistance through Wright County of Minnesota .
We have been accepted to Minnesota Care for health coverage and we get $ 189.00 per month for food stamps , which is not enough to even survive on .
I love the United States of America and thank The Good Lord each and every day for allowing Me to live in such a wonderful country .
However , it seems kind of ridiculous that our Great Nation can spend billions of dollars on wars , space exploration , and every other kind of expenditure , but cannot find it in their grasp to assist those Americans who have work all their lives , ( until this recession hit ) , to help this Great Nation become what it is today , by putting through another long - term extension for those long - term unemployed .
I appreciate everything the Government has done in regards to unemployment this far , however extending the dates people have to file does not do one bit of good for all the people that have ran out of benefits .
Thank you for your time on this matter and I look forward to hearing from you very soon with some good news .
Sincerely ,
Please visit Rochester Unemployment Examiner to review unemployment information , data and details that you do n’t find in the main stream media .
You can also add comments about your current situation and what you think needs ot be done to improve the job market and unemployment benefits system .
I hope to see you there .

Image caption Hulme was told he was a " real danger to young boys "
A paedophile who raped a 10 - year - old boy has been jailed indefinitely after being branded " every parent 's nightmare " .
Gareth Hulme , a 25 - year - old security guard from Manchester , was described in the city 's crown court as a predatory paedophile .
He admitted raping the 10 year old and 22 other charges relating to child sex offences and indecent images .
His arrest also led to police smashing an international child sex network .
Hulme was ordered to serve a minimum of six years when he was sentenced on Wednesday .
Judge Anthony Gee QC said as Hulme was regarded as a danger to young boys it may be many more years before he is considered safe enough to release .
Hulme raped the 10 year old twice at a festival in Cheshire last year .
Lurked in chatroom
While working at the event as a security guard , he gained the trust of the boy 's parents and lured him away to walk his dog in woods .
He also lurked in internet chatrooms to groom other victims , including a 15 - year - old boy , and was also attempting to arrange a meeting with a friend to have sex with a nine year old .
The 10 year old 's parents were in court while Hulme was sentenced .
The boy 's mother , in a victim impact statement , told the court that her " happy , friendly , outgoing " son had become quiet and withdrawn since the attacks .
She said he now refuses to do PE at school because he has to take his clothes off and sometimes communicates using charts with sad or smiling faces so he can indicate his mood .
" We do n't know if he will ever be the same again , " she said .
No right - thinking person hearing the facts of this case can feel anything but horror , revulsion and disgust Judge Anthony Gee QC
When police raided Hulme 's home following his arrest last June , they found a hoard of child abuse images on his mobile phone and computer .
This led to the unravelling of a child sex ring and 23 other police forces , including Interpol , launched raids to arrest suspects as far afield as Ireland , Spain and Luxembourg .
Twenty - five people have been arrested since Hulme was held and Greater Manchester Police also traced other potential child sex offenders , three of whom were charged , including a former high school maths teacher .
Judge Gee said : " No right - thinking person hearing the facts of this case can feel anything but horror , revulsion and disgust .
" I regard yours as an appalling case .
" You are a sexual predator and a paedophile .
" I regard you as a real danger to young boys who you regard as your prey to satisfy deviant and perverted sexual urges . "
He added : " You are only 25 and it seems likely to me you will remain a real danger to others for many years to come . "
Det Con Jordan McGowan , from Greater Manchester Police 's Operation Impact team set up to smash the paedophile ring , said : " What Hulme did to these boys was horrific and has led to two families dealing with issues that nobody should ever have to face .
" Cruelly , he had such a strong psychological hold over his victims that they were too scared to come forward . "
Internet Kill Switch
Last month , Sen. Joe Lieberman , I - Conn. , introduced a bill ( text here ) that might — we ’re not really sure — give the president the authority to shut down all or portions of the Internet in the event of an emergency .
It ’s not a new idea .
Sens. Jay Rockefeller , D - W.Va. , and Olympia Snowe , R - Maine , proposed the same thing last year , and some argue that the president can already do something like this .
If this or a similar bill ever passes , the details will change considerably and repeatedly .
So let ’s talk about the idea of an Internet kill switch in general .
It ’s a bad one .
Security is always a trade - off : costs versus benefits .
So the first question to ask is :
What are the benefits ?
There is only one possible use of this sort of capability , and that is in the face of a warfare - caliber enemy attack .
It ’s the primary reason lawmakers are considering giving the president a kill switch .
They know that shutting off the Internet , or even isolating the U.S. from the rest of the world , would cause damage , but they envision a scenario where not doing so would cause even more .
That reasoning is based on several flawed assumptions .
The first flawed assumption is that cyberspace has traditional borders , and we could somehow isolate ourselves from the rest of the world using an electronic Maginot Line .
We can’t .
Yes , we can cut off almost all international connectivity , but there are lots of ways to get out onto the Internet : satellite phones , obscure ISPs in Canada and Mexico , long - distance phone calls to Asia .
The Internet is the largest communications system mankind has ever created , and it works because it is distributed .
There is no central authority .
No nation is in charge .
Plugging all the holes is n’t possible .
Even if the president ordered all U.S. Internet companies to block , say , all packets coming from China , or restrict non-military communications , or just shut down access in the greater New York area , it would n’t work .
You ca n’t figure out what packets do just by looking at them ; if you could , defending against worms and viruses would be much easier .
And packets that come with return addresses are easy to spoof .
Remember the cyberattack July 4 , 2009 , that probably came from North Korea , but might have come from England , or maybe Florida ?
On the Internet , disguising traffic is easy .
And foreign cyberattackers could always have dial - up accounts via U.S. phone numbers and make long - distance calls to do their misdeeds .
The second flawed assumption is that we can predict the effects of such a shutdown .
The Internet is the most complex machine mankind has ever built , and shutting down portions of it would have all sorts of unforeseen ancillary effects .
Would ATMs work ?
What about the stock exchanges ?
Which emergency services would fail ?
Would trucks and trains be able to route their cargo ?
Would airlines be able to route their passengers ?
How much of the military ’s logistical system would fail ?
That ’s to say nothing of the variety of corporations that rely on the Internet to function , let alone the millions of Americans who would need to use it to communicate with their loved ones in a time of crisis .
Even worse , these effects would spill over internationally .
The Internet is international in complex and surprising ways , and it would be impossible to ensure that the effects of a shutdown stayed domestic and did n’t cause similar disasters in countries we ’re friendly with .
The third flawed assumption is that we could build this capability securely .
We can’t .
Once we engineered a selective shutdown switch into the Internet , and implemented a way to do what Internet engineers have spent decades making sure never happens , we would have created an enormous security vulnerability .
We would make the job of any would - be terrorist intent on bringing down the Internet much easier .
Computer and network security is hard , and every Internet system we ’ve ever created has security vulnerabilities .
It would be folly to think this one would n’t as well .
And given how unlikely the risk is , any actual shutdown would be far more likely to be a result of an unfortunate error or a malicious hacker than of a presidential order .
But the main problem with an Internet kill switch is that it ’s too coarse a hammer .
Yes , the bad guys use the Internet to communicate , and they can use it to attack us .
But the good guys use it , too , and the good guys far outnumber the bad guys .
Shutting the Internet down , either the whole thing or just a part of it , even in the face of a foreign military attack would do far more damage than it could possibly prevent .
And it would hurt others whom we do n’t want to hurt .
For years we ’ve been bombarded with scare stories about terrorists wanting to shut the Internet down .
They ’re mostly fairy tales , but they ’re scary precisely because the Internet is so critical to so many things .
Why would we want to terrorize our own population by doing exactly what we do n’t want anyone else to do ?
And a national emergency is precisely the worst time to do it .
Just implementing the capability would be very expensive ; I would rather see that money going toward securing our nation ’s critical infrastructure from attack .
Defending his proposal , Sen. Lieberman pointed out that China has this capability .
It ’s debatable whether or not it actually does , but it ’s actively pursuing the capability because the country cares less about its citizens .
Here in the U.S. , it is both wrong and dangerous to give the president the power and ability to commit Internet suicide and terrorize Americans in this way .

A former Justice Department attorney who quit his job to protest the Obama administration 's handling of the New Black Panther Party voter intimidation case is accusing Attorney General Eric Holder of dropping the charges for racially motivated reasons .
J. Christian Adams , now an attorney in Virginia and a conservative blogger for Pajamas Media , says he and the other Justice Department lawyers working on the case were ordered to dismiss it .
" I mean we were told , ' Drop the charges against the New Black Panther Party , ' " Adams told Fox News , adding that political appointees Loretta King , acting head of the civil rights division , and Steve Rosenbaum , an attorney with the division since 2003 , ordered the dismissal .
Asked about the Justice Department 's claim that they are career attorneys , not political appointees , Adams said " obviously , that 's false . "
" Under the vacancy reform act , they were serving in a political capacity , " he said .
" This is one of the examples of Congress not being told the truth , the American people not being told the truth about this case .
It 's one of the other examples in this case where the truth simply is becoming another victim of the process . "
Adams claimed an unnamed political appointee said if somebody wants to bring these kinds of cases , " that ' not going to de done out of the civil rights division . "
Adams also accused Assistant Attorney General Thomas Perez of lying under oath to a federal commission about the circumstances surrounding the decision to drop the probe .
The Justice Department has defended its move to drop the case , saying it obtained an injunction against one member to keep him away from polling stations while dismissing charges against the others " based on a careful assessment of the facts and the law . "
But Adams told Fox News that politics and race was at play in the dismissal .
" There is a pervasive hostility within the civil rights division at the Justice Department toward these sorts of cases , " Adams told Fox News ' Megyn Kelly .
Adams says the dismissal is a symptom of the Obama administration 's reverse racism and that the Justice Department will not pursue voting rights cases against white victims .
" In voting , that will be the case over the next few years , there 's no doubt about it , " he said .
In an opinion article published in the Washington Times last week , Adams said the dismissal " raises serious questions about the department 's enforcement neutrality in upcoming midterm elections and the subsequent 2012 presidential election . "
Justice Department spokeswoman Tracy Schmaler dismissed Adams ' accusations as a " good faith disagreement " with ulterior motives .
" It is not uncommon for attorneys within the department to have good faith disagreements about the appropriate course of action in a particular case , although it is regrettable when a former department attorney distorts the facts and makes baseless allegations to promote his or her agenda , " she said in a written statement .
In the final days of the Bush administration , three Black Panthers -- Minister King Samir Shabazz , Malik Zulu Shabazz and Jerry Jackson -- were charged in a civil complaint with violating the Voter Rights Act in November 2008 by using coercion , threats and intimidation at a Philadelphia polling station -- with Shabazz brandishing what prosecutors called a deadly weapon .
The Obama administration won a default judgment in federal court in April 2009 when the Black Panthers did n't appear in court to fight the charges .
But the administration moved to dismiss the charges in May 2009 .
Justice attorneys said a criminal complaint , which resulted in the injunction , proceeded successfully .
The department " is committed to comprehensive and vigorous enforcement of both the civil and criminal provisions of federal law that prohibit voter intimidation .
We continue to work with voters , communities , and local law enforcement to ensure that every American can vote free from intimidation , coercion or threats , " Schmaler said Wednesday .
But the Justice Department 's explanation has failed to appease the United States Commission on Civil Rights , which is probing the department 's decision , or Republican lawmakers who say the dismissal could lead to an escalation of voter intimidation .
The commission held a hearing in April in which Rep. Frank Wolf , R - Va. , who has led the charge for answers from the Justice Department , was among those testifying .
The Justice Department did not provide witnesses at that hearing .
Instead , Perez testified before the commission in May .
" At a minimum , without sufficient proof that New Black Panther Party or Malik Zulu Shabazz directed or controlled unlawful activities at the polls , or made speeches directed to immediately inciting or producing lawless action on Election Day , any attempt to bring suit against those parties based merely upon their alleged ' approval ' or ' endorsement ' of Minister King Samir Shabazz and Jackson ’s activities would have likely failed , " he told the commission .
The commission has repeatedly sought information from the Justice Department , going as far as filing subpoenas .
Schmaler said the department has provided 2,000 pages of information in response .
But Adams said in the Times article that the department ordered the attorneys " to ignore the subpoena , lawlessly placing us in an unacceptably legal limbo . "
Adams also says that after the dismissal , Justice Department attorneys were instructed not to bring any more cases against racial minorities under the Voting Section .
Adams told Fox News that the New Black Panther case was the " easiest I ever had at the Justice Department .
" It does n't get any easier than this , " he said .
" If this does n't constitute voter intimidation , nothing will . "

WASHINGTON — Lobbyists for the financial services industry enjoy longstanding ties to the members of Congress who were named this week to the conference committee on financial reform legislation , according to a joint analysis of available data released today by Public Citizen and the Center for Responsive Politics .
At least 56 current industry lobbyists previously served on the personal staffs of the 43 members of Congress named Wednesday to the conference committee , according to the study , available here : ConferenceKlatchReport.pdf .
Notably , these figures do not include 59 lobbyists who served on either the Senate or House of Representatives banking committee but never worked directly for a member .
Those lobbyists were enumerated in a report published in early June by Public Citizen and the Center for Responsive Politics .
The financial services industry ’s links to the Senate ’s representatives on the panel are particularly extensive .
Collectively , 41 industry lobbyists once worked on the legislative staffs of the committee ’s 12 senators .
And each senator once employed at least one current lobbyist .
The chairman and ranking members of the Senate Committee on Banking , Housing and Urban Affairs , Sens. Chris Dodd ( D - Conn . ) and Richard Shelby ( R - Ala . ) , employed the most industry lobbyists – eight each .
At least seven current financial services lobbyists once served as chief of staff to a member of the conference committee .
“ Lobbyists with these sorts of connections can have a profound effect on the outcome of legislation , ” said Sheila Krumholz , executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics .
“ Their knowledge extends not only to the issues , but , perhaps more importantly , to their former bosses ’ cell phone numbers . ”
Added David Arkush , director of Public Citizen ’s Congress Watch division , “ The American people want reform , not a reunion .
Given industry ’s deep connections to lawmakers on the conference committee , it ’s critical that Chairman Barney Frank ( D - Mass . ) has committed to make the conference process the most transparent in history .
Now the public can crash what ordinarily would be an insider affair and make sure lawmakers hear from the American people , not just Wall Street lobbyists . ”

PULLMAN , Wash .-- The world 's biggest Roman candle has got nothing on this .
Using super - high pressures similar to those found deep in the Earth or on a giant planet , Washington State University researchers have created a compact , never - before - seen material capable of storing vast amounts of energy .
" If you think about it , it is the most condensed form of energy storage outside of nuclear energy , " says Choong - Shik Yoo , a WSU chemistry professor and lead author of results published in the journal Nature Chemistry .
The research is basic science , but Yoo says it shows it is possible to store mechanical energy into the chemical energy of a material with such strong chemical bonds .
Possible future applications include creating a new class of energetic materials or fuels , an energy storage device , super - oxidizing materials for destroying chemical and biological agents , and high - temperature superconductors .
The researchers created the material on the Pullman campus in a diamond anvil cell , a small , two - inch by three - inch - diameter device capable of producing extremely high pressures in a small space .
The cell contained xenon difluoride ( XeF2 ) , a white crystal used to etch silicon conductors , squeezed between two small diamond anvils .
At normal atmospheric pressure , the material 's molecules stay relatively far apart from each other .
But as researchers increased the pressure inside the chamber , the material became a two - dimensional graphite - like semiconductor .
The researchers eventually increased the pressure to more than a million atmospheres , comparable to what would be found halfway to the center of the earth .
All this " squeezing , " as Yoo calls it , forced the molecules to make tightly bound three - dimensional metallic " network structures . "
In the process , the huge amount of mechanical energy of compression was stored as chemical energy in the molecules ' bonds .
###
Financial support for the research came from the U.S. Department of Defense 's Defense Threat Reduction Agency and the National Science Foundation .

The referendum date coincides with various elections
A referendum on changing the UK's voting system is planned for 5 May 2011 , the BBC understands .
A vote on changing from first - past - the - post to the alternative vote ( AV ) could be held on the day of Holyrood , Welsh Assembly and English local elections .
But the government must first get it through Parliament and may face a rebellion by Tory MPs .
Many Labour
MPs oppose a referendum - something pledged as part of the Tory - Lib Dem coalition deal .
It is thought the referendum will be linked to plans to change constituency boundaries - a key concern of the Conservatives but something fiercely opposed by Labour .
' Unfair '
The Tories pledged to make constituency sizes more " equal " in their manifesto - Labour say the plans are designed to eliminate smaller inner-city seats which they hold .
The proposed date of the referendum is due to be confirmed at a cabinet meeting next Tuesday and is likely to be announced by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg later that day .
But legislation will not be debated until the autumn and may face a sizeable rebellion .
Under the coalition deal , Tory MPs will be whipped to support a referendum - but will then be free to campaign against a change .
ANALYSIS
It may seem odd that the date of 5 May should be so crucial - but for Nick Clegg it is a major victory .
It significantly strengthens his own position and the prospects for the coalition holding together .
The great fear in Lib Dem circles was that the AV referendum would be booted off into the long grass by a Conservative Party that regards voting reform as an unwelcome distraction .
5 May gives Lib Dems certainty - a definite time scale for achieving what most regard as the single most important concession wrung out of David Cameron in the coalition agreement .
The hope too is that , because 5 May coincides with local , Scottish and Welsh elections , it will boost the chances of a " yes " vote by bolstering turnout .
It also gives Nick Clegg the opportunity to campaign against the Conservatives and so underline his party 's independence and demonstrate to anxious supporters that it has not become an annexe of the Conservative Party .
Send us your comments
The Tories say the existing first - past - the - post system guarantees strong , stable government , while Lib Dems argue it is inherently unfair on smaller parties and allows candidates to be elected despite getting the support of only a minority of constituents .
Under the proposed AV system , voters rank candidates in order of preference and anyone getting more than 50 % in the first round is elected .
If that does not happen , the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated and voters ' second choices allocated to the remaining candidates .
This process continues until a winner emerges .
A government source said holding the referendum on the same day as the elections should improve voter turnout .
The Liberal Democrats are set to campaign for the new system , while the Conservatives will oppose it .
The BBC 's deputy political editor James Landale said the outcome could determine how long the coalition survived .
For many Lib Dems , it was the one reason they agreed to take part , he said , and if they lost , it could be a reason to leave .
Conservative MP
Daniel Kawczynski , chairman of the all - party group for the promotion of first - past - the - post , said he was " very concerned " about AV and he would campaign " vigorously " against it .
Under AV , he said : " There are millions of Britons out there , like me , who have one preference - in my case it is the Conservative Party .
We will be voting once , and yet other people will be given a second vote , and that is creating two classes of voters which is simply unacceptable . "
But campaign group the Electoral Reform Society welcomed the news .
A spokesman said : " This is a fantastic opportunity to turn the page on the old politics and an old system that 's served it so well .
This is a real chance for change . "
' Peripheral issue '
The previous Labour government also promised a referendum on the AV system , which it planned to hold in autumn 2011 .
But Labour may choose to give its MPs - many of whom oppose changing the voting system - a free vote on the matter .
Shadow foreign secretary David Miliband told BBC Radio 4's
Today programme that if he wins the Labour leadership contest , he will back a referendum and allow activists to campaign in favour of a switch to AV .
He said : " I think it 's important that we move to a system where every Member of Parliament has at least 50 % of the vote of their constituents .
At the moment only a third of MPs have that 50 % backing .
" Alternative vote , which allows you to rank your preferences ... allows that to happen . "
His brother Ed , another leadership candidate , also said he would support changing the voting system .
He said : " I strongly support the case for introducing the Alternative Vote , to ensure greater fairness for voters and greater legitimacy for our MPs in Westminster .
Whenever the referendum takes place , I will campaign with other supporters across the political spectrum for this important change . "
But another leadership candidate , shadow health secretary Andy Burnham , told the Guardian that voting reform was " irrelevant " and " a peripheral issue " .
" It is not my party 's job to prop up the Liberal Democrats by helping them win a referendum that is important to them , " he told the newspaper .
One of the most disturbing aspects of British Petroleum 's handling of the Deepwater Horizon explosion and subsequent continuing oil spill is the company 's ham - handed attempts to restrict media coverage .
BP officials seem to be more adept at cutting off information flows than oil leaks .
It took pressure from Congress to get BP to stream live images of the underwater leak on a website accessible to the public .
Those images had been available at the White House for weeks .
SENSITIVE men across England have embarked on a pathetic attempt to pretend to care about football .
As the World Cup begins there are high levels of concern among nice , intelligent non -football fans that to admit ambivalence would be like standing on a step ladder in the middle of the high street and screaming ‘ Look at my vagina ’ .
English teacher Tom Logan said : “ To me , football is nothing more than a massive PE lesson with the occasional violent assault thrown in .
“ But if anyone asks , I ’ll mutter something about how ‘ I ’ve always liked to watch the big games ’ and that Leo Walnut should probably have been in the main team .
“ This is mildly humiliating , but less so than being mauled by an entire pub . ”
Stephen Malley , a father - of - two who was enthralled by the Leonardo sketches at the British Musuem , is indifferent to all sports and often ironically refers to football as simply ‘ ball ’ .
He said : “ In anticipation of the impending ball event , I have prepared the stock line ‘ I ’m really looking forward to the World Cup , I hope Liverpool win’ .
I ’m confident this will ‘ do the business ’ . ”
He added : “ ‘ I presume Kevin Keegan is still the best one ? ”
Meanwhile , Woody Allen fan Nathan Muir is concerned he may have overcompensated by having the St George ’s Cross tattooed permanently on his face .
He said : “ I thought it would be the best way to avoid hassle , but now I ’m not so sure .
I should probably get that Nick Hornby novel about the record shop that ’s owned by a Tottenham supporter .
I do n’t suppose you know what a ‘ corner ’ is ? ”
He added : “ When I go out I ’ll probably just stay by the bar , and start cheering a fraction of a second after everyone else , when I ’m sure it ’s safe to do so .
“ I ’ll then shout something like ‘ Sport is brilliant !
As is the Queen !’.
It ’ll be fine . ”

Consider for a moment the manly purr of Old Spice spokesman Isaiah Mustafa ’s “ Hello , Ladies ” salutation .
It ’s seduced the country social media - style : 94 million views on YouTube , 630,0000 Facebook fans , and an estimated 1 billion aggregate impressions in just one week .
But wait .
It appears consumers may have been too distracted by his glorious swan dives and monocle smiles to remember the actual product he was hawking .
Sales of Red Zone body wash have actually declined 7 % according to a report by SymphonyIRI .
( UPDATE : A spokesman for Old Spice claims Brandweek took SymphonyIRI ’s stat out of context .
Citing Nielsen figures , the rep says OS body wash sales have actually increased 11 % in the last 12 months . )
And the towel - clad and deep - voiced Mustafa may have not even contributed to Old Spice ’s overall sales growth , which Ad Age chalks up to a high - value coupon campaign by the company .
Both Nivea and Gillette saw similar if not higher growth during that period , and neither had the help of Mustafa–just coupons .
So did Mustafa ’s unprecedented popularity fail to translate into influence ?
Is there perhaps another equally viral ad campaign , one with a frontman who rivals Mustafa ’s dash and flair , that has helped move units ?
Unfortunately for The Man Your Man Could Smell Like , there is : The Most Interesting Man in the World .
Since he joined forces with Dos Equis in 2006 , sales have shot up significantly every year , leaping 26 % since January alone , Dos Equis brand manager Ryan V. Thompson recently told me .
“ We ’re now the fastest growing beer import in the country , ” he says .
Adding insult to injury , there ’s no question who would win a staring contest .
“ The Most Interesting Man is well proven , ” explains Thompson .
“ He once went four days straight staring at himself in his own staring contest–he wins every time . ”
advertisement
I decided to track down The Most Interesting Man in the World and speak with him about viral advertising for our chronicle of the social graph , The Influence Project .
Why has The Most Interesting Man succeeded where Mustafa has failed ?
“ He ’s a man that has had life experience , and has been there , and done that , and beyond , ” says the also - pretty - damn interesting man who plays The Most Interesting Man in the World , Jonathan Goldsmith , deservedly in the third - person .
“ It ’s not just a slickness , but experience that means something . ”
According to Goldsmith , it is this infinite life experience that has given his character a depth , which is universally intriguing .
“ People ask me all the time for tips .
How would you entertain ?
What advice would you have for meeting women ?
What does your home look like ? ” he says , pulling off the pitch - perfect hyperbole that only The World ’s Most Interesting Man could get away with .
“ If you ’re not interested , you will not be interesting .
If you do n’t experience life , you wo n’t be a participant –you ’ll just be a voyeur ; you ’ll watch it go by like a parade you ’re not involved in . ”
Is there anything The Most Interesting Man in the World could learn , then , from The Man Your Man Could Smell Like ?
Would he ever try Old Spice Red Zone Body Wash After Hours ?
“ No , I do n’t think so , ” he says .
“ After tasting Old Spice , there are limitations [ compared with Dos Equis ] .
I wish [ Mustafa ] well , and I thank him very much for following my training regime .
He ’s looking very well as a physical specimen . ”
Breaking character for a moment , Goldsmith explains , “ I think the campaign is so successful , because every man , including me , would like to be like him . ”
He also credits the brilliant writers behind his clever lines and the company itself for keeping up the character .
And this is a guy who knows characters .
His credits read like a greatest hits collection of ’ 70s and ’ 80s television , with guest - starring roles in everything from Hawaii Five - O to Eight is Enough , CHiPs to Partners in Crime , St. Elsewhere to Trapper John M.D. , Charlie ’s Angels to Highway to Heaven … .
You get the picture .
“ Dos Equis is very wise to keep the mystique going , ” he says .
“ The Most Interesting Man is not just a talking head–he ’s not a conventional spokesman . ”
Goldsmith even admitted that he was surprised Old Spice ’s campaign had n’t translated into sales .
advertisement
There is one difference between him and the character he plays that he ’d like to make clear , though .
While The Most Interesting Man in the World uses his joie de vivre to sling beer , Goldsmith says he uses his celebrity now “ to draw attention to [ his ] charities ” which are of “ vital importance ” to him .
He ’s heavily involved in several , including Free Arts
for Abused Children , Stella Link ( a socially conscious entertainment group ) , and
the Sabre Foundation , an organization focused on saving endangered
Siberian tigers .
Seriously .

The loss of personal support is the most dramatic for a prime minister in a decade .
It marks the first time Mr Rudd , as either opposition leader or prime minister , has had a disapproval rating higher than his approval rating .
The proposed 40 per cent tax on the mining sector 's so - called super profits , revealed as the key response to the Henry tax review , failed to prove a vote winner , with 47 per cent opposing the impost , 44 per cent supporting it and 9 per cent undecided .
The only comfort for Labor is that none of the unpopularity has translated into a direct increase in support for the Coalition .
Mr Rudd is regarded as only slightly more trustworthy than his opponent but he also rates higher for untrustworthiness .
He is still the preferred prime minister , although that gap has closed by 10 points in a month .
The poll of 1400 voters was taken from Thursday night to Saturday night and follows a horror month for the government in which it scrapped the home insulation scheme , binned plans to build 260 childcare centres and endured another interest rate rise .
Most damaging of all , it shelved until at least 2013 any attempt to implement an emissions trading scheme .
On a two - party - preferred basis , Labor and the Coalition are even at 50 per cent , compared with 51 - 49 a month ago .
This represents a 2.7 - point two - party swing against Labor since the election .
If the swing were uniform and an election were held now , Labor would lose 19 seats - and government .
Since the previous poll , Labor 's primary vote fell 2 points to 37 per cent , the Coalition was steady at 42 per cent and the Greens improved 1 point to 13 per cent .
The approval and disapproval ratings of the Opposition Leader , Tony Abbott , were steady at 46 per cent and 45 per cent , respectively .
Mr Rudd leads as preferred prime minister on 53 per cent - down 6 points in a month - to Mr Abbott on 38 per cent ( 4 points up ) .
The poll finds 58 per cent of voters still support an ETS .
Only 30 per cent oppose it .
Mr Rudd once called climate change '' the greatest moral , economic and environmental challenge of our generation ' ' and his decision to shelve the policy polarised the electorate - 43 per cent supported the delay , 45 per cent opposed it and 13 per cent were undecided .
As Mr Abbott launched the Liberals ' first election TV commercials yesterday , the poll finds he and Mr Rudd enjoy about the same levels of trust .
Mr Rudd is regarded as trustworthy by 43 per cent of voters and untrustworthy by 38 per cent .
Mr Abbott is regarded as trustworthy by 40 per cent and untrustworthy by 34 .
Loading
The poll confirms a trend it detected just over a month ago when Labor toughened laws against asylum seekers .
It matches the findings of Newspoll , taken last weekend , which tapped into the discontent , and will do little to dampen talk about the Deputy Prime Minister , Julia Gillard , being readied to take over as leader in case Mr Rudd implodes .
A senior minister said yesterday that events would have to worsen dramatically for anyone to contemplate seriously a leadership change before the election .

As millions of gallons of oil continue to spill into the Gulf of Mexico , a group of Milwaukeeans prepare to live , by choice , without electricity and other conveniences in conjunction with a local , underground event called " Power Down Week . "
Power Down Week runs June 21 - 27 and is based in Milwaukee 's Riverwest neighborhood .
A kick - off party takes place Monday , June 21 at 4:30 p.m. at the Falcon Bowl , 801 E. Clarke St .
Main organizer Sarah Moore says there is no way to know how many people will participate in the event because registration is not required , but she estimates somewhere between 50 and 300 people will live without electricity , running water or technology for a week .
As part of Power Down Week , dozens of workshops and community events will take place , including potlucks , an edible food walk , instruction on how to build a cob over , a movie generated by a projector with solar - powered batteries , rooftop garden tours , beer making , soap making , urban camping , gardening classes , yarn spinning , group bike rides , a " kale - gate " potluck party and more .
Many of the workshops and events are presented by Transition Milwaukee , a local organization committed to " rebuilding community resilience and self reliance . "
" I really do n't believe renewable energies are going to rescue us , " says Moore .
" We need to power down , re-skill and live on less .
I will do anything to make sure the cycle of life continues . "
There are not any hard and fast rules for Power Down Week .
People will participate on all different levels , meaning some will simply watch fewer TV shows or use their computer less , while others , like Riverwest 's Sura Faraj , will take it much further .
" I 'm going hardcore and planning to be off of all electricity .
There will be no computer , lights or fan .
I also wo n't be using my car , eating only locally - grown food and I 'm shutting off my hot water , " says Faraj .
Faraj says her biggest challenge will come from her commitment to only eat locally - produced food .
" I have a small garden , but not much is ready for harvest except strawberries and greens .
I 'm hoping some of my potatoes are ready .
I know I 'm going to be hungry , " she says .
Moore says she plans to turn off her electricity and hot water and will disconnect the drain on her sink .
Instead , a bucket under her sink will catch the water and Moore will use it to hydrate her garden .
" It 's going to be kind of like camping , " says Moore .
Originally , Moore conceptualized Power Down Week last December after a friend , Xav Leplae , told her a story about having fun with friends at his business , Riverwest Film and Video , when the power spontaneously went out .
This story inspired Moore , and she called a meeting to discuss some of her ideas .
She discovered many other people -- including Claire Moore and Tom Brandstetter who are instrumental in the event -- were interested in trying to organize a community event that would challenge people to use fewer resources and make eco-friendly changes in their lives .
Brandstetter , a clinical pharmacist who lives in Bay View , rented a Riverwest apartment for a month so he could be closer to the power down action .
On a regular basis , Branstetter claims to use about 20 percent of the energy consumed by an average American .
He is committed to a vegan diet , makes his own biodiesel , rides a bike as much as possible , has a wood burning stove and solar shower , watches very little television and is vigilant about turning off electrical appliances and lights when he 's not using them .
" It 's all doable stuff , " says Branstetter , who recently donated $ 25,000 to the East Side 's First Unitarian Society of Milwaukee to help with a project to update the 1892 - built building with greener systems .
Power Down
Week will also offer public solar showers and a phone message system .
Participants who give up phones can give a main number to friends and family and , in the case of emergency , would be contacted by a bike messenger .
Faraj sees Power Down
Week as a fun way to reinforce her personal convictions .
" I 'm doing this simply to challenge myself .
It 's a game , after all .
But there 's also a reason behind this game .
It 's called peak oil , climate change and unsustainable living , " she says .

The chapel is formed by seventeen rows of spires , rising 150 feet up in the air .
The spires are made with steel tube frames , using one hundred tetrahedrons that are exactly the same and weigh five tons .
Between the tetrahedrons , the architects installed colored glass , which further enhances the building 's space age character .

SEC Charges Diebold and Former Executives With Accounting Fraud FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2010 - 93 Washington , D.C. , June 2 , 2010 — The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Diebold , Inc. and three former financial executives for engaging in a fraudulent accounting scheme to inflate the company 's earnings .
The SEC separately filed an enforcement action against Diebold 's former CEO seeking reimbursement of certain financial benefits that he received while Diebold was committing accounting fraud .
The SEC alleges that Diebold 's financial management received " flash reports " — sometimes on a daily basis — comparing the company 's actual earnings to analyst earnings forecasts .
Diebold 's financial management prepared " opportunity lists " of ways to close the gap between the company 's actual financial results and analyst forecasts .
Many of the opportunities on these lists were fraudulent accounting transactions designed to improperly recognize revenue or otherwise inflate Diebold 's financial performance .
Diebold — an Ohio - based company that manufactures and sells ATMs , bank security systems and electronic voting machines — agreed to pay a $ 25 million penalty to settle the SEC 's charges .
Diebold 's former CEO Walden O'Dell agreed to reimburse cash bonuses , stock , and stock options under the " clawback " provision of the Sarbanes - Oxley Act .
The SEC's case against Diebold 's former CFO Gregory Geswein , former Controller and later CFO Kevin Krakora , and former Director of Corporate Accounting Sandra Miller is ongoing .
Additional Materials Litigation Release No. 21543
SEC Complaint v. Diebold
SEC Complaint v. O'Dell
SEC Complaint v. Geswein , Krakora , and Miller " Diebold 's financial executives borrowed from many different chapters of the deceptive accounting playbook to fraudulently boost the company 's bottom line , " said Robert Khuzami , Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement .
" When executives disregard their professional obligations to investors , both they and their companies face significant legal consequences . "
Scott W. Friestad , Associate Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement , added , " Section 304 of Sarbanes - Oxley is an important investor protection provision because it encourages senior management to proactively take steps to prevent fraudulent schemes from happening on their watch .
We will continue to seek reimbursement of bonuses and other incentive compensation from CEOs and CFOs in appropriate cases . "
Section 304 of the Sarbanes - Oxley
Act deprives corporate executives of certain compensation received while their companies were misleading investors , even in cases where that executive is not alleged to have violated the securities laws personally .
The SEC has not alleged that O'Dell engaged in the fraud .
Under the settlement , O'Dell has agreed to reimburse the company $ 470,016 in cash bonuses , 30,000 shares of Diebold stock , and stock options for 85,000 shares of Diebold stock .
According to the SEC 's complaint against Diebold , filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia , the company manipulated its earnings from at least 2002 through 2007 to meet financial performance forecasts , and made material misstatements and omissions to investors in dozens of SEC filings and press releases .
Diebold 's improper accounting practices misstated the company 's reported pre-tax earnings by at least $ 127 million .
Among the fraudulent accounting practices used to inflate earnings and meet forecasts were : Improper use of " bill and hold " accounting .
Recognition of revenue on a lease agreement subject to a side buy - back agreement .
Manipulating reserves and accruals .
Improperly delaying and capitalizing expenses .
Writing up the value of used inventory .
Without admitting or denying the SEC 's charges , Diebold consented to a final judgment ordering payment of the $ 25 million penalty and permanently enjoining the company from future violations of the antifraud , reporting , books and records , and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws .
The SEC charged Geswein , Krakora , and Miller , in a complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio , with violating Section 17 ( a ) of the Securities Act of 1933 , Sections 10 ( b ) and 13 ( b ) ( 5 ) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 , and Exchange Act Rules 10 b 5 and 13b2 - 1 ; and aiding and abetting Diebold 's violations of Sections 13 ( a ) , 13 ( b ) ( 2 ) ( A ) and 13 ( b ) ( 2 ) ( B ) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b - 20 , 13a - 1 , 13a-11 , and 13a - 13 .
In addition , the SEC charged Geswein and Krakora with violating Exchange Act Rules 13a - 14 and 13b2 - 2 and Section 304 of the Sarbanes - Oxley Act .
The Commission seeks permanent injunctive relief , disgorgement of ill - gotten gains with prejudgment interest , and financial penalties .
The SEC also seeks officer - and - director bars against Geswein and Krakora as well as their reimbursement of bonuses and other incentive and equity compensation .
Scott Friestad , Robert Kaplan , Brian Quinn , Christopher Swart , Pierron Leef , and Kristen Dieter conducted the SEC 's investigation in this matter .
Litigation efforts in the ongoing case will be led by David Gottesman and Robyn Bender .
The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Attorney 's Office for the Northern District of Ohio and the Federal Bureau of Investigation .

I got invited to participate last week in a conference call with Joss Whedon about him directing this week ’s episode of Glee .
The episode is called Dream On and guest stars Neil Patrick Harris , Idina Menzel , and Molly Shannon .
The wifi flaked out on me , so I did n’t get to ask anything myself , but I ’ve written up the more interesting questions for you .
The interview is about yesterday ’s episode of Glee ( in the US ) , so beware there are a couple of ( tiny ) spoilers in it ( mainly about set pieces and dances ) .
Q : What was it like directing someone else ’s show ?
Joss Whedon : Directing somebody else ’s show is – I ’ve done it once before , twice just with The Office .
It helps if the show ’s unutterably wonderful .
That takes a lot of the pressure off .
It ’s a little tricky .
You ’re living in somebody else ’s house and you have to make sure that you ’re fulfilling their needs .
It also takes some of the burden off you .
You do n’t have to be the guy who sees the big picture .
You just take what they give you and make sure that you ’re servicing it as best you can .
Having said that , Glee is probably harder to shoot than any other show in recorded history , with all the different elements going on and whatnot ; it ’s a different kind of challenge , but ultimately enormous fun .
Q : What were you able to do with the dance number that maybe you were n’t able to do in your other musical episode from Dr. Horrible ?
Joss Whedon :
Well , dance would be one thing .
There ’s more real hard - core dancing in the show , not in every number .
Some numbers are just about movement .
Then I get to be seriously involved in creating that movement .
Then some numbers are real dance numbers and that ’s all Zach Woodlee and Brooke , the choreographers , they ’re phenomenal .
There were numbers that I did n’t know exactly how they worked narratively until I saw the choreography and then said , oh , this all works just fine .
I got to really shoot some fun dancing and most of the stuff I ’ve done has been more just movement .
Q : Could you talk about the dance number , the mall number .
How did that fit in ?
Was that the most difficult ?
Joss Whedon :
You know , the thing about that number is that really was Zach and Brooke getting it done .
Ultimately , it ’s a complicated , it ’s a big , big number , very gratifying , I think because we ’re seeing things we have n’t seen before .
I do pride myself on being the guy who knew we were actually going to be able to shoot it pretty quickly because once it gets dialed in , you pretty much just shoot them doing it .
Because of the number of extras and the enormity of the number , people thought it was going to be much more of a bear than it actually was .
We had two film cameras and four video cameras going the whole time , so the thing actually went pretty quickly .
We were able to tack on another scene that day , which is great , because those schedules are a bear .
Q : What was it like working with Neil again ?
Joss Whedon : I am so tired of that guy .
Why do they always make me direct Neil ?
Why the pain ?
Neil is a consummate pro and a dear friend , which is an ideal combination .
There ’s no problem .
My only complaint was that I wanted to shoot even more of the kids than I got to , that and certain craft service issues about not having caviar , but really that ’s in my contract , actually .
I feel like he ’s one of those people who expresses the way I wish I could express myself .
He ’s like a muse , and he ’s friends with Matt .
The sort of rivalry / affection between them just informed the whole thing so much .
We had such a good time .
He came in the day after the Oscars , the day before How I Met Your Mother .
He fit this into his schedule in the most bizarre fashion .
I even got him and Jane Lynch to come in late on Friday night after finishing How I Met Your Mother , just so that we could knock a scene off because the schedule was so hard for him .
Always cooperative , always imaginative ; Neil ’s the man .
Q : Can you talk a little bit about how much fun you had doing the flashbacks and how collaborative you guys were about what Neil was going to bring to this episode .
Joss Whedon :
You know , Neil ’s great because he looked at the script .
He was very excited .
He had some very specific questions even based on the vocal arrangements , what kind of guy am I supposed to be .
So , it was a real collaboration .
As for the mullet , there was definitely some talk about “ Is n’t that kind of the ‘ 80s , I mean , it ’s sort of the ‘ 90s , what ’s with the mullet ? ”
Sean Ryan , without missing a beat said , “ Achy Breaky Heart was ’ 92 . ”
So , he ’s really on top of his game .
Q : Are there other shows that you ’d like to direct ?
What are some of the other shows that you enjoy , that you ’re a fan of ?
Joss Whedon : I ’m going to just go ahead and make a blanket statement .
I do n’t want to direct the shows I ’m a fan of anymore .
It means I always have to read the episodes that come before it .
It ’s like a giant slew of spoilers that quite frankly is not fair .
I would say after Glee , Friday Night Lights is probably the show that blows me away the most .
But , I definitely do n’t want to direct one of those , because I ’m still on Season 2 .
Q : Obviously the show has its own plot line , it ’s well underway .
Were you involved at all about the song selections for this episode ?
Joss Whedon : Oh , no .
They select the songs well in advance .
They give you the script , not quite as well in advance , but much longer than I usually give the script , actually …
You ’re there to service what they ’ve already thought up .
Quite frankly , I felt very fortunate .
First of all , because I actually knew all the people , which is not always the case .
I think a lot of people feel that because I ’ve run shows that I was going to go in there and be working with them on it .
But , honestly , I am just a visiting director in this situation .
I would definitely give my thoughts , “ Oh , I feel like the song should go like this , is there any way we can change on this line , ” little stuff like that , trying very hard not to overstep .
I certainly was n’t about to say , “ Oh , do this on one , well I may not get the rights to one song , and so I ’d like to get another . ”
That would be the only thing .
This really is Brad who wrote it , and Ryan and Ian .
This is their world and I ’m privileged to walk in it .
But , I ’m not going to walk all over it .
Q : I just wanted to know how Glee was different from anything else you ’ve ever worked on .
Joss Whedon : Glee is different from anything else period .
Every show is different .
I would just say that the enormous amount of work that everybody is doing at all times on that show kind of spun my head around .
It ’s not an easy show to make and the kids , the whole cast works so hard and are busy working on every episode .
So , really , I do n’t remember we ’re shooting four episodes at once .
It ’s hard to keep your head around all of it , the rehearsals , the recording , and the show moves as quickly as it moves .
Production is tough and you have to be on your feet at all times .
You ’ve got a different aesthetic , an old - fashioned aesthetic in the lighting and the camerawork is very classical .
It ’s not edgy in that sense .
The edge comes from taking a very comforting milieu , the comfort , and ease of set , and then putting something rather kind of shocking .
Either shocking because it ’s so snarky , or dirty , or funny , or because it ’s just so open hearted in the middle of it .
Q : Could you talk a little bit about how you approach music from a visual narrative standpoint ?
How are you able to work that ?
Joss Whedon :
When I approach music , obviously , if it ’s a dance number , some of the work is done for you because you pretty much know where you want the camera based on the movement .
If it ’s just about movement , then I approach it very strictly from the narrative of the emotion .
Particularly in “ Dream On ” and “ I Dreamed a Dream ” I got to pitch my own movement and my own staging for those numbers to try to work in all the emotional elements and emotional reality of the thing , and at the same time , keep it kind of fluid and keep it exciting .
It ’s one of the great joys of the show to be able to do that .
Then to have the actors respond and to understand and just take what you thought up to the extreme .
It ’s kind of the same way you block a scene , you ’re just looking for emotional reality and visual panache , except it ’s way more fun because there ’s music .
Q : You obviously did a musical episode of Buffy , the Vampire Slayer .
How does that compare to Glee ?
Did it prepare you in a way ?
Joss Whedon :
Oh , yeah , oh , yeah .
Doing Buffy and doing Dr. Horrible were both great prep for something like this .
This is obviously not my first rodeo .
It ’s different , Glee , obviously , but knowing a little bit of the realities of the difference in a day ’s work between shooting a musical number and shooting just a regular scene , is very useful .
It ’s the kind of thing that I would like to spend a lot more of my time doing .
I love musicals deeply and dearly .
This was a return to home for me .
Not my home , but a very welcoming one .
Q : So , would you do another episode of Glee in the future ?
Joss Whedon : “ Nevah , nevah . ”
Oh , yeah , I choked , totally .
Sorry .
If I had the window and they would take me , yes , in a heartbeat .
User reviews can be a fine thing , they add value to program descriptions and new perspectives to reviews .
Many software sites use them , Betanews , Softpedia or Giveaway of the Day give their users options to vote and comment on software reviewed or hosted on their sites .
There is nothing wrong with user comments and ratings as long as they do not influence a software 's visibility on a website .
Softpedia for instance allows users to vote for software , but does not use the overall rating to determine where and how a software is presented on their site , as this is solely determined by the number of downloads .
That 's not so with Betanews .
If you take a look at the software listing you notice that ratings play an important role on the site .
They are displayed prominently and trigger the popularity listing as well .
That alone would not be a problem , but the system could be used by individuals or companies to increase the ratings and reviews of their products , with the purpose to gain visibility on the site .
Remove
It Pro SE for instance currently has a rating of 4.2 ( of 5 ) with 213 votes .
That 's a lot of votes for a program that is not well known .
It has for instance roughly the same amount of votes as PC Wizard , PHPmyAdmin or Audacity and at least twice as many as MemTest 86 + , Gspot or HashTab .
The amount of ratings is an indicator , but not proof that something is wrong with the program 's listing .
If you take a closer look at the reviews you notice huge differences .
Some users have rated it with 1 or 2 stars , with the following comments :
Took Removeit for at test run , found 16 files and tagged them as dangerous , only problem , every single file are good file , and if I 'd had quarantine the files I would have crippled my system .
Nothing but FALSE POSITIVES .
This is Crapware , almost bordering on Rogue ( IMHO )
Got a handful of false positives from this one .
Best was when it detected my PPPoE protocol driver ( RasPPPoE ) as a Trojan .
I know people say prevention is the best protection , but not letting me on the internet ( had I deleted PPPoE ) is just too much for me .
Too bad the lowest rating is 1 .
I would rate it 0 if I could .
I find it suspicious how it ALWAYS finds something on your system the first run , probably a false positive too .
Seems mainly designed to scare people into getting their ' paid ' support product .
I gave it a 2 for effort .... but still too many false positives .
On my system were three ( supposedly dangerous ) files identified ( 2 were part of Tune Up Utilities 2007 and one belongs to BoClean 4.25 / Comodo Firewall )
After uploading these files to Virus Total where they were scanned with 31 AV engines everything came back clean .
So I recommend you get a second opinion before becoming all panicky and trust the findings of this scanner too much .
The majority of voters on the other hand rated the program with five stars , the maximum available .
Let 's see what they have to say :
I have tried just about every Antivirus Antimalware program on the market .
But RemoveIT
Pro has always proven to be more efficient in removal of Virus attacks ....
Fantastic Program
After using adaware , malwarebytes and avg , only RemoveIT Pro fixed malware problem .
Great tool ! :-)
It is the best malware removal tool ever , works well and fast !
Light , user friendly and very effective in removing malware .
The trend is obvious .
The low rating commenters mentioned false positives , the high rating commenters how fast , efficient and great the tool is .
Let 's give the program a test ride , shall we ?
First problem , the program only starts if it is executed with administrative rights .
Scanning of the system started and it quickly found the first trojans and malware on it .
First up was googleupdate.exe , identified as Win32.Unknown.Random.X , then several system 32 folder files , heck , even the Windows Screensaver that ships with the operating system was detected as a virus .
RemoveIT Pro SE detected 27 threats on the computer system , that Kaspersky missed , apparently .
Next step was the verification of the findings .
Opened Virustotal.com and submitted every single file for inspection .
All 27 files were clean , according to Virustotal and the 41 different malware scanning engines it uses .
The confirmation that RemoveIT Pro detected false positives added weight to the user comments who stated that , and all who did rated the program with 1 or 2 stars .
The positive ratings , especially those stating that the program removed malware that no other program was able to find could be attributed to those false positives in some cases .
RemoteIT
Pro does actually detect malware that no other program detects , problem is , they are all false positives .
The amount of five star ratings on the other hand could also indicate a campaign to artificially increase the program 's rating on the site , and likely on other software sites as well .
How do you handle user ratings on software download sites ?
Let us know in the comments .

San Francisco , California ( CNN ) --
Jurors wrapped up deliberations Friday and will continue next week in the racially charged murder trial of a white former police officer in Oakland , California , accused of killing an unarmed black man .
Jurors deliberated for nearly three hours Friday afternoon without reaching a verdict in the case against Johannes Mehserle .
Mehserle , a former Bay Area Rapid Transit police officer , is accused of shooting 22 - year - old Oscar Grant dead on a California train platform on January 1 , 2009 .
The jurors will resume their deliberations Tuesday morning ; court is closed Monday due to the extended holiday weekend .
Closing arguments concluded earlier in the day Friday .
Mehserle could be found not guilty , guilty of murder , or guilty of a lesser offense like manslaughter .
The shooting was captured on a bystander 's cell - phone video camera .
The video was widely circulated on the internet and on news broadcasts , and it spurred several protests and riots in and around Oakland .
The trial was moved from Alameda County to Los Angeles due to pre-trial publicity .
Bay Area Rapid Transit police were called to Oakland 's Fruitvale station on January 1 after passengers complained about fights on a train .
Officers pulled several men , including Grant , off the train when it arrived at Fruitvale .
The video showed Mehserle pulling his gun and fatally shooting Grant in the back as another officer kneeled on the unarmed man .
Mehserle has said at the trial that he intended to draw and fire his Taser rather than his gun , CNN affiliate KTVU eported .
Mehserle resigned his position a few days after the incident and was later arrested in Nevada .
He was released on a $ 3 million bond .
Meanwhile , police in Oakland are bracing for riots as a verdict nears in the racially charged trial .
An Oakland police department website has messages from the police chief and the mayor of Oakland warning people to stay calm .
" We anticipate that regardless of the verdict reached by the jury , demonstrations could occur in downtown Oakland , and potentially throughout the city , " one of the messages said .
" We will not tolerate destruction or violence .
We live here , and we love Oakland .
We understand that the community is grieving , and we are in this together .
We will get through this together . "
Grant 's family filed a $ 50 million wrongful death lawsuit against the officers involved in the incident .
In January , the transit system agreed to pay $ 1.5 million to settle the suit .
The money will provide financial support to Grant 's young daughter .
Police are now releasing details of his targets on Sunday .
From the San Francisco Chronicle :
Convicted felon Byron Williams loaded up his mother 's Toyota Tundra with guns , strapped on his body armor and headed to San Francisco on Sunday with one thing in mind : to kill workers at the ACLU and an environmental foundation , prosecutors say .
Williams , an anti-government zealot on parole for bank robbery , had hoped to " start a revolution " with the bloodshed at the ACLU and the Tides Foundation in San Francisco , authorities said .
But before he made it to the city , Williams was stopped by California Highway Patrol officers for speeding and driving erratically on westbound Interstate 580 west of Grand Avenue in Oakland .
Police say he then initiated a chaotic , 12 - minute gunbattle with officers , firing a 9 mm handgun , a .308 - caliber rifle and a shotgun .
He reloaded his weapons when he ran out of ammunition and stopped only after officers shot him in areas of his body not covered by his bullet - resistant vest , authorities said .
The ACLU is a common target of right - wing rage , but the Tides Foundation ?
I 'm a lefty from San Francisco and I 've never heard of it .
How did this guy from a rural part of California learn of it ?
If you guessed Glenn Back , you'd be correct - he 's mentioned the Tides Foundation several times on his show , and ominously links them to ACORN and the Weather Underground .
This transcript is from about a year ago :
BECK : The Apollo Alliance — OK .
Oh look :
It 's ACORN .
ACORN founder Wade Rathke is former chairman of Tides Center .
That 's weird : Rathke was on the Tides board .
ACORN , Tides , Apollo , Van Jones , Jeff Jones , Weather Underground — uh - oh .
( END VIDEO CLIP ) ACORN , SEIU , Tides — all of those connections alone and seeing how they are all intertwined and related are eye opening .
But , when you combine that with what they are being mobilized to work for , it 's frightening — unless you love France .
Not recent enough ?
Beck brought up the Tides Foundation just last week , on Wednesday , July 14th .
Well , they have the education system .
They have the media .
They have the capitalist system .
What do you think the Tides Foundation was ?
They infiltrate and they saw under Ronald Reagan that capitalists were not for all of this nonsense , so they infiltrated .
Now , they are using failing capitalism to destroy it .
They 're using the churches through social justice .
The media — do I have to explain that one ?
This is what progressives and all power - seekers do .
They find something vulnerable .
They latch on to it .
They exploit it for power .
I have found no other news outlet that has mentioned the Tides Foundation in any context , much less portraying it as a Destroyer of America .
So , to the right - wing nutbags who scoffed at this guy being a consumer of FOX " News " - he gave himself away by his choice of targets .
Tides is one of Beck 's targets and it almost became a target of Byron Williams , wearing body armor and carrying three weapons and loads of ammo .
I stand by my contention yesterday :
The irresponsibility of the right - wing media is surely going to result in more Byron Williams across the country .
Potential bloodshed , even of police officers , seems a price they 're willing to pay to push their agenda .
UPDATE : Thanks to everyone for the recs .
I 'll just add that Williams requested a Public Defender at his court hearing today .
Not very bootstrappy of him !
UPDATE 2 : The San Jose Mercury News adds a bit of background on this dope , as well as some interesting tidbits :
“ Although a great deal of progress has been made since 2001 , it would be wrong to see road safety as a ‘ job well done ’ .
More than 35,000 people died in road accidents across Europe last year , and stark figures like these must spur us on to greater achievement in the future .
I have been baffled by the recent backlash against dads in the delivery room , one of those things that seems to make such perfect sense to me that I have a hard time wrapping my mind around the counter - argument .
Advertisement
First , the New York Times ran a piece suggesting that men are sufficiently grossed out by the miracle of birth that it actually kills passion .
Then , some doc in France said that having dad around is bad because it stresses mom out .
Now comes the idea that the pre-natal period — in which dad , no matter how many Lamaze classes he attends , is kind of on the outside looking in — conditions would - be dads to see themselves as useless when the kid actually emerges .
I love Strollerderby 's take on why this is dumb :
So , instead of keeping dad away , maybe the answer is as simple as acknowledging that the period of pregnancy and birth can be weird and awkward and alienating for him .
We can talk more about the differences between men and women 's experiences .
We can give mom permission to go though a distinctly female experience without feeling like she 's a sell - out to women 's rights .
We should look harder at why dad is feeling so passive in the delivery room .
And give him better tools to help his pregnant / birthing / lactating partner in a way that bolsters confidence .
Advertisement
And — once again , for the record — I am adamant that dads be present for childbirth for one simple reason : there are few times in life when we can make it crystal clear to dads how powerful and important the job of raising , teaching and protecting a child is .
One of those time happens in the delivery room , and I shudder to think there are people interested in eliminating that moment .
( Hat Tip to Jason Sperber for pointing this out . )

' Jessi Slaughter ' Says Death Threats Wo n't Stop Her From Posting Videos on the Internet Jessi Slaughter , 11 , says she stands behind profanity - laced video .
July 22 , 2010  --
The Florida seventh grader whose profanity - laced video prompted online death threats said today that she has no intentions of logging off the Internet , a decision that 's backed by her parents .
" I 'm going to continue making my videos , I 'm going to continue updating my Twitter and going on Stickam and stuff -- just going to be a little more careful with who sees what I 'm doing , " the girl told ABCNews.com .
Because of her age she is identified here by her screen name " Jessi Slaughter " rather than her real name .
For more on this story , tune in to " Good Morning America " Friday at 7 a.m. ET for our continuing coverage .
Jessi's rage , violent threats and graphic language that she used against her online tormentors have dropped jaws .
" I 'm happy with my life okay ?
And if you can't , like , realize that and stop hating you know what ? " the 11 - year - old said in the video .
" I 'll pop a Glock in your mouth and make a brain slushy . "
" Because you hater - b*****s?
You 're just , like , jealous of me , " she said .
" Stop hating on me .
I 'm just a normal girl who 's perfect in every way and you 're just jealous . "
She ended the video by giving the middle finger and blowing a kiss at the camera .
" I stand behind it 100 percent because it cleared up a lot of things that were posted , " she told ABCNews.com .
" I just want it to kind of like turn positive , " she said .
" And I kind of do like the attention but I do n't like so much negative attention . "
But her mother , Diane Leonhardt , said things will change in their house .
While Jessi will not be banned from using the Internet , a detective will come by the house next week to sit with her and explain how use the Internet safely and responsibly .
As for the content of the video , " I do n't want to see that going on anymore and I have talked about it .
She is going to start getting some counseling , " Leonhardt said .
Jessi created an Internet firestorm when she posted a nearly five - minute video raging against online bullies who had called her names and accused a friend of raping her .
But her online rage , posted to Stickam , a video - sharing site , and uploaded on YouTube , only prompted more hatred , this time from more experience and vicious computer junkies .
Once her story hit the message boards of 4 chan , an infamous and anonymous network Web savvy users , the threats against Jessi started coming fast and furious .
Members of Anonymous , a group linked to 4 chan , quickly joined in as did users of the like - minded site Tumblr .
They posted her full name , address and home phone numbers and death threats began rolling in .

Jessi said she feels safe in her home , but fears what might happen to her out in public .
" I 'm afraid that somebody from 4 chan or Anonymous is going to try to jump me or something , " she said .
Marion County Sheriff 's Office spokesman Judge Cochran confirmed today that detectives there were investigating the entire situation to look for evidence of cyberbulling and cyber - stalking .
Authorities got involved he said after a series of phone calls and e-mails were made -- some of them " from some other time zone , " Cochran said , warning detectives that a young girl was possibly being exploited online .
At 12:01 on July 16 , police went to the Leonhardts ' home , but Cochran said , they did not remove Jessi from the home or place her under police protection .
Her video , as well as a follow up video in which her father rages against her bullies , have been seen by millions .
There is even a remix that blends her rants with a Justin Beiber song .
In the second video , as Jessi sobs in front of the camera , Gene Leonhardt warns viewers to leave his daughter alone .
" This is from her father .
You bunch of lying , no good punks , " he said , raging into the webcam .
" And I know who it 's coming from because I back traced it .
And you 've been reported to cyber police and the state police . "
In an exclusive interview today with " Good Morning America " Gene Leonhardt said he was only trying to protect his little girl .
" As a father , I was just trying to support my daughter and get people to stop hating , " Gene Leonhardt said .
Diane Leonhardt , said the entire experience has been frightening .
" When this first started , we were very afraid , ' she said .
Cochran said it was unclear whether the phone calls and e-mails made to the Sheriff 's Office were out of true concern for Jessi or whether they were made maliciously .
" If we had the evidence that someone has made a threat to a child in Marion County , we 'll start pursuing suspects , " he said .
Police also investigated and quickly dismissed other claims made to them that Gene Leonhardt was molesting his daughter , an accusation that made him cry .
Detectives , Cochran said , have released little information about such correspondence and what evidence they might have about where it all came from .
Experts Say Jessi Slaughter Video Highlights Dangers of Cyberbullying
Jessi's social life has largely been confined to her computer .
She told ABCNews.com that most of her friends are online .
" I do n't really get along with people from school that much , " she said .
" They do n't like me because they see me and they think I 'm weird . "
On Stickam , which has had its share of controversy over a proliferation of child pornography images , Jessi would chat back and forth with her cyber friends .
She was also active on the teen gossip site Sticky Drama .
It was there , she said , that her nightmare started when another user took a picture of Jessi and a friend at a concert off the photo - sharing site PhotoBucket and posted it along with the rape allegation .
But Jessi , whose account has since been removed at Stickam , insists she 's not too young for this kind of activity .
" I think age does n't really matter , " she said .
" It 's the person -- him or herself ... and how they deal with that . "
But she still is only 11 .
She likes music and can play a little bit of guitar .
She dreams of a career styling hair and makeup -- and maybe learning how to do body piercings .
Jessi told " Good Morning America " that she was sent to a mental health facility when authorities believed she might be suicidal .
She insisted that she would n't kill herself , but said she could understand how someone could be pushed over the edge .
" I think that 's completely wrong that people would taunt people to some degree that they would actually kill themselves over it , " she said .
" And that 's actually completely wrong and whoever is doing it should be locked away for a really long time . "
Internet security expert Parry Aftab , founder of WiredSafety.org , agreed that this back and forth of online rants and cyberbullying should have been stopped before it ever got to the point where Jessi was receiving death threats .
" At some point we need to have an adult in charge , " she told " Good Morning America . "
" Do n't try to take it into your own hands . "
At 11 , Jessi is n't even old enough to use the social networking sites where the cyberbullying took place and where she posted her videos , Aftab noted .
But family therapist Terry Real said that Jessi 's retaliation video deserves attention by itself .
" This is about violence breeding violence , " he said .
" It 's great that this kid is getting some counseling , " Real said .
" This is a trauma and it needs to be taken seriously . "
The debate has long been waged via bumper stickers , but Massachusetts drivers opposed to abortion have a new mouthpiece : license plates .
The Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles is set to offer a " Choose Life " plate sponsored by the anti-abortion organization Massachusetts Choose Life , Inc .
The plate 's design features a yellow heart behind an image of a mother holding a child .
Massachusetts Choose Life , Inc. -- an affiliate of the national Choose Life , Inc. organization based in Ocala , Florida -- will receive $ 28 of the $ 40 Massachusetts special plate fee .
Customers pay the $ 40 special plate fee in addition to the $ 50 registration fee for a standard plate .
Massachusetts Choose Life , Inc. will allocate the proceeds it receives from the plates to not - for - profit agencies within the state that do not counsel in or refer for abortion .
" Once we start to receive money from the Registry , we will have a grant process whereby eligible organizations can apply for funds , " reads a statement on Massachusetts Choose Life , Inc. 's website .
" The grant process will ensure that the agencies are non-governmental , not - for - profit agencies not involved in abortion services in any way who offer free counseling and services to women with a crisis pregnancy . "
Merry Nordeen , 47 , began campaigning for the Massachusetts plates in 2003 .
" I prayed really hard for this — I prayed for seven years , and God did n't disappoint me , " Nordeen , a secretary at St. Joseph Parish in Wakefield , told the Boston Globe .
Massachusetts law allows eligible charitable organizations to benefit from the issue of a special plate series .
Groups seeking to sponsor a special plate are required to post a $ 100,000 bond , which is released after the sale of 3,000 plates within the first two years of its original issue .
Production of the plates -- which are manufactured at the Massachusetts Correctional Institute / Cedar Junction -- begins once the sponsoring group has collected applications and the $ 40 special plate fee from 1,500 customers .
With the addition of the " Choose Life " plate , the Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles now offers a total of 18 special plates .
Others include the " Fish and Wildlife Plate , " which supports the Massachusetts Environmental Trust ; the " Cure Breast Cancer Plate , " which supports the Diane Connolly - Zaniboni Breast Cancer Research Fund at Tufts Medical Center in Boston ; and the " United We Stand " plate , which Massachusetts 9/11 Fund , the Massachusetts Military Heroes Fund and local police and fire departments .
Florida began offering " Choose Life " plates in August , 2000 .
The plates are now available in over 20 states , and Choose Life groups are working for approval of the plates in over a dozen additional states .
Lawsuits involving the plates are pending in New York and New Jersey , according to Choose Life , Inc. 's website .

It 's been a few weeks since the release of Tyrannis , and I find myself
continually finding excuses to delay writing a review of it .
First I
put it off because the entire focus of Tyrannis - its headline feature ,
Planetary Interaction ( PI ) - was n't actually available until a week
after the patch went live .
Then I put it off because I was hoping to
see what impact PI would have on the markets , but CCP has n't removed
the NPC - seeded goods from the pre-Tyrannis economy , and it's not clear
that they 'll do so anytime soon .
Finally I realized that I was delaying
the review simply because I did not want to admit , in print , the truth :
Tyrannis is basically Facebook for style = " font - style : italic ; " >EVE ,
complete with it's own
space - Farmville equivalent .
It 's an ugly realization , because you then inevitably imagine some CCP
devs goofing off at the office and messing about on Facebook and
playing Farmville .
Then one of them has an Eureka moment and blurts
out , " Hey !
Let 's do this , but IN SPACE ! "
Six months later and an awful
lot of hype we have Tyrannis , which brings us Eve Gate ( ie : Spacebook )
and Planetary Interaction ( Planetville ? ) .
And a new Scorpion
model .
I had written a href = " http://www.tentonhammer.com/node/83514 " id =" h1 - 5 "
title= " column " > column
several months ago warning against this development direction , and
sadly here we are .
With gritted teeth , it 's time to get it over with
and examine the micro - level impact of this patch , and see if it has any
interesting implications for nullsec dwellers .

Spacebook : Eve
Gate !
It 's Facebook .
In space .
It looks like Facebook , it has contacts
like Facebook .
The good thing is that I can finally check my evemail
via the web .
All the same , it 's hard to get folks excited about a
reskinned Facebook .
Next !
Planetary Interaction : Obligatory
Planetville joke aside , PI deserves a more serious review than Eve Gate .
First of all , I respect one of the intentions of PI greatly ; it was
designed to allow people to have something to fiddle with while in
fleets or on ops .
You can now move your little planet - harvesters around
while chilling on a gate or listening to your FC freak out about
something ; EVE has always lacked for minigames to give pilots something
to do during the ' boring bits ' , and PI is our first Bejeweled or
Farmville timewaster that 's actually inside the game client .
The problem is that PI could have been so much more .
Perhaps it will
develop into something greater in time , but as it stands right now it 's
frighteningly similar to the aforementioned farming browser game .
You
mine some stuff ; you build a little network of extractors which go into
factories which spits out , well , POS mods , mostly .
If we were going to
have a timewaster minigame , could n't it have had more game and less
timewaster ?
There are many other browser games that CCP could have
cribbed design notes from ( city - level Civilization clones seem
particularly popular at the moment ) ; these at least provide a challenge
greater than ' scan mineral source , adjust extractor location ' .
That said , PI has several implications for the entire game .
It shows
CCP 's intent to have a completely player - created economy , removing many
of the NPC - seeded items .
This is , broadly , a good thing ; it means there
is more chaos and involvement and opportunity for things to Go
Hellishly Wrong , which is what makes EVE interesting .
Logistically PI
provides nullsec alliances the ability to locally produce outposts ,
control towers and cumbersome mods such as Capital Assembly Arrays ;
this allows alliances with organized PI setups to completely skip
freighter ops through chokepoints .
Alliances wo n't even need to do the
PI themselves ; they can ship PI - produced modules to nullsec in a jump
freighter from empire , then assemble the bulky components which would
ordinarily be manually freightered on site .
This makes nullsec
logistics even easier and safer - and thus possibly more stagnant ,
depending on how you view the optimum risk / reward spectrum .
The implementation of the PI system has been - to put it charitably -
rocky .
When first patched , tower modules could be refined , which
allowed players to reprocess certain mods to create mass numbers of PI
modules ; this essentially allowed many alliances to create outpost eggs
out of thin air .
Right now you can set up a PI network to produce
items , but every item produced by PI can presently be purchased from
NPCs at a fixed rate ; until the seeded items are removed , the entire PI
economy is a sham .
This means that we can't judge what that economy
will be like , and the seeds also allow speculators to stockpile an
endless number of seeded mods at a vastly discounted rate .
Empire Mission Stealth Nerf : This
is one of my favorite features of Tyrannis , and is probably better for
the health of the game than anything else .
The loot tables for empire
missions have been nerfed broadly - by expanding the drop rates for
named modules and removing mineral - heavy ' meta 0 ' drops .
This means
that the isk value of named mods have plummeted , and the risk - free
iskmaking of the average empire dweller has taken a huge hit .
As a
nullsec dweller it 's always rubbed me the wrong way that Raven pilots
in the Forge can hoover up isk without putting anything on the line ,
while in nullsec we live in relative poverty ; slowly the balance seems
to be shifting .

Insurance Adjustment : My
eyes glaze over at the mention of insurance rates , but this is actually
a significant change .
For a long time , ' insurance fraud ' has
artificially inflated the costs of highend minerals ; by increasing T2
insurance payouts and reducing T1 insurance , the bottom has fallen out
of the highend mineral market .
Similarly , certain ships which were
previously only used at great cost are now worth using in mass fleets ;
expect a lot more HAC ops called , because they now cost about as much
to lose as a battleship .
The Scorpion : There 's
a CCP dev whose name is sadly unknown to me .
He sketched out the
Scorpion , as well as designed for the Alliance Tournament prize ships .
The new Scorpion is hands - down the best looking ship in EVE , and
whoever this dev is , he needs to be immediately re-tasked to updating
the older ship designs .
There 's an obvious talent there , a gift , and
that talent needs to fix the Raven .
And the Bellicose hulls .
And the
Dominix .
You get the idea .
I 've never seen so many Scorpions on ops
before , and it's the closest thing to an unmitigated crowd - pleaser that
Tyrannis has to offer .
So , the verdict ?
Tyrannis could have been so much more .
Perhaps it will
be eventually , one of those ' organic growth ' patches which we are
presently underwhelmed with , but eventually some ' really cool stuff '
comes out of it .
The shift to having the economy being entirely
player - based is good ; the nerfing of risk - free empire missions is good ,
and the Scorpion owns .
But it 's hard to say that this is an expansion
in the sense that Dominion was , where the game was radically altered
and major new features were added that affected everyone ; Tyrannis
feels more like a bugfix with Spacebook and Planetville tacked on .
AT LEAST 188 children and young people who were either in care or known to social services have died in the past decade , the Health Service Executive confirmed last night .
The HSE revealed that 151 young people who were known to it but were not in care died during the past 10 years -- 10 of them as a result of unlawful killing .
The new figure is in addition to the 37 children who the HSE last week confirmed had died in care during the past decade .
Last night , the HSE said it hoped that publication of the figures would " bring to an end the debate about numbers " .
However , it was learned last night that so far no files concerning the dead children had been passed over by the HSE to the Independent Review Group .
And fears were immediately raised that the true extent of the scandal could be much wider as it did not include children who were identified as ' at risk ' but who died before a full assessment had been carried out .
Health managers insisted last night that they were not trying to bury bad news by releasing the shocking figures late on the eve of a bank holiday weekend .
In a damning indictment of the state of the country 's child - protection services , it emerged that almost half of the 124 children who were known to social services and who have died since January 1 , 2000 died as a result of unnatural causes .
Meanwhile , 27 young adults , who were aged between 18 and 21 years and who had previously been in care but had since left it , died during the same period .
While four of these died from natural causes , 23 died from unnatural causes .
The HSE said 84 children and young people had died unnatural deaths , including :
21 suicides .
10 unlawfully killed .
14 died after taking drugs .
15 died in traffic accidents .
24 died in " other accidents " .
The most vulnerable group was shown to be those aged between 18 and 21 years and who were no longer in care .
The vast majority of these were found to have died from unnatural causes .
Children 's ' charities last night called for aftercare to be placed on a statutory footing .
Vulnerable
Among these is Danny Talbot , the 19 - year - old who died from a drugs overdose in Dublin 's inner-city last August .
He was in an aftercare programme at the time of his death .
The HSE said it had analysed its records dating back 10 years .
During this time , there were more than 200,000 referrals to social services and there were child - protection concerns in relation to 20,000 children .
Fine Gael's Alan Shatter said the HSE was still " scandalously concealing " the number of children who were identified as being ' at risk ' but who died before a full assessment of their case was carried out .
He said that in 2008 alone , of 24,000 reports to social services of children being ' at risk ' , 8,000 were never even assessed or investigated .
However HSE local health manager Bernard Gloster , who is responsible for compiling the figures , said he was satisfied that any 'at risk ' children had been included .
" There are lots of children who come to the knowledge of the State for different reasons but that would n't necessarily say that there would be evidence to suggest that they were either of child - protection concern or at risk . "
The register of child deaths will remain open for the next three months and any new cases that emerge will be added to it .
However , Mr Gloster said he was satisfied that it was already as accurate as it could be .
Children 's Minister Barry Andrews said there would be shock at the scale of the numbers revealed .
He added that behind each case was a child and family , whose loss must always be borne in mind .
Irish Independent
Since the World Cup started , guardian .
co.uk users have been rating the players after each match .
From our monster list of all ratings , we 've pulled out four key lists
Sandra Jean Burke has lived , worked , paid taxes , raised three boys and even voted in government elections in Canada since her grandparents rescued her from a U.S. orphanage at age 6 and brought her here in 1951 .
Only last year , when she applied for the Old Age Security pension and was asked for her “ immigration landing paper , ” did the Mississauga woman discover she had never been registered as a landed immigrant with Citizenship and Immigration Canada .
Burke , who turns 66 in August , called the immigration department for a routine “ verification of entry ” and was told it had no record .
She is not sure if her deceased grandparents had ever completed the proper application for her , or the document was simply lost .
Now , Burke just hopes to get legal status and receive the assistance she desperately needs to enjoy her senior years with her three adult sons , Robert , William and Chad , and four grandchildren .
“ I have had my social insurance card , my health card .
I ’ve lived here for 59 years .
I always tell people I was born in the United States and they ’d never questioned me , ” Burke said at the Barsuda Dr. townhouse where she has lived since 1978 .
“ It makes me angry , ” added Burke .
“ I did n’t come here under my grandmother ’s coat .
Now I have to prove I ’ve had roots in Canada . ”
Don Chapman , who founded an online group called Lost Canadians to lobby for those who lose their Canadian citizenship for various reasons , said he was not surprised to hear of Burke ’s case .
Immigration status was simply not a big deal in the post - war period .
“ Sandra is just one of many who may not have the papers .
Now , they are getting to that age to collect pensions .
This is happening with more regularity now .
It ’s a bubble that ’s going to burst , ” Chapman said .
Born Sandra Jean MacEwen , in Somerville , Mass. , Burke was sent to an orphanage when her American mother died in 1950 and her Canadian father gave her up .
Her paternal grandmother , Catherine Bell MacEwen , later located her and brought her to Norval , Ont. , by train .
The family then moved to Prince Edward Island , where Burke finished high school .
She came to Toronto in 1963 , at 19 .
She had worked all her life — on electronics assembly lines at Canadian Admiral , Inglis and Pyroil — until nine years ago , when she was forced to take a disability pension because of her worsening diabetes and associated health problems .
In between , she got married , divorced and became a single mom .
Last summer , when she turned 65 , her $ 715 monthly disability pension was stopped and replaced by Canada Pension Plan payments at roughly $ 430 a month .
She had to apply for Old Age Security to supplement her dwindling income .
Burke said she had never applied for a passport — one way she might have learned of her tenuous status — because she had never had spare money to travel .
Earlier this year , Burker ’s MP , Paul Szabo ( Mississauga South ) submitted an application for a citizenship certificate on her behalf under her “ unique ” circumstances .
“ It appears that the adults in her childhood , including the foster care program that she was in , never applied for permanent residency or Canadian citizenship when she was a child , ” Szabo wrote in a letter .
“ As Canada is the only country she really knows , she has always considered herself Canadian .
She has been through a lot of turmoil and misfortune in her life and now faces financial hardship .
All she seeks is to be considered a Canadian , especially considering her strong family ties to Canada . ”
In June , Citizenship and Immigration Canada rejected the request , citing the fact that Burke , born in 1944 , did not acquire “ British subject ” status before January 1 , 1947 , when Canada introduced a new citizenship act that would restrict citizenship for those born to Canadians overseas .
It ’s just too late now .

Officials said Burke can still apply for permanent residency through a sponsorship by her family or on humanitarian and compassionate grounds .
However , there is no guarantee she would be considered eligible to receive OSA because her time in Canada prior to issuance of citizenship might not count toward the 10 - year residency requirement .
A Facebook group , Give Sandy Burke Her Citizenship , has been launched , along with a letter campaign to petition Immigration Minister Jason Kenney to grant Burke citizenship .

Spill prompts NOAA to define its data management architecture
NOAA CIO says IT systems need to evolve to address next crisis
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is defining the architecture needed to effectively manage , store and disseminate data to the public and other agencies after the Deepwater Horizon - BP oil spill made starkly clear there is a need to do so , Joseph Kilmavicz , NOAA ’s chief information officer , said at a recent Industry Advisory Council membership meeting .
“ My job is to bring data together in a usable format , ” said Kilmavicz , who is also director of High Performance Computing and Communications at NOAA .
“ There is going to be an evolution [ as we ] plan how to best posture our IT systems and data to prepare for the next crisis . "
Kilmavicz spoke to IAC members on July 15 in Vienna , Va. , about the GeoPlatform Web site , which allows the public to track Deepwater Horizon - BP oil spill recovery data online via a near - real - time interactive map .
BP announced July 15 that the company had finally stopped the leak with a new cap , but it was too soon to know if that would lead to a permanent solution .

Gulf oil spill
GeoPlatform , launched June 15 , includes regularly updated geospatial data from several federal and state agencies on the oil spill trajectory , closed fishery areas , impact on wildlife and Gulf resources , daily position of research ships , and affected shorelines .
GeoPlatform.gov was launched in two weeks with the help of geo-spatial executives across the government , the Environmental Protection Agency and the University of New Hampshire .
The site is hosted on NOAA ’s Web server farm , Kilmavicz said .
The volume of data collected for the site is immense , coming from many types of sensors and sources in the Gulf of Mexico in different formats , he said .
GeoPlatform receives data from NOAA , the U.S. Coast Guard , EPA , the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service , the U.S. Geological Survey , the Homeland Security Department , NASA and several states .
“ All data can be geospatially referenced , ” Kilmavicz said .
For example , there ’s no reason why data in Data.gov ca n’t be put it in a geospatial background , he said .
Data.gov gives the public access to machine - readable datasets generated by the executive branch of the federal government .
Data management is critical , though .
“ Bringing data together does n’t solve all problems , ” Kilmavicz said .
More important is “ how do you use that information ? ”
There is still a lot of work to be done in that area , he said .
It ’s been quiet about K3 b 2.0 .
It ’s not that it ’s no longer developed or anything .
There are two blocker bugs :
One related to DVD - DL burning ( https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=234033) and one to Blu-ray burning ( https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=236069).
The main problem is that Michał , the main developer , does not ( yet ) have a Blu-ray recorder to work on the a fix himself .
He sent out letters to drive manufacturers to see whether they can sponsor one .
No reply as of yet .
And the DVD - DL bug cannot be verified by either Michał or Sebastian .
So if you can help with either bug ( eg. sponsoring a recorder , contributing code , testing ) , leave comment in the appropriate bug report or send Michał an e-mail ( his address is also in the bug reports ) .
And now the note to distributors :
All KDE Platform 4 - based releases were preview releases ( Alpha , Beta , RC ) of 2.0 .
This means unless a new pre-release added a dependency that you ca n’t meet ( IIRC it only affects the switch from sudo to KAuth that was done relatively late and AFAIK also requires SC 4.4 ) , you really should package newer K3b releases as official updates – especially as there is a full feature and string freeze in place since the first RC ( when you shipped pre-releases of Firefox 3.0 and Thunderbird 3.0 you had no problems doing the same ) .
The K3b team is very very small .
And while I try to get some of the work load off Michał ’s back ( like blogging about status updates ) , incoming reports for bugs that are already fixed , but you do n’t package newer versions , increase the load in an unnecessary way .
Thanks for reading and since I like promoting bands who are not known around the world , here ’s one song from an awesome Romanian music group ( and the vid ’s funny , too ) : Șuie Paparude – Armada verbal ă

Applications
What could a distance printing - machine possibly be used for ?
There are countless applications , some of which are descibed here .
A national Angus - Reid poll released Wednesday has found majority support for legalizing marijuana , with 52 % of respondents saying they wanted to free the weed .
That figure includes 59 % of independents and 57 % of Democrats , but only 38 % of Republicans .
Gallup poll data , summarized in April Pew Research Center report
The 52 % figure is almost identical to a December Angus - Reid poll that found support at 53 % .
The difference is within the statistical margin of error .
But the Angus - Reid polling finds higher support than most recent polls , which show support nationwide for legalization somewhere in the forties .
Support for legalizing any other drugs was dramatically lower , with only 10 % supporting legalizing Ecstasy , and only single - digit support for legalizing heroin , cocaine , or methamphetamine .
The high levels of opposition to drug legalization cut across party lines .
The poll found that while a large majority ( 64 % ) believe that " America has a serious drug abuse problem , " an equally large majority ( 65 % ) believe the war on drugs is a failure .
Only 8 % said the drug war was working .
The poll also surveyed attitudes toward Mexico and things Mexican .
Some 78 % respondents had favorable views of Mexican food , and 59 % held favorable views of the Mexican people .
But only 34 % had a favorable view of Mexican immigrants ( without distinguishing between legal and illegal ) and only 7 % had a favorable view of the Mexican government .
The poll found that people who had actually been to Mexico tended to have more favorable view of things Mexican .
Nearly half ( 49 % ) of respondents believe Mexico deserves most of the blame for being a major drug supplier to the US , while 34 % thought the US bore more blame .
A majority ( 59 % ) of Republicans blamed Mexico , while only 49 % of independents and 45 % of Democrats did .
Regionally , majorities of people in the West ( 54 % ) and the South ( 52 % ) blamed Mexico , while only 46 % in the Midwest and 38 % in the Northeast blamed Mexico .
How to find which device corresponds to your root filesystem
I recently found something I was looking for for quite a long time .
If you use the mount command in Linux , you can see that the root device is not listed like the other mounted filesystems :
/ dev/root on / type ext3 ( rw ) / dev/mmcblk0p1 on / mmcboot type vfat ( rw ) proc on / proc type proc ( rw ) none on /sys type sysfs ( rw , noexec , nosuid , nodev ) none on / dev type tmpfs ( rw , mode=0755 ) ...
For the / mount point , you are just told that it corresponds to / dev/ root , which is not the real device you are looking for .
Of course , you can look at the kernel command line and see on which initial root filesystem Linux was instructed to boot ( root parameter ) :
$ cat / proc / cmdline mem=512 M console=ttyS2,115200n8 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rw rootwait
However , this does n’t mean that what you see is the current root device .
Many Linux systems boot on intermediate root filesystems ( like initramdisks and initramfs ) , which are just used to access the final one .
I explored the contents of / proc , but did n’t find any file revealing what the root device is .
Fortunately , I eventually found a command to find the root device :
$ rdev /dev/mmcblk0p2 /
But how does this work ?
How could we find such information by ourselves ?
Use the Source , Luke !
When you ask yourself questions like this one , the best is to look at the BusyBox sources which implement this command .
These sources are usually simpler than the ones for the same GNU command .
Here is what BusyBox rdev does …
It first runs the stat system call on the / directory .
Let ’s run the stat command that corresponds to it :
$ stat / File : `/'
Size : 4096 Blocks : 8 IO Block : 4096 directory Device : b302h/45826d Inode : 2 Links : 23 Access : ( 0755 / drwxr-xr-x )
Uid : ( 0 / root ) Gid : ( 0 / root ) Access : 2010-07-21 22:00:01.000000000 +0200 Modify : 2010-06-13 15:04:37.000000000 +0200 Change : 2010-06-13 15:04:37.000000000 +0200
What ’s interesting is the Device field .
It means that the device corresponding to / has the major number b3 in hexadecimal ( 179 in decimal ) , and minor number 02 .
Bingo , this corresponds to / dev/mmcblk0p2 :
$ ls -l /dev/mmcblk0p2 brw-rw---- 1 root disk 179 , 2 Jan 1 1970 /dev/mmcblk0p2
Therefore , what BusyBox rdev does is walk through / dev and its subdirectories to find a device file matching the major and minor numbers .
This is not a completely generic solution though .
On some very simple embedded systems , you do n’t even need to create device files for all existing devices .
In particular , the device file for the root filesystem does n’t have to exist .
In such a case , rdev would n’t be able to find the root device .
A more generic solution could be to walk through / sys / block which enumerates all the block devices present on a system ( even if not all of them have an entry in / dev / .
This would allow to find the device with the matching major and minor numbers :
$ cat /sys / block / mmcblk0/mmcblk0p1/dev 179:1
Through this example , you can see how useful it can be to study the sources of system commands to understand how the system works .
BusyBox sources , implementing simplified versions of GNU utilities , make this even easier .
The Devils avoided arbitration with defenseman Mark Fraser , signing him to a one - year , one - way contract for $ 500,000 .
Last season , Fraser made $ 500,000 , but had a two - way contract .
Fraser wanted a one - way contract to ensure himself a spot on an NHL roster .
Fraser became an important rookie on the Devils ’ blue line last season .
In 61 games , he tallied three goals and three assists and had a plus - 3 .
He also recorded 36 penalty minutes and averaged 12:22 of ice time .
After the Devils acquired Martin Skoula in a trade deadline deal and Paul Martin returned from injury , Fraser became a healthy scratch for 13 of the team ’s final 19 regular season games .
He only played in one of the team ’s five playoff games .
Devils ’ general manager Lou Lamoriello was happy with the terms of the contract .
“ This is something I ’m very comfortable with , ” Lamoriello said of the contract .
“ We talked about it , but we were prepared to go Friday ( to the arbitration hearing ) if we had to . ”
Since Fraser filed for arbitration , the Devils now have a second buyout window to clear cap space if they need .
That could help them if the rejection of Ilya Kovalchuk ’s 17 - year , $ 102 million deal is overturned .
The buyout window begins three days after the agreement and ends 48 hours after the starting date .
I think this is a solid depth move for the Devils .
Fraser comes cheaper than other veterans still available , and he played solid hockey whenever he was on the ice .
He did make some mistakes , but he was always reliable and gave the team quality minutes .
I advocated for Fraser to get more playing time last season , and I ’m happy to see this deal get done .

A Very Canadian Coup in Haiti :
The Top 10 Ways Canada Aided the 2004 Coup and its Reign of Terror
By Richard Sanders , coordinator , Coalition to Oppose the Arms Trade
Things went from bad to worse after Canada 's Liberal government helped plan and carry out the 2004 regime change that illegally ousted President Aristide 's democratically - elected government .
Canada then helped empower and entrench an illegal coup - installed puppet regime that launched a reign of terror in which thousands of prodemocracy supporters were executed , jailed without charge , driven into hiding , or exiled .
This Canadian - financed dictatorship , propped up by UN - sanctioned occupation forces , was applauded by corporations greedy to profit from " reconstruction " contracts , the privatisation of public services , and the wage - slavery of Haitian sweatshops .
Canada has a lot to answer for .
Here are 10 ways in which our government contributed to this major travesty of justice in Haiti :
(1) Creating the Coup 's Ideological Pretext
The world 's most powerful states justify their “ right ” to invade , overthrow and occupy weaker nations with euphemistic platitudes .
They rationalise their role in various theatres of war using dramatic soliloquies , invoking the need for " humanitarian interventions " against “ failed states . ”
The “ Responsibility - to - Protect ” ( R2P ) doctrine -- an ideological pretext that was created and developed by Canada 's Liberal government - - was used to legitimise the illegal coup imposed on Haiti in 2004 .
Institutionalised on the world stage by a Canadian creature called the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty ( ICISS ) , the R2P doctrine was the brain - child of then - Prime Minister Jean Chrétien .
When announcing its birth in 2000 , then - Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy thanked the “ Carnegie , MacArthur and Rockefeller Foundations ” for “ strong political and financial support . ”
With Axworthy acting as chair of the board , ICISS offices were ensconced in Ottawa ’s Foreign Affairs department .
Canada chose both ICISS co-chairs and appointed such " Big L " Liberals as Michael Ignatieff , a long - time U.S. resident and supporter of then - President George W.Bush , " missile defense , " the Iraq war and torture .
The R2P script spells out acceptable excuses for violating the UN ’s two primary principles : state sovereignty and military non-intervention .
In May 2004 , after ousting Haiti ’s democratically - elected government , then - Prime Minister Paul Martin summarized a fundamental R2P principle : “ Failed states more often than not require military intervention in order to ensure stability . ”
Asking himself , “ Why is it up to Canada to be the catalyst ? ” he answered , “ We inspire confidence ... because we are neither a former colonial power nor a superpower . ”
Canada 's political / economic / military allies in Washington and London needed a champion for the starring role in R2P .
Already typecast as honest broker and heroic peacekeeper , Canada was perfect for the part .
(2) Initiating the Planning Process
Canada 's Liberal government was instrumental in gathering together an exclusive coterie of international players to lay the foundation for Haiti 's coup .
Their first meeting , the so - called “ The Ottawa Initiative on Haiti ” ( January 31 - February 1 , 2003 ) was held at the federal government 's conference centre on Meech Lake near Canada 's capital .
We now know , thanks to Access to Information , that this confab on “ the current political situation in Haiti ” was “ envisaged to be of a restricted and intimate nature .... in order to facilitate a free exchange of views and brainstorming among the invited participants . ”
Those invited to this so - called " free exchange " did not include a single Haitian , not even from the wealthy corporate elite that was so instrumental in facilitating the coup .
Besides El Salvador 's Foreign Minister , participants were exclusively from North America and Europe .
They were also homogenous in their opposition to Haiti's President Aristide and in support of replacing him with an imposed , occupation government .
The meeting 's host was Denis Paradis , a Quebec Liberal MP who was Chrétien 's Secretary of State for Latin America , Africa and the Francophonie .
Canada 's future Foreign Affairs Minister , Pierre Pettigrew , was also there , as were two U.S. State Department officials , Mary Ellen Gilroy and Otto Reich -- a long - time coup plotter , propagandist , and veteran of the Contragate scandal .
Also on hand were the US representative to the Organization of American States , France 's Minister for Security and Conflict Prevention and the Francophonie 's Administrator General .
" The Ottawa Initiative " was presumably supposed to remain secret , but in March 2003 , Paradis leaked some details to journalist Michel Vastel , who wrote about it in L’Actualité ( March 15 , 2003 ) .
The purpose of Canada 's initial meeting appears to have been to build a working consensus among influential players from the key states striving for regime change in Haiti , primarily , the US , Canada and France .
They agreed -- in general terms -- on the goal of ridding themselves of Aristide before his five - year mandate expired , and on using their troops to supplant Haiti 's elected government with a new regime .
Vastel 's account had few details on the military invasion / occupation , noting only that “ No decision has yet been taken , but in French diplomatic circles , they say that there has been talk of a sort of guardianship‚ as in Kosovo ....
Even if the UN does n’t want this kind of intervention leading to military occupation , this might be inevitable until elections are organized . ”
Participants wanted their new regime in place before the powerfully - symbolic bicentennial of Haiti ’s revolution , when a slave revolt defeated France 's Napoleonic might .
This objective was soon echoed by Chrétien who , in April 2003 , “ declared that the ‘ international community ’ should not have to wake up with Aristide in power on January 1 , 2004 , Haiti ’s bicentennial . ”
With " The Ottawa Initiative " groundwork firmly in place , Aristide was ousted by the end of February 2004 .
(3) Providing Military Troops and Equipment
Canada 's military played a significant role in deposing Haiti ’s democracy and protecting the ensuing dictatorship .
In the early hours of February 29 , 2004 , U.S. officials entered President Aristide 's home threatening a " bloodbath " if he did not leave the country .
Forced to sign a “ letter of resignation , ” heavily - armed Marines took him to the airport , which Canadian commandos had just “ secured . ”
Aristide later said : “ The coup and kidnapping was led by the U.S. , France and Canada .
[ They ] were on the front lines by sending their soldiers to Haiti before February 29 , by having their soldiers either at the airport or at my residence , or around the palace , or in the capital to make sure that they succeeded in kidnapping me , leading [ to ] the coup . ”
Canada sent “ a team of JTF2 [ Joint Task Force 2 ] commandos to Haiti four days before the coup ” ( American Forces Press Service , March 14 , 2004 ) .
They “ took control of the Port - au - Prince airport on ... February 29 , 2004 ....
About 30 Canadian special forces soldiers secured the airport and two sharpshooters [ were ] positioned on top of the control tower . ”
( AFP , March 2 , 2004 )
Canadian Forces ( CF ) also “ secured key locations " in the capital .
( Anthony Fenton , The Dominion , April 22 , 2006 ) .
According to a government video , CF “ provided extensive support ” during the preceding week : “ More than 100 CF personnel and four CC - 130 Hercules aircraft ... assist[ed ] with emergency contingency plans and security measures . ”
( “ Operation PRINCIPAL , ” February 28 , 2004 . )
Immediately after the coup , 500 Canadian troops joined U.S. and French forces in protecting Haiti 's newly - empowered , illegal regime and suppressing Aristide supporters .
However , the Canadian Air Force website said Canadian troops “ helped restore peace and democracy in Haiti following that country ’s democratic elections . ”
In reality , the “ democratic elections ” — which swept Aristide to power — occurred in 2000 , and Canada 's troops helped overthrow democracy , not restore it .
The claim that Canadian troops “ helped restore peace ” is equally ludicrous .
During the coup 's two - year reign of terror , thousands were murdered with impunity by Haitian police , its disbanded military and death squads , as foreign troops stood by providing cover .
Canada is also a major supporter of UN forces which took over the occupation in 2004 and have killed many civilians during numerous , heavily - armed raids into Haiti 's poorest neighbourhoods .
Unperturbed , Canada has pushed for the use of even more excessive force by UN troops .
(4) Funding , Training and Commanding the Police
In 1995 , Aristide disbanded Haiti 's military for its role in coups , dictatorships , mass murder and torture .
With Aristide 's 2004 ouster , Haiti's US - trained ex-military were placed in all Haitian National Police ( HNP ) leadership positions , including police - abuse investigations .
Through Haiti's UN Police Mission ( UNPOL ) , the RCMP has funded and led the HNP 's training , supervision and oversight .
The RCMP's David Beer -- transferred from teaching counter - insurgency tactics in Iraq - - became UNPOL 's first chief .
Another RCMP , Graham Muir , was next to command UNPOL 's 1,600 officers ( including 125 RCMP and Quebec police ) .
Although admitting HNP 's responsibility for murder , Muir blamed it on “ rogue elements . ”
Lawyer Brian Concannon , with the Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti , said RCMP - led UNPOL shared responsibility for HNP rampages : “ [ M ] any of these rogue [ HNP ] elements were intentionally integrated into the force , without public objection from MINUSTAH or UNPOL .... [ I ] n 2004 , Gen . Abraham [ Haiti ’s retired military leader ] started integrating former soldiers into the force , bypassing regulations for police recruitment and promotion ....
Several times , MINUSTAH , including UNPOL officers , watched as the HNP shot into peaceful demonstrations . ”
In its 2005 Human Rights Investigation , the University of Miami Law School published interviews with brave HNP officers , fearing for their lives , who described raids into poor proAristide neighbourhoods , when HNP commanders ordered the murder of suspects and witnesses .
Also , coup - appointed Police Chief Leon Charles ordered the violent suppression of peaceful , prodemocracy demonstrations .
Amnesty International exposed HNP 's summary executions , arbitrary arrests , torture and rape .
Similarly , the International Catholic Institute said " many " HNP officers engaged in " drug rackets , kidnappings [ and ] extra-judicial killings . ”
When the HNP killed nine Aristide supporters , the HNP said they " were not shot during a demonstration since ... authorities had received no notice of a demonstration . "
The UN Civilian Police spokesperson , the RCMP's Dan Moskaluk , calling it an " illegal demonstration , " did n't comment on HNP 's authority to execute protesters .
When HNP received a million rounds of ammunition , 10,000 US military - style handguns and weapons , Moskaluk defended the transfer .
Human rights groups denounced it , saying HNP would distribute weapons to death squads for joint operations conducted under UN supervision .
In 2006 , an " International Tribunal " led by former - U.S. Attorney - General Ramsey Clark , found the RCMP 's Beer and Muir guilty of crimes against humanity , but to no avail .
HNP and their RCMP handlers have operated with complete impunity .
(5) Every Trick in the Diplomatic Book
Canada used every conceivable diplomatic trick to bring down Aristide 's elected government and then legitimise the coup - installed regime .
On February 5 , 2004 -- while a murderous band of ex-military and death - squad leaders launched a campaign attacking Haitian government facilities , police stations and health clinics -- Liberal cabinet minister Pierre Pettigrew met with Paul Arcelin .
Described as the terrorist 's “ political mastermind ” and “ spokesman , " Arcelin also served as diplomatic representative in Cana
At the UN Security Council on February 26 , Canadian , U.S. and French diplomats dismissed Caribbean Community ( CARICOM ) calls for a multinational force to protect Aristide 's elected government from a coup .
While Jamaica ’s Foreign Minister warned , “ Immediate action is needed to safeguard democracy [ and ] to avert bloodshed , ” U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell and Foreign Affairs Minister Bill Graham told Aristide to resign .
Canada , the U.S. and France immediately recognised the illegal coup regime , but CARICOM 's 15 member states , Venezuela and the African Union 's 53 governments all refused diplomatic recognition and demanded an investigation into Aristide ’s exile .
Two Canadian ambassadors to Haiti launched diplomatic offensives .
Kenneth Cook said “ there is no evidence of a kidnapping " and Claude Boucher said “ We hope ... Aristide is going to disappear ...[ and ] never come back . "
In March 2004 , coup Prime Minister Gérard Latortue and David Lee , Canada 's ambassador to the Organization of American States , flew by American military helicopter to a celebration of Aristide ’s ouster .
When Latortue praised Haiti's terror squads calling them " freedom fighters , " Lee nodded in approval .
In June 2005 , Governor - General Adrienne Clarkson acknowledged Robert Tippenhauer as Haiti's ambassador to Canada , although no constitutional basis existed for his credentials .
A strong representative of Haiti's wealthy business elite , Tippenhauer had also referred to Haiti 's terrorists as “ freedom fighters . ”
In 2006 , Canada appointed Haitian - born Michäelle Jean as governor general and she was soon gracing photo ops with smiling coup - President Boniface Alexandre .
Prime Minister Martin and Foreign Affairs Minister Pettigrew led official junkets to Haiti unashamedly exalting the coup regime .
During reciprocal visits , the illegally - appointed " leaders " were welcomed with open Canadian arms .
Dozens were killed , including many women and children , when hundreds of heavily - armed UN troops and police -- in armoured vehicles and helicopters -- made night - time raids into Port - au - Prince 's poorest neighbourhoods .
Unperturbed by these war crimes , Canada ’s ambassador Claude Boucher , urged UN troops to “ increase their operations ” in Haiti .
(6) Supporting Destructive Neoliberal Economic Policies
Canada helped devise , finance , implement and legitimize a destructive , neoliberal economic restructuring program called the Interim Cooperation Framework ( ICF ) .
Within weeks of the coup , the ICF was drafted by " lead donors , " including Canada , at the World Bank 's Washington headquarters .
Sponsored by the U.S. , Canada and France , the ICF focused on privatization and exporting inexpensive factory goods .
While benefited Haitian elites , foreign corporations and international financial institutions , the ICF hurt Haiti 's poor majority .
In June 2004 , 31 Haitian civil - society organizations listed major ICF problems , including :
* " The whole exercise is taking place [ under ] an increasing loss of sovereignty ...[ and ] long - term military occupation ....
* is controlled by external actors ...[ and ] excludes all real participation of the majority and vulnerable sectors of our country ....
* ignores the priority social needs of our country ’s poor ...;
* [ proposes ] superficial solutions to ... abject poverty ... ;
* privatis[ing ] the Electricity Co. , the Port - au - Prince Water Board , the Telephone Co. , the Airport and Port Authorities , [ will ] probably [ have ] disastrous effects ... ;
* is taking place in a pseudo - colonial framework ... without any concern for transparency .
* next to nothing has been allocated for a credible consultation process ....
* The ICF ... reinforces existing power structure .
It risks aggravating the suffering of the most excluded and exploited sectors , and accelerating the process of destroying our nation . "
Some of the ICF 's most harmful elements , were noted by Canadian journalist / activist , Nik Barry - Shaw :
Slashing subsidies for Haiti ’s impoverished farmers ,
Reducing the minimum wage ,
Dismantling an extremely - successful adult - literacy program ,
Giving a three - year tax holiday to large businesses ,
Paying $ 30 million in “ back wages ” to ex-soldiers from the army Aristide disbanded .
During the window of opportunity offered by Haiti 's unelected coup government , Canada secured Haiti ’s membership in the private , Caribbean Development Bank ( CDB ) while Foreign Affairs Minister Pettigrew was Vice - President of its Board of Governors .
Denis Marcheterre , a senior financial specialist with the Canadian International Development Agency ( CIDA ) , said Canada needed to get Haiti into the CDB during the unelected regime because an elected government might not have complied .
Canada participates in the CDB , said Marcheterre , so Canadian corporations can win contracts from borrowing countries , like Haiti .
By paying Haiti's CDB membership , Canada helped lock Haiti into long - term debt that would be paid to Canadian contractors .
(7) Using Aid as a Weapon
Canada , the U.S. and France put a stranglehold on development assistance to Haiti 's government .
External aid to Aristide 's government has reduced from $ 611 million in 1994 - 95 , to $ 266 million in 1999 - 2000 .
After Aristide 's second landslide electoral victory in 2000 , bilateral aid to his Lavalas - Party government was cut to $ 136 million .
By starving Haiti's popular government of resources , Canada deliberately fostered the “ failed - state ” conditions whose pretext justified the 2004 coup .
Most of the " aid " that Canada and the U.S. sent after 2000 , was not aimed at addressing basic human needs among Haiti 's poor majority .
It was instead funnelled into relatively wealthy , so - called " democracy promotion " groups linked to Haiti 's elite corporate class .
Most glaringly , CIDA poured $ 24 million into twelve projects administered - - entirely or in part -- by members of the Group of 184 , including more than $ 500,000 went straight into the coffers of this right - wing coalition .
The G - 184 was led by some of Haiti 's most hated multimillionaires and sweat - shop owners who provided weapons and funding to paramilitary terrorists whose anti-government violence provoked the 2004 invasion .
Such CIDA - funded Haitian groups as CARLI , CONAP , ENFOFANM , FNH , ISC and PAPDA , stirred up domestic and international opposition to Aristide , helped destabilize his popularly - elected government and called for its immediate demise .
CIDA 's agents of regime change then ignored or covered up the coup government 's worst excesses .
CIDA also funded the National Coalition for Haitian Rights ( NCHR ) whose disinformation was widely used by governments , international media and foreign NGOs .
The NCHR worked as an arm of the illegal , Canadian - backed coup regime to eliminate political opponents .
Within days of the 2004 coup , CIDA gave NCHR $ 100,000 to help nonexistent victims of a faked " genocide . "
NCHR's " special project " fabricated evidence to frame Lavalas activists and leaders .
Chief among NCHR 's targets was Prime Minister Yvon Neptune , who suffered two years behind bars before being released for lack of any actual evidence .
CIDA contracted several Quebec - based organisations to aid and abet its Haitian regime - change policies .
These groups -- including Alternatives , FOCAL , Development and Peace , Réseau Liberté , Rights and Democracy , and Concertation pour Haiti -- either distributed CIDA grants to their Haitian " partners " for virulently anti-Aristide campaigns , or became cheerleaders in the government 's propaganda war to cover up atrocities of the coup - imposed dictatorship and rationalise Canada 's role in overthrowing Haiti 's democracy .
(8) Imposing an Illegal " Justice " System
After helping oust Aristide 's elected government , Canada dramatically increased " aid " to Haiti .
Most Canadian financing went into police , prisons and courts .
These institutions tightened the illegal dictatorship 's gasp on power by persecuting its opponents .
CIDA funded and helped administer Haiti's " Ministry of Justice " which coordinated the arbitrary arrest and imprisonment without charge , of hundreds of supporters , activists and leaders from Aristide 's Lavalas Party .
The American government chose USAID official , Bernard Gousse , to be Haiti's Justice Minister .
CIDA -- the Canadian equivalent of USAID -- appointed one of its bureaucrats , Philippe Vixamar , as Deputy Justice Minister .
Soon after Gousse 's shamed resignation in 2005 , Canada replaced Vixamar and another CIDA bureaucrat , Dilia Lemaire , became Deputy Minister .
During the coup - regime period , Vixamar was interviewed by human rights investigators from the University of Miami ’s Law School .
Vixamar " revealed that the U.S. and Canadian governments play key roles in the justice system ... including paying high - level government officials .
He denied there are human rights and constitutional abuses within the criminal justice system . "
Deputy - Minister Vixamar said " CIDA assigned him to this position and is his direct employer .
Now in his fourth consecutive year of employment for CIDA , Vixamar had previously worked for USAID for 10 years and was with the U.S. Department of Justice for three . "
When asked about " warrantless arrests and reports that hundreds of prisoners have not appeared before a judge ... Vixamar denied there were any political prisoners in Haiti . "
This lie was echoed by Prime Minister Paul Martin who , when visiting Haiti in November 2004 , said “ There are no political prisoners in Haiti . ”
That month , the Catholic Church ’s Commission for Justice and Peace said there were over 700 Haitian political prisoners , including elected cabinet ministers such as Haiti 's legitimate Prime Minister Neptune .
Vixamar said his Ministry was " fully confident " in its " exclusive reliance on the National Coalition for Haitian Rights to alert it when the police or courts commit human rights abuses . "
He also disclosed their sole reliance on this extremely antiAristide , CIDA - funded group for vetting " integration of former soldiers into the [ Haitian National Police ] HNP . "
When nonviolent activist , Father Jean - Juste , was arrested without warrant , Amnesty named him a “ prisoner of conscience . ”
Vixamar quipped that Jean - Juste was harbouring " chimères , " the Haitian elite ’s hateful epithet for criminals , thugs and Aristide supporters .
After two years , Jean - Juste was released without charge .
(9 ) Funding and Whitewashing Unfair Elections
In 2005 , CIDA , Foreign Affairs , and Elections Canada created the International Mission for Monitoring Haitian Elections ( IMMHE ) .
Chaired by Jean - Pierre Kingsley , Canada ’s Chief Electoral Officer , IMMHE ignored scandals surrounding the Canadian - funded and - supervised 2007 elections .
When election - day reports revealed tens of thousands of cast ballots were found dumped , and mass protests began , the IMMHE said only hundreds were found .
Its source was UN troops responsible for ballot security .
The officer in charge was Canadian colonel , Barry MacLeod .
While IMMHE said the “ overall picture was positive , ” it admitted “ organization problems ” :
delayed voting - station openings , insufficient space and signage
incomplete voters ' lists
no assistance for illiterate or disabled voters
inconsistent voting - centre instructions
voting without privacy
undelivered ballot - box seals to prevent tampering
inadequate lighting for ballot - counting
unmonitored Vote - Tabulation - Centre entry / exit
IMMHE however ignored these major problems :
Haiti’s Constitution gives provisional governments 90 days to organize elections .
The coup regime missed its deadline by 21 months .
The illegally - appointed , electoral authority was funded by occupation powers , including Canada .
Thousands of Aristide 's Lavalas - Party supporters , organizers and politicians were killed , imprisoned or exiled , thus excluding participation .
Lavalas ' presidential candidate , Father Jean - Juste , being jailed without charge , was excluded .
Lavalas meetings were not permitted and rallies were terrorised by police .
Leaders of paramilitary rebels were allowed to campaign .
U.S. and Canadian governments spent tens of millions on pre-election training for Lavalas opponents , and supported antiAristide journalists .
Impoverished Lavalas supporters were disenfranchised by :
electronic voter registration
TV / radio instructions
a 94 % reduction in registration / voting centres , from 22,000 during Aristide 's 2000 election to fewer than 1,300 in 2007
disproportionate location of registration / voting centres .
Cité Soleil , where hundreds of thousands of proAristide voters lived , had no voting centre
last - minute moves of voting centres
forcing 32,000 largely - Lavalas voters into a single centre
undersupplied polling materials
destroying voter - tally sheets and voters ' lists
having to walk or line up for many hours
discarding 147,765 votes as “ null ” or " unclear "
finding 85,290 " blank " votes , making it harder for the winner to reach 50 %
tampering with tally sheets and ballot boxes .
Lavalas has since been banned from two elections .
The now - cancelled 2010 elections were set to exclude Lavalas .
( 10 ) Helping Corporations Profit from Haitian Poverty
After the coup , Canada worked hand - in - glove with Haiti 's unelected regime helping companies turn handsome profits .
The Canadian government bolstered Haiti's elitist regime on business - friendly policies including “ reconstruction ” contracts , privatisation and promoting sweat - shops .
Haiti's post - coup military occupation boosted sales of helicopters , assault vehicles , weapons , ammunition and lucrative contracts for servicing thousands of foreign troops in Haiti .
“ Reconstruction ” industries from the occupying powers began raking in billions .
Ambassador Claude Boucher wanted Canadian firms to exploit Haiti's post - coup environment .
He , and acting - " Prime Minister " Latortue , spawned the Haitian - Canadian Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( HCCCI ) .
In an interview with Anthony Fenton , HCCCI 's first president , Quèbec high - school graduate Robert Tippenhauer , said Canada 's role in ousting Aristide and empowering the “ transitional ” government , entitled Canadian businesses to lucrative , “ post - conflict ” contracts .
Latortue , Tippenhauer and Boucher helped profit - hungry Canadian delegations scouring Haiti for contracts in road construction , telecommunications , energy , urban planning , waste disposal , agroindustry and manufacturing .
In 2005 , Haitian multimillionaire Réginald Boulos said Haiti " offers a lot of opportunities for foreign investors to be involved in privatization . "
And , he said , electricity , water and transportation were all " being audited for privatization . "
Haiti's Boulos - family empire includes a nefarious pharmaceutical company , supermarkets and right - wing media .
In 2005 , Canada flew Boulos , and other Haitian elite , to meet bankers and bureaucrats at the government 's Meech - Lake resort near Ottawa .
On the table were “ privatization ” and “ private sector provision of public services . ”
Knowing Haiti's masses opposed these policies , participants wanted them “ properly pushed " immediately .
Another Haitian millionaire , Andy Apaid , helped Boulos lead the virulently antiAristide , CIDA - funded Group of 184 .
Aristide 's government said Apaid was n't paying enough taxes .
Apaid also disliked paying his sweatshop employees and opposed Aristide 's doubling of the minimum wage .
Receiving less than a dollar a day , Apaid 's wage - slaves made millions for Canadian clothing importers , like Gildan .
In 2000 , Minister Pettigrew announced Gildan was a finalist for the government 's " Export Award " for " strengthen[ing ] local economies with new jobs . ”
Ironically , Gildan shifted 200 + Montreal jobs to Caribbean sweatshops .
In 2003 , International Cooperation Minister , Susan Whelan , gave Gildan the CIDA - funded “ Award for Excellence in Corporate Social and Ethical Responsibility . ”
In 2006 , Gildan received another Social - Responsibility prize at a gala attended by Quebec ’s Conservative - cum - Liberal premier , Jean Charest , and 1000 other business celebrities .
Gildan 's shares nearly quadrupled in value during the coup - regime period .
The Moral of the Story
Do n't believe the lies your government tells you when it goes to war , or helps overthrow another government .
Most Canadians have no idea that Canada was instrumental in overthrowing Haiti 's democratically - elected government in 2004 .
Some Canadian peace , human rights and development groups continue to spread government propaganda that presents Canada 's odious role in Haiti 's regime change as if it was a " humanitarian intervention " that promoted justice and democracy .
Such official Canadian myths hide the brutal atrocities of Haiti 's post - coup occupation behind the narrative facade of " peacekeeping , " " failed states " and the " right to protect . "
Because Canadian progressives have not successfully countered these myths about Haiti , the proud revolutionary people of that country have been forced to endure further humiliation , violence , injustice and exploitation .
It 's time we set the record straight .

June 24 , 2010 --
In the small Massachusetts town where the Mayflower first landed and puritanical Pilgrims penned the " compact " that would evolve into the U.S. Constitution , a tempest is brewing -- over condoms in the classroom .
Just this week , the school board of Provincetown , a seaside resort that sits on the tip of Cape Cod , voted unanimously for a sex education policy allowing all children -- elementary and high school -- to seek out a counselor and obtain condoms .
But according to Superintendent Beth Singer , that policy was " misinterpreted and misunderstood , " and today the world descended on the smallest school district in the state , asking why it was giving condoms to first graders .
And because school officials felt strongly that those who are sexually active should have protection , they had no " opt out " clause for parents .
When the national news media descended , some locals reacted : " This is ridiculous and absurd , " said one .
" It 's disgusting . "
" I think this should be a parent 's decision , " said Charlie Hanson .
" I think it is going a little too far , " said Constance Black .
School officials said they believe in abstinence and the policy was intended to encourage students who are having sex to protect themselves and their partners .
" We were never giving condoms to elementary school children , " said Singer .
" It 's for sexually active people and we do n't see that as relevant to elementary school . "
" You turn on the television and 24/ 7 there is sex , " she said .
" And it is possible to have a young teenager in the sixth grade .
So the school committee did n't want to eliminate anyone to having access for whom it was relevant . "
In fact , Provincetown 's elementary school -- all 85 students -- serves children in pre-K to grade 6 , but will soon admit toddlers as young as 15 months .
" Surprise , we are not giving them condoms , " said Singer , who said the backlash " is not over yet . "
After stories headlined " Condoms for Kids " hit the Internet , readers reacted : " Welcome to the socialist USA where the government knows best . "
Earlier today , Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick called Singer and weighed in , saying sex education programs should be " age appropriate , " and " parents ought to be involved . "
Singer said she has taken his advice and the board will " relook " over its policy .
" Most of the firestorm is outside our town , " she said .
" I have suggested that if this were Hoboken [ New Jersey ] , people would n't have reacted this way .
Provincetown is a certain kind of town . "
Provincetown , with a summer population that can swell as high as 100,000 on the Fourth of July , is the nation 's self - proclaimed " oldest art colony " and former stage to playwrights like to Eugene O'Neill and Tennessee Williams .
It has also been named the nation 's " best gay resort town " and a " number one destination " for same - sex weddings , largely during the summer when out - of - towners descend on the pristine beaches and rental homes .
This progressive community -- influenced by early Americans and later by generations of Portuguese fisherman -- is used to difference of opinions , according to Bob Sanborn , director of the Provincetown Tourist Board .
" Because of our tradition and freedom over many years with artists , writers and bohemians and later the LGBT ( lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ) community started flocking to town , it 's known for its being rich and diverse , " he said .
Everyone gets along and is always very accepting . "
Sanborn said he likes the way the condom policy " really focuses on education .
There is a high awareness factor and safe sex is valued here , " he said .
And some Provincetown residents are baffled by why they are getting all this attention for what they see as a comprehensive sex education program .
" I can't believe this is newsworthy , " said Pat Patrick , owner of Marine Specialties and father of an 8 - year - old .
" I honestly am surprised it 's an issue . "
Patrick , who is not related to the governor but whose wife Shannon sits on the school board , said most third graders would not even know enough to ask for a condom .
" If they do know enough to ask , maybe they should be talking to a counselor , " he said .
" I do n't like that students can't be discreet about this , " said Shannon .
" They have to go and ask for it , " she told the Provincetown Banner .
" I 'd rather them not have the conversation [ with counselors ] and have the condom than not have the condom . "
Dr. Ari Brown , an Austin , Texas , pediatrician , said she is not surprised some parents are " up in arms " that giving condoms will encourage sexual activity .
" I disagree , " said Brown , author of the parenting book , " Expecting 411 . "
" It will encourage safer sexual activity .
I do n't think the condoms will be offered up with crayons or construction paper on the school supplies list "
" Some kids are going to have sex , " she said .
" We 'd all like them to wait until they are mature , responsible , and in a monogamous and mutually loving relationship -- and the best we can do is to educate our kids in our own homes to make that a reality . "
As for Singer , who wrote Provincetown 's policy , she said she has " learned a lot " from what many locals say is a tempest in a teapot .
" It gave us an opportunity to relook at the policy with the eyes of a stranger and perhaps , as some in the community have suggested , clean it up , " she said .
Singer said they intend to make it clear advice given by counselors will be " age appropriate " and " inclusive of families . "
But the policy will stand , she said .
" We were n't expecting this , but it has given us the opportunity to tell what the real policy is , " said Singer .
" A student has to initiate this , seek out a nurse or social worker who is professionally trained , to have a conversation in order to get a condom , " said Singer .
" It can be a teaching opportunity .
You can go to a drugstore and buy a condom and not have that conversation . "
China ' leapfrogs US to become biggest energy user '
Published duration 20 July 2010
image caption China has experienced rapid economic growth in the last 20 years
China has overtaken the United States to become the world 's top energy consumer for the first time , a new report says .
Provisional figures from the International Energy Agency indicate that China 's energy demand has doubled in a decade .
The IEA said China had taken first place because it was hit less hard than the US by the global financial crisis .
China challenged the report 's findings , saying its figures were unreliable .
The US has been the biggest consumer of energy for more than 100 years .
But China 's rapid economic growth in the past two decades has pushed it into top spot , according to Tuesday 's report .
The surge in demand for energy in China was further fuelled by its rising population .
House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Henry A. Waxman ( D - Beverly Hills ) on Thursday assailed BP for a " series of reckless decisions " that led to the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon that killed 11 people and started the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history .
Waxman 's staff said in a report to committee members that BP made numerous decisions that " increased the risk of a well control problem , while neglecting additional safety precautions " before the Deepwater Horizon explosion .
" BP chose a well design that had only two barriers to prevent flow of dangerous gases instead of using a design that had multiple barriers ; BP ignored the advice of its contractor , Halliburton , and chose a cement sealing approach for the well that was predicted to fail ; BP failed to conduct a key test to evaluate the sufficiency of the cementing job ; BP failed to fully circulate well fluids to facilitate better cementing ; and BP did not install a key piece of equipment at the wellhead prior to the explosion , " the staff said in a report .
" All of these decisions saved time and money for BP , but increased risks . "
The report and Waxman 's comments came as his committee passed the " Blowout Prevention Act , " aimed at establishing new standards for redundancy , testing and third - party certification of the well - top apparatus that is supposed to shut off an unexpected surge of oil .
The bill also would require third - party certifications for safe well design and cementing , among other things .
" This bill intends to strike that delicate balance to be as aggressive as possible to prevent this from ever happening again but at the same time to allow reasonable development to occur , " said Texas Rep.
Joe Barton , the panel 's top Republican .
The report is available at the committee 's website .

Since the writing one of the commenters below wrote a script that will allow you to schedule your gmail messages without outlook or another mail program : https://code.google.com/p/gmail-delay-send/.
I have n’t tried it yet , but in looks promising !
The bad news is that Gmail does not support scheduling emails at the time of this posting .
The good news is that it does support IMAP , which allows you to access your Gmail account from a third - party email client .
So all you need to do is set up your Gmail account in your desktop client , such as Microsoft Outlook , Outlook Express or Thunderbird .
You can then use the delay send feature of your desktop email client to schedule the sending of a message in Gmail .
If you do n’t have a desktop email client , two of the three I mentioned above are free , so get set up on one of those first .
To schedule sending a Gmail message in Microsoft Outlook 2007 :
1. Create a new IMAP email account : Tools > Account Settings … >
New
2. Enter your Gmail address ( note : I am showing the detailed settings , however the wizard will work fine ) .
3 . Nothing special for outgoing server
4 . Port settings : I ’ve seen others quoted .
These work for me .
5 . Open a new email and click the Options tab :
6. Click on “ Delay Delivery ”
7 . Set the desired delivery time .
8. Compose and send the message .
That ’s it !

United States Supreme Court M C DONALD ET AL .
v. CITY OF CHICAGO , ILLINOIS , ET AL . ( 2010 ) No. 08-1521 Argued : March 2 , 2010 Decided : June 28 , 2010
Two years ago , in District of Columbia v. Heller , 554 U. S. ___ , this Court held that the Second Amendment protects the right to keep and bear arms for the purpose of self - defense and struck down a District of Columbia law that banned the possession of handguns in the home .
Chicago ( hereinafter City ) and the village of Oak Park , a Chicago suburb , have laws effectively banning handgun possession by almost all private citizens .
After Heller , petitioners filed this federal suit against the City , which was consolidated with two related actions , alleging that the City 's handgun ban has left them vulnerable to criminals .
They sought a declaration that the ban and several related City ordinances violate the Second and Fourteenth Amendments .
Rejecting petitioners ' argument that the ordinances are unconstitutional , the court noted that the Seventh Circuit previously had upheld the constitutionality of a handgun ban , that Heller had explicitly refrained from opining on whether the Second Amendment applied to the States , and that the court had a duty to follow established Circuit precedent .
The Seventh Circuit affirmed , relying on three 19th - century cases -- United States v. Cruikshank , 92 U. S. 542 , Presser v. Illinois , 116 U. S. 252 , and Miller v. Texas , 153 U. S. 535 -- which were decided in the wake of this Court 's interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment 's Privileges or Immunities Clause in the Slaughter - House Cases , 16 Wall .
36 .
Held :
The judgment is reversed , and the case is remanded .
567 F. 3d 856 , reversed and remanded .
Justice Alito delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I , II - A , II -B , II -D , III - A , and III - B , concluding that the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the Second Amendment right , recognized in Heller , to keep and bear arms for the purpose of self - defense .
Pp. 5 - 9 , 11- 19 , 19 -33 .
( a) Petitioners base their case on two submissions .
Primarily , they argue that the right to keep and bear arms is protected by the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and that the Slaughter - House Cases ' narrow interpretation of the Clause should now be rejected .
As a secondary argument , they contend that the Fourteenth Amendment 's Due Process Clause incorporates the Second Amendment right .
Chicago and Oak Park ( municipal respondents ) maintain that a right set out in the Bill of Rights applies to the States only when it is an indispensable attribute of any " ' civilized ' " legal system .
If it is possible to imagine a civilized country that does not recognize the right , municipal respondents assert , that right is not protected by due process .
And since there are civilized countries that ban or strictly regulate the private possession of handguns , they maintain that due process does not preclude such measures .
Pp. 4 - 5 .
( b) The Bill of Rights , including the Second Amendment , originally applied only to the Federal Government , not to the States , see , e.g. , Barron ex rel .
Tiernan v. Mayor of Baltimore , 7 Pet. 243 , 247 , but the constitutional Amendments adopted in the Civil War 's aftermath fundamentally altered the federal system .
Four years after the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment , this Court held in the Slaughter - House Cases , that the Privileges or Immunities Clause protects only those rights " which owe their existence to the Federal government , its National character , its Constitution , or its laws , " 16 Wall . , at 79 , and that the fundamental rights predating the creation of the Federal Government were not protected by the Clause , id. , at 76 .
Under this narrow reading , the Court held that the Privileges or Immunities Clause protects only very limited rights .
Id. , at 79 - 80 .
Subsequently , the Court held that the Second Amendment applies only to the Federal Government in Cruikshank , 92 U. S. 542 , Presser , 116 U. S. 252 , and Miller , 153 U. S. 535 , the decisions on which the Seventh Circuit relied in this case .
Pp. 5 - 9 .
( c) Whether the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms applies to the States is considered in light of the Court 's precedents applying the Bill of Rights ' protections to the States .
Pp. 11 -19 .
(1) In the late 19th century , the Court began to hold that the Due Process Clause prohibits the States from infringing Bill of Rights protections .
See , e.g. , Hurtado v. California , 110 U. S. 516 .
Five features of the approach taken during the ensuing era are noted .
First , the Court viewed the due process question as entirely separate from the question whether a right was a privilege or immunity of national citizenship .
See Twining v. New Jersey , 211 U. S. 78 , 99 .
Second , the Court explained that the only rights due process protected against state infringement were those " of such a nature that they are included in the conception of due process of law . "
Ibid .
Third , some cases during this era " can be seen as having asked ... if a civilized system could be imagined that would not accord the particular protection " asserted therein .
Duncan v. Louisiana , 391 U. S. 145 , 149 , n. 14 .
Fourth , the Court did not hesitate to hold that a Bill of Rights guarantee failed to meet the test for Due Process Clause protection , finding , e.g. , that freedom of speech and press qualified , Gitlow v. New York , 268 U. S. 652 , 666 ; Near v. Minnesota ex rel .
Olson , 283 U. S. 697 , but the grand jury indictment requirement did not , Hurtado , supra .
Finally , even when such a right was held to fall within the conception of due process , the protection or remedies afforded against state infringement sometimes differed from those provided against abridgment by the Federal Government .
Pp. 11-13 .
(2) Justice Black championed the alternative theory that §1 of the Fourteenth Amendment totally incorporated all of the Bill of Rights ' provisions , see , e.g. , Adamson v. California , 332 U. S. 46 , 71-72 ( Black , J. , dissenting ) , but the Court never has embraced that theory .
Pp. 13 -15 .
(3) The Court eventually moved in the direction advocated by Justice Black , by adopting a theory of selective incorporation by which the Due Process Clause incorporates particular rights contained in the first eight Amendments .
See , e.g. , Gideon v. Wainright , 372 U. S. 335 , 341 .
These decisions abandoned three of the characteristics of the earlier period .
The Court clarified that the governing standard is whether a particular Bill of Rights protection is fundamental to our Nation 's particular scheme of ordered liberty and system of justice .
Duncan , supra , at 149 , n. 14 .
The Court eventually held that almost all of the Bill of Rights ' guarantees met the requirements for protection under the Due Process Clause .
The Court also held that Bill of Rights protections must " all ... be enforced against the States under the Fourteenth Amendment according to the same standards that protect those personal rights against federal encroachment . "
Malloy v. Hogan , 378 U. S. 1 , 10 .
Under this approach , the Court overruled earlier decisions holding that particular Bill of Rights guarantees or remedies did not apply to the States .
See , e.g. , Gideon , supra , which overruled Betts v. Brady , 316 U. S. 455 . Pp. 15 -19 .
(d) The Fourteenth Amendment makes the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms fully applicable to the States .
Pp. 19-33 .
(1) The Court must decide whether that right is fundamental to the Nation 's scheme of ordered liberty , Duncan v. Louisiana , 391 U. S. 145 , 149 , or , as the Court has said in a related context , whether it is " deeply rooted in this Nation 's history and tradition , " Washington v. Glucksberg , 521 U. S. 702 , 721 .
Heller points unmistakably to the answer .
Self - defense is a basic right , recognized by many legal systems from ancient times to the present , and the Heller Court held that individual self - defense is " the central component " of the Second Amendment right .
554 U. S. , at ___ , ___.
Explaining that " the need for defense of self , family , and property is most acute " in the home , ibid. , the Court found that this right applies to handguns because they are " the most preferred firearm in the nation to ' keep ' and use for protection of one 's home and family , " id. , at ___ , ___-___ .
It thus concluded that citizens must be permitted " to use [ handguns ] for the core lawful purpose of self - defense . "
Id. , at ___ .
Heller also clarifies that this right is " deeply rooted in this Nation 's history and traditions , " Glucksberg , supra , at 721 .
Heller explored the right 's origins in English law and noted the esteem with which the right was regarded during the colonial era and at the time of the ratification of the Bill of Rights .
This is powerful evidence that the right was regarded as fundamental in the sense relevant here .
That understanding persisted in the years immediately following the Bill of Rights ' ratification and is confirmed by the state constitutions of that era , which protected the right to keep and bear arms .
Pp. 19 - 22 .
(2) A survey of the contemporaneous history also demonstrates clearly that the Fourteenth Amendment 's Framers and ratifiers counted the right to keep and bear arms among those fundamental rights necessary to the Nation 's system of ordered liberty .
Pp. 22-33 .
( i) By the 1850's , the fear that the National Government would disarm the universal militia had largely faded , but the right to keep and bear arms was highly valued for self - defense .
Abolitionist authors wrote in support of the right , and attempts to disarm " Free - Soilers " in " Bloody Kansas , " met with outrage that the constitutional right to keep and bear arms had been taken from the people .
After the Civil War , the Southern States engaged in systematic efforts to disarm and injure African Americans , see Heller , supra , at ___ .
These injustices prompted the 39th Congress to pass the Freedmen 's Bureau Act of 1866 and the Civil Rights
Act of 1866 to protect the right to keep and bear arms .
Congress , however , ultimately deemed these legislative remedies insufficient , and approved the Fourteenth Amendment .
Today , it is generally accepted that that Amendment was understood to provide a constitutional basis for protecting the rights set out in the Civil Rights Act.
See General Building Contractors Assn. , Inc. v. Pennsylvania , 458 U. S. 375 , 389 .
In Congressional debates on the proposed Amendment , its legislative proponents in the 39th Congress referred to the right to keep and bear arms as a fundamental right deserving of protection .
Evidence from the period immediately following the Amendment 's ratification confirms that that right was considered fundamental .
Pp. 22-31 .
( ii ) Despite all this evidence , municipal respondents argue that Members of Congress overwhelmingly viewed §1 of the Fourteenth Amendment as purely an antidiscrimination rule .
But while § 1 does contain an antidiscrimination rule , i.e. , the Equal Protection Clause , it can hardly be said that the section does no more than prohibit discrimination .
If what municipal respondents mean is that the Second Amendment should be singled out for special -- and specially unfavorable -- treatment , the Court rejects the suggestion .
The right to keep and bear arms must be regarded as a substantive guarantee , not a prohibition that could be ignored so long as the States legislated in an evenhanded manner .
Pp. 30 -33 .
Justice Alito , joined by The Chief Justice , Justice Scalia , and Justice Kennedy , concluded , in Parts II -C , IV , and V , that the Fourteenth Amendment 's Due Process Clause incorporates the Second Amendment right recognized in Heller .
Pp. 10 - 11 , 33 -44 .
( a) Petitioners argue that that the Second Amendment right is one of the " privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States . "
There is no need to reconsider the Court 's interpretation of the Privileges or Immunities Clause in the Slaughter - House Cases because , for many decades , the Court has analyzed the question whether particular rights are protected against state infringement under the Fourteenth Amendment 's Due Process Clause .
Pp. 10 - 11 .
( b) Municipal respondents ' remaining arguments are rejected because they are at war with Heller 's central holding .
In effect , they ask the Court to hold the right to keep and bear arms as subject to a different body of rules for incorporation than the other Bill of Rights guarantees .
Pp. 33 -40 .
( c) The dissents ' objections are addressed and rejected .
Pp. 41 - 44 .
Justice Thomas agreed that the Fourteenth Amendment makes the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms that was recognized in District of Columbia v. Heller , 554 U. S. ___ , fully applicable to the States .
However , he asserted , there is a path to this conclusion that is more straightforward and more faithful to the Second Amendment 's text and history .
The Court is correct in describing the Second Amendment right as " fundamental " to the American scheme of ordered liberty , Duncan v. Louisiana , 391 U. S. 145 , 149 , and " deeply rooted in this Nation 's history and traditions , " Washington v. Glucksberg , 521 U. S. 702 , 721 .
But the Fourteenth Amendment 's Due Process Clause , which speaks only to " process , " cannot impose the type of substantive restraint on state legislation that the Court asserts .
Rather , the right to keep and bear arms is enforceable against the States because it is a privilege of American citizenship recognized by §1 of the Fourteenth Amendment , which provides , inter alia : " No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States . "
In interpreting this language , it is important to recall that constitutional provisions are " ' written to be understood by the voters . ' " Heller , 554 U. S. , at ___ .
The objective of this inquiry is to discern what " ordinary citizens " at the time of the Fourteenth Amendment 's ratification would have understood that Amendment 's Privileges or Immunities Clause to mean .
Ibid .
A survey of contemporary legal authorities plainly shows that , at that time , the ratifying public understood the Clause to protect constitutionally enumerated rights , including the right to keep and bear arms .

OTIS M c DONALD , et al . , PETITIONERS v. CITY OF CHICAGO , ILLINOIS , et al .
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit
[ June 28 , 2010 ]
Justice Alito announced the judgment of the Court and delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I , II - A , II -B , II -D , III - A , and III - B , in which The Chief Justice , Justice Scalia , Justice Kennedy , and Justice Thomas join , and an opinion with respect to Parts II -C , IV , and V , in which The Chief Justice , Justice Scalia , and Justice Kennedy join .
Two years ago , in District of Columbia v. Heller , 554 U. S. ___ ( 2008 ) , we held that the Second Amendment protects the right to keep and bear arms for the purpose of self - defense , and we struck down a District of Columbia law that banned the possession of handguns in the home .
The city of Chicago ( City ) and the village of Oak Park , a Chicago suburb , have laws that are similar to the District of Columbia 's , but Chicago and Oak Park argue that their laws are constitutional because the Second Amendment has no application to the States .
We have previously held that most of the provisions of the Bill of Rights apply with full force to both the Federal Government and the States .
Applying the standard that is well established in our case law , we hold that the Second Amendment right is fully applicable to the States .
I
Otis McDonald , Adam Orlov , Colleen Lawson , and David Lawson ( Chicago petitioners ) are Chicago residents who would like to keep handguns in their homes for self - defense but are prohibited from doing so by Chicago 's firearms laws .
A City ordinance provides that " [ n ] o person shall ... possess ... any firearm unless such person is the holder of a valid registration certificate for such firearm . "
Chicago , Ill. , Municipal Code §8-20-040 ( a ) ( 2009 ) .
The Code then prohibits registration of most handguns , thus effectively banning handgun possession by almost all private citizens who reside in the City .
§8-20-050 ( c ) .
Like Chicago , Oak Park makes it " unlawful for any person to possess ... any firearm , " a term that includes " pistols , revolvers , guns and small arms ... commonly known as handguns . "
Oak Park , Ill. , Municipal Code §§27-2-1 ( 2007 ) , 27 - 1 - 1 ( 2009 ) .
Chicago enacted its handgun ban to protect its residents " from the loss of property and injury or death from firearms . "
See Chicago , Ill. , Journal of Proceedings of the City Council , p. 10049 ( Mar. 19 , 1982 ) .
The Chicago petitioners and their amici , however , argue that the handgun ban has left them vulnerable to criminals .
Chicago Police Department statistics , we are told , reveal that the City 's handgun murder rate has actually increased since the ban was enacted1 and that Chicago residents now face one of the highest murder rates in the country and rates of other violent crimes that exceed the average in comparable cities .
2
Several of the Chicago petitioners have been the targets of threats and violence .
For instance , Otis McDonald , who is in his late seventies , lives in a high - crime neighborhood .
He is a community activist involved with alternative policing strategies , and his efforts to improve his neighborhood have subjected him to violent threats from drug dealers .
App. 16 -17 ; Brief for State Firearm Associations as Amici Curiae 20 - 21 ; Brief for State of Texas et al. as Amici Curiae 7 - 8 . Colleen Lawson is a Chicago resident whose home has been targeted by burglars .
" In Mrs. Lawson 's judgment , possessing a handgun in Chicago would decrease her chances of suffering serious injury or death should she ever be threatened again in her home .
" 3 McDonald , Lawson , and the other Chicago petitioners own handguns that they store outside of the city limits , but they would like to keep their handguns in their homes for protection .
See App. 16-19 , 43 -44 ( McDonald ) , 20 - 24 ( C. Lawson ) , 19 , 36 ( Orlov ) , 20 - 21 , 40 ( D. Lawson ) .
After our decision in Heller , the Chicago petitioners and two groups4 filed suit against the City in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois .
They sought a declaration that the handgun ban and several related Chicago ordinances violate the Second and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution .
Another action challenging the Oak Park law was filed in the same District Court by the National Rifle Association ( NRA ) and two Oak Park residents .
In addition , the NRA and others filed a third action challenging the Chicago ordinances .
All three cases were assigned to the same District Judge .
The District Court rejected plaintiffs ' argument that the Chicago and Oak Park laws are unconstitutional .
See App. 83 -84 ; NRA , Inc. v. Oak Park , 617 F. Supp. 2d 752 , 754 ( ND Ill. 2008 ) .
The court noted that the Seventh Circuit had " squarely upheld the constitutionality of a ban on handguns a quarter century ago , " id. , at 753 ( citing Quilici v. Morton Grove , 695 F. 2d 261 ( CA7 1982 ) ) , and that Heller had explicitly refrained from " opin[ing ] on the subject of incorporation vel non of the Second Amendment , " NRA , 617 F. Supp. 2d , at 754 .
The court observed that a district judge has a " duty to follow established precedent in the Court of Appeals to which he or she is beholden , even though the logic of more recent caselaw may point in a different direction . "
Id. , at 753 .
The Seventh Circuit affirmed , relying on three 19th - century cases -- United States v. Cruikshank , 92 U. S. 542 ( 1876 ) , Presser v. Illinois , 116 U. S. 252 ( 1886 ) , and Miller v. Texas , 153 U. S. 535 ( 1894 ) -- that were decided in the wake of this Court 's interpretation of the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment in the Slaughter - House Cases , 16 Wall. 36 ( 1873 ) .
The Seventh Circuit described the rationale of those cases as " defunct " and recognized that they did not consider the question whether the Fourteenth Amendment 's Due Process Clause incorporates the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms .
NRA , Inc. v. Chicago , 567 F. 3d 856 , 857 , 858 ( 2009 ) .
Nevertheless , the Seventh Circuit observed that it was obligated to follow Supreme Court precedents that have " direct application , " and it declined to predict how the Second Amendment would fare under this Court 's modern " selective incorporation " approach .
Id. , at 857-858 ( internal quotation marks omitted ) .
We granted certiorari .

A
Petitioners argue that the Chicago and Oak Park laws violate the right to keep and bear arms for two reasons .
Petitioners ' primary submission is that this right is among the " privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States " and that the narrow interpretation of the Privileges or Immunities Clause adopted in the Slaughter - House Cases , supra , should now be rejected .
As a secondary argument , petitioners contend that the Fourteenth Amendment 's Due Process Clause " incorporates " the Second Amendment right .
Chicago and Oak Park ( municipal respondents ) maintain that a right set out in the Bill of Rights applies to the States only if that right is an indispensable attribute of any " ' civilized ' " legal system .
Brief for Municipal Respondents 9 .
If it is possible to imagine a civilized country that does not recognize the right , the municipal respondents tell us , then that right is not protected by due process .
Ibid .
And since there are civilized countries that ban or strictly regulate the private possession of handguns , the municipal respondents maintain that due process does not preclude such measures .
Id. , at 21 - 23 .
In light of the parties ' far - reaching arguments , we begin by recounting this Court 's analysis over the years of the relationship between the provisions of the Bill of Rights and the States .
B
The Bill of Rights , including the Second Amendment , originally applied only to the Federal Government .
In Barron ex rel .
Tiernan v. Mayor of Baltimore , 7 Pet. 243 ( 1833 ) , the Court , in an opinion by Chief Justice Marshall , explained that this question was " of great importance " but " not of much difficulty . "
Id. , at 247 .
In less than four pages , the Court firmly rejected the proposition that the first eight Amendments operate as limitations on the States , holding that they apply only to the Federal Government .
See also Lessee of Livingston v. Moore , 7 Pet. 469 , 551-552 ( 1833 ) ( " [ I ]t is now settled that those amendments [ in the Bill of Rights ] do not extend to the states " ) .
The constitutional Amendments adopted in the aftermath of the Civil War fundamentally altered our country 's federal system .
The provision at issue in this case , §1 of the Fourteenth Amendment , provides , among other things , that a State may not abridge " the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States " or deprive " any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law . "
Four years after the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment , this Court was asked to interpret the Amendment 's reference to " the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States . "
The Slaughter - House Cases , supra , involved challenges to a Louisiana law permitting the creation of a state - sanctioned monopoly on the butchering of animals within the city of New Orleans .
Justice Samuel Miller 's opinion for the Court concluded that the Privileges or Immunities Clause protects only those rights " which owe their existence to the Federal government , its National character , its Constitution , or its laws . "
Id. , at 79 .
The Court held that other fundamental rights -- rights that predated the creation of the Federal Government and that " the State governments were created to establish and secure " -- were not protected by the Clause .
Id. , at 76 .
In drawing a sharp distinction between the rights of federal and state citizenship , the Court relied on two principal arguments .
First , the Court emphasized that the Fourteenth Amendment 's Privileges or Immunities Clause spoke of " the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States , " and the Court contrasted this phrasing with the wording in the first sentence of the Fourteenth Amendment and in the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV , both of which refer to state citizenship .
5 ( Emphasis added . )
Second , the Court stated that a contrary reading would " radically chang[e ] the whole theory of the relations of the State and Federal governments to each other and of both these governments to the people , " and the Court refused to conclude that such a change had been made " in the absence of language which expresses such a purpose too clearly to admit of doubt . "
Id. , at 78 .
Finding the phrase " privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States " lacking by this high standard , the Court reasoned that the phrase must mean something more limited .
Under the Court 's narrow reading , the Privileges or Immunities Clause protects such things as the right
" to come to the seat of government to assert any claim [ a citizen ] may have upon that government , to transact any business he may have with it , to seek its protection , to share its offices , to engage in administering its functions ... [ and to ] become a citizen of any State of the Union by a bonâ fide residence therein , with the same rights as other citizens of that State . "
Id. , at 79 - 80 ( internal quotation marks omitted ) .
Finding no constitutional protection against state intrusion of the kind envisioned by the Louisiana statute , the Court upheld the statute .
Four Justices dissented .
Justice Field , joined by Chief Justice Chase and Justices Swayne and Bradley , criticized the majority for reducing the Fourteenth Amendment 's Privileges or Immunities Clause to " a vain and idle enactment , which accomplished nothing , and most unnecessarily excited Congress and the people on its passage . "
Id. , at 96 ; see also id . , at 104 .
Justice Field opined that the Privileges or Immunities Clause protects rights that are " in their nature ... fundamental , " including the right of every man to pursue his profession without the imposition of unequal or discriminatory restrictions .
Id. , at 96 -97 .
Justice Bradley 's dissent observed that " we are not bound to resort to implication ... to find an authoritative declaration of some of the most important privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States .
It is in the Constitution itself . "
Id. , at 118 .
Justice Bradley would have construed the Privileges or Immunities Clause to include those rights enumerated in the Constitution as well as some unenumerated rights .
Id. , at 119 .
Justice Swayne described the majority 's narrow reading of the Privileges or Immunities Clause as " turn[ing ] ... what was meant for bread into a stone . "
Id. , at 129 ( dissenting opinion ) .
Today , many legal scholars dispute the correctness of the narrow Slaughter - House interpretation .
See , e.g. , Saenz v. Roe , 526 U. S. 489 , 522 , n. 1 , 527 ( 1999 ) ( Thomas , J. , dissenting ) ( scholars of the Fourteenth Amendment agree " that the Clause does not mean what the Court said it meant in 1873 " ) ; Amar , Substance and Method in the Year 2000 , 28 Pepperdine L. Rev. 601 , 631 , n. 178 ( 2001 ) ( " Virtually no serious modern scholar - - left , right , and center -- thinks that this [ interpretation ] is a plausible reading of the Amendment " ) ; Brief for Constitutional Law Professors as Amici Curiae 33 ( claiming an " overwhelming consensus among leading constitutional scholars " that the opinion is " egregiously wrong " ) ; C. Black , A New Birth of Freedom 74-75 ( 1997 ) .
Three years after the decision in the Slaughter - House Cases , the Court decided Cruikshank , the first of the three 19th - century cases on which the Seventh Circuit relied .
92 U. S. 542 .
In that case , the Court reviewed convictions stemming from the infamous Colfax Massacre in Louisiana on Easter Sunday 1873 .
Dozens of blacks , many unarmed , were slaughtered by a rival band of armed white men.6
Cruikshank himself allegedly marched unarmed African - American prisoners through the streets and then had them summarily executed .
7
Ninety - seven men were indicted for participating in the massacre , but only nine went to trial .
Six of the nine were acquitted of all charges ; the remaining three were acquitted of murder but convicted under the Enforcement Act of 1870 , 16 Stat.
140 , for banding and conspiring together to deprive their victims of various constitutional rights , including the right to bear arms .
8
The Court reversed all of the convictions , including those relating to the deprivation of the victims ' right to bear arms .
Cruikshank , 92 U. S. , at 553 , 559 .
The Court wrote that the right of bearing arms for a lawful purpose " is not a right granted by the Constitution " and is not " in any manner dependent upon that instrument for its existence . "
Id. , at 553 .
" The second amendment , " the Court continued , " declares that it shall not be infringed ; but this ... means no more than that it shall not be infringed by Congress . "
Ibid .
" Our later decisions in Presser v. Illinois , 116 U. S. 252 , 265 ( 1886 ) , and Miller v. Texas , 153 U. S. 535 , 538 ( 1894 ) , reaffirmed that the Second Amendment applies only to the Federal Government . "
Heller , 554 U. S. , at ___ , n. 23 ( slip op. , at 48 , n. 23 ) .
C
As previously noted , the Seventh Circuit concluded that Cruikshank , Presser , and Miller doomed petitioners ' claims at the Court of Appeals level .
Petitioners argue , however , that we should overrule those decisions and hold that the right to keep and bear arms is one of the " privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States . "
In petitioners ' view , the Privileges or Immunities Clause protects all of the rights set out in the Bill of Rights , as well as some others , see Brief for Petitioners 10 , 14 , 15 - 21 , but petitioners are unable to identify the Clause 's full scope , Tr. of Oral Arg. 5 - 6 , 8 - 11 .
Nor is there any consensus on that question among the scholars who agree that the Slaughter - House Cases ' interpretation is flawed .
See Saenz , supra , at 522 , n. 1 ( Thomas , J. , dissenting ) .
We see no need to reconsider that interpretation here .
For many decades , the question of the rights protected by the Fourteenth Amendment against state infringement has been analyzed under the Due Process Clause of that Amendment and not under the Privileges or Immunities Clause .
We therefore decline to disturb the Slaughter - House holding .
At the same time , however , this Court 's decisions in Cruikshank , Presser , and Miller do not preclude us from considering whether the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment makes the Second Amendment right binding on the States .
See Heller , 554 U. S. , at ___ , n. 23 ( slip op . , at 48 , n. 23 ) .
None of those cases " engage[d ] in the sort of Fourteenth Amendment inquiry required by our later cases . "
Ibid .
As explained more fully below , Cruikshank , Presser , and Miller all preceded the era in which the Court began the process of " selective incorporation " under the Due Process Clause , and we have never previously addressed the question whether the right to keep and bear arms applies to the States under that theory .
Indeed , Cruikshank has not prevented us from holding that other rights that were at issue in that case are binding on the States through the Due Process Clause .
In Cruikshank , the Court held that the general " right of the people peaceably to assemble for lawful purposes , " which is protected by the First Amendment , applied only against the Federal Government and not against the States .
See 92 U. S. , at 551 -552 .
Nonetheless , over 60 years later the Court held that the right of peaceful assembly was a " fundamental righ[t ] ... safeguarded by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment . "
De Jonge v. Oregon , 299 U. S. 353 , 364 ( 1937 ) .
We follow the same path here and thus consider whether the right to keep and bear arms applies to the States under the Due Process Clause .
D
1
In the late 19th century , the Court began to consider whether the Due Process Clause prohibits the States from infringing rights set out in the Bill of Rights .
See Hurtado v. California , 110 U. S. 516 ( 1884 ) ( due process does not require grand jury indictment ) ; Chicago , B. & Q. R. Co. v. Chicago , 166 U. S. 226 ( 1897 ) ( due process prohibits States from taking of private property for public use without just compensation ) .
Five features of the approach taken during the ensuing era should be noted .
First , the Court viewed the due process question as entirely separate from the question whether a right was a privilege or immunity of national citizenship .
See Twining v. New Jersey , 211 U. S. 78 , 99 ( 1908 ) .
Second , the Court explained that the only rights protected against state infringement by the Due Process Clause were those rights " of such a nature that they are included in the conception of due process of law . "
Ibid .
See also , e.g. , Adamson v. California , 332 U. S. 46 ( 1947 ) ; Betts v. Brady , 316 U. S. 455 ( 1942 ) ; Palko v. Connecticut , 302 U. S. 319 ( 1937 ) ; Grosjean v. American Press Co. , 297 U. S. 233 ( 1936 ) ; Powell v. Alabama , 287 U. S. 45 ( 1932 ) .
While it was " possible that some of the personal rights safeguarded by the first eight Amendments against National action [ might ] also be safeguarded against state action , " the Court stated , this was " not because those rights are enumerated in the first eight Amendments . "
Twining , supra , at 99 .
The Court used different formulations in describing the boundaries of due process .
For example , in Twining , the Court referred to " immutable principles of justice which inhere in the very idea of free government which no member of the Union may disregard . "
211 U. S. , at 102 ( internal quotation marks omitted ) .
In Snyder v. Massachusetts , 291 U. S. 97 , 105 ( 1934 ) , the Court spoke of rights that are " so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental . "
And in Palko , the Court famously said that due process protects those rights that are " the very essence of a scheme of ordered liberty " and essential to " a fair and enlightened system of justice . "
302 U. S. , at 325 .
Third , in some cases decided during this era the Court " can be seen as having asked , when inquiring into whether some particular procedural safeguard was required of a State , if a civilized system could be imagined that would not accord the particular protection . "
Duncan v. Louisiana , 391 U. S. 145 , 149 , n. 14 ( 1968 ) .
Thus , in holding that due process prohibits a State from taking private property without just compensation , the Court described the right as " a principle of natural equity , recognized by all temperate and civilized governments , from a deep and universal sense of its justice . "
Chicago , B. & Q. R. Co. , supra , at 238 .
Similarly , the Court found that due process did not provide a right against compelled incrimination in part because this right " has no place in the jurisprudence of civilized and free countries outside the domain of the common law . "
Twining , supra , at 113 .
Fourth , the Court during this era was not hesitant to hold that a right set out in the Bill of Rights failed to meet the test for inclusion within the protection of the Due Process Clause .
The Court found that some such rights qualified .
See , e.g. , Gitlow v. New York , 268 U. S. 652 , 666 ( 1925 ) ( freedom of speech and press ) ; Near v. Minnesota ex rel .
Olson , 283 U. S. 697 ( 1931 ) ( same ) ; Powell , supra ( assistance of counsel in capital cases ) ;
De Jonge , supra ( freedom of assembly ) ; Cantwell v. Connecticut , 310 U. S. 296 ( 1940 ) ( free exercise of religion ) .
But others did not .
See , e.g. , Hurtado , supra ( grand jury indictment requirement ) ;
Twining , supra ( privilege against self - incrimination ) .
Finally , even when a right set out in the Bill of Rights was held to fall within the conception of due process , the protection or remedies afforded against state infringement sometimes differed from the protection or remedies provided against abridgment by the Federal Government .
To give one example , in Betts the Court held that , although the Sixth Amendment required the appointment of counsel in all federal criminal cases in which the defendant was unable to retain an attorney , the Due Process Clause required appointment of counsel in state criminal proceedings only where " want of counsel in [ the ] particular case ... result[ed ] in a conviction lacking in ... fundamental fairness . "
316 U. S. , at 473 .
Similarly , in Wolf v. Colorado , 338 U. S. 25 ( 1949 ) , the Court held that the " core of the Fourth Amendment " was implicit in the concept of ordered liberty and thus " enforceable against the States through the Due Process Clause " but that the exclusionary rule , which applied in federal cases , did not apply to the States .
Id. , at 27 - 28 , 33 .
2
An alternative theory regarding the relationship between the Bill of Rights and §1 of the Fourteenth Amendment was championed by Justice Black .
This theory held that §1 of the Fourteenth Amendment totally incorporated all of the provisions of the Bill of Rights .
See , e.g. , Adamson , supra , at 71 - 72 ( Black , J. , dissenting ) ; Duncan , supra , at 166 ( Black , J. , concurring ) .
As Justice Black noted , the chief congressional proponents of the Fourteenth Amendment espoused the view that the Amendment made the Bill of Rights applicable to the States and , in so doing , overruled this Court 's decision in Barron .9 Adamson , 332 U. S. , at 72 ( dissenting opinion ) .
10 Nonetheless , the Court never has embraced Justice Black 's " total incorporation " theory .
3
While Justice Black 's theory was never adopted , the Court eventually moved in that direction by initiating what has been called a process of " selective incorporation , " i.e. , the Court began to hold that the Due Process Clause fully incorporates particular rights contained in the first eight Amendments .
See , e.g. , Gideon v. Wainright , 372 U. S. 335 , 341 ( 1963 ) ; Malloy v. Hogan , 378 U. S. 1 , 5 - 6 ( 1964 ) ; Pointer v. Texas , 380 U. S. 400 , 403-404 ( 1965 ) ; Washington v. Texas , 388 U. S. 14 , 18 ( 1967 ) ; Duncan , 391 U. S. , at 147- 148 ; Benton v. Maryland , 395 U. S. 784 , 794 ( 1969 ) .
The decisions during this time abandoned three of the previously noted characteristics of the earlier period .
11 The Court made it clear that the governing standard is not whether any " civilized system [ can ] be imagined that would not accord the particular protection . "
Duncan , 391 U. S. , at 149 , n. 14 .
Instead , the Court inquired whether a particular Bill of Rights guarantee is fundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty and system of justice .
Id. , at 149 , and n. 14 ; see also id. , at 148 ( referring to those " fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at the base of all our civil and political institutions " ( emphasis added ; internal quotation marks omitted ) ) .
The Court also shed any reluctance to hold that rights guaranteed by the Bill of Rights met the requirements for protection under the Due Process Clause .
The Court eventually incorporated almost all of the provisions of the Bill of Rights .
12 Only a handful of the Bill of Rights protections remain unincorporated .13
Finally , the Court abandoned " the notion that the Fourteenth Amendment applies to the States only a watered - down , subjective version of the individual guarantees of the Bill of Rights , " stating that it would be " incongruous " to apply different standards " depending on whether the claim was asserted in a state or federal court . "
Malloy , 378 U. S. , at 10 - 11 ( internal quotation marks omitted ) .
Instead , the Court decisively held that incorporated Bill of Rights protections " are all to be enforced against the States under the Fourteenth Amendment according to the same standards that protect those personal rights against federal encroachment . "
Id. , at 10 ; see also Mapp v. Ohio , 367 U. S. 643 , 655-656 ( 1961 ) ; Ker v. California , 374 U. S. 23 , 33 -34 ( 1963 ) ; Aguilar v. Texas , 378 U. S. 108 , 110 ( 1964 ) ; Pointer , 380 U. S. , at 406 ; Duncan , supra , at 149 , 157-158 ; Benton , 395 U. S. , at 794-795 ; Wallace v. Jaffree , 472 U. S. 38 , 48-49 ( 1985 ) .14
Employing this approach , the Court overruled earlier decisions in which it had held that particular Bill of Rights guarantees or remedies did not apply to the States .
See , e.g. , Mapp , supra ( overruling in part Wolf , 338 U. S. 25 ) ; Gideon , 372 U. S. 335 ( overruling Betts , 316 U. S. 455 ) ; Malloy , supra ( overruling Adamson , 332 U. S. 46 , and Twining , 211 U. S. 78 ) ; Benton , supra , at 794 ( overruling Palko , 302 U. S. 319 ) .
III
With this framework in mind , we now turn directly to the question whether the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms is incorporated in the concept of due process .
In answering that question , as just explained , we must decide whether the right to keep and bear arms is fundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty , Duncan , 391 U. S. , at 149 , or as we have said in a related context , whether this right is " deeply rooted in this Nation 's history and tradition , " Washington v. Glucksberg , 521 U. S. 702 , 721 ( 1997 ) ( internal quotation marks omitted ) .
A
Our decision in Heller points unmistakably to the answer .
Self - defense is a basic right , recognized by many legal systems from ancient times to the present day ,15 and in Heller , we held that individual self - defense is " the central component " of the Second Amendment right .
554 U. S. , at ___ ( slip op. , at 26 ) ; see also id . , at ___ ( slip op. , at 56 ) ( stating that the " inherent right of self - defense has been central to the Second Amendment right " ) .
Explaining that " the need for defense of self , family , and property is most acute " in the home , ibid. , we found that this right applies to handguns because they are " the most preferred firearm in the nation to ' keep ' and use for protection of one 's home and family , " id. , at ___ ( slip op. , at 57 ) ( some internal quotation marks omitted ) ; see also id . , at ___ ( slip op. , at 56 ) ( noting that handguns are " overwhelmingly chosen by American society for [ the ] lawful purpose " of self - defense ) ; id. , at ___ ( slip op. , at 57 ) ( " [ T ]he American people have considered the handgun to be the quintessential self - defense weapon " ) .
Thus , we concluded , citizens must be permitted " to use [ handguns ] for the core lawful purpose of self - defense . "
Id. , at ___ ( slip op. , at 58 ) .
Heller makes it clear that this right is " deeply rooted in this Nation 's history and tradition . "
Glucksberg , supra , at 721 ( internal quotation marks omitted ) .
Heller explored the right 's origins , noting that the 1689 English Bill of Rights explicitly protected a right to keep arms for self - defense , 554 U. S. , at ___-___ ( slip op. , at 19 - 20 ) , and that by 1765 , Blackstone was able to assert that the right to keep and bear arms was " one of the fundamental rights of Englishmen , " id. , at ___ ( slip op. , at 20 ) .
Blackstone 's assessment was shared by the American colonists .
As we noted in Heller , King George III 's attempt to disarm the colonists in the 1760's and 1770's " provoked polemical reactions by Americans invoking their rights as Englishmen to keep arms .
" 16 Id. , at ___ ( slip op. , at 21 ) ; see also L. Levy , Origins of the Bill of Rights 137 - 143 ( 1999 ) ( hereinafter Levy ) .
The right to keep and bear arms was considered no less fundamental by those who drafted and ratified the Bill of Rights .
" During the 1788 ratification debates , the fear that the federal government would disarm the people in order to impose rule through a standing army or select militia was pervasive in Antifederalist rhetoric . "
Heller , supra , at ___ ( slip op. , at 25 ) ( citing Letters from the Federal Farmer III ( Oct. 10 , 1787 ) , in 2 The Complete Anti-Federalist 234 , 242 ( H. Storing ed. 1981 ) ) ; see also Federal Farmer : An Additional Number of Letters to the Republican , Letter XVIII ( Jan. 25 , 1788 ) , in 17 Documentary History of the Ratification of the Constitution 360 , 362-363 ( J. Kaminski & G. Saladino eds. 1995 ) ; S. Halbrook , The Founders ' Second Amendment 171-278 ( 2008 ) .
Federalists responded , not by arguing that the right was insufficiently important to warrant protection but by contending that the right was adequately protected by the Constitution 's assignment of only limited powers to the Federal Government .
Heller , supra , at ___ ( slip op. , at 25 - 26 ) ; cf. The Federalist No. 46 , p. 296 ( C. Rossiter ed. 1961 ) ( J. Madison ) .
Thus , Antifederalists and Federalists alike agreed that the right to bear arms was fundamental to the newly formed system of government .
See Levy 143- 149 ; J. Malcolm , To Keep and Bear Arms : The Origins of an Anglo - American Right 155 - 164 ( 1994 ) .
But those who were fearful that the new Federal Government would infringe traditional rights such as the right to keep and bear arms insisted on the adoption of the Bill of Rights as a condition for ratification of the Constitution .
See 1 J. Elliot , The Debates in the Several State Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution 327-331 ( 2d ed. 1854 ) ; 3 id. , at 657-661 ; 4 id. , at 242-246 , 248-249 ; see also Levy 26 - 34 ; A. Kelly & W. Harbison , The American Constitution : Its Origins and Development 110 , 118 ( 7th ed. 1991 ) .
This is surely powerful evidence that the right was regarded as fundamental in the sense relevant here .
This understanding persisted in the years immediately following the ratification of the Bill of Rights .
In addition to the four States that had adopted Second Amendment analogues before ratification , nine more States adopted state constitutional provisions protecting an individual right to keep and bear arms between 1789 and 1820 .
Heller , supra , at ___ ( slip op. , at 27-30 ) .
Founding - era legal commentators confirmed the importance of the right to early Americans .
St. George Tucker , for example , described the right to keep and bear arms as " the true palladium of liberty " and explained that prohibitions on the right would place liberty " on the brink of destruction . "
1 Blackstone 's Commentaries , Editor 's App. 300 ( S. Tucker ed. 1803 ) ; see also W. Rawle , A View of the Constitution of the United States of America , 125 - 126 ( 2d ed. 1829 ) ( reprint 2009 ) ; 3 J. Story , Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States § 1890 , p. 746 ( 1833 )
( " The right of the citizens to keep and bear arms has justly been considered , as the palladium of the liberties of a republic ; since it offers a strong moral check against the usurpation and arbitrary power of rulers ; and will generally , even if these are successful in the first instance , enable the people to resist and triumph over them " ) .

By the 1850's , the perceived threat that had prompted the inclusion of the Second Amendment in the Bill of Rights -- the fear that the National Government would disarm the universal militia -- had largely faded as a popular concern , but the right to keep and bear arms was highly valued for purposes of self - defense .
See M. Doubler , Civilian in Peace , Soldier in War 87-90 ( 2003 ) ; Amar , Bill of Rights 258-259 .
Abolitionist authors wrote in support of the right .
See L. Spooner , The Unconstitutionality of Slavery 66 ( 1860 ) ( reprint 1965 ) ; J. Tiffany , A Treatise on the Unconstitutionality of American Slavery 117-118 ( 1849 ) ( reprint 1969 ) .
And when attempts were made to disarm " Free - Soilers " in " Bloody Kansas , " Senator Charles Sumner , who later played a leading role in the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment , proclaimed that " [ n] ever was [ the rifle ] more needed in just self - defense than now in Kansas . "
The Crime Against Kansas : The Apologies for the Crime : The True Remedy , Speech of Hon. Charles Sumner in the Senate of the United States 64 - 65 ( 1856 ) .
Indeed , the 1856 Republican Party Platform protested that in Kansas the constitutional rights of the people had been " fraudulently and violently taken from them " and the " right of the people to keep and bear arms " had been " infringed . "
National Party Platforms 1840 - 1972 , p. 27 ( 5th ed. 1973 ) .17
After the Civil War , many of the over 180,000 African Americans who served in the Union Army returned to the States of the old Confederacy , where systematic efforts were made to disarm them and other blacks .
See Heller , 554 U. S. , at ___ ( slip op. , at 42 ) ; E. Foner , Reconstruction : America 's Unfinished Revolution 1863 - 1877 , p. 8 ( 1988 ) ( hereinafter Foner ) .
The laws of some States formally prohibited African Americans from possessing firearms .
For example , a Mississippi law provided that " no freedman , free negro or mulatto , not in the military service of the United States government , and not licensed so to do by the board of police of his or her county , shall keep or carry fire - arms of any kind , or any ammunition , dirk or bowie knife . "

Throughout the South , armed parties , often consisting of ex-Confederate soldiers serving in the state militias , forcibly took firearms from newly freed slaves .
In the first session of the 39th Congress , Senator Wilson told his colleagues : " In Mississippi rebel State forces , men who were in the rebel armies , are traversing the State , visiting the freedmen , disarming them , perpetrating murders and outrages upon them ; and the same things are done in other sections of the country .

The Report of the Joint Committee on Reconstruction -- which was widely reprinted in the press and distributed by Members of the 39th Congress to their constituents shortly after Congress approved the Fourteenth Amendment19 - - contained numerous examples of such abuses .
See , e.g. , Joint Committee on Reconstruction , H. R. Rep. No. 30 , 39th Cong. , 1st Sess. , pt. 2 , pp. 219 , 229 , 272 , pt. 3 , pp. 46 , 140 , pt. 4 , pp. 49 -50 ( 1866 ) ; see also S. Exec. Doc. No. 2 , 39th Cong. , 1st Sess. , 23 - 24 , 26 , 36 ( 1865 ) .
In one town , the " marshal [ took ] all arms from returned colored soldiers , and [ was ] very prompt in shooting the blacks whenever an opportunity occur[red ] . "
H. R. Exec. Doc. No. 70 , at 238 ( internal quotation marks omitted ) .
As Senator Wilson put it during the debate on a failed proposal to disband Southern militias : " There is one unbroken chain of testimony from all people that are loyal to this country , that the greatest outrages are perpetrated by armed men who go up and down the country searching houses , disarming people , committing outrages of every kind and description . "
39th Cong. Globe 915 ( 1866 ) .20
Union Army commanders took steps to secure the right of all citizens to keep and bear arms , 21 but the 39th Congress concluded that legislative action was necessary .
Its efforts to safeguard the right to keep and bear arms demonstrate that the right was still recognized to be fundamental .
The most explicit evidence of Congress ' aim appears in § 14 of the Freedmen 's Bureau Act of 1866 , which provided that " the right ... to have full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings concerning personal liberty , personal security , and the acquisition , enjoyment , and disposition of estate , real and personal , including the constitutional right to bear arms , shall be secured to and enjoyed by all the citizens ... without respect to race or color , or previous condition of slavery . "
14 Stat. 176-177 ( emphasis added ) .
22 Section 14 thus explicitly guaranteed that " all the citizens , " black and white , would have " the constitutional right to bear arms . "
The Civil Rights Act of 1866 , 14 Stat. 27 , which was considered at the same time as the Freedmen 's Bureau Act , similarly sought to protect the right of all citizens to keep and bear arms .
23 Section 1 of the Civil Rights
Act guaranteed the " full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of person and property , as is enjoyed by white citizens . "
Ibid .
This language was virtually identical to language in § 14 of the Freedmen 's Bureau Act , 14 Stat.
176-177 ( " the right ... to have full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings concerning personal liberty , personal security , and the acquisition , enjoyment , and disposition of estate , real and personal " ) .
And as noted , the latter provision went on to explain that one of the " laws and proceedings concerning personal liberty , personal security , and the acquisition , enjoyment , and disposition of estate , real and personal " was " the constitutional right to bear arms . "
Ibid .
Representative Bingham believed that the Civil Rights
Act protected the same rights as enumerated in the Freedmen 's Bureau bill , which of course explicitly mentioned the right to keep and bear arms .
39th Cong. Globe 1292 .
The unavoidable conclusion is that the Civil Rights Act , like the Freedmen 's Bureau Act , aimed to protect " the constitutional right to bear arms " and not simply to prohibit discrimination .
See also Amar , Bill of Rights 264-265 ( noting that one of the " core purposes of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and of the Fourteenth Amendment was to redress the grievances " of freedmen who had been stripped of their arms and to " affirm the full and equal right of every citizen to self - defense " ) .
Congress , however , ultimately deemed these legislative remedies insufficient .
Southern resistance , Presidential vetoes , and this Court 's pre-Civil - War precedent persuaded Congress that a constitutional amendment was necessary to provide full protection for the rights of blacks .
24 Today , it is generally accepted that the Fourteenth Amendment was understood to provide a constitutional basis for protecting the rights set out in the Civil Rights Act of 1866 .
See General Building Contractors Assn. , Inc. v. Pennsylvania , 458 U. S. 375 , 389 ( 1982 ) ; see also Amar , Bill of Rights 187 ; Calabresi , Two Cheers for Professor Balkin 's Originalism , 103 Nw. U. L. Rev. 663 , 669-670 ( 2009 ) .
In debating the Fourteenth Amendment , the 39th Congress referred to the right to keep and bear arms as a fundamental right deserving of protection .
Senator Samuel Pomeroy described three " indispensable " " safeguards of liberty under our form of Government . "
39th Cong. Globe 1182 .
One of these , he said , was the right to keep and bear arms :
" Every man ... should have the right to bear arms for the defense of himself and family and his homestead .
And if the cabin door of the freedman is broken open and the intruder enters for purposes as vile as were known to slavery , then should a well - loaded musket be in the hand of the occupant to send the polluted wretch to another world , where his wretchedness will forever remain complete . "
Ibid .
Even those who thought the Fourteenth Amendment unnecessary believed that blacks , as citizens , " have equal right to protection , and to keep and bear arms for self - defense . "
Id. , at 1073 ( Sen. James Nye ) ; see also Foner 258-259.25
Evidence from the period immediately following the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment only confirms that the right to keep and bear arms was considered fundamental .
In an 1868 speech addressing the disarmament of freedmen , Representative Stevens emphasized the necessity of the right : " Disarm a community and you rob them of the means of defending life .
Take away their weapons of defense and you take away the inalienable right of defending liberty . "
" The fourteenth amendment , now so happily adopted , settles the whole question . "
Cong . Globe , 40th Cong. , 2d Sess. , 1967 .
And in debating the Civil Rights Act of 1871 , Congress routinely referred to the right to keep and bear arms and decried the continued disarmament of blacks in the South .
See Halbrook , Freedmen 120 - 131 .
Finally , legal commentators from the period emphasized the fundamental nature of the right .
See , e.g. , T. Farrar , Manual of the Constitution of the United States of America § 118 , p. 145 ( 1867 ) ( reprint 1993 ) ; J. Pomeroy , An Introduction to the Constitutional Law of the United States § 239 , pp. 152-153 ( 3d ed. 1875 ) .
The right to keep and bear arms was also widely protected by state constitutions at the time when the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified .
In 1868 , 22 of the 37 States in the Union had state constitutional provisions explicitly protecting the right to keep and bear arms .
See Calabresi & Agudo , Individual Rights Under State Constitutions when the Fourteenth Amendment was Ratified in 1868 : What Rights Are Deeply Rooted in American History and Tradition ?
87 Texas L. Rev. 7 , 50 ( 2008 ) .26 Quite a few of these state constitutional guarantees , moreover , explicitly protected the right to keep and bear arms as an individual right to self - defense .
See Ala. Const. , Art. I , §28 ( 1868 ) ; Conn. Const. , Art. I , §17 ( 1818 ) ; Ky. Const. , Art. XIII , § 25 ( 1850 ) ; Mich. Const. , Art. XVIII , §7 ( 1850 ) ; Miss.
Const. , Art. I , §15 ( 1868 ) ; Mo. Const. , Art. I , §8 ( 1865 ) ; Tex. Const. , Art. I , §13 ( 1869 ) ; see also Mont. Const. , Art. III , § 13 ( 1889 ) ; Wash .
Const. , Art. I , § 24 ( 1889 ) ; Wyo. Const. , Art. I , § 24 ( 1889 ) ; see also State v. McAdams , 714 P. 2d 1236 , 1238 ( Wyo. 1986 ) .
What is more , state constitutions adopted during the Reconstruction era by former Confederate States included a right to keep and bear arms .
See , e.g. , Ark. Const. , Art. I , §5 ( 1868 ) ; Miss.
Const. , Art. I , §15 ( 1868 ) ; Tex. Const. , Art. I , §13 ( 1869 ) .
A clear majority of the States in 1868 , therefore , recognized the right to keep and bear arms as being among the foundational rights necessary to our system of Government .
27
In sum , it is clear that the Framers and ratifiers of the Fourteenth Amendment counted the right to keep and bear arms among those fundamental rights necessary to our system of ordered liberty .

Despite all this evidence , municipal respondents contend that Congress , in the years immediately following the Civil War , merely sought to outlaw " discriminatory measures taken against freedmen , which it addressed by adopting a non-discrimination principle " and that even an outright ban on the possession of firearms was regarded as acceptable , " so long as it was not done in a discriminatory manner . "
Brief for Municipal Respondents 7 .
They argue that Members of Congress overwhelmingly viewed §1 of the Fourteenth Amendment " as an antidiscrimination rule , " and they cite statements to the effect that the section would outlaw discriminatory measures .
Id. , at 64 .
This argument is implausible .
First , while §1 of the Fourteenth Amendment contains " an antidiscrimination rule , " namely , the Equal Protection Clause , municipal respondents can hardly mean that § 1 does no more than prohibit discrimination .
If that were so , then the First Amendment , as applied to the States , would not prohibit nondiscriminatory abridgments of the rights to freedom of speech or freedom of religion ; the Fourth Amendment , as applied to the States , would not prohibit all unreasonable searches and seizures but only discriminatory searches and seizures -- and so on .
We assume that this is not municipal respondents ' view , so what they must mean is that the Second Amendment should be singled out for special -- and specially unfavorable -- treatment .
We reject that suggestion .
Second , municipal respondents ' argument ignores the clear terms of the Freedmen 's Bureau Act of 1866 , which acknowledged the existence of the right to bear arms .
If that law had used language such as " the equal benefit of laws concerning the bearing of arms , " it would be possible to interpret it as simply a prohibition of racial discrimination .
But § 14 speaks of and protects " the constitutional right to bear arms , " an unmistakable reference to the right protected by the Second Amendment .
And it protects the " full and equal benefit " of this right in the States .
14 Stat. 176-177 .
It would have been nonsensical for Congress to guarantee the full and equal benefit of a constitutional right that does not exist .
Third , if the 39th Congress had outlawed only those laws that discriminate on the basis of race or previous condition of servitude , African Americans in the South would likely have remained vulnerable to attack by many of their worst abusers : the state militia and state peace officers .
In the years immediately following the Civil War , a law banning the possession of guns by all private citizens would have been nondiscriminatory only in the formal sense .
Any such law - - like the Chicago and Oak Park ordinances challenged here -- presumably would have permitted the possession of guns by those acting under the authority of the State and would thus have left firearms in the hands of the militia and local peace officers .
And as the Report of the Joint Committee on Reconstruction revealed , see supra , at 24 - 25 , those groups were widely involved in harassing blacks in the South .
Fourth , municipal respondents ' purely antidiscrimination theory of the Fourteenth Amendment disregards the plight of whites in the South who opposed the Black Codes .
If the 39th Congress and the ratifying public had simply prohibited racial discrimination with respect to the bearing of arms , opponents of the Black Codes would have been left without the means of self - defense -- as had abolitionists in Kansas in the 1850's .
Fifth , the 39th Congress ' response to proposals to disband and disarm the Southern militias is instructive .
Despite recognizing and deploring the abuses of these militias , the 39th Congress balked at a proposal to disarm them .
See 39th Cong. Globe 914 ; Halbrook , Freedmen , supra , 20 - 21 .
Disarmament , it was argued , would violate the members ' right to bear arms , and it was ultimately decided to disband the militias but not to disarm their members .
See Act of Mar. 2 , 1867 , §6 , 14 Stat.
485 , 487 ; Halbrook , Freedmen 68- 69 ; Cramer 858-861 .
It can not be doubted that the right to bear arms was regarded as a substantive guarantee , not a prohibition that could be ignored so long as the States legislated in an evenhanded manner .
IV
Municipal respondents ' remaining arguments are at war with our central holding in Heller : that the Second Amendment protects a personal right to keep and bear arms for lawful purposes , most notably for self - defense within the home .
Municipal respondents , in effect , ask us to treat the right recognized in Heller as a second - class right , subject to an entirely different body of rules than the other Bill of Rights guarantees that we have held to be incorporated into the Due Process Clause .
Municipal respondents ' main argument is nothing less than a plea to disregard 50 years of incorporation precedent and return ( presumably for this case only ) to a bygone era .
Municipal respondents submit that the Due Process Clause protects only those rights " ' recognized by all temperate and civilized governments , from a deep and universal sense of [ their ] justice . ' " Brief for Municipal Respondents 9 ( quoting Chicago , B. & Q. R. Co. , 166 U. S. , at 238 ) .
According to municipal respondents , if it is possible to imagine any civilized legal system that does not recognize a particular right , then the Due Process Clause does not make that right binding on the States .
Brief for Municipal Respondents 9 .
Therefore , the municipal respondents continue , because such countries as England , Canada , Australia , Japan , Denmark , Finland , Luxembourg , and New Zealand either ban or severely limit handgun ownership , it must follow that no right to possess such weapons is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment .
Id. , at 21 - 23 .
This line of argument is , of course , inconsistent with the long - established standard we apply in incorporation cases .
See Duncan , 391 U. S. , at 149 , and n. 14 .
And the present - day implications of municipal respondents ' argument are stunning .
For example , many of the rights that our Bill of Rights provides for persons accused of criminal offenses are virtually unique to this country .
28 If our understanding of the right to a jury trial , the right against self - incrimination , and the right to counsel were necessary attributes of any civilized country , it would follow that the United States is the only civilized Nation in the world .
Municipal respondents attempt to salvage their position by suggesting that their argument applies only to substantive as opposed to procedural rights .
Brief for Municipal Respondents 10 , n. 3 .
But even in this trimmed form , municipal respondents ' argument flies in the face of more than a half - century of precedent .
For example , in Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing , 330 U. S. 1 , 8 ( 1947 ) , the Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment .
Yet several of the countries that municipal respondents recognize as civilized have established state churches .
29
If we were to adopt municipal respondents ' theory , all of this Court 's Establishment Clause precedents involving actions taken by state and local governments would go by the boards .
Municipal respondents maintain that the Second Amendment differs from all of the other provisions of the Bill of Rights because it concerns the right to possess a deadly implement and thus has implications for public safety .
Brief for Municipal Respondents 11 .
And they note that there is intense disagreement on the question whether the private possession of guns in the home increases or decreases gun deaths and injuries .
Id. , at 11 , 13 - 17 .
The right to keep and bear arms , however , is not the only constitutional right that has controversial public safety implications .
All of the constitutional provisions that impose restrictions on law enforcement and on the prosecution of crimes fall into the same category .
See , e.g. , Hudson v. Michigan , 547 U. S. 586 , 591 ( 2006 )
( " The exclusionary rule generates ' substantial social costs , ' United States v. Leon , 468 U. S. 897 , 907 ( 1984 ) , which sometimes include setting the guilty free and the dangerous at large " ) ; Barker v. Wingo , 407 U. S. 514 , 522 ( 1972 ) ( reflecting on the serious consequences of dismissal for a speedy trial violation , which means " a defendant who may be guilty of a serious crime will go free " ) ; Miranda v. Arizona , 384 U. S. 436 , 517 ( 1966 ) ( Harlan , J. , dissenting ) ; id. , at 542 ( White , J. , dissenting ) ( objecting that the Court 's rule " [ i ] n some unknown number of cases ... will return a killer , a rapist or other criminal to the streets ... to repeat his crime " ) ; Mapp , 367 U. S. , at 659 .
Municipal respondents cite no case in which we have refrained from holding that a provision of the Bill of Rights is binding on the States on the ground that the right at issue has disputed public safety implications .
We likewise reject municipal respondents ' argument that we should depart from our established incorporation methodology on the ground that making the Second Amendment binding on the States and their subdivisions is inconsistent with principles of federalism and will stifle experimentation .
Municipal respondents point out -- quite correctly -- that conditions and problems differ from locality to locality and that citizens in different jurisdictions have divergent views on the issue of gun control .
Municipal respondents therefore urge us to allow state and local governments to enact any gun control law that they deem to be reasonable , including a complete ban on the possession of handguns in the home for self - defense .
Brief for Municipal Respondents 18 - 20 , 23 .
There is nothing new in the argument that , in order to respect federalism and allow useful state experimentation , a federal constitutional right should not be fully binding on the States .
This argument was made repeatedly and eloquently by Members of this Court who rejected the concept of incorporation and urged retention of the two - track approach to incorporation .
Throughout the era of " selective incorporation , " Justice Harlan in particular , invoking the values of federalism and state experimentation , fought a determined rearguard action to preserve the two - track approach .
See , e.g. , Roth v. United States , 354 U. S. 476 , 500-503 ( 1957 ) ( Harlan , J. , concurring in result in part and dissenting in part ) ; Mapp , supra , at 678- 680 ( Harlan , J. , dissenting ) ; Gideon , 372 U. S. , at 352 ( Harlan , J. , concurring ) ; Malloy , 378 U. S. , at 14 - 33 ( Harlan , J. , dissenting ) ; Pointer , 380 U. S. , at 408-409 ( Harlan , J. , concurring in result ) ; Washington , 388 U. S. , at 23 - 24 ( Harlan , J. , concurring in result ) ; Duncan , 391 U. S. , at 171- 193 ( Harlan , J. , dissenting ) ; Benton , 395 U. S. , at 808-809 ( Harlan , J. , dissenting ) ; Williams v. Florida , 399 U. S. 78 , 117 ( 1970 ) ( Harlan , J. , dissenting in part and concurring in result in part ) .
Time and again , however , those pleas failed .
Unless we turn back the clock or adopt a special incorporation test applicable only to the Second Amendment , municipal respondents ' argument must be rejected .
Under our precedents , if a Bill of Rights guarantee is fundamental from an American perspective , then , unless stare decisis counsels otherwise,30 that guarantee is fully binding on the States and thus limits ( but by no means eliminates ) their ability to devise solutions to social problems that suit local needs and values .
As noted by the 38 States that have appeared in this case as amici supporting petitioners , " [ s ] tate and local experimentation with reasonable firearms regulations will continue under the Second Amendment . "
Brief for State of Texas et al. as Amici Curiae 23 .
Municipal respondents and their amici complain that incorporation of the Second Amendment right will lead to extensive and costly litigation , but this argument applies with even greater force to constitutional rights and remedies that have already been held to be binding on the States .
Consider the exclusionary rule .
Although the exclusionary rule " is not an individual right , " Herring v. United States , 555 U. S. ___ ( 2009 ) ( slip op . , at 5 ) , but a " judicially created rule , " id. , at ___ ( slip op. , at 4 ) , this Court made the rule applicable to the States .
See Mapp , supra , at 660 .
The exclusionary rule is said to result in " tens of thousands of contested suppression motions each year . "
Stuntz , The Virtues and Vices of the Exclusionary Rule , 20 Harv. J. Law & Pub .
Pol'y , 443 , 444 ( 1997 ) .
Municipal respondents assert that , although most state constitutions protect firearms rights , state courts have held that these rights are subject to " interest - balancing " and have sustained a variety of restrictions .
Brief for Municipal Respondents 23 - 31 .
In Heller , however , we expressly rejected the argument that the scope of the Second Amendment right should be determined by judicial interest balancing , 554 U. S. , at ___-___ ( slip op. , at 62-63 ) , and this Court decades ago abandoned " the notion that the Fourteenth Amendment applies to the States only a watered - down , subjective version of the individual guarantees of the Bill of Rights , " Malloy , supra , at 10 - 11 ( internal quotation marks omitted ) .
As evidence that the Fourteenth Amendment has not historically been understood to restrict the authority of the States to regulate firearms , municipal respondents and supporting amici cite a variety of state and local firearms laws that courts have upheld .
But what is most striking about their research is the paucity of precedent sustaining bans comparable to those at issue here and in Heller .
Municipal respondents cite precisely one case ( from the late 20th century ) in which such a ban was sustained .
See Brief for Municipal Respondents 26 - 27 ( citing Kalodimos v. Morton Grove , 103 Ill. 2d 483 , 470 N. E. 2d 266 ( 1984 ) ) ; see also Reply Brief for Respondents NRA et al. 23 , n. 7 ( asserting that no other court has ever upheld a complete ban on the possession of handguns ) .
It is important to keep in mind that Heller , while striking down a law that prohibited the possession of handguns in the home , recognized that the right to keep and bear arms is not " a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose . "
554 U. S. , at ___ ( slip op. , at 54 ) .
We made it clear in Heller that our holding did not cast doubt on such longstanding regulatory measures as " prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill , " " laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings , or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms . "
Id. , at ___-___ ( slip op. , at 54 - 55 ) .
We repeat those assurances here .
Despite municipal respondents ' doomsday proclamations , incorporation does not imperil every law regulating firearms .
Municipal respondents argue , finally , that the right to keep and bear arms is unique among the rights set out in the first eight Amendments " because the reason for codifying the Second Amendment ( to protect the militia ) differs from the purpose ( primarily , to use firearms to engage in self - defense ) that is claimed to make the right implicit in the concept of ordered liberty . "
Brief for Municipal Respondents 36 - 37 .
Municipal respondents suggest that the Second Amendment right differs from the rights heretofore incorporated because the latter were " valued for [ their ] own sake . "
Id. , at 33 .
But we have never previously suggested that incorporation of a right turns on whether it has intrinsic as opposed to instrumental value , and quite a few of the rights previously held to be incorporated -- for example the right to counsel and the right to confront and subpoena witnesses -- are clearly instrumental by any measure .
Moreover , this contention repackages one of the chief arguments that we rejected in Heller , i.e. , that the scope of the Second Amendment right is defined by the immediate threat that led to the inclusion of that right in the Bill of Rights .
In Heller , we recognized that the codification of this right was prompted by fear that the Federal Government would disarm and thus disable the militias , but we rejected the suggestion that the right was valued only as a means of preserving the militias .
554 U. S. , at ___ ( slip op. , at 26 ) .
On the contrary , we stressed that the right was also valued because the possession of firearms was thought to be essential for self - defense .
As we put it , self - defense was " the central component of the right itself . "

We turn , finally , to the two dissenting opinions .
Justice Stevens ' eloquent opinion covers ground already addressed , and therefore little need be added in response .
Justice Stevens would " ' ground the prohibitions against state action squarely on due process , without intermediate reliance on any of the first eight Amendments . ' " Post , at 8 ( quoting Malloy , 378 U. S. , at 24 ( Harlan , J. , dissenting ) ) .
The question presented in this case , in his view , " is whether the particular right asserted by petitioners applies to the States because of the Fourteenth Amendment itself , standing on its own bottom . "
Post , at 27 .
He would hold that " [t ] he rights protected against state infringement by the Fourteenth Amendment 's Due Process Clause need not be identical in shape or scope to the rights protected against Federal Government infringement by the various provisions of the Bill of Rights . "
Post , at 9 .
As we have explained , the Court , for the past half - century , has moved away from the two - track approach .
If we were now to accept Justice Stevens ' theory across the board , decades of decisions would be undermined .
We assume that this is not what is proposed .
What is urged instead , it appears , is that this theory be revived solely for the individual right that Heller recognized , over vigorous dissents .
The relationship between the Bill of Rights ' guarantees and the States must be governed by a single , neutral principle .
It is far too late to exhume what Justice Brennan , writing for the Court 46 years ago , derided as " the notion that the Fourteenth Amendment applies to the States only a watered - down , subjective version of the individual guarantees of the Bill of Rights . "
Malloy , supra , at 10 - 11 ( internal quotation marks omitted ) .
B
Justice Breyer 's dissent makes several points to which we briefly respond .
To begin , while there is certainly room for disagreement about Heller 's analysis of the history of the right to keep and bear arms , nothing written since Heller persuades us to reopen the question there decided .
Few other questions of original meaning have been as thoroughly explored .
Justice Breyer ' s conclusion that the Fourteenth Amendment does not incorporate the right to keep and bear arms appears to rest primarily on four factors :
First , " there is no popular consensus " that the right is fundamental , post , at 9 ; second , the right does not protect minorities or persons neglected by those holding political power , post , at 10 ; third , incorporation of the Second Amendment right would " amount to a significant incursion on a traditional and important area of state concern , altering the constitutional relationship between the States and the Federal Government " and preventing local variations , post , at 11 ; and fourth , determining the scope of the Second Amendment right in cases involving state and local laws will force judges to answer difficult empirical questions regarding matters that are outside their area of expertise , post , at 11 - 16 .
Even if we believed that these factors were relevant to the incorporation inquiry , none of these factors undermines the case for incorporation of the right to keep and bear arms for self - defense .
First , we have never held that a provision of the Bill of Rights applies to the States only if there is a " popular consensus " that the right is fundamental , and we see no basis for such a rule .
But in this case , as it turns out , there is evidence of such a consensus .
An amicus brief submitted by 58 Members of the Senate and 251 Members of the House of Representatives urges us to hold that the right to keep and bear arms is fundamental .
See Brief for Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison et al. as Amici Curiae 4 .
Another brief submitted by 38 States takes the same position .
Brief for State of Texas et al. as Amici Curiae 6 .
Second , petitioners and many others who live in high - crime areas dispute the proposition that the Second Amendment right does not protect minorities and those lacking political clout .
The plight of Chicagoans living in high - crime areas was recently highlighted when two Illinois legislators representing Chicago districts called on the Governor to deploy the Illinois National Guard to patrol the City 's streets .
31
The legislators noted that the number of Chicago homicide victims during the current year equaled the number of American soldiers killed during that same period in Afghanistan and Iraq and that 80 % of the Chicago victims were black .
32 Amici supporting incorporation of the right to keep and bear arms contend that the right is especially important for women and members of other groups that may be especially vulnerable to violent crime .33
If , as petitioners believe , their safety and the safety of other law - abiding members of the community would be enhanced by the possession of handguns in the home for self - defense , then the Second Amendment right protects the rights of minorities and other residents of high - crime areas whose needs are not being met by elected public officials .
Third , Justice Breyer is correct that incorporation of the Second Amendment right will to some extent limit the legislative freedom of the States , but this is always true when a Bill of Rights provision is incorporated .
Incorporation always restricts experimentation and local variations , but that has not stopped the Court from incorporating virtually every other provision of the Bill of Rights .
" [ T ] he enshrinement of constitutional rights necessarily takes certain policy choices off the table . "
Heller , 554 U. S. , at __ ( slip op. , at 64 ) .
This conclusion is no more remarkable with respect to the Second Amendment than it is with respect to all the other limitations on state power found in the Constitution .
Finally , Justice Breyer is incorrect that incorporation will require judges to assess the costs and benefits of firearms restrictions and thus to make difficult empirical judgments in an area in which they lack expertise .
As we have noted , while his opinion in Heller recommended an interest - balancing test , the Court specifically rejected that suggestion .
See supra , at 38 - 39 .
" The very enumeration of the right takes out of the hands of government -- even the Third Branch of Government -- the power to decide on a case - by - case basis whether the right is really worth insisting upon . "
Heller , supra , at ___ ( slip op. , at 62-63 ) .
* * *
In Heller , we held that the Second Amendment protects the right to possess a handgun in the home for the purpose of self - defense .
Unless considerations of stare decisis counsel otherwise , a provision of the Bill of Rights that protects a right that is fundamental from an American perspective applies equally to the Federal Government and the States .
See Duncan , 391 U. S. , at 149 , and n. 14 .
We therefore hold that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the Second Amendment right recognized in Heller .
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed , and the case is remanded for further proceedings .
It is so ordered .

[ June 28 , 2010 ]
Justice Scalia , concurring .
I join the Court 's opinion .
Despite my misgivings about Substantive Due Process as an original matter , I have acquiesced in the Court 's incorporation of certain guarantees in the Bill of Rights " because it is both long established and narrowly limited . "
Albright v. Oliver , 510 U. S. 266 , 275 ( 1994 ) ( Scalia , J. , concurring ) .
This case does not require me to reconsider that view , since straightforward application of settled doctrine suffices to decide it .
I write separately only to respond to some aspects of Justice Stevens ' dissent .
Not that aspect which disagrees with the majority 's application of our precedents to this case , which is fully covered by the Court 's opinion .
But much of what Justice Stevens writes is a broad condemnation of the theory of interpretation which underlies the Court 's opinion , a theory that makes the traditions of our people paramount .
He proposes a different theory , which he claims is more " cautiou[s ] " and respectful of proper limits on the judicial role .
Post , at 57 .
It is that claim I wish to address .

A
After stressing the substantive dimension of what he has renamed the " liberty clause , " post , at 4 - 7,1 Justice Stevens proceeds to urge readoption of the theory of incorporation articulated in Palko v. Connecticut , 302 U. S. 319 , 325 ( 1937 ) , see post , at 14 - 20 .
But in fact he does not favor application of that theory at all .
For whether Palko requires only that " a fair and enlightened system of justice would be impossible without " the right sought to be incorporated , 302 U. S. , at 325 , or requires in addition that the right be rooted in the " traditions and conscience of our people , " ibid .
( internal quotation marks omitted ) , many of the rights Justice Stevens thinks are incorporated could not pass muster under either test : abortion , post , at 7 ( citing Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey , 505 U. S. 833 , 847 ( 1992 ) ) ; homosexual sodomy , post , at 16 ( citing Lawrence v. Texas , 539 U. S. 558 , 572 ( 2003 ) ) ; the right to have excluded from criminal trials evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment , post , at 18 ( citing Mapp v. Ohio , 367 U. S. 643 , 650 , 655-657 ( 1961 ) ) ; and the right to teach one 's children foreign languages , post , at 7 ( citing Meyer v. Nebraska , 262 U. S. 390 , 399-403 ( 1923 ) ) , among others .
That Justice Stevens is not applying any version of Palko is clear from comparing , on the one hand , the rights he believes are covered , with , on the other hand , his conclusion that the right to keep and bear arms is not covered .
Rights that pass his test include not just those " relating to marriage , procreation , contraception , family relationships , and child rearing and education , " but also rights against " [ g] overnment action that shocks the conscience , pointlessly infringes settled expectations , trespasses into sensitive private realms or life choices without adequate justification , [ or ] perpetrates gross injustice . "
Post , at 23 ( internal quotation marks omitted ) .
Not all such rights are in , however , since only " some fundamental aspects of personhood , dignity , and the like " are protected , post , at 24 ( emphasis added ) .
Exactly what is covered is not clear .
But whatever else is in , he knows that the right to keep and bear arms is out , despite its being as " deeply rooted in this Nation 's history and tradition , " Washington v. Glucksberg , 521 U. S. 702 , 721 ( 1997 ) ( internal quotation marks omitted ) , as a right can be , see District of Columbia v. Heller , 554 U. S. ___ , ___-___ , ___-___ , ___-___ ( 2008 ) ( slip op . , at 20 - 21 , 26 -30 , 41 - 44 ) .
I can find no other explanation for such certitude except that Justice Stevens , despite his forswearing of " personal and private notions , " post , at 21 ( internal quotation marks omitted ) , deeply believes it should be out .
The subjective nature of Justice Stevens ' standard is also apparent from his claim that it is the courts ' prerogative -- indeed their duty -- to update the Due Process Clause so that it encompasses new freedoms the Framers were too narrow - minded to imagine , post , at 19 - 20 , and n. 21 .
Courts , he proclaims , must " do justice to [ the Clause 's ] urgent call and its open texture " by exercising the " interpretive discretion the latter embodies . "
Post , at 21 .
( Why the people are not up to the task of deciding what new rights to protect , even though it is they who are authorized to make changes , see U. S. Const. , Art. V , is never explained .
2 ) And it would be " judicial abdication " for a judge to " tur [ n ] his back " on his task of determining what the Fourteenth Amendment covers by " outsourc[ing ] " the job to " historical sentiment , " post , at 20 -- that is , by being guided by what the American people throughout our history have thought .
It is only we judges , exercising our " own reasoned judgment , " post , at 15 , who can be entrusted with deciding the Due Process Clause 's scope -- which rights serve the Amendment 's " central values , " post , at 23 -- which basically means picking the rights we want to protect and discarding those we do not .
B
Justice Stevens resists this description , insisting that his approach provides plenty of " guideposts " and " constraints " to keep courts from " injecting excessive subjectivity " into the process .
3 Post , at 21 .
Plenty indeed -- and that alone is a problem .
The ability of omnidirectional guideposts to constrain is inversely proportional to their number .
But even individually , each lodestar or limitation he lists either is incapable of restraining judicial whimsy or cannot be squared with the precedents he seeks to preserve .
He begins with a brief nod to history , post , at 21 , but as he has just made clear , he thinks historical inquiry unavailing , post , at 19 - 20 .
Moreover , trusting the meaning of the Due Process Clause to what has historically been protected is circular , see post , at 19 , since that would mean no new rights could get in .
Justice Stevens moves on to the " most basic " constraint on subjectivity his theory offers : that he would " esche[w ] attempts to provide any all - purpose , top - down , totalizing theory of ' liberty . ' " Post , at 22 .
The notion that the absence of a coherent theory of the Due Process Clause will somehow curtail judicial caprice is at war with reason .
Indeterminacy means opportunity for courts to impose whatever rule they like ; it is the problem , not the solution .
The idea that interpretive pluralism would reduce courts ' ability to impose their will on the ignorant masses is not merely naïve , but absurd .
If there are no right answers , there are no wrong answers either .
Justice Stevens also argues that requiring courts to show " respect for the democratic process " should serve as a constraint .
Post , at 23 .
That is true , but Justice Stevens would have them show respect in an extraordinary manner .
In his view , if a right " is already being given careful consideration in , and subjected to ongoing calibration by , the States , judicial enforcement may not be appropriate . "
Ibid .
In other words , a right , such as the right to keep and bear arms , that has long been recognized but on which the States are considering restrictions , apparently deserves less protection , while a privilege the political branches ( instruments of the democratic process ) have withheld entirely and continue to withhold , deserves more .
That topsy - turvy approach conveniently accomplishes the objective of ensuring that the rights this Court held protected in Casey , Lawrence , and other such cases fit the theory -- but at the cost of insulting rather than respecting the democratic process .
The next constraint Justice Stevens suggests is harder to evaluate .
He describes as " an important tool for guiding judicial discretion " " sensitivity to the interaction between the intrinsic aspects of liberty and the practical realities of contemporary society . "
Post , at 24 .
I cannot say whether that sensitivity will really guide judges because I have no idea what it is .
Is it some sixth sense instilled in judges when they ascend to the bench ?
Or does it mean judges are more constrained when they agonize about the cosmic conflict between liberty and its potentially harmful consequences ?
Attempting to give the concept more precision , Justice Stevens explains that " sensitivity is an aspect of a deeper principle : the need to approach our work with humility and caution . "
Ibid .
Both traits are undeniably admirable , though what relation they bear to sensitivity is a mystery .
But it makes no difference , for the first case Justice Stevens cites in support , see ibid. , Casey , 505 U. S. , at 849 , dispels any illusion that he has a meaningful form of judicial modesty in mind .
Justice Stevens offers no examples to illustrate the next constraint : stare decisis , post , at 25 .
But his view of it is surely not very confining , since he holds out as a " canonical " exemplar of the proper approach , see post , at 16 , 54 , Lawrence , which overruled a case decided a mere 17 years earlier , Bowers v. Hardwick , 478 U. S. 186 ( 1986 ) , see 539 U. S. , at 578 ( it " was not correct when it was decided , and it is not correct today " ) .
Moreover , Justice Stevens would apply that constraint unevenly :
He apparently approves those Warren Court cases that adopted jot - for - jot incorporation of procedural protections for criminal defendants , post , at 11 , but would abandon those Warren Court rulings that undercut his approach to substantive rights , on the basis that we have " cut back " on cases from that era before , post , at 12 .
Justice Stevens also relies on the requirement of a " careful description of the asserted fundamental liberty interest " to limit judicial discretion .
Post , at 25 ( internal quotation marks omitted ) .
I certainly agree with that requirement , see Reno v. Flores , 507 U. S. 292 , 302 ( 1993 ) , though some cases Justice Stevens approves have not applied it seriously , see , e.g. , Lawrence , supra , at 562 ( " The instant case involves liberty of the person both in its spatial and in its more transcendent dimensions " ) .
But if the " careful description " requirement is used in the manner we have hitherto employed , then the enterprise of determining the Due Process Clause 's " conceptual core , " post , at 23 , is a waste of time .
In the cases he cites we sought a careful , specific description of the right at issue in order to determine whether that right , thus narrowly defined , was fundamental .
See , e.g. , Glucksberg , 521 U. S. , at 722-728 ; Reno , supra , at 302-306 ; Collins v. Harker Heights , 503 U. S. 115 , 125-129 ( 1992 ) ; Cruzan v. Director , Mo. Dept. of Health , 497 U. S. 261 , 269-279 ( 1990 ) ; see also Vacco v. Quill , 521 U. S. 793 , 801-808 ( 1997 ) .
The threshold step of defining the asserted right with precision is entirely unnecessary , however , if ( as Justice Stevens maintains ) the " conceptual core " of the " liberty clause , " post , at 23 , includes a number of capacious , hazily defined categories .
There is no need to define the right with much precision in order to conclude that it pertains to the plaintiff 's " ability independently to define [ his ] identity , " his " right to make certain unusually important decisions that will affect his own , or his family 's , destiny , " or some aspect of his " [ s ] elf - determination , bodily integrity , freedom of conscience , intimate relationships , political equality , dignity [ or ] respect . "
Ibid . ( internal quotation marks omitted ) .
Justice Stevens must therefore have in mind some other use for the careful - description requirement -- perhaps just as a means of ensuring that courts " procee[d ] slowly and incrementally , " post , at 25 .
But that could be achieved just as well by having them draft their opinions in longhand .

II
If Justice Stevens ' account of the constraints of his approach did not demonstrate that they do not exist , his application of that approach to the case before us leaves no doubt .
He offers several reasons for concluding that the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms is not fundamental enough to be applied against the States .
5
None is persuasive , but more pertinent to my purpose , each is either intrinsically indeterminate , would preclude incorporation of rights we have already held incorporated , or both .
His approach therefore does nothing to stop a judge from arriving at any conclusion he sets out to reach .
Justice Stevens begins with the odd assertion that " firearms have a fundamentally ambivalent relationship to liberty , " since sometimes they are used to cause ( or sometimes accidentally produce ) injury to others .
Post , at 35 .
The source of the rule that only nonambivalent liberties deserve Due Process protection is never explained -- proof that judges applying Justice Stevens ' approach can add new elements to the test as they see fit .
The criterion , moreover , is inherently manipulable .
Surely Justice Stevens does not mean that the Clause covers only rights that have zero harmful effect on anyone .
Otherwise even the First Amendment is out .
Maybe what he means is that the right to keep and bear arms imposes too great a risk to others ' physical well - being .
But as the plurality explains , ante , at 35 - 36 , other rights we have already held incorporated pose similarly substantial risks to public safety .
In all events , Justice Stevens supplies neither a standard for how severe the impairment on others ' liberty must be for a right to be disqualified , nor ( of course ) any method of measuring the severity .
Justice Stevens next suggests that the Second Amendment right is not fundamental because it is " different in kind " from other rights we have recognized .
Post , at 37 .
In one respect , of course , the right to keep and bear arms is different from some other rights we have held the Clause protects and he would recognize :
It is deeply grounded in our nation 's history and tradition .
But Justice Stevens has a different distinction in mind :
Even though he does " not doubt for a moment that many Americans . . . see [ firearms ] as critical to their way of life as well as to their security , " he pronounces that owning a handgun is not " critical to leading a life of autonomy , dignity , or political equality .
" 6 Post , at 37 - 38 .
Who says ?
Deciding what is essential to an enlightened , liberty - filled life is an inherently political , moral judgment -- the antithesis of an objective approach that reaches conclusions by applying neutral rules to verifiable evidence .
7
No determination of what rights the Constitution of the United States covers would be complete , of course , without a survey of what other countries do .
Post , at 40 - 41 .
When it comes to guns , Justice Stevens explains , our Nation is already an outlier among " advanced democracies " ; not even our " oldest allies " protect as robust a right as we do , and we should not widen the gap .
Ibid .
Never mind that he explains neither which countries qualify as " advanced democracies " nor why others are irrelevant .
For there is an even clearer indication that this criterion lets judges pick which rights States must respect and those they can ignore :
As the plurality shows , ante , at 34 - 35 , and nn. 28 - 29 , this follow - the - foreign - crowd requirement would foreclose rights that we have held ( and Justice Stevens accepts ) are incorporated , but that other " advanced " nations do not recognize - - from the exclusionary rule to the Establishment Clause .
A judge applying Justice Stevens ' approach must either throw all of those rights overboard or , as cases Justice Stevens approves have done in considering unenumerated rights , simply ignore foreign law when it undermines the desired conclusion , see , e.g. , Casey , 505 U. S. 833 ( making no mention of foreign law ) .
Justice Stevens also argues that since the right to keep and bear arms was codified for the purpose of " prevent[ing ] elimination of the militia , " it should be viewed as " ' a federalism provision ' " logically incapable of incorporation .
Post , at 41 - 42 ( quoting Elk Grove Unified School Dist .
v. Newdow , 542 U. S. 1 , 45 ( 2004 ) ( Thomas , J. , concurring in judgment ) ; some internal quotation marks omitted ) .
This criterion , too , evidently applies only when judges want it to .
The opinion Justice Stevens quotes for the " federalism provision " principle , Justice Thomas ' s concurrence in Newdow , argued that incorporation of the Establishment Clause " makes little sense " because that Clause was originally understood as a limit on congressional interference with state establishments of religion .
Id. , at 49 - 51 .
Justice Stevens , of course , has no problem with applying the Establishment Clause to the States .
See , e.g. , id. , at 8 , n. 4 ( opinion for the Court by Stevens , J. ) ( acknowledging that the Establishment Clause " appl[ies ] to the States by incorporation into the Fourteenth Amendment " ) .
While he insists that Clause is not a " federalism provision , " post , at 42 , n. 40 , he does not explain why it is not , but the right to keep and bear arms is ( even though only the latter refers to a " right of the people " ) .
The " federalism " argument prevents the incorporation of only certain rights .
Justice Stevens next argues that even if the right to keep and bear arms is " deeply rooted in some important senses , " the roots of States ' efforts to regulate guns run just as deep .
Post , at 44 ( internal quotation marks omitted ) .
But this too is true of other rights we have held incorporated .
No fundamental right -- not even the First Amendment -- is absolute .
The traditional restrictions go to show the scope of the right , not its lack of fundamental character .
At least that is what they show ( Justice Stevens would agree ) for other rights .
Once again , principles are applied selectively .
Justice Stevens ' final reason for rejecting incorporation of the Second Amendment reveals , more clearly than any of the others , the game that is afoot .
Assuming that there is a " plausible constitutional basis " for holding that the right to keep and bear arms is incorporated , he asserts that we ought not to do so for prudential reasons .
Post , at 47 .
Even if we had the authority to withhold rights that are within the Constitution 's command ( and we assuredly do not ) , two of the reasons Justice Stevens gives for abstention show just how much power he would hand to judges .
The States ' " right to experiment " with solutions to the problem of gun violence , he says , is at its
Dear First Sergeant A .
You ’ve become famous , my brother .
I know you did n’t want to .
You prefer the dark waters of the night .
Yet suddenly we can see you on every self - respecting news channel – CNN , BBC , NBC .
There you are , quickly gliding down to the deck of the vessel .
The audience at home watches with concern .
Not all of us get the chance to jump off a helicopter in the middle of the night straight into an ocean of hatred and the knives held by bloodthirsty “ peace activists . ”
Personal Account ' 20 people threw me from deck ' Ahiya Raved ( Video )
Officer who led IDF raid on Marmara recounts battle onboard ship , says surprised by strength of resistance .
' I cocked my weapon when I saw that one was coming towards me with a knife drawn and I fired once .
Then another 20 people came at me from all directions and threw me down to the deck below ' ' 20 people threw me from deck '
It ’s a rather heavy burden , First Sergeant A . The burden of the Jewish people .
It sounds bombastic , right ?
“ History ” and “ ideals ” are bad words in the post - Israeli discourse .
Even to me it sounds a little schmaltzy .
Our precious elites , which at this time engage in constant self - flagellation , managed to entrench within us the weakness of spirit and a sense of cynicism .
However , this burden exists .
Perhaps it managed to find its way to your shoulders back when you were born .
You are a citizen of the Jewish State , First Sergeant A. , and your medical profile makes you fit to be a combat soldier .
Hence , you have been destined to glide down from helicopters at late hours of night and take the spiting of the whole enlightened world .
This world also expects you not to respond , even when someone fires at you .
Our ‘ genetic disease ’ - We ’re Jewish
We see you every day at the bus stop , First Sergeant A .
We live not too far from your base and you return from home at the same time we head to kindergarten .
You should know , A. , that my son watches you with admiration from the back seat .
He is excited to see the wings on your shirt and rules that you must be “ the strongest soldier in the world . ”
I smile when he says that , but then he adds : “ Dad , I too will be like him when I grow up . ”
At night , when he sleeps peacefully thanks to you , I look at him and get frightened a little - because this burden sneaks into his bed right before my eyes and holds on to him .
And he ’s just five years old .
Yes , all of us around here carry this terrible “ genetic disease . ”
My grandfather brought it with him from the train station in Munich in 1939 , and it was passed on to his great grandson , who now looks at your through the window .
There ’s not much we can do about it – we ’re Jewish .
I would love to be proven wrong .
I wish I could remove this burden and run to the other end of the world .
When I heard the blood - thirsty grunts across the globe the other day , I grabbed my atlas and started to flip through it , only to discover that we have no other place under the sun .
The only place we ’ve got is right behind your broad shoulders .
You must think that I ’m getting carried away , but I ’m not exaggerating .
If you look around you closely enough , you too may realize that all that ’s separating us from the knives , and bats , and barbed wire , and turbid soup – is you .
Just you .
So you should know , First Sergeant A. , that we love you and are proud of you and your comrades .
I hope for your success and pray for your health , even though we have no idea what you look like .
But once in a while , do n’t forget to watch out for yourself a little too .
You may be used to operating in enemy territory , but being a Jewish mother is scary business as well .
THE MOSQUE QUESTION
Can America live with the idea of a $ 100 million “ ground zero mosque ” built two blocks from the site of the 9/11 attacks ?
The prospect has sparked political debate , protests and national press as critics confront the project as proposed by the American Society for Muslim Advancement and the Cordoba Initiative .
The din grows louder : Hearings have begun at the Landmarks Preservation Commission in Manhattan , ultimately charged with approving or rejecting the construction of “ Cordoba House , ” described by organizers as a “ cultural nexus ” and “ a center guided by Islamic values in their truest form , ” complete with a swimming pool and a 500 - seat auditorium .
Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf , chairman of the project , insists it is a community center , not a mosque - comparing it to the city ’s Jewish Community Center or the 92nd Street Y .
He has the support of New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Attorney General Andrew Cuomo , and is opposed by Republican gubernatorial hopeful Rick Lazio and Rep. Peter T. King , a Republican from the 3rd District .
Mr. King has called for an investigation into the financial underpinnings .
“ The response to my call for an inquiry has been very positive .
In my neighborhood , we had 150 victims who died at ground zero , their friends and families left behind .
Now , you can build mosque anywhere you want .
The issue is not about where people pray or worship .
This is an extraordinary situation .
To build the mosque within a few blocks of ground zero is n’t appropriate , and besides that , it is a multimillion dollar operation , ” Mr. King tells Inside the Beltway .
“ There should be an investigation into who is financing this project , because the balance sheets are revealing very few details .
At the very least , the 9/11 families deserve a full accounting of who is paying for this mosque , and information about the imam who is leading it .
In the past , mosques and imams have not always been cooperative with law enforcement .
Add it all together , and significant questions emerge , ” Mr. King adds .
THE MAINE EVENT
Bad timing , unfortunate coincidence , collateral damage ?
It ’s all in the headlines :
“ Michelle Obama urges U.S. holidaymakers to support the Gulf Coast . ” ( The Guardian )
“ Obama family will spend the weekend in Maine . ” ( Boston Globe )
“ First lady encourages Americans to vacation on the Gulf - the Obamas head to Maine . ” ( ABC News )
“ Obama vacations for the third time - since oil spill began . ” ( Right Pundits.com )
“ Obamas will vacation on the beach in Maine when the beach in the Gulf has more room .
What were they thinking ? ” ( Lucianne.com )
THIRST FOR FREEDOM
Inside the Beltway has heard of the Muckraker ’s Happy Hour , a motley gathering of journalists and wonks organized by the Project on Government Oversight at a Capitol Hill watering hole each month .
But move over .
Witness the Ayn Rand Happy Hour - this hosted by FreedomWorks , a grass - roots group chaired by Dick Armey that seeks less government and less taxes .
An inside source reveals that official cocktails include the Ragnar Rum Runner , the Ayn Rand White Russian and Halleys 5th Concerto Cosmopolitan .
FreedomWorks ’ president Matt Kibbe will act as the genial host as guests celebrate the author ’s classic novel , “ Atlas Shrugged , ” a cautionary tale of overbearing government .
Mr. Kibbe also is sending a copy of the book to every member of the U.S. House and Senate .
That ’s a lot of books , like 535 of them .
His guests get copies , too .
“ They will be able to discuss the parallels between the events of the novel and the developments in present day America , ” Mr. Kibbe observes .
RECOVERY BLITZ
It ’s the “ summer of recovery . ”
Get used to it .
That ’s the brand name this week .
In the next 72 hours , President Obama , Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and a cast of thousands - well - eight Cabinet level officials , anyway - will journey to green - minded electric - car factories , battery manufacturers and vehicle charging stations .
All will likely repeat the mantra of Council of Economic Advisers chairwoman Christina Romer ’s new analysis that insists , “ For every Recovery Act dollar invested in projects that leverage private capital , the private sector is putting in at least 2.5 times as much . ”
The journeys are far flung , and unless staged in electric cars , they will leave a considerable carbon footprint : Mr. Obama heads to Michigan , Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis will visit North Carolina , Secretary of Energy Steven Chu goes to Indiana , Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Shaun Donovan goes to New York City - and so on .
MESSAGE FROM W
In days of yore , the press was fond of accusing the George W. Bush administration of being secretive .
Time marches on .
The former president is eager to share the archives of his time in office .
The George W. Bush Presidential Center in Dallas , in fact , will boast the largest digital archive in the nation ’s history , including the “ Freedom Collection , ” a central repository for archives of political dissidents struggling to bring freedom and opportunity to their own nations .
There ’s also a research - based policy institute in the works , a woman ’s initiative chaired by Laura Bush , a Texas rose garden , a museum .
The center is seeking charter members , says Mark Langdale , president of the George Bush Foundation .
See the details at www.georgewbushcenter.com.

The spray is tentatively called PSD502 .
It is a metered dose spray that is used for the treatment of primary premature ejaculation .
It works by being applied to the ' non- keratinized skin on the mucosa of the glans penis . ' The research study used 530 men , from the United States , Europe , and Canada , all with premature ejaculation .
Of this total number , 358 men gave themselves three quick sprays of PSD502 onto the head of their penis five minutes before having sex .
Just before sex they wiped the spray off their penis .
The PSD502 spray contains two common topical painkillers .
They are lidocaine and prilocaine .
The spray is made by Shionogi Pharma Inc. , a U.S. - based group company of Shionogi & Co. , Ltd. , which is headquartered in Atlanta , Georgia , U.S.A .
The other men used a spray of placebo ( an inactive substance ) , as a control group for the study .
Both groups did not know which product they were being given .
They used the product for three months , for a total of about 23,000 doses .
Page two continues with the results of the study .
According to the results of the study , men who sprayed PSD502 onto the head of their penis five minutes before sex , after using the drug for three months , were able to delay premature ejaculation , on average , to just over three minutes after penetrating their female partner 's vagina .
Generally , for men who did not use the PSD502 , the time of premature ejaculation , on average , was approximately 0.5 minute ( 30 seconds ) .
According to WebMD , premature ejaculation occurs when ejaculation occurs within one minute of vaginal penetration .
The organization states that up to 30 % of men suffer some degree of premature ejaculation .
And , premature ejaculation , according to WebMD , is the top sexual health problem for men in the United States .
Dr. Ira D. Sharlip headed the study of PSD502 and premature ejaculation .
Dr. Sharlip is a clinical professor of urology ( and senior physician diplomate of urology ) at the University of California , San Francisco .
The study was funded by Shionogi Pharma Inc. , which makes the PSD502 spray .
According to the WebMD article ' New Drug Spray May Help Premature Ejaculation , ' Dr. Sharlip presented his study 's findings at the 2010 annual meeting of the American Urological Association ( AUA ) , which was held in San Francisco , California .
Page three continues with comments from Dr. Sharlip .
Dr. Sharlip commented about the extent that PSD502 could help relieve premature ejaculation for a wide range of men .
Sharlip stated within the WebMD article , " Yet I think a substantial number of [ men with premature ejaculation ] would use it . ' The WebMD article also stated that unproven products , such as ' Stay Erect '  and ' Play Longer ' are on the market .
Thus , PSD502 is the only product that has been scientifically studied to actually extend premature ejaculation in men .
Dr. Sharlip reported that at the beginning of the study the average time ' from penetration to ejaculation ' was 36 seconds for both groups .
At the end of the study , three months later , the PSD502 group had increased this time to 3.3 minutes , while the control group was still under 1 minute .
The WebMD article stated , ' A stopwatch held by the man or his partner was used to calculate the times .
' Talk about distracting , '.... ' But that 's one of the strengths of the study ; they got real data , not just men reporting back they think they lasted longer after using the medication .
'" Also , ' The men getting PSD502 also reported better ejaculatory control and overall satisfaction with their sexual experience than the placebo recipients . '
 Page four concludes with the future of PSD502 , along with further information about the study .
The WebMD article warns that : ' This study was presented at a medical conference .
The findings should be considered preliminary as they have not yet undergone the " peer review " process , in which outside experts scrutinize the data prior to publication in a medical journal . ' However , the product shows promise in delaying premature ejaculation .
Before being offered to the public , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) will have to approve its use .
Such approval is being sought by Shionogi , .
For additional information on this study , please read the June 1 , 2010 EurekAlert article ' Pivotal data for the investigational treatment PSD502 for primary premature ejaculation .'
Gen . Stanley McChrystal today announced that the long - planned invasion of Kandahar , initially slated for sometime this month , has been delayed indefinitely because of a lack of support among the local population .
“ I think its more important that we get it right than we get it fast , ” McChrystal insisted , adding that local politics were more difficult than he expected and that it might take months to get the offensive off the ground .
Though the lack of local support is certainly a factor , the floundering occupation of the fictional city of Marjah is another .
Nearly four months into an invasion which was supposed to be over in a matter of hours , troops are still facing daily firefights over the tiny farming community , with commanders saying the operation may extend past the fall .
The “ government in a box ” invasion of Marjah was supposed to be a test case for the very large , very real city of Kandahar .
Yet if they cannot drive the Taliban out and prop up a Karzai - appointee in the largely irrelevant farming village , it is perhaps unsurprising that Kandahar locals do n’t like their chances of doing the same in a city that is seen as the center of Taliban activity .

Luckily , courtesy of Congressman Dave Kamp , we have managed to obtain this report which shows the unprecedented level of delusion that exists at all levels of our administration .
In a nutshell , the attached report pretends to forecast US debt and GDP levels .
What it does n't pretend to do , is to be the work product of a variety of pathological liars .
Even as Geithner anticipates US total debt to hit $ 19.6 trillion by the end of 2015 , somehow , in some parallel universe , he also anticipates US GDP will rise at a 5 % CAGR for the next five years !
Total US GDP , which was at $ 14.2 trillion for 2009 , is expected to ramp up by 2.7 % in 2010 , and then really put on the afterburners in 2011 through 2015 , averaging almost 6 % each year , and hitting a stunning $ 19.2 trillion in 2015 .
The ridiculousness of this assumption is beyond comprehension .
And even so , total debt / GDP will still be over 100 % per the government 's baseline assumptions .
Alternatively , if one assumes , as PIMCO does , a GDP growth rate of 1.5 % for the next 4 - 5 years courtesy of the 10 % unemployment " new normal " , total debt - GDP will hit 126 % in 5 years .
And this obviously excludes GSE , SSN and Medicare off balance sheet debt .
Lastly , the Treasury assumes that even with 100 % Debt to GDP , the funding cost on US market debt in 2015 will be only 4.7 % , compared to the 1990 - 2009 average of 5.9 % .
The chart below shows the US Treasury 's baseline estimate .
Keep in mind total debt will realistically be much higher than what is projected here .
One notable observation is that the Treasury assumes that Intergovernmental Debt ( i.e. funding for trust funds such as SSN etc ) , will only rise at around 4.5 % each year .
This is another chimera that will promptly blow up in the administration 's face , now that SSN is net cashflow negative for the first time in history , and will need constant cash replenishment from the Treasury .
So far so good .
Where things get very surreal is when the government attempts to project GDP for the next five years .
As the chart below shows , Geithner believes that after a minor dip in 2009 , GDP will continue growing , and in fact , for four of the projected years , overtake the 1990 - 2009 average of 4.9 % !
So instead of taking the government 's word for GDP growth , we have decided to adjust the growth rate at a fixed 1.5 % .
We show the resulting Debt - to - GDP ratio below for both the government 's baseline and our adjusted case .
The difference in 2015 is material : 101 % versus 126 % .
The previous chart ties in directly with the next set of critical data : the government 's expected all - in blended interest rate on the marketable debt .
As the chart below demonstrates , the Treasury anticipates having interest expense outlays exploding from $ 201.5 billion in 2009 to $ 653.6 billion .
Yet even that amount is a mere 4.7 % of the total projected outstanding marketable debt in 2015 , which is well - below the 5.9 % the US paid in interest on its debt between 1990 and 2019 , when debt - to - GDP peaked at 83 % .
Here once again we construct a more draconian scenario , in which we assume that the interest rate on debt increases at 1 % each year after 2009 , starting at 4 % in 2010 and growing until it hits 9 % in 2015 .
As the chart below shows , the result of this scenario would be a catastrophe for the US and its already untenable budget .
Our take home from this compendium of incredulous data , is that there is no way in hell for the US to hit any of its estimates for future funding and outflow , except for one case : if the US continues to be the capital safe haven for the next five years .
This means that it will be in the US ' interest to generate ongoing solvency , liquidity and geopolitical tensions for the next 5 years and likely much longer .
Another benefit - the US defense sector 's taxable net incomes will soar .
All this is completely independent of any debate on whether the US will see inflation or deflation .
As we have seen over the past year , even as stocks have been incorrectly pricing in a return of moderate inflation , Treasury rates have hit record lows , primarily as the fixed income market has continued seeing Treasuries as the last safe refuge .
Look for this to only become more acute as increasingly more baby boomers retire .
Yet the one virtually certain component of the UST 's forecast is that conflict and international " contagion " will be a critical part of the equation should the Treasury wish to retain any semblance of control over its even near - term projections .
How much of this will be accelerated by the administration , is a topic for another day .

Greg Johnson has penned an essay about Oswald Spengler and racial decadence that arrives at some pretty sweeping conclusions .
A few days ago , Robert Campbell altered me to the existence of this article in a telephone conversation .
Three Senses of Race
Cutting to the meat of the essay , Greg Johnson starts off by arguing that race exists in three primary senses , the biological , cultural , and psychological :
1. ) Race can refer to populations which vary by geography in gene frequencies and phenotype .
2. ) Race can refer to having “ racial consciousness . ”
3. ) Race can prefer to a primordial , life affirming , vital determination to expand and propagate and expand your tribe .
Nothing to argue with here .
I would only dispute the idea that “ racial consciousness ” is “ backward looking ” whereas race in the psychological sense is “ forward looking . ”
In Colonial America , racial consciousness and race in the psychological sense evolved out of pre-existing English ideas and attitudes .
Both were a response to the environmental conditions faced by Englishmen in the New World .
The settlers took elements of their tradition ( i.e. , the concepts of just war and private property ) and adapted them to their circumstances .
In the eighteenth century , Americans began the project of racial classification and interpretation of racial differences .
“ Science ” itself ( a method of understanding the natural world ) is a tradition that stretches back into the Middle Ages and Greco - Roman Antiquity .
There is no conflict between “ progress ” and “ tradition . ”
The only way to make “ progress ” is by working within the bounds of a tradition .
This is most clearly seen in the history of technology where incremental advances in existing technology have led to new conceptual breakthroughs .
Thus , the telegraph evolved over time into the cell phone , or the Kitty Hawk into the Columbia space shuttle .
Race and Culture
Having established the three senses of race ( biological , cultural , and psychological ) , Greg Johnson moves on to argue that race informs culture , and vice versa .
Nothing to argue with here either .
The societies built by Europeans are an extended phenotype .
They reflect underlying heritable characteristics like intelligence and personality traits .
At the same time , cultural memes ( which are not heritable ) are constantly influencing mate selection , which over time will change a population at the biological level .
Race Platonism and Race Traditionalism
Following Spengler , Greg Johnson next begins to discuss “ Race Platonism ” and “ Race Traditionalism , ” which he defines as 1 . ) that racial archetypes that are immutable forms and 2 . ) that the modern races have degenerated from ideal forms that existed in the distant past .
Both are easily dismissed .
“ Race Traditionalism ” is easily refuted by the fossil evidence of archaeology .
“ Race Platonism ” is refuted by everything we know about modern biology and genetics .
If all racial minority groups were expelled from North America tomorrow , the White population would still evolve .
Natural selection would continue to operate on mutations and genetic drift .
In the absence of gene flow , Whites and non-Whites would eventually diverge into separate species .
Change is inevitable .
Outside of the “ Radical Traditionalist ” community , this idea is uncontroversial in White Nationalist circles .
Racial Preservation – Getting It Wrong
Having established the three types of race , the fact that culture informs race , and that genetic change is inevitable , Greg Johnson moves into more controversial territory .
He declares that “ racial preservation ” is tantamount to “ death . ”
Johnson ’s error begins in setting up a straw man of racial preservation .
The ideal of “ racial preservation ” is not analogous to , say , killing a deer and having a taxidermist mount it on your wall , as everyone recognizes that gene frequencies change in each generation .
“ Racial preservation ” means nothing more than declaring that some traits ( i.e. , fair skin , fair hair , fair eyes , high intelligence , amiable personality , etc. ) should be favored , selected , and encouraged in our culture .
This can be easily accomplished : Whites and non-Whites can be geographically separated , non-White immigration can be banned , the traditional American racial ideal can be promoted in all types of media , miscegenation can be outlawed , the tax code could be altered to encourage eugenic marriages , social services that deter family formation can be eliminated , etc .
If American culture and public policy was changed tomorrow , say , to reflect the White Nationalist racial idea , the United States would become more racially and culturally European over time , which is exactly what happened between Reconstruction and the the Civil Rights Movement .
When JFK was elected president , America was almost 90 %
White ; this happened by design , not by accident .
Racial Purity – Getting It More Wrong
After developing this idea that “ racial preservation ” is “ death , ” through an interpretation of Oswald Spengler , Greg Johnson goes on to attack the idea of “ racial purity , ” which he claims is incompatible with race in the psychological sense as a viral , life affirming world outlook .
Historically speaking , it only takes a moment ’s reflection to dismiss this idea .
In Colonial America , the ideal of racial preservation and race in the psychological sense evolved together and complemented each other .
“ Racial purity ” meant nothing more than the determination of English settlers to preserve their European phenotype .
The frontiersmen had the will to power to seize land , clear it of Indians , and erect towns and cities .
As White settlement expanded along the Atlantic seaboard , the first anti-miscegenation laws were passed ; a racial caste system emerged ; an elaborate code of racial etiquette began to govern racial interaction .
The “ healthy men of race ” – the American settlers – were expansionists who still thought of themselves as Englishmen , increasingly thought of themselves as Whites , and eventually codified their ideal of racial preservation into law .
Like Americans have always done , they thought about the past , present , and the future .
There is no opposition between “ vitality ” and “ racial purity . ”
If that were the case , 350 years of American history would be incomprehensible .
White Nationalism Is Degenerate – Jumping the Tracks
Greg Johnson concludes that “ racial preservation ” is “ death ” ( from 1665 to 1967 , America was dead ) and that “ racial purity ” is somehow opposed to “ vitality ” ( like when we conquered the North American continent ) .
The next logical step is to conclude that White Nationalism is “ overwhelmingly a degenerate movement . ”
White Nationalism is condemned as degenerate … because , somehow , White Nationalists do n’t want to Whites to evolve into the Talosians from Star Trek or Elves from Lord of the Rings .
By advocating racial preservation ( i.e. , erecting barriers to non-White admixture ) , we are “ murdering ” and “ mummifying ” our race .
Well , I disagree .
Greg Johnson is condemning the healthy elements of White Nationalism as degenerate .
By healthy , I mean White Nationalists advocate America ’s traditional racial and cultural ideals over modern progressive ones , which is to say , we select for European phenotype .
Among other things ,
White Nationalists want to separate the races , ban miscegenation , increase the birthrate , and promote aesthetic images of White beauty and health in the media .
What is degenerate about that ?
Progressives advocate miscegenation , race anarchy ,
White guilt , transfers of wealth from Whites to non-Whites , third world immigration , multiculturalism , affirmation action , and diversity .
If there is something “ healthy ” about the progressive agenda ( the first interracial kiss occurred on Star Trek ) , I certainly have never seen it .
White Nationalists are degenerates , but not for the reasons Greg Johnson describes .
The problem is that White Nationalists , even the ones who have given up America ( yours truly included ) , are still culturally American themselves .
Even the most diehard racialists are only a few degrees mentally removed from the American cultural mainstream .
The same degeneracy that afflicts American culture in general ( expressive individualism being the best example ) has deeply penetrated the White Nationalist movement .
When Neo -Nazis parade through Toledo , they are simply carrying on the long established avant - garde tradition of shocking the bourgeoisie .
When White Nationalists get piercings and tattoos , they are merely aping their aracial peers .
I could continue to list examples , but the two above are sufficient to establish my point .
White Nationalists are not immune to their cultural environment .
It is a constant struggle to separate ourselves , mentally and physically , from the sewage that pulsates through our culture .
Even the best of us are subtly influenced by it .
A “ Vital ” White Nationalism
Now that “ racial preservation ” has been labeled “ death , ” “ racial purity ” called “ mummifying the race , ” and White Nationalism has been pronounced “ an overwhelmingly degenerate movement , ” Greg Johnson wants to create a new vital White Nationalism , and has a few ideas as to how to go about this .
His starting point : the “ animal vitality ” of a Star Trek convention .
I ’ve known Trekkies in the past .
None of them have struck me as particularly virile .
Quite the opposite .
Johnson diagnoses the problem : White Nationalism is “ conservative , ” which is to say , “ backward looking , ” devitalized , decadent , decadent , and gloomy .
Star Trek is “ progressive , ” which means forward - looking , optimistic , and hopeful .
Come on , Greg .
This is n’t even a good interpretation of Star Trek .
In TOS , Captain Kirk fought the Klingons .
In TNG , the show bombed until the Borg were created as a villain .
The Deep Space Nine series was entirely about war with a race called “ The Dominion . ” Voyager bombed until the Borg returned as the major villain .
Finally , Enterprise was a flop , even after the directors tried to revive the show through a grab bag of conflicts with the Klingons , Borg , Xindi , and Romulans .
In the latest Star Trek movie , a Romulan time traveler destroys Vulcan , the home planet of Spock .
There are no social penalties ( aside from nerdiness ) with being labeled a Trekkie .
No one loses their job or goes to prison for watching Star Trek .
No one utterly dehumanizes Trekkies .
They are not socially ostracized by their own families .
This is a really bad analogy .
In Johnson ’s view , a “ vital White Nationalist movement ” would be a “ utopian , progressivist , eugenicist mythical - cultural phenomenon . ”
Maybe something like a combination of Star Trek and Lord of the Rings .
I think this prescription speaks more to Johnson ’s aesthetic and intellectual tastes than it does to reality .
History : Our Guide
Greg Johnson thinks we should look to the future as our guide .
I think we should look to our past .
What factors motivated White Americans to seize their racial destiny and conquer a continent ?
Answer : it was a combination of things .
The American colonies were established out of religious , commercial , and geopolitical motives .
In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries , the English wanted to rid themselves of a swarming underclass , compete with France and Spain in the New World , create an outlet for their industrial production and a source of raw materials , and bring the Gospel to the New World .
As Virginia and the other colonies matured , Americans expropriated land from the Indians .
The Indians were considered savages , heathens , and non-Whites .
They were squatting on land which the colonists could develop and build into a free society .
For racial , ethnic , religious , moral , and economic reasons , the Indians were dispossessed and pushed further West .
In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries , science labeled non-Whites inferior , and studies were produced that convinced the brightest minds to support segregation .
Greedy settlers motivated by self - interest poured into Indian lands .
Racial idealism and geopolitical rivalry with Britain motivated Americans annex Texas and seize the West from Mexico .
In sum , Americans conquered North America for commercial , religious , geopolitical , cultural , political , moral , racial , ethnic , intellectual and self - interested reasons .
Everything from racial idealism to religion to science to morality to divine providence was cited to justify the expropriation .
The lesson to be learned from this is that White Nationalists should appeal to the full suite of human interests , not any specific one , to justify the reconquest .
Devitalization
What crippled the American project ?
One European bad idea after another : liberalism , anti-slavery , natural rights ideology , communism , democracy , capitalism , millenarianism , anarchism , fascism , anti-racism , expressive individualism , libertarianism , postmodernism , feminism , nihilism , humanism , etc .
The effete sons of rough frontiersmen became infatuated and possessed by these abstract ideas .
These abstractions were pushed to ever newer extremes at the expense of common sense , self interest , and tradition .
When combined with material abundance , they produced the moral rot which has always been the source of republican decline .
Oswald Spengler can be included in this category : Western Civilization is doomed , cultures go through life cycles , we are living in the terminal phase of civilization .
I ca n’t think of a better prescription for helplessness and inaction than Spenglerian historical determinism .
Revitalizing the White Nationalist movement lies in recapturing the racial attitude of our pioneer ancestors .
The solution does not lie in the dust covered books of long dead European philosophers .
This article first appeared in The eXile on June 1 , 2007
For months now , our overseas readers have been asking us , “ What ’s a gopnik ? ”
They have a vague idea of what a gopnik looks like , thanks to our Face Control page : tough Russian dudes with bad skin and blank fuck - if - I - care expressions .
They ’re the guys who look more comfortable squatting than standing .
But more than anything else , they ’re the last males on planet earth who can get away with wearing those 20s - style leather gangster caps without looking like drama school fags rehearsing for a musical .
What makes the gopniki so fucking cool to behold is that they exist beyond irony .
If the gopniki are anything , they are “ authentic . ”
In an era in which “ authenticity ” is the most valued and rarest attribute of all ( in the minds of middle - class Gen - Y hipsters , at least ) , the gopniki rank at the top of the White World ’s coolness hierarchy .
Proof of their authenticity lies in their incredibly bold tastes : a combination of cheese , menace , and Third World flash so brash that even the avant - est Western hipster could n’t possibly imagine it , because even if he or she did , it would inevitably come off as kitsch and harmless in their bourgeois hands .
Even the fact that gopniki love blasting techno , singing shitty karaoke in cheap cafes with blinking disco lights , or wearing cheap pointy leather shoes to match their 20s Ragtime kepka - tabletka caps , only boosts their cred as the baddest - assed white guys on Planet Earth .
But the story of Russia ’s gopniki is n’t a simple celebration of undiscovered authentic - coolness .
Rather , it ’s a tragedy of literary proportions .
Like Faulkner ’s Old South , or Tolstoi ’s fading landed gentry , the story of Russia ’s gopniki is the tragic tale of a dying breed of a once - proud people .
Charles Portis wrote that whenever a guidebook refers to a country ’s people as being “ proud , ” it usually means “ barely human ” in the special lingo of those guidebooks .
In the case of the gopniki , they really are barely human , and that ’s why they ’re so fucking awesome .
Take the word “ gopnik ” : rarely does a word so seamlessly match the object that it signifies .
The “ gop ” is brutal , dumb , and funny , but not funny like “ I ’ll laugh in the gopnik ’s face ” funny .
It ’s funny in a very private way , safely inside your car , with the doors locked and the windows up , and the foot on the pedal , and the wife and kids screaming not to stop at the red light .
* * *
“ You can take my Speedo away when you peel it from my cold , sticky balls . ”
How and where did gopnik culture start ?
The word “ gopnik ” was n’t a clever poet ’s invention , but rather it comes , as so many cool Russian words do , from an acronym : Gosudarstvenoe Obshezhitie Proletariata , or “ State Dormitory of the Proletariat . ”
Add the “ nik ” to the G.O.P. , and a species is born .
And born it was , according to legend , in the wake of the Bolshevik Revolution .
According to the best accounts we have , including that of Leningrad ’s lead singer Shnur , gopniki were originally peasants and landless riff - raff who came to Petrograd in the 1920s in search of work .
They poured out of Petrograd ’s train stations , and found residences , if lucky , in newly transformed dormitories , where they transformed themselves into the first local ghetto gangstas in Soviet Russia .
The gopnik species even has an exact origin : Ligovsky Prospekt , dom 10 .
It was the Oktyabrskaya Hotel , which the Soviets turned into a downtown dormitory for incoming proletarians , but which , in the hands of the gopniki , was transformed into their own collectivized gangsta crib .
Since they were village outsiders , often from broken families , many with histories of petty crime or worse , the gopniki were despised by the Petrograd / Leningrad natives .
They became legends as outlaws and toughs who could n’t be broken by the Soviet system .
They had their own code of ethics and lived by their own rules , their own knuckle tats and styles , sort of like the vori v zakoni of the misdemeanor world of hooligans .
Over time , as gopnik fashion , slang , and attitude spread throughout the country ’s lower classes , the meaning of the word changed .
Rather than referring to the specific phenomenon of village toughs living in the Oktyabrskaya Hotel , “ gopnik ” referred to any Russian brute with a shaven head , thick leather jacket , ridiculous leather shoes , and the ubiquitouskepka - tabletka .
It could also refer to the guy squatting in courtyard in his track suit and tapochki , pounding a bottle of cheap Zhigulovskoe beer and spitting seeds , occasionally snapping at his wife to keep her mouth shut , since her only job is to take their baby on a stroll in the second - hand Turkish baby carriage that he pinched from the front of someone ’s izba …
In the 90s , it seemed that the gopniki were poised to inherit , if not the earth , then at least 1/6 of the earth ’s land mass .
Gopniki ranged across all of Russia ’s fabled 11 time zones , from the now - defunct Intourist Hotel lobby just a couple hundreds meters from Red Square , to the kiosk - lined walkway along Vladivostok ’s shoreline , and all points in between .
Gopniki , or at least Russian men who ’d adopted the gopnik look , seemed to be moving into every sphere of life , from “ biznes , ” where they served as the muscle , to politics , where , as LDPR deputies they formed the core resistance to Westernization .
The entire nation had gone gopnik : shaven heads , hardened post - zona expressions , and an uncanny nose for cheesy clothes , no matter how much they cost .
Some traded in their leather coats and tracksuit tops for maroon Hugo Boss blazers .
They could n’t resist adding bling to the mix : gold chains , necklaces and bracelets , fancy watches that were so gold and shiny that they crossed back over to looking like cheap Vietnamese knock - offs , even if they were real .
Best of all , the 90s was accompanied by the ultimate gopnik soundtrack : nonstop shitty techno music , blaring out of every restaurant , every shawarma stand and kiosk , every Zhiguli or stolen Merc , every hotel room converted into an “ ofis . ”
No matter where you turned in 1990s Russia , you simply could not escape bad techno music .
What no one understood then , and what few understand even today , is that the 1990s was n’t so much the high - water mark for the Gopnik Nation , as the Beginning of the End .

Last weekend , we decided to take a Gopniki Safari– to do some field anthropology work in order to bring the world of the gopnik to you , the eXile reader .
We asked around for the best place to go gopnik - spotting , and got all sorts of answers from our Russian friends .
“ They ’re everywhere ! ”
“ Go to any Russian town . ”
“ You do n’t even have to leave Moscow .
Just pick a metro stop outside of the ring line , they ’ll come to you . ”
The most interesting response came from our own Vika Bruk , who used to write the “ Generation Eltiny ” column : “ Try going to ‘ Velikie Luki ’ [ a provincial dump that literally means ‘ Great Onions ’ – Ed . ] .
That ’s where , like , all of my relatives live – my aunt who works at a textile factory , her alcoholic husband , my cousin Maxim who ’s a guard , my other cousin Alexei who ’s also a guard for a bank , my other cousin Natasha who ’s getting divorced from her lazy asshole husband , my uncle Alexander , who sells Chinese shoes at the market , his son Alexander who ’s in the army , his other son Edward , I do n’t know what he ’s doing .
So , yeah , there are plenty of gopniki – my entire family . ”
The problem was that Great Onions is located in the Pskov province , and we needed somewhere closer .
In the Moscow region , no city has a tougher reputation than Lubertsy , a working - class suburb just south of the MKAD .
In the 1990s , Lubertsy was known as Gopnik Central .
Violence was as common as tracksuits and chewed - up sunflower seeds .
One girl who was born and raised in Lubertsy , and moved to Moscow in the early 1990s , told us , “ Every guy I knew there was a gopnik .
If you go there , you ’ll probably see them everywhere , but I ca n’t say for sure since I have n’t returned . ”
When we asked her if she could perhaps call one of her old childhood friends , she replied , “ I can ’t .
Most of them are dead , either from drugs or some shooting or stabbing .
The rest got out and moved away like I did .
I do n’t know anyone there anymore . ”
We took a taxi out to Lubertsy on a late Saturday afternoon .
It was hot outside , hotter than normal for this time of year .
We figured that while some of the gopniki might be relaxing by a toxic sludge hole ( locally termed a “ beach ” or “ lake ” ) , enough should be squatting next to kiosks and in courtyards to satisfy our anthropological requirements .
But then something unexpected happened .
We drove slowly through the center of Lubertsy , expecting to find , if not fresh Death Porn corpses , then at the very least stains which spoke of recent death porn happenings .
Instead , the town was actually … eh , could someone smack us with a wet fish for what we ’re about to say here ?
It was actually kinda , like , pleasant .
In a family - friendly sorta way .
We nit you shot .
There were plenty of leafy trees , clean sidewalks , couples and families strolling .
We counted at least four sushi restaurants just on one stretch of one main street , along with the usual Rosinter chain restaurants , and hamster - habitat Torgovie Tsentri .
Even though there were fewer mega - pricey foreign cars in Lubertsky , nevertheless the town was full of lower - priced foreign car models .
Even the Zhigs were clean and washed .
We only spotted one souped - up Lada disco wagon with blinking red runway lights along the trim .
If America has “ Rice Rockets , ” then surely this Gopnik Nation must have its “ Shawarma Shuttles . ”
And yet , lo , we only spotted this one lone Shawarma Shuttle in a sea of bourgeois vehicles .
Strolling Lubertsky was n’t working out .
If we wanted to spot some gopniks , we need to think like gopniks .
Where would they go ?
The park !
And not just the park , but the place in the park where they have plastic lawn furniture around a kiosk blaring out distorted 90s techno , or what gopniki like to call a “ kafe . ”
Welp , suffice to say we found the park .
And we found the “ kafe ” with the plastic lawn furniture .
We bought our beers .
We sat down .
And we ’ll be damned if we did n’t see a single goddamn gopnik the entire time .
In fact , the kafe was altogether civilized : no blaring loud techno , beer served cold , the patrons all keeping out of each other ’s business , even a couple of indy goth types in the mix .
At first we started bitching out loud , worried that we did n’t have a story .
But then the frustration started to turn to concern .
What happened to the gopniki ?
Did they all leave for a pond for the weekend ?
Was it too hot for them ?
Had they left Lubersty for ranker pastures ?
We decided to ditch the civilized “ kafe ” and head into the park : a depressing collection of rusty Soviet - era children ’s attractions that all but screamed , “ If you want to have a very , very late - term abortion , then place your child on this attraction , stand back , pay five rubles , and let us take care of the rest . ”
While strolling through the park , we spotted a group of shirtless guys roughhousing around over by a set of monkey bars .
But when we moved into a closer position , we realized that these were n’t gopniki at all : they werekavkatsi , “ blackasses ” , the very inverse of gopniks .
After several hours of roaming around Lubertsky , we finally decided to give up .
If there were no gopniki here , where the fuck would we find them ?
That ’s when we settled on one of the gnarliest regions in Moscow , “ Brateevo , ” a district whose very name is synonymous with gopnik .
Brateevo is one of those outlying districts whose every square inch of land seems packed with 17 - story white paneli , huge awful buildings made from faded white concrete slabs .
As you approach Brateevo from the MKAD , there are so many of thesepaneli packed in so tightly and haphazardly that you can’t imagine there ’s room to walk between them , that sunlight is blocked , all vegetation stunted .
But alas , looks can be deceiving .
Once again , after arming ourselves with beer and heading into the shit , we found ourselves face - to - face with something far worse than teams of squatting gopniki : we found ourselves amidst a sea of totally gopnik - free humanity .
Once again , families , baby carriages , nice cars , kids sporting the new pop-indy look , cute girls walking their dogs .
In fact , Brateevo had gone so cosmopolitan that even our intentionally loud English speaking , designed to draw attention , did n’t so much as warrant a glance .
Even stray dogs ignored us .
There was only one place left to look : a local billiard hall .
If the gopniki were anywhere , even a lone gopnik or two , they ’d be here .
And , well , you can guess what we did n’t find there .
* * *
If you follow the Russian blog world , you ’d think that gopniki are so ubiquitous in Russia that they ’re multiplying and threatening to spill over the borders , to take over China .
Everywhere sites ridicule , mock , or glorify - by - way - of - ridicule the Russian gopnik .
We should have known , from experience in the West , what it means whenever an “ authentic ” sub-class gets discovered by cooler people .
It means that they ’re dead , history , gone .
And that is what this article is about : not only to introduce the Gopnik to the world , but also to announce the Gonpik ’s tragic death .
Because whenever something this hardcore gets cool , it ’s always a bad sign .
What happened to them ?
By most accounts , two things have worked to kill off the Gopnik .
First , in the 80s and 90s , the sudden and wide availability of hard drugs and pistols , introduced into a culture as fearless and primitive as theirs , meant that nearly half of the species went extinct within a decade .
The second cause is more environmental .
The introduction of Western bourgeois values and cultural tastes , along with Putin ’s ushering in a period of apparent stability , growth and sobriety , meant that the gopnik ’s 70 year reign as the kings of the rebel world suddenly changed : Russians of all classes quickly grew to despise the peasant - like gopnik aesthetic .
Russians were ashamed and disgusted by gopniki more than anything , not realizing until the past year or two , when it was already too late , that gopniki were the great national treasure , the “ Russian Idea ” in human form , the only ones who kept it real .
Where once Russia ’s tough young underclass romanticized gopniki , today they look up to rappers ( preferably white ) .
The new Putin - era patriots no longer need gopniki either , even though gopniki have always been the fiercest Russian patriots .
In the Putin era , patriotic kids look more European , dress more European , listen to European - ish and even American - like music .
The only remnant of the gopnik gene is that even the most seemingly - Westernized young Russian carries inside of himself or herself classic gopnik attitudes : blind chauvinism , anti-Americanism , hatred of dark - skinned people , and of course , their gopnik behavior on Aeroflot flights , in which even the wealthiest and best - traveled Russian ’s recessive gopnik gene kicks in , ordering him or her to wear a track suit , tapochki , and to hit a bottle of Moskovsky Cognac during the flight , singing loud songs and leaning over ( and into ) their neighbors ’ seats .
But just as the mighty Tyrannosaurus Rex evolved into the rock pigeon , right before our eyes we ’re witnessing the rapid devolution of the gopnik into something that can only be described as “ skinny dude with a bad mullet who tells everyone he ’s a brand manager but for now he works at a Evroset kiosk where he managed to five - finger enough cash to get himself a used Nissan Almera , which he loves more than anything which ever was , is , or shall be . ”
Nothing is more emblematic of the gopnik ’s tragic extinction than the fact that Leningrad ’s Shnur , a great fan of Gopnik Couture , is preparing to open a Gopnik museum in his native St. Petersburg .
Shnur ’s band romanticizes the gopniki to a middle - class audience which has finally come to appreciate them , albeit in a semi-ironic way only made possible by the gopnik ’s tragic extinction .
Even the original gopnik wellspring , Lugovsky Prospekt Dom 10 , is today a 3 - star hotel whose cheapest rooms run for $ 100 a night .
Like Faulkner ’s Old South and Tolstoi ’s dying landed gentry , we are celebrating and lamenting Russia ’s gopniki only now , when it is too late , and they can be little more to us than aesthetic objects , symbols of a bygone era which was far purer than ours , free of the self - conscious irony and highly mediated coolness , and the dull office life that defines the lives of more and more Russians in the Putin era .

WHAT THE POLITICIANS SAY ABOUT THE GOPNIK : An eXile Survey
* Oleg Lavrov , director of LDPR ’s Moscow ’s branch : “ We think gopniki are Russia ’s most powerful political force .
People make fun of us and call us the party of the marginaly — of gopniki , thieves , bums and drunks .
But see , these are people that no one else represents … we set up booths at train stations and at one point counted one million members .
When we nominated Malishkin [ former boxer and Zhirinovsky ’s body guard — Ed. ] as candidate for 2004 presidential elections , people were shocked .
Sure he ’s no intellectual , but the gopniks will vote for him . ”
* Yuri Nabutovsky , coordinator of SPS ’s regional operations : “ We ’re not really interested in the gopnik segment of the population .
We are … how do I say … we ’re too liberal for them .
SPS is looking for people that have their own views on the world … and that is definitely not them .
Gopniki do not have the necessary level of intellectual sophistication for us .
United Russia is probably better suited for them .
And anyway , United Russia is doing the most to attract them . ”
* United Russia ’s switchboard operator : “ We ’re doing many things to attract as many different kinds of people as possible .
If you want your question answered , please put it in writing . ”
* Andrei Samoshin , Fair Russia ’s Moscow representative : “ We ’re not United Russia , we ca n’t use federal funds for our programs .
Our outreach is limited .
In fact we ’re not really sure how good it is to expand … it ’s really not that important to us .
We do n’t want to have dead souls ’ in our party . ”
* Irina Palilova , Levada Center ’s political analyst / media liaison : “ [ Giggles ]
I ’d be hard - pressed to answer your question .
We do n’t classify people based on the gopnik criteria .
We classify people based on income , age , etc . ”

This is what the Champions League is all about : England ’s best side against Spain ’s best side in last season ’s final in Rome , Italy ’s best side against Germany ’s best side this season in Madrid .
This is an intriguing match - up between two sides who have underachieved in Europe in recent years , and between two of the greatest tacticians in modern times .
The Italy v Germany clash is emphasized when you consider the situation regarding both countries ’
UEFA coefficients ( which determines the number of European places each national league is allocated ) where Germany currently leads Italy by 0.155 points .
The basic result of that is that Serie A needs Inter to beat Bayern if it is to regain third place , and therefore retain its four Champions League places for 20011/ 12 .
This might seem a relatively tenuous , distant problem , but losing a fourth spot would be a huge embarrassment for Italy , and therefore we have an unlikely situation where Italy is depending on Jose Mourinho , a man who has become so unpopular across the country in recent months .
As well as being a playoff for that Champions League spot , this is also a playoff for the treble .
Both completed the domestic league and cup double within the past fortnight , and this game means one club will have the most successful season in their history , whilst the other will be left deflated at the end of an otherwise superb season .
The main interest on the pitch , of course , is the match - up between Arjen Robben and Wesley Sneijder , the two Dutch players discarded by Real Madrid last summer .
The two No 10s have been the key player for their respective new clubs , and the irony of them contesting the final at the Santiago Bernabeu is plain to see , especially when Real ’s monumental spending spree last summer saw them depart – for the fifth season in a row – at the second round stage .
It is a great contest too , for Lucio – who left Bayern for Inter last summer , and for Samuel Eto ’o , who could become both the first player to score three times in the Champions League final ( he is level with Raul on two ) and the first player to win back - to - back trebles with two different clubs .
Managers
This game is literally the master versus the student : Jose Mourinho worked for two years as Louis van Gaal ’s assistant at Barcelona , and together they won the league title both seasons .
Never before have they faced one another .
The two have further similarities .
Van Gaal ’s Champions League win with Ajax in 1995 was probably the 1990s equivalent of Mourinho ’s success with Porto in 2004 , probably the most impressive European Cup wins of those respective decades .
And both managers have won league titles in three separate countries – van Gaal in Holland ( Ajax and AZ ) , Spain ( Barcelona ) and now Germany ( Bayern ) ; Mourinho in Portugal ( Porto ) , England ( Chelsea ) and Italy ( Inter ) .
Few managers taste instant success in such a wide range of countries – in this final , it ’s more of a case of the special two , rather than the special one .
Despite them working together at Barcelona , they have become renowned for playing different brands of football – van Gaal is often seen as having continued the attacking brand of Dutch football epitomised by Total Football , Mourinho is painted as being a defensive , negative manager whose teams win without much style .
That might be slightly unfair on Mourinho , but the perceived differences in style only add to the excitement of this final .
Inter selection
Although Mourinho started the season playing a 4 - 3 - 1 - 2 , he has since pretty much permanently switched to a 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 / 4 - 2-1 - 3 system .
The main surprise in the second half of Inter season is how few surprises there have been .
Mourinho has a clearly - preferred system and an easily - identifiable first XI when all are available , especially given the troubles this season of two players who should have broken through permanently into the first team , Davide Santon and Mario Balotelli .
The main dilemma is who to replace the suspended Thiago Motta with , in a crucial role for Inter ( more on that later ) .
There are three options for Mourinho here .
Playing Dejan Stankovic there would be a very attacking move , whilst Sulley Muntari would provide more of a battling quality .
The most likely replacement , however , is Cristian Chivu , although this may mean that he starts at left - back , with Javier Zanetti moving forward into midfield , as he did , for example , against Fiorentina .
Elsewhere , the line - up is fairly predictable – there has been speculation that Balotelli could replace Pandev , but this looks unlikely given the defensive job Inter ’s left - winger will have to do against Philip Lahm .
Bayern selection
Like Inter , Bayern ’s starting XI in the second half of the season has been fairly predictable and they have stuck to a 4 - 4 - 2 / 4 - 2-3- 1 shape .
The spanner in the works is Franck Ribery ’s suspension – if van Gaal is keen to keep the same playing system , with inverted wingers , then Hamit Altintop will start , which seems the likely scenario according to the German press .
There would be value , though , in fielding Danijel Pranjic there , a more defensive option , considering the forward surges of Maicon will have to be looked after .
Elsewhere the line - up should be the same as they have fielded throughout the season , with Ivica Olic and Thomas Muller upfront .
Tactics
Inter have tended to sit back and soak up pressure in their Champions League knockout run , but given the nature of Bayern ’s slightly suspect backline , attack might be the name of the game .
Fielding a forward four in a 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 is essentially quite a defensive shape from Mourinho , as its main aim is to contain the opposition full - backs – but the attacking benefit of fielding four attacking players like this is clear , and means Inter can really go for it from the off .
The Chivu / Zanetti dilemma is an interesting one , because Inter ’s left - back will have the most important defensive job up against Arjen Robben , whilst their central midfield partner for Cambisso might be the freest player on the pitch and see a lot of the ball .
Zanetti ’s superior passing ability means he will probably get the nod in midfield , with Chivu sticking solidly to Robben on the flank , although the two could switch , especially if the man who starts at left - back picks up a booking .
Wesley Sneijder position will also be interesting , as he may come into direct confrontation with his compatriot Mark van Bommel .
If van Bommel is drawn up into the pitch to confront Inter ’s midfielders , though , Sneijder may find himself with space , and his tendency to drift to the left makes it difficult for the centre - backs to pick up .
Bayern are set up quite well to face Inter ’s defence .
Walter Samuel and Lucio have coped very well with tall forwards like Didier Drogba and Zlatan Ibrahimovic , but in Serie A they have sometimes struggled against smaller , pacier forwards .
The work rate of Olic and Muller will cause them problems , and Muller will also have a defensive job to do on Esteban Cambiasso when Bayern lose the ball .
Bayern will struggle to get their full - backs forward if Inter play 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 , and they may have a slight numerical disadvantage in midfield too .
They have depended on Robben throughout the season , and may well do more than ever in this game tonight .
Inter ’s three central midfielders ( if you include Sneijder ) should , in theory , outnumber Byaern ’s two .
Therefore , expect Thomas Muller to drop back to ease the pressure on Schweinsteiger and van Bommel , and perhaps Martin Demichelis might step up into midfield when Bayern have the ball , as he did so well against Manchester United .
Moves to watch out for :
Inter :
Wesley Sneijder plays slightly behind Inter ’s front three , and slightly to the left of the pitch .
When the ball is on the right - hand side , Inter ’s three forwards move towards the ball , often leaving Sneijder unmarked on the edge of the area , or at the far post , such as against Barca .
Bayern :
Bayern also use their forwards to make space for their No 10 .
Muller and Olic move towards the far post , increasing the distance between left centre - back , and left - back , allowing Robben to cut in .
Alternatively , one of the strikers makes a run towards Robben ’s wing , dragging that defender out of position , and creating space for Robben in the centre of the pitch .
This video shows how much he likes to cut inside :
The game could be won by these two producing a moment of individual genius – otherwise , it will be won in the centre of midfield .
It should be a tight match , but Inter start as favourites .

The rate of ice loss slowed in the first half of July , primarily because of a change in atmospheric circulation .
The dipole anomaly , an atmospheric pattern that dominated the Arctic in June , broke down .
It was replaced by a pattern of low - pressure systems tracking across northern Eurasia and then into the central Arctic Ocean .
About the data .
Figure 1 . Daily Arctic sea ice extent on July 15 was 8.37 million square kilometers ( 3.23 million square miles ) .
The orange line shows the 1979 to 2000 median extent for that day .
The black cross indicates the geographic North Pole .

High - resolution image Overview of conditions From July 1 to 15 , Arctic sea ice extent declined an average of 60,500 square kilometers ( 23,400 square miles ) per day , 22,500 square kilometers ( 8,690 square miles ) per day slower than the 1979 to 2000 average and substantially slower than the rate of decline in May and June .
Ice extent remained lower than normal in all regions of the Arctic , with open water developing along the coasts of northwest Canada , Alaska and Siberia .
Figure 2 .
The graph above shows daily Arctic sea ice extent as of July 15 , 2010 .
The solid light blue line indicates 2010 ; dashed green shows 2007 ; solid pink shows 2006 , and solid gray indicates average extent from 1979 to 2000 .
The gray area around the average line shows the two standard deviation range of the data .

As of July 15 , total extent was 8.37 million square kilometers ( 3.23 million square miles ) , which is 1.62 million square kilometers ( 625,000 square miles ) below the 1979 to 2000 average for the same date , but 360,000 square kilometers ( 139,000 square miles ) above July 15 , 2007 , the lowest extent for that date in the satellite record .

High - resolution image A change in circulation Through much of May and June , high pressure dominated the Beaufort Sea with low pressure over Siberia .
Winds associated with this pattern , known as the dipole anomaly , helped speed up ice loss by pushing ice away from the coast and promoting melt .
However , the dipole anomaly pattern broke down in early July .
In the first half of July , cyclones ( low pressure systems ) generated over northern Eurasia tracked eastward along the Siberian coast and then into the central Arctic Ocean , where they tend to stall .
This cyclone pattern is quite common in summer .
The low - pressure cells have brought cooler and cloudier conditions over the Arctic Ocean .
They have also promoted a cyclonic ( anticlockwise ) sea ice motion , which acts to spread the existing ice over a larger area .
All of these factors likely contributed to the slower rate of ice loss over the past few weeks .
In the last few days , high pressure has started to build again in the Beaufort Sea , but whether this will continue remains to be seen .

High - resolution image Areas of diffuse ice Satellite images provided by the University of Bremen , from the NASA Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer – Earth Observing System ( AMSR - E ) , show areas of low ice concentration over the central Arctic pack ice .
While we normally report on the extent of area covered by at least fifteen percent sea ice , a more reliable measurement , it is also valuable to look at ice concentration values , which can reveal conditions in more detail .
However , it can be difficult to interpret AMSR - E concentration data during the summer , because microwave signals associated with low ice concentration look very much like signals associated with surface melt .
Weather effects can also cause false concentration signals .
By comparing AMSR - E data with data from other satellites , we can determine which areas of apparent low - concentration ice are real , and which appear to be low because of melt or atmospheric effects .
Visible - band images from the NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS ) sensor show that some of the areas of apparent low ice concentration within the central pack ice are actually melt and atmospheric effects .
However , the MODIS data also confirm that there are substantial areas of open water within the pack ice , such as near the North Pole and in the Beaufort Sea .
Open water in the interior pack ice is not unprecedented .
Winds can push the ice apart , creating openings in the pack ice .
These areas of open water may close up quickly if the wind changes , but since the dark areas of open water readily absorb solar energy , they can also lead to more extensive melt .
Have you ever thought about becoming an indie game developer ?
Has your game company just gone under , sick of working for publishers or do you just want to break into the games industry ?
Whatever the reason , one thing that rings true for all Indie developers is the goal of making a good game .
A lot of friends in the games industry have recently made the decision to “ go Indie ” .
I thought I ’d write up my guide to becoming an indie game developer taken from my experience and the experience of friends both starting out and with completed independent games .
Is it for you ?
Indie game development is n’t for everyone .
The pay is low , you typically need a “ day job ” and you need to work extremely hard for little reward at the beginning .
It ’s not all bad though as you are your own boss ( and project manager ) , the monetary rewards can be higher and the reward of creating something of your own is overwhelming .
If you ’re passionate about making games then the negatives might seem inconsequential , however I ’d recommend taking some time to think them through .
You need to be well informed about how long indie games take to develop and you need to be realistic with the goals you set .
My biggest advice is to talk to people who have done it before .
These guys can tell you where the stumbling blocks are , and give you a realistic view into what life will be like once you take the plunge .
Set Concrete , Realistic Milestones
Many indie games are killed by a lack of interest after a few months or years of development .
By keeping your goals realistic and achievable you are reducing the chances of failing in the worst way , by not completing the game .
Always have one primary goal you are heading towards ( e.g. alpha , beta , release ) .
The primary goal should be made up of smaller , measurable goals ( e.g. implementing level 5 ) .
Finally these smaller goals should be broken up into a constant “ to do ” list .
If you have any spare time , you should know exactly what you should be working on next .
This cuts down on procrastination and helps you have a clear direction for the coming days and weeks .
Find a Great Team !
Realistically , there are few games that can be created by a single person .
Your team needs to cover all the bases – programming , design , art , audio , project management .
Even if you have all these skills , having at least one other person will half the amount of work you have to do and double the number of people contributing to game ideas and “ finding the fun ” .
Find people who are passionate about game development .
Passion trumps ability when it comes to independent games .
As long as the team member is good at their job , it ’s more important to find someone who ’s passionate then the very best in their field .
The lack of short and medium term rewards from indie game development means the team will be rely on their passion to make it to the end - game .
Do n’t expect to “ fill the gaps ” at the end of a project by slotting someone in once everything else is done .
You need a well rounded team from the outset so all areas of the game get enough love and attention .
Different people have differing levels of time they can invest .
Work this out up - front and all agree on your level of commitment .
Roughly schedule the entire game so everyone is area of expectations and can commit to the duration of the project .
Get a day job
Most people will need a “ day job ” to pay the bills while they live the dream of being an indie developer .
Be careful if you plan on living off your savings as they disappear quickly , and there ’s nothing worse than having to go back to working full - time because you ran out of money .
Find the highest paid job you can , no matter how boring .
Think of it as a short - term solution to the problem of funding your own indie game .
You can probably find a higher paid job outside the games industry by looking at similar industry that also use your talents .
Programmers can take on business contracts , artists can go freelance , designers can become technical writers and project managers can work on “ normal ” software projects .
Use your imagination and focus on having as much time as possible to work on your game while still paying the bills .
Learn project management
Love it or hate it , project management needs to be done .
Indie teams rarely have one person dedicated to project management , and so the task is shared throughout the team .
This includes scheduling , planning and making sure they are met .
A great way for people to lose focus and motivation is not have a clear plan for the project .
Look at one of the many agile development methodologies ( e.g. scrum ) as a great way to keep from bogging down in project management .
There are plenty of great tools available to help with project management , here are a few I ’d recommend looking at :
Acunote
Jira
FogBUGZ
Get pragmatic
Be pragmatic in everything you do .
Aiming for perfection will give you a great tech demo that no one will buy .
People will pay for a great game , not great technology .
Since working for myself I ’ve stepped into what I call “ Fanatical Pragmatism ” .
Do the absolute minimum required to achieve your current goals without digging yourself into a corner .
Overestimate time and money
Everything always takes longer and costs more than you expect when you turn indie .
All the indie developers I know have spent far more money and have taken over double the time they first expected .
Constantly update schedules to keep a realistic target for your milestones .
When the schedule starts to slip , be realistic and evaluate if everyone is happy continuing .
My recommendation is to estimate how long the game will take to create and how much it will cost and multiply these values by three .
Either you ’ll be happy working on the game for this long ( and can afford to ) or you need to cut back the scope of the game .
Make constant playable builds
Aim for a playable prototype as early as possible .
It ’s difficult to be objective with your own game , so you need to reply on other people ’s opinions .
Listen to their feedback and stop if your game is no good .
There ’s no point spending months developing a game that ’s no good .
Constantly create playable demos and show everyone you know .
Keep it small and watch feature creep
Keep the design tight and focussed .
Find the fun parts first and build only what ’s necessary .
You ’re an indie developer so people wo n’t expect a AAA title .
Aim for a lower price point and people ’s expectations will be lower .
All the indie developers I ’ve spoken to have had major feature creep causing their schedules to blow out .
The smaller you can start your design out , and keep it that way , the more success your project will have .
Your platform choice will help you keep things small …
Pick the right platform
The best choices for an indie developer are PC , iPhone and web .
The specific choice comes down to risk versus reward .
PC games are generally larger and therefore higher risk , however they also have a greater chance of making good money .
Web games are particularly good for a first game , just do n’t expect to make much money .
There is a lot of debate at the moment about monetizing flash games and unfortunately the platform still seems a little too immature .
People just are n’t prepared to pay for a flash game .
There are numerous ways around this ( like micro- payments ) , LostGarden has a great series on this .
Conclusion
So this is a general list of things to prepare you for becoming an independent game developer .
It ’s a long , slow slog , but it ’s worth the effort .
By staying focussed and making intelligent decisions as you go you ’ll put yourself in a great position .
Are you working on an indie game now , or would you like to ?
Leave your thoughts and experiences in the comments .
In this post , I 'll talk about the REMOVE_ASSET and INSTALL_ASSET mechanisms that can be invoked by Google via Android 's GTalkService to not only remotely remove applications from an Android device but also remotely install new applications .
RootStrap Background
So if you did n't check out my slides from SummerCon last week in NYC , I talked a bit about a program called RootStrap in the second half of my talk .
RootStrap is intended as an example of an application that could be used to bootstrap a rootkit ( hence the name ) .
Summed up as briefly as possible , RootStrap phones home periodically to fetch remote native ARM code and executes it outside the Dalvik VM .
An attacker could use such an approach to gain a large install base for a seemingly innocent application and then push down a local privilege escalation exploit as soon as a new vulnerability is discovered in the Linux kernel and root the device .
Since carriers are fairly conservative in pushing out OTA patches for their devices , an attacker could easily push out their malicious payload before the devices were patched .
In addition to the sample RootStrap application , I also posted an innocent looking app called " Twilight Eclipse Preview " that claimed to be a preview of the upcoming Twilight Eclipse movie to the Android Market .
The Twilight app was actually just RootStrap in disguise , displaying a Twilight image while phoning home to check for new payloads to pull down and execute .
Obviously , none of these payloads were actually malicious in nature .
The Twilight app got \~200 downloads in the first 24 hours but started slowing down as it received bad reviews ... apparently I do n't have a future in marketing mobile apps to Twilight teens .
Android Remote Kill
In response to Andy 's coverage on Forbes of my SummerCon presentation , Google asked me to withdraw my applications from the market , which I had no problem doing .
Later that day , I noticed a couple of notifications on my phone :
Sweet , Google had just invoked their remote kill functionality !
Apparently not many people have dug into the vending APK , but I 've known about the REMOVE_ASSET functionality for a while so it was neat to see it being invoked on my phone .
I verified my assumptions of the REMOVE_ASSET intent by bringing up the GTalkService monitor :
Talking with Rich later , this was apparently the first time the Android team invoked the remote kill functionality .
I had assumed it had been used frequently in the past , but apparently attackers have been slacking off .
Rich covered their use of the remote kill functionality on the Android Developers blog today .
Now , the Android platform not only allows for the removal of applications remotely via the REMOVE_ASSET intent , but also allows for the installation of new applications via the INSTALL_ASSET intent .
If some people are upset that Google retains the ability to kill applications remotely ( I personally prefer the potential security gains of the functionality ) , I fear what they'd think of the INSTALL_ASSET feature . ;-)
The GTalkService Connection
So just how does the remote install and remote kill functionality work on the Android platform ?
I actually talked about this functionality in my SummerCon slides as well when discussing the operation of the Android Market and its protocol .
Your Android device maintains a persistent TCP / SSL / XMPP connection to Google 's GTalk servers at all times over your device 's data connection ( either your mobile data service or WiFi ) .
This connection is managed by a service aptly named GTalkService .
Your device will automatically re-establish this persistent connection whenever you move between networks and periodically sends heartbeat messages to Google 's servers .
The GTalkService connection allows Google to push down messages to your device .
For example , Google 's recently announced C2DM ( cloud to device messaging ) platform uses this connection to provide push functionality to third - party apps .
As seen in slide # 11 and # 12 of my presentation , the GTalkService is actually used during the normal Android Market install process .
Instead of downloading the APK from the Market , clicking ' Install ' will trigger Google 's servers to push a INSTALL_ASSET message down the GTalkService pipe .
Upon receiving this message , your phone will download and install the APK .
As expected , the REMOVE_ASSET intent functions similarly .
Google can push a REMOVE_ASSET message down to all the Android phones in order to remote kill a particular application deemed malicious .
Both the INSTALL_ASSET and REMOVE_ASSET functionality are implemented in the vending APK :
Security Concerns
While remotely removing apps might ruffle the feathers of people who like the feeling of having full control over their device , the remote install functionality is of more concern from a security perspective .
As I mention on slide # 14 , if an attacker is able to MITM this SSL GTalkService connection for a particular device , it may be possible to spoof these INSTALL_ASSET messages to deliver a malicious application payload .
If Google 's GTalkService servers were compromised , the malicious impact would obviously be a bit more widespread .
You better believe that myself and others are taking a careful look at these code paths . :-)

The aid ship trying to break the Gaza blockade has ignored repeated demands from Israeli warships to divert to the Israeli port of Ashdod .
The Israeli military says it has made radio contact with the 1200 - tonne Rachel Corrie , urging it to change course for Ashdod and not Gaza , because of the ongoing blockade .
" A short time ago we have contacted the boat and we 've asked them politely to change their course to Ashdod port , " said Israeli military spokeswoman Lieutenant - Colonel Avital Liebovich .
" If they will choose to do so we promised them we wo n't board the ship - they will be able to pass the cargo to security inspection in Ashdod port and we 'll pass it on to Gaza . "
But the ship 's crew has ignored the order and is continuing towards Gaza .
Israeli ships surrounded the Rachel Corrie about 30 nautical miles from Gaza in the Mediterranean Sea .
But so far military authorities have not boarded the ship .
The Irish - owned vessel - named after American pro-Palestinian activist Rachel Corrie , who was killed in the Gaza Strip in 2003 - has 11 passengers on board .
It is carrying tonnes of aid for Gaza , including cement , which Israel bans because of concerns it could be used to produce weapons .
Israel has offered to deliver the aid itself if it passes a security inspection , but those on board the Rachel Corrie have refused .
The passengers have said they will not resist if Israeli authorities take over the ship .
Those onboard say they are prepared for a confrontation , but that they do not have weapons on the ship .
One of the ship 's crew , Derek Graham , says they have a clear plan in case they are stopped .
" There will be no resistance put up by us whatsoever , " he said .
" I have instructed everybody to sit at midships - this includes the crew that are not essential to the running of the ship - make sure that they are sitting on the ground with the hands shown , the palms of their hands shown , to show they have no weapons of any kind in their hands , because we do not want [ what happened ] last Monday morning . "
Mr Graham was referring to the incident five days earlier , when nine men were killed by Israeli commandos who boarded a Turkish ship heading for Gaza .

UPDATE : The video of Emerson 's interview where he confirms this information is posted on the Media Mentions section of the site for those that want to check it out .
UPDATE : As many fans have pointed out , this epilogue will be available on the COMPLETE COLLECTION not just the Season 6 DVD .
So for those wondering what happened with Ben and Hurley after the Ajira plane takes off , well you are in luck !
Apparently there are an additional 12 - 14 minutes that will be an " epilogue " that will be included on the Season 6 DVD set .
Of course this is a part of ABC 's way of making some more money , but at least there is more footage to see .
Also some are speculating this is where we will see Walt .
Here is the story from E !
Online :
One more reason to love Michael Emerson :
He just spilled the goods on an amazing surprise for any Lost fan planning to buy the final , sixth - season DVD .
( And trust me , now all of you will be buying it . )
There will be more Lost .
There is more to the story , and we will get to see it !
Praise Jacob !

Either in anticipation of QE2 which will cut the value of the dollar by another 50 % once another $ 2 trillion in toxic crap becomes the " assets " backing the viability of the dollar , or just because they are sick of Fed policies , mid-Michigan has taken monetary matters into their own hands , and in one simple act , completely bypassed the destabilizing influence of the domestic currency printers .
As ConnectMidMichigan reports , " New types of money are popping up across Mid-Michigan and supporters say , it 's not counterfeit , but rather a competing currency .
Right now , you can buy a meal or visit a chiropractor without using actual U.S. legal tender . "
The plan is so simple , it just may work - after all if one can't get away from the Fed 's probing and pickpocketing long fingers , all one has to do is learn to live without its parasitic pieces of paper .
And not just paper : " I sell three or four every single day and then I get one or two back a week , " said Dave Gillie , owner of Gillies Coney Island Restaurant in Genesee Township .
Gillie also accepts silver , gold , copper and other precious metals to pay for food . "
So yes , you can eat gold .... and load up your gas tank with it .
More from CMM :
" Do people have to accept dollars or money ?
No , they don't , " Gillie said .
" They can accept anything they want or they can refuse to accept anything . "
He 's absolutely right .
The U.S. Treasury Department says the Coinage Act of 1965 says " private businesses are free to develop their own policies on whether or not to accept cash , unless there is a state law which says otherwise . "
That allows gas stations to say they do n't accept 50 - or $ 100 bills after a certain time of day in hopes of not getting robbed .
A chiropractic office in Lapeer County 's Deerfield Township allows creativity when it comes to payment .
" This establishment accepts any form of silver , gold , chicken , apple pie , if someone works it out with me , " said Jeff Kotchounian of Deerfield Chiropractic .
" I 've taken many things . "
Jeff Kotchounian says he 's used this Ron Paul half troy ounce of silver to get $ 25 worth of gas from a local station .
While the government and banks do n't accept them , many others do .
So why is there interest in these competing currencies ?
Is it just novelty or is there something deeper ?
If the ruling kleptocrats , pardon , the Fed , demand on being such an intimate part of everyday life , and procuring all of the population 's real wealth and cash producing assets in the process , said population has a choice of either going with this sheepish approach , and meekly allowing the loaded gun to be parked at its temple , or do what Michigan , with its 99.9 % real unemployment , has decided to do .

A judge in New York has granted bail to one woman accused of spying for Russia and denied bail to two other suspects .
Judge Ronald Ellis said journalist Vicky Pelaez could be freed on $ 250,000 ( £ 167,000 ) bail and placed under house arrest as soon as Tuesday .
A bail hearing for her husband , Juan Lazaro , was postponed .
Prosecutors say he has admitted working for Russia .
Bail hearings for five other alleged Russian spies were delayed by courts in Boston and Alexandria in Virginia .
Those denied bail in New York City were the suspects named as Cynthia and Richard Murphy , who had been living in New Jersey .
SPY RING SUSPECTS Vicky Pelaez - freed on bail in New York
Juan Lazaro ( husband of Ms Pelaez ) - bail hearing postponed
Anna Chapman - denied bail in New York
Richard and Cynthia Murphy - denied bail in New York
Donald Howard Heathfield , Tracey Lee Ann Foley - hearing adjourned until 16 July in Boston
Michael Zottoli , Patricia Mills , Mikhail Semenko - hearing due 2 July in Virginia
Christopher Metsos - missing in Cyprus after being granted bail
The judge said he could not be certain of who they were and so could not grant bail , the BBC's Laura Trevelyan in New York reports .
The pair sat impassively in court , giving away very little of what they were thinking , our correspondent says .
Whereas prosecutors argued that they were part of a powerful and sophisticated espionage network , the suspects ' defence lawyers disputed whether they would have been in a position to pass anything valuable to Russia , our correspondent adds .
Granting Ms Pelaez bail under strict conditions , the judge said she was a US citizen and did not appear to be trained as a spy .
The nine have been held since they were arrested on Sunday with a 10th suspect .
An 11th suspect disappeared in Cyprus after he was released on bail .
The alleged agents are accused of posing as ordinary residents to collect information for Russian intelligence .
The 10th suspect , using the name Anna Chapman , had her bail request denied by a US court on Monday .
We heard yet more James Bond - style language in a case already dripping with it Laura Trevelyan A glimpse of suburban ' spycraft '
US police moved in on the group after an investigation lasting more than a decade .
Earlier on Thursday , prosecutors said Juan Lazaro had confessed to working for Russia 's intelligence service .
Prosecutors said he had admitted that " Juan Lazaro " was not his real name and that his home in Yonkers had been paid for by Russian intelligence .
He is also said to have confessed that his wife passed letters to the " service " on his behalf .
He told investigators that even though he loved his son , " he would not violate his loyalty to the ' service ' even for his son " , prosecutors wrote in a court document .
Federal prosecutors also submitted evidence to the court that $ 80,000 in new $ 100 bills had been found in a safe - deposit box belonging to Mr and Mrs Murphy , along with a false birth certificate for Mr Murphy .
Assistant US Attorney Michael Farbiarz argued against the four being granted bail , saying : " There are a lot of Russian government officials in the United States who are actively assisting this conspiracy . "
The evidence in the case was " extraordinarily strong " and continuing to mount , he told the judge .
Lawyer Donna Newman , defending Mr Murphy , said he was a stay - at - home dad whose networking was with other parents at kindergarten .
' Femme fatale '
In Boston , US Federal Judge Jennifer Boal ordered that Donald Howard Heathfield and another suspect identified in court papers as Tracey Lee Ann Foley remain in custody until the new hearing on 16 July .

One suspect named as Anna Chapman had already been denied bail
Judge Boal also ordered a hearing to consider custody for the couple 's two children .
Mr Heathfield 's defence lawyer , Peter Krupp , told the judge the case against his client was " extremely thin " .
" It essentially suggests that they successfully infiltrated neighbourhoods , cocktail parties and the PTA , " Mr Krupp said .
In Alexandria , Virginia , a bail hearing due to take place on Thursday for the suspects named as Michael Zottoli , Patricia Mills and Mikhail Semenko was delayed until Friday .
Ms Chapman , 28 , has been painted as the femme fatale of the alleged spy ring , with several glamorous photos posted on her page on Facebook .
The 10 suspects held in the US are accused of trying to blend into American society and cultivate contacts among policy makers in order to pass information on to Russian intelligence .
They are accused of conspiracy to act as unlawful agents of a foreign government , a crime less serious than espionage but which carries up to five years in prison .
Most of them are believed to be Russians living under false names .
Moscow initially reacted angrily to the allegations but both sides have said they will not let it harm relations .
Suspect vanishes
The 11th suspect disappeared in Cyprus on Wednesday .
Officials in Washington have expressed disappointment that Cypriot officials freed him on bail .
The man , a Canadian passport holder , was named by police as Christopher Metsos .
He was due to sign in at a police station in the coastal town of Larnaca on Wednesday but did not show up .
He was held at Larnaca airport on Tuesday as he tried to board a plane to Budapest , a day after the US said it had held 10 other suspects .
Mr Metsos was awaiting a hearing for extradition to the US .
Aged 54 or 55 , he is depicted by US prosecutors as the alleged spy ring 's shadowy money man , visiting the US as early as 2004 to deliver bags of cash to its members .
Accused of money laundering , he was released on bail of 26,500 euros ( £ 21,700 ; $ 32,500 ) to await an extradition hearing scheduled for 29 July .
Cyprus has issued an arrest warrant for him on Thursday but police were not certain whether he remained on the island .

What WikiLeaks did was brilliant journalism , and the bleating critics from the president on down are revealing just how low a regard they have for the truth .
As with Richard Nixon ’s rage against the publication of the Pentagon Papers , our leaders are troubled not by the prospect of these revelations endangering troops but rather of endangering their own political careers .
It is our president who unnecessarily sacrifices the lives of our soldiers and not those in the press who let the public in on the folly of the mission itself .
What the documents exposed is the depth of chicanery that surrounds the Afghanistan occupation at every turn because we have stumbled into a regional quagmire of such dark and immense proportions that any attempt to connect this failed misadventure with a recognizable US national security interest is doomed .
What is revealed on page after page is that none of the local actors , be they labeled friend or foe , give a whit about our president ’s agenda .
They are focused on prizes , passions and causes that are obsessively homegrown .
Our fixation on Al Qaeda has nothing to do with them .
President Barack Obama ’s top national security adviser admitted as much when he said last December that there were fewer than 100 of those foreign fighters left in Afghanistan .
Those who do remain in the region are hunkered down in Pakistan , and as the leaked documents reveal , that nation is just toying with us by pretending to cooperate while its intelligence service continues to support our proclaimed enemies .
As Gen. Stanley McChrystal made clear in his famous report , the battles in Afghanistan are tribal in nature and the agendas are local — be they about drugs , religion or the economic power of military blackmail .
The documents contain a steady drumbeat of local hustles that are certainly deadly but rise to the level of a national security threat against the United States only when we insist on making their history our own .
It has ever been so with the Afghans , and our continued attempt to bend their passions to our purposes will always lead to horrid results .
That is , in fact , just how their nation came to be the launching pad for the 9/11 attacks , which is the ostensible purpose of our occupation .
We meddled in their history in a grand cold war adventure to humble the Soviets by attacking the secular government in Kabul with which Moscow sided .
When presidential press secretary Robert Gibbs intones , “ We are in this region of the world because of what happened on 9/11 , ” he is mouthing a dangerous half - truth .
The opposite is the case : 9/11 happened because the United States was in the region , and not the other way around .
Entanglement with Afghanistan has been based on a tissue of lies since day one , when Jimmy Carter first decided to throw in with the religious fanatics there , as current Secretary of Defense Robert Gates revealed in his 1996 memoir .
Gates had served on Carter ’s National Security Council and in his book exposed what the publisher touted as “ Carter ’s never - before revealed covert support to Afghan mujahedeen — six months before the Soviets invaded . ”
Our government recruited terrorists from the Arab world to go to Afghanistan and fight in that holy war against godless communism with even greater enthusiasm during the presidency of Ronald Reagan , who proclaimed the Muslim fanatics “ freedom fighters . ”
As the 9/11 Commission report stated , those freedom fighters included Osama bin Laden and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , the alleged architect of the 9/11 attacks .
Three years before that attack , Zbigniew Brzezinski , Carter ’s national security adviser , was asked in an interview with Le Nouvel Observateur if he regretted “ having given arms and advice to future terrorists , ” and he answered : “ What is most important to the history of the world ?
Some stirred - up Muslims or the liberation of Central Europe and the end of the cold war ? ”
One of Carter ’s advisers back then was Richard Holbrooke , now Obama ’s top civilian adviser on Afghanistan .
Clearly he knows quite a bit about stirring up Muslims , and someone should ask him about the brilliant decision to give heat - seeking Stinger rockets to those same fanatics who then turned them against our side , according to the recently disclosed documents .
They never learn .
It was Holbrooke who helped design the Vietnam - era assassination programs exposed in the Pentagon Papers and now replicated in the Afghanistan documents .
Thanks to Daniel Ellsberg , who risked much to make the record of the Vietnam War public , we learned about the madness that Holbrooke and others were creating .
We should be grateful to the whistle - blowers who gave us the Afghanistan war documents for once again letting us in on the sick joke that passes for US foreign policy .

Nelson says no to climate vote
Democratic Sen . Ben Nelson of Nebraska said Thursday he would not support a procedural vote later this month to begin debate on a climate bill that includes a cap on electric utility emissions , a declaration that underscores the tough climb that Majority Leader Harry Reid will have in trying to cobble together a 60 - vote supermajority on the controversial issue .
“ A carbon tax or trade piece would significantly increase the utility rates in Nebraska for businesses , agriculture and individuals , ” the Nebraska Democrat told POLITICO .
“ I do n’t think that ’s an appropriate way to go .
And while I ’d usually vote for a motion to proceed , this is so extraordinary , that I just ca n’t bring myself to do that . ”

Nelson has long been known as an opponent of proposals for tackling greenhouse gases with a cap - and - trade plan .
But his opposition to the procedural vote stands out given party discipline that at least allows the majority leader to take a bill up on the floor .
Environmentalists tracking the debate said earlier this week that they expect most Democrats will vote for the motion to proceed out of deference to Reid and President Barack Obama .
In 2008 , Nelson voted for the motion to proceed on an economy - wide climate bill authored by Sens. Joe Lieberman ( I - Conn . ) , John Warner ( R - Va. ) and Barbara Boxer ( D - Calif . ) .
The procedural vote — 74 - 14 — included 32 Republicans who saw the floor debate as an opportunity to criticize Democrats for supporting a measure that would increase gasoline prices .
Several other senators are holding their cards close on how they ’d vote on the procedural question on the next climate bill .
“ I ’ll wait to see what the leadership position is before I make a decision on what I ’d do , ” said Judd Gregg ( R - N.H. ) , who voted for the motion to proceed in 2008 alongside long - time GOP climate opponents Kit Bond of Missouri , John Cornyn of Texas and David Vitter of Louisiana .
Reid told reporters on Tuesday that he was aiming to begin floor debate on the climate and energy bill as soon as the week of July 26 .
The legislation is expected to come in four parts : an oil spill response ; a clean - energy and job - creation title based on work done in the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee ; a tax package from the Senate Finance Committee ; and a section that deals with greenhouse gas emissions from the electric utility industry .

( Stuff we did n't have time for in today 's audio report ) ...
Counterterrorism police have targeted hundreds of surveillance cameras on two Muslim areas of Birmingham , enabling them to track the precise movements of people entering and leaving the neighbourhoods .
The project has principally been sold to locals as an attempt to combat antisocial behaviour , vehicle crime and drug dealing in the area .
But the cameras have been paid for by a £ 3 m grant from a government fund , the Terrorism and Allied Matters Fund , which is administered by the Association of Chief Police Officers .
About 150 automatic numberplate recognition ( ANPR ) cameras have been installed in Washwood Heath and Sparkbrook in recent months .
Birmingham's two predominantly Muslim suburbs will be covered by three times more ANPR cameras than are used to monitor the entire city centre .
They include about 40 cameras classed as " covert " , meaning they have been concealed from public view .
The funding arrangement was not made clear to the handful of councillors who were briefed that the cameras would appear in their area .
Instead , they were told only that the money had come from the Home Office .
" I raised my concern then : is this really about spying ? " said Salma Yaqoob , a member of the Respect party and councillor for Sparkbrook .
" The terrorism aspect was certainly not emphasised in that meeting .
In fact it was me having to be portrayed as the awkward squad , or even paranoid , for even raising the issue of whether this was really about counterterrorism .
They were very much saying , ' No , this is about burglary and crime . ' "
The criteria for TAM funds state clearly that a police force must prove a project will " deter or prevent terrorism or help to prosecute those responsible " .
Police sources said the initiative , code - named Project Champion , is the first of its kind in the UK that seeks to monitor a population seen as " at risk " of extremism .
When the cameras become operative , residents will not be able to drive into or leave the two neighbourhoods without their movements being tracked .
Officials maintain the cameras will prove useful for tackling a whole range crime .
The areas were ringfenced for intense surveillance in 2007 after a police investigation into a suspected plot to kidnap and kill a British soldier in the area .
The Safer Birmingham Partnership , a joint initiative between police and the local authority which will run the cameras , expressed " regret " there had not been fuller consultation .
Senior SBP officials said they only became aware that the cameras were paid for by counterterrorism funds as a result of Guardian inquiries .
Jackie Russell , the director of the partnership , said : " Just because the funding has an interest in counterterrorism does n't mean that for us , that is our focus .
For us , it is about community safety . "
Steve Jolly , a local activist leading a campaign to have the cameras removed , called on the deputy prime minister to intervene : " Nick Clegg has made a real point of emphatically drawing attention to the surveillance society and promising to stop unnecessary infringements of privacy , " he said .
" I think we should hold him to his word , and say , ' Look at what is happening in Birmingham – are you going to allow it to go ahead ? ' "
Onus is now on business to prevent dishonesty and act seen as indirect response to BAE case
" Fragmented and complex " anti-corruption laws dating back to the 1880s were finally overhauled last week with the passing of what experts describe as one of the most significant reforms to corporate criminal law in a century .
The Bribery Act , which received royal assent last Thursday , heralds a clampdown on large UK businesses making payments to officials overseas to facilitate business , say experts .
The new act has introduced an offence of corporate failure to prevent bribery .
It is the first time such a law has existed in the UK .
It also requires companies to have " adequate processes " in place to prevent such offences .
The act is seen as a response to the BAE Systems case , where the prosecution against the defence company was dropped after the intervention of Lord Goldsmith , then attorney general .
Earlier this year , BAE agreed to pay £ 300 m in fines after signing up to a plea bargain with Britain 's Serious Fraud Office and the US department of justice .
But the case has had a long - term impact on Britain 's reputation : its position in the international " corruption index " has slipped to 17th , behind Japan , Hong Kong and Austria .
" The strictness of the act can be seen as an indirect consequence of the BAE case and the damage done to the UK 's international reputation by the government 's handling of it , " said Eoin O'Shea , head of the anti-corruption group at Lawrence Graham , an international business law firm .
" The act will force British businesses to be proactive in tackling bribery . "
The offence of failing to prevent bribery is " strict liability " , so that failure to have adequate processes will result in prosecution , regardless of whether prosecutors can show corrupt intent .
Experts have predicted that the new rules will lead to an increase in investigations .
Government figures indicate a £ 2 m annual cost of extra investigations , prosecutions and court hearings .
" Any company not actively examining the history of its third - party relationships to determine exposure to bribery and corruption risk will have significant difficulties in being able to demonstrate compliance with the new law , " said David Leppan , founder of World - Check , a risk intelligence company that has launched a " Bribery Act solution " to help multinationals comply with stricter rules .
However , the legislation continued to attract controversy during its final stages in parliament because of defences available to law enforcement agencies .
The act proposed to exempt them from corrupt behaviour where " necessary for the prevention of a serious crime " , but this defence was removed at the last minute and now applies only to the intelligence services and armed forces .
Corporate executives have expressed concern that the measures will place them at a competitive disadvantage to companies in the United States , as measures in the new law such as the ban on so - called " facilitation payments " go further than US anti-corruption rules .
The Tories have also criticised the " unacceptable rush " of the bill through parliament before the election .
" The lack of time provided by the government … did not allow us to study the practical application of the bill to the extent that we wished , " said Jonathan Djanogly , the shadow solicitor general .
But campaigners welcomed the law , saying it would help to restore the UK 's reputation and help developing countries .
" This act sends out a strong message to UK plc and the rest of world – the UK will not tolerate bribery , " said Chandrashekhar Krishnan , executive director of Transparency International UK .
" Corruption disproportionately affects the poor and is a persistent threat to development and democracy .
The UK will now have greater credibility in encouraging good governance in countries that receive UK aid and in persuading major emerging economies to stop their own companies paying bribes . "
A survey in 2006 by Control Risks , a consultancy , estimates that a quarter of UK - based international companies have lost business to corrupt competitors in recent years , while figures from the World Bank suggest that bribery adds up to 10 % to the total cost of doing business globally .
I never expected a story to rival that of Brad Pitt starring in World War Z , yet it has happened relatively quick .
Announced as the San Diego Comic - Con , Guillermo del Toro will be directing a brand new version of The Haunted Mansion , based on the ever - so - popular Disneyland / Disneyworld ride ( I wish I could live there ) .
“ We are not returning Eddie Murphy ’s call , ” he joked , adding that they want this to be “ the haunted house movie that a generation remembers and loves …
We are making it scary and fun , but the scary will be scary . ”
After 9/11 , Disney began making feature films of their rides in an attempt to get movie fans to return to the theme parks .
It took off with the success of Pirates of the Caribbean , but Disney has yet to get another franchise off the ground .
Why not have it be Haunted Mansion ?
F.U.C.K. YES .
Official press release inside .
Keep up with all of our San Diego Comic - Con happenings by clicking here :
Guillermo del Toro surprised the 6,500 fans gathered today at Comic - Con with the announcement that he is currently developing a new film for The Walt Disney Studios based on the classic Disney theme park attraction , The Haunted Mansion .
“ Dark imagery is an integral part of the Walt Disney legacy .
After all , Disney himself was the father of some really chilling moments and characters – think Chernabog from Fantasia or Maleficent as the Dragon or the Evil Queen in Snow White , ” said del Toro .
“ I could n’t be more excited to be a part of my own adaptation of the original theme park attraction Walt envisioned and that remains - for me - the most desirable piece of real estate in the whole world ! ”
“ Millions of people from around the world visit The Haunted Mansion each year , but no one has ever had a tour guide like Guillermo del Toro , ” said Rich Ross , Chairman of The Walt Disney Studios .
“ Guillermo is one of the most gifted and innovative filmmakers working today and he is going to take audiences on a visually - thrilling journey like they ’ve never experienced before . ”
Since August 1969 , foolish mortals have dared to trespass on the macabre grounds of Disney ’s Haunted Mansion .
A hallowed landmark in Disneyland ’s New Orleans square , it ’s the dwelling place of 999 happy haunts dying to meet new visitors each day .
The plantation - style of the mansion ’s facade is a sweet deception for visitors .
Inside , ghostly doom buggies line the hallways .
Since its construction , the mysteries of the mansion have transcended the attraction with stories surfacing about horrifying encounters with the supernatural .
Versions of the daunting edifice have been built at other Disney theme parks in Orlando , Tokyo and Paris .
Numerical libraries usually have a function for finding the hypotenuse of a right triangle .
Is n’t this trivial ?
If the sides of a triangle are x and y , just write this :
sqrt(x*x + y*y )
That works in theory , but in practice it may fail .
If x is so large that x*x overflows , the code will produce an infinite result .
We ’d like to be able to say to the computer “ Now x*x and y*y might be too big , but just wait a minute .
I ’m going to take a square root , and so the numbers will get smaller .
I just need to borrow some extra range for a minute . ”
You can do something like that in environments that have extended precision , but that would be inefficient and unnecessary .
And of course it would fail completely if you ’re already using the largest numeric type available .
Here ’s how to compute sqrt ( x*x + y*y ) without risking overflow .
max = maximum ( |x| , |y| ) min = minimum ( |x| , |y| ) r = min / max return max * sqrt ( 1 + r*r )
Notice that the square root argument is between 1 and 2 and so there is no danger of overflow in taking the square root .
The only way the algorithm could overflow is if the result itself is too large to represent .
In that case the fault lies with the problem , not the algorithm : the algorithm was asked to compute a quantity larger than the largest representable number , and so it does the correct thing by overflowing and returning an infinite value .
However , the algorithm will not unnecessarily return an infinite value due to an overflow in an intermediate computation .
To see how the algorithm above may succeed when the naive implementation would fail , let M be the largest representable number .
For IEEE double precision , M is on the order of 10^308 .
All that matters for this example is that M is greater than 4 .
Let x and y equal 0.5 M.
The algorithm above would return 0.707 M .
But the naive algorithm would compute x*x and overflow since 0.25 M2 > M.
Then x*x + y*y would evaluate to infinity and the square root would evaluate to infinity .
A hypotenuse function is included in math.h on every system that I am aware of .
It may be named hypot or _hypot .

Adventure , theme park and Ferrari fans rejoice !
Ferrari World , the world ’s first Ferrari theme park is all set to start functioning in October 2010 , in Abu Dhabi .
According to sources this will be one experience no one will want to miss – providing an intense multi-sensory experience .
The theme park will be a testament to the unsurpassed excellence of the Ferrari – famed for being high in performance , technical excellence and design .
The red roof of the park is a direct take off from the iconic double curve of the Ferrari GT body – and spans 200,000 square metres .
Emblazoned on it is a sight that any Ferrari lover would kill to get a look at – the biggest Ferrari logo ever made .
Ferrari World will have a number of rides – with a number of the usual amusement / theme park rides and will also impart a complete Ferrari experience – through 20 state of the art rides .
One of them is the world ’s fastest roller coaster ( with speeds in excess of 200 km per hour ) , which is designed to give the rider the feeling of being inside a Ferrari .
Another experience that is sure to be unforgettable is the G - Force – which takes passengers on a ride over 62 m – through the roof and back again !
Located on the Yas Island , on the north east of mainland Abu Dhabi , the park was specifically located here keeping in mind the global tourist destination tag and facilities that this area enjoys .
It ’s sure to be a hit with the locals too – who are well known for their motor sports enthusiasm .

While U.S. officials insist they are making progress in reversing the momentum built up by the Taliban insurgency over the last several years , the latest news from Afghanistan suggests the opposite may be closer to the truth .
Even senior military officials are conceding privately that their much - touted new counterinsurgency strategy of " clear , hold and build " in contested areas of the Pashtun southern and eastern parts of the country are not working out as planned despite the " surge " of some 20,000 additional U.S. troops over the past six months .
Casualties among the nearly 130,000 U.S. and other NATO troops now deployed in Afghanistan are also mounting quickly .
Four U.S. troops were killed Wednesday when Taliban fire brought down their helicopter in the southern province of Helmand , the scene of a major U.S. offensive centered on the strategic farming region of Marja over the past several months .
That brought the death toll of NATO soldiers just this week to 23 , including 10 killed in various attacks around the country on Monday , the deadliest day for NATO forces in two years .
" It ’s been a tough week , " Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said Wednesday .
Seventeen of the 23 were U.S. soldiers , bringing the total U.S. death toll in and around Afghanistan since the U.S. intervened to oust the Taliban from power in late 2001 to more than 1,100 , according to the independent iCasualties website .
While senior military officials attributed the steadily rising toll to Washington ’s surge of a total of 30,000 additional troops by next month , as well as the beginning of the Taliban ’s annual summer offensive , none other than Secretary of Defense Robert Gates warned that the U.S. and its NATO allies were running out of time to show results .
" The one thing none of the ( alliance ’s ) publics … including the American public , will tolerate is the perception of stalemate in which we ’re losing young men , " he said in London Wednesday on the eve of a key NATO ministerial meeting in Brussels this week at which Afghanistan will top the agenda and Gates himself is expected to prod his interlocutors to fulfil pledges to provide more troops .
" All of us , for our publics , are going to have to show by the end of the year that our strategy is on the track , making some headway , " he said .
Obama , who last November set a July 2011 as the date after which Washington would begin to withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan , has said his administration will conduct a major review of U.S. strategy and whether it is working at the end of this year .
The latest polling here shows a noticeable erosion of support for Washington ’s commitment to the war compared to eight months ago when Obama agreed to the Pentagon ’s recommendations to send the 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan to bring the total U.S. presence there to around 100,000 .
An additional 34,000 troops from NATO and non-NATO allies are supposed to be deployed there by year ’s end .
According to a Washington Post / ABC
News poll released Thursday , 53 percent of respondents said the war in Afghanistan , which last month , according to most measures , exceeded the Vietnam conflict as the longest - running war in U.S. history , was " not worth fighting . "
That was the highest percentage in more than three years .
The same poll found that 39 percent of the public believe that Washington is losing the war , compared to 42 percent who believe it is winning .
While public skepticism about the war appears to be growing , the foreign policy elite , including within the military , also seems increasingly doubtful for a number of reasons .
Disillusionment with President Hamid Karzai — already running high as a result of last year ’s rigged elections and his tolerance for government and family corruption — gained new momentum last weekend with the forced resignations of his two top security officials , Interior Minister Hanif Atmar and intelligence chief Amrullah Saleh , who were considered by Western officials as among the most competent of Karzai ’s cabinet members .
The two men reportedly objected strongly to Karzai ’s order to release all accused Taliban prisoners who are being held without enough evidence for trials .
The order was seen as the latest in a series of moves designed to reconcile with the Taliban leadership , a step that Washington has strongly opposed until now .
Among other things , the U.S. fears that such a move could prompt leaders of the Northern Alliance , which consists of non-Pashtun groups , to break with the government and prepare for renewed civil war of the kind that devastated Afghanistan before the Taliban first took control in 1996 .
Karzai ’s bid for reconciliation stems from his conviction , according to a number of accounts , that U.S. strategy is unlikely to succeed in weakening — let alone defeating — the Taliban and that his hold on power will ultimately rely on reaching an accommodation with them .
That impression may well be grounded in an accurate assessment of the way Washington ’s counterinsurgency strategy is actually playing out .
Indeed , the Marjah campaign , which was heralded as a major test of Washington ’s new strategy when it was launched in February , appears to be faltering badly .
Late last month , Washington ’s overall military commander , Gen. Stanley McChrystal , even referred to it as " a bleeding ulcer . "
While it initially succeeded in " clearing " Taliban from the region McChrystal ’s pledge that U.S. troops would bring with them an Afghan " government in a box " that would provide basic security and social services proved , as a feature story in Thursday ’s Washington Post described it , " largely empty . "
As a result of local disillusionment with the police and the very few Afghan civilian officials that followed the U.S. military into the area , insurgents have regrouped and in some areas regained the offensive , according to the latest reports .
One recent study found that the majority of the population had become more antagonistic to NATO forces than was the case before the operation began .
The Marja experience has cast doubt on a yet more ambitious and strategically critical operation planned for Kandahar .
While Washington had initially planned to launch a major military operation to " clear " Taliban from neighborhoods in and around the city before introducing the civilian component of the counterinsurgency strategy , it has now reversed the order in hopes of not alienating the local population as it did in Marja .
But the presence of more police and civilian officials will no doubt require a build - up of NATO troops to protect them , particularly in light of a stepped - up and highly effective Taliban campaign to intimidate government officials who are perceived as cooperating with the Western forces by assassinating selected targets , including even low - level bureaucrats .

On the crowded floor of EA ’s behemoth booth at E3 2010 , there stood a line that awaited patiently to see something special behind closed doors .
Above those doors were copious “ best of ” awards from various publications .
To the side , a decal — a soldier in a familiar nanosuit engaged in combat .
This was the line for the demonstration of Crysis 2 .
Upon queuing up , I squealed on the inside like a child in line to see Santa .
Not only was I about to see the sequel to one of the best looking video games of all time , but we were going to be shown a real - time demonstration of the game on the PC platform .
Of all of the media that has been released for Crysis 2 thus far , it has all been run on either the Xbox 360 or PS3 platforms .
It was time to finally see what the PC version was visually capable of .
The demo we were shown was a short sequence from the now infamous Times Square portion of the game .
New York lies in complete shambles as war is waged in all directions .
The player , assuming the role of Nomad once more , is fighting humans and aliens alike in the burned out streets of the Big Apple .
The action is intense and chaotic — attacks come from side alleys , from the air , from inside of buildings — it is total war .
It did n’t take long to realize that Crysis 2 is a completely different game from its predecessor .
It was difficult for me to tell , based on what we were watching , how much of Crytek ’s famed “ go where you want ” gameplay was intact .
The demo had Nomad on the streets of New York , hiding behind broken chunks of buildings and trashed taxi cabs to return fire at the many enemies .
At one point , Nomad kicked a car off of the elevated road he was standing on and towards an enemy robot that was on a side road .
He fired a grenade to detonate the car and remove the threat .
Soon afterward , Nomad used the strength mode to jump through a window of a nearby office building .
The fighting continued in the tight hallways of the office .
Computers and desks blew apart in spectacular fashion , fallen prey to errant gunfire .
After dispatching many enemies , Nomad eventually jumped out of another window and back down to the street .
It appeared to me that these situations were presenting multiple options for where the player could go on their choice .
I would love to see a large portion of New York that is completely explorable , but until I have control of Nomad myself , it is difficult to tell just how much freedom is given to the player .
Eventually , Nomad finds his way to New York ’s Grand Central Station , a designated safe area in the sprawling urban wasteland .
After meeting up with a few friendlies , a massive walking robot crashes through the far glass , and an intense showdown follows from within the confines of the station .
After Nomad is able to fell the juggernaut , he looks up through the glass sky lights just in time to see fireballs slam into the nearby “ MaxLife ” skyscraper .
The building lurches forward — it is n’t going to last much longer .
Realizing that the building is about to fall onto the station , Nomad is rescued by Marines in an armored car .
The demo ended with a dramatic sequence of Nomad making a quick escape in the vehicle .
Pedestrians are everywhere , trying desperately to escape with their lives .
Unable to save them all , the MaxLife building crashes down onto the station and creates a spectacular cloud of dust and debris .
It is very clear that Crysis 2 will play nothing like the first game .
Apart from the suit powers ( which have actually been simplified a bit — gone is the speed power ) , very little of what gamers learned while playing Crysis will help when playing Crysis 2 .
This is n’t the familiar wide open world of guerrilla warfare .
This is down and dirty , gritty urban combat .
So very few times has a sequel dared to differ so much from its predecessor that I can think of only a handful of titles .
This change of pace and setting will either greatly please or completely enrage fans .
How about the visuals of Crysis 2 ?
There is no question that expectations are astronomical for Crysis 2 — gamers place Crysis as one of the prime examples of photo - realism in games .
To this day , three years after release , gamers still brag about how well their newest gaming build can run Crysis with maximum settings enabled .
One thing is for sure – Crysis 2 is going to be a contender .
Does it actually live up to the expectations , though ?
From a lighting standpoint , Crysis 2 is leagues beyond everything else out there .
The lighting technologies in CryEngine 3 are superb .
I have never seen an engine handle the sheer magnitude of lightsources with the ease that Crysis 2 does .
Light is coming from everywhere and casting shadows on everything .
Search lights from choppers , yellow flames belching from car engines , and explosions from a rocket launch all add their light to the scene .
The battlefield becomes chaotic with objects , combatants , and light sources dancing across the screen .
The result is a true spectacle to behold .
When the fireballs crashed into the MaxLife building as Nomad watched from below , they cast a bright , orange light .
As they passed over the skylights of Grand Central Station , every bit of framework between the panes of glass cast a shadow .
This complex mesh of shadows ( doubled , thanks to the second fireball ) moved across the entire interior of the station .
The effect was so impressive that I paid little attention to the actual impact with the building .
Such a high volume of complex dynamic shadows is simply unheard of in modern gaming .
Beyond being able to handle a high amount of light sources in real - time , CryEngine 3 introduces other high - level lighting effects .
Ambient Occlusion serves to approximate radiating light and shade areas of complex geometry to better reflect real - world lighting .
This effect is difficult to see in the darkness of Crysis 2 , but it was especially noticeable in the indoor areas .
To push that look even further , CryEngine 3 is the first real - time graphics engine to implement a global illumination model .
Though not technically a true global illumination model , it simulates light bounce and even uses light propagation volumes to introduce color bounce and indirect lighting .
What all of this means is that games using CryEngine 3 have the most realistic lighting effects ever seen in a video game .
To make more sense of global illumination and light propogation volumes , the following video from SIGGRAPH 2009 illustrates the effects in CryEngine 3 :
Everything in Crysis 2 looks fantastic .
Texture work is just as good as it was with the first game .
Clean , detailed textures appear on every object in the scene .
Motion blur and depth of field blur are subtle and smooth — and are still the finest examples of the tech in gaming today .
Sound design is loud and complex , the kind of stuff that can only be fully appreciated with a good pair of headphones or a surround sound system cranked to the max .
Character faces treated with subsurface scattering and brought to life by the remarkable lip sync and facial animation return as well .
Crytek has clearly built off of what they brought to the table with CryEngine 2 all while turning the dial to 11 .
To me , Crysis 2 fully lives up to the expectations visually , with the bulk of the achievements in the lighting department .
Sadly , most gamers will look at Crysis 2 and not see much of a difference , however .
We are reaching an age in computer graphics where the major strides in technology are made in the minute details , and to the untrained eye , these details matter naught .
At the end of the day , most will complain that Crytek has n’t done enough with Crysis 2 .
The reality is quite the contrary — Crytek has made significant leaps forward in technology with the game , and they have paved the way once more for modern methods of computer graphics .
A mysterious fungus is wreaking havoc on Afghanistan 's opium poppies , which account for 92 % of the world 's supply .
Local farmers blame the US military and NATO after a white substance appeared on their crops .
The United Nations blames nature .
The head of the United Nations ' Office on Drugs and Crime , Antonio Maria Costa , told the BBC that the price of opium has shot up by 50 % in Helmand and Kandahar provinces , where US and NATO forces are prepping for a major offensive against the Taliban , who depend on the drug trade for a large amount of funding .
But as for a western conspiracy ?
Costa says no , because this happens from time to time .
" Nature really played in favour of the opium economy ; this year , we see the opposite situation . "

Hey Guys ,
I watched a video created by Matt Cutts , the head of the Google anti-spam team , which I have embedded below for you .
The focus of the video is about a recent change to the Google algorithm , and in particular the way they rank pages for the long tail keyword phrases .
I ’m interested to hear what you all think about this .
However what I think may possible be the outcome , is sites that Google see as not authority sites will no longer find it so easy to rank for long tail keyword phrases .
What is an authority affiliate marketing site ?
Well I think it ’s one that has a substantial amount of information on it , and is regularly updated with new content .
Perhaps the sites that will be affected the most are small sites with a handful of pages , that are solely focusing on getting easy traffic through ranking for specific long tail phrases only .
Form what Matt Cutts says in this video , I think that Google will rank authority sites for long tail phrases even when they are not trying to target the keyword directly .
I realize this happens already to some degree , but perhaps it will be more apparent .
So what should you do ?
Well I think the key thing to take from this video , is that it ’s important to build quality sites , that demonstrate that you ’re an authority on the topic , and avoid creating fly by night flimsy sites , that only target a few long tail phrases .
What do you guys think ?

This is a special episode I put a lot of extra time into ( during the AVGN break ) .
With James Rolfe and Mike Matei
Unlike most robot invaders , Neato‘s XV - 11 did n’t leave my house a flaming wreck .
That ’s probably because it ’s a vacuum .
The latest technology in robotic cleaners , the XV - 11 ( $ 399 ) is head and shoulders above first generation bots like the Roomba .
That ’s because the little vacuum uses a top - mounted laser detection system and advanced mapping software to plan the best route to clean your carpet .
I got to test drive the XV - 11 ’s in my home this week , right as they were shipping out to customers for the first time .
The robot did not disappoint .
Check out some of its successes and limitations in the video highlights below .
Taking a robot home is probably one of the cooler things a technophile like myself can do .
There ’s just something about unwrapping a machine and watching it explore your home like a new puppy that makes me smile .
Still , the cuteness of the XV - 11 wears off pretty quickly , and well it should .
This is a working robot , and I was anxious to see how well it worked .
Rather than read the instruction manual carefully and optimize my home to see how well the robot could clean , I took the lazy approach .
I plugged the docking station into the nearest outlet , set the robot to clean as soon as possible , placed some obstacles out , and hoped for the best .
It ’s supposed to be a smart robot , right ?
I might as well be as dumb as possible and see what happens .
The results were surprisingly good .
My apartment , for better or worse , is n’t that big .
( Curse you San Francisco real estate prices ! )
With the doors to the bedroom and bathroom open , the XV - 11 could clean my whole home in one charge .
That was nice .
It also happened to work out that the dustbin could handle the whole house without having to be emptied ( which you have to do on your own ) .
All in all , I did almost nothing to help the robot out during its process and the floors ended up as clean ( if not cleaner ) than when I vacuum on my own .
Score one for Neato .
That being said , the robot did n’t work perfectly .
There were some clear limitations , most of which I could have anticipated after visiting Neato back in February .
Here ’s where the XV - 11 had problems :
Getting Tangled
In the Brush :
The one area where I absolutely had to intervene was in dislodging the robot from entanglements .
This is what I call the “ tassel problem ” as the bot was determined to eat the decorative fringe on my rug .
Like all vacuums , the XV - 11 can get fabric and wires caught in its intake , but unlike uprights , it does n’t have you following it around to get it free .
An unsupervised XV - 11 will simply shut down and wait when it gets caught .
That ’s the safe thing to do , but it does mean you could come home to find your bot sitting and stuck , waiting for your help like some kind of petulant child .
Having to go through the house and tuck away wires and loose fringe makes owning an autonomous robot vacuum less fun , but it ’s a necessity .
Sliding Objects :
The XV - 11 uses laser guidance and an advanced mapping process ( SLAM ) to plan its route and avoid obstacles .
It updates its map constantly , meaning you can walk around the bot and it wo n’t freak out – it will just reroute itself .
The same happens when it accidentally knocks a moveable object around .
Which can be a bad thing .
It dragged a bathmat around my bathroom , and a stool around my kitchen , but then avoided the places where they landed .
This inevitably caused it to miss a few spots in the cleaning process .
Now , most people probably do n’t vacuum their kitchen and bathroom linoleum , so this wo n’t be a concern for many .
Still , it ’s a limitation to consider .
Lost On User Error :
While the robot is capable of finding its way home , it failed to do so in my apartment .
Why ?
I did n’t to read the instruction manual .
The bot needs some clear space around the station ( several feet ) to maneuver its way in .
You ’re supposed to put the dock against a wall and far from any corner .
I , however , just plugged the thing in and left it where it laid .
Not a good plan .
The bot knocked its charging station a few times during the course of its cleaning .
Once it finished vacuuming it got close to recharging , but did n’t make it home without help .
It took me a while to figure out how to get the bot to finally dock ( I had to clear a lot of obstacles and reset the dock ) .
All of this is clearly ‘ user error ’ , but I ’m putting this down as a limitation anyway .
Why ?
Because humans take their appliances for granted .
Sure we should n’t overload the clothes washer , or forget to change the oil in our cars , or leave the coffee pot on forever … but we do .
Simply stated , we should keep in mind that the XV - 11 is n’t human - proof .
The following video highlights the more interesting moments of the vacuum cleaning my house .
The raw footage was 50 + minutes , so forgive me for editing heavily to get this down to around 8 .
Keep in mind that the bot is pretty boring when it ’s working well , so I skipped the majority of the time it performed without a fuss .
I had a brief chat with Neato when I returned the robot , and learned that they are still very much interested in improving and innovating the XV - 11 moving forward .
A software patch ( which will be available even if you ’ve already received your XV - 11 ) will help the robot avoid things get stuck in its brush , hopefully eliminating or at least reducing the frequency of the “ tassel problem ” .
Neato is also looking for feedback from its first generation users to help plan future models of the device .
My suggestion : let the bot connect with a computer so that a user can see the maps it makes and tell the robot exactly where to go in their home ( Neato says this is one of the ideas they ’re considering ) .
Bottom line , Neato makes a great robot vacuum .
At $ 399 , it is n’t the cheapest , but I think you definitely get your money ’s worth .
It has some clear limitations – I think I would definitely do a little tiddying up before I let the XV - 11 work unsupervised – but it ’s a very useful robot to have around the house .
And there will be more robots around the house .
We ’ve had domestic bots in the form of appliances for many years ( think garage door openers and dishwashers ) , but autonomous devices that roam and work on their own are still something of a rarity .
With iRobot ’s launch of Roomba earlier in the decade , it looked like the vacuum cleaner would be the gateway for robots to enter into the home .
Now Neato is looking to swing that gate open further by giving its XV - 11 something that you do n’t see in many robots : good decision making .
The XV - 11 is smart .
SLAM constantly lets the robot know where it is , and where it should be going .
It plans the route it will take , avoids obstacles , and knows how to get back to its charging station .
Those are all cool capabilities for a robot vacuum cleaner to possess , but they are also the basic requirements needed for many household robots you ’d want in your house .
The number of tasks these bots will take on is going to increase .
A good rule of thumb : if the work is dull , difficult , or dangerous , we ’ll eventually design a robot to do it .
Whether they are mowing your lawn , washing your windows , or monitoring your house while you ’re gone , the domestic bots of the future are going to have a lot in common with the XV - 11 .
Which means they wo n’t be perfect , but they will be pretty damn cool .
* Full disclosure : Neato did not charge the writer or Singularity Hub for use of its robot .
This could be considered a gift .

Plans by Ryanair to introduce standing room on its aircraft will not happen for at least two years and may never materialise if the airline fails to meet stringent European safety requirements .
The budget airline 's boss , Michael O'Leary , will talk about his plans to replace 10 rows of seats with a standing area as well as introducing a coin- operated toilet on some planes in an interview on ITV's How to Beat the Budget Airlines tonight .
However , safety officials at the European Aviation Safety Agency ( Easa ) , which regulates safety issues on European airlines , said its rules would have to be ripped up and rewritten in order to allow standing room on Ryanair flights .
In Easa 's certification specifications it states : " A seat ( or berth for a non-ambulant person ) must be provided for each occupant who has reached his or her second birthday . "
" This idea [ of Ryanair 's ] is unprecedented and unlikely to be certified in the near future , " said a spokesman for Easa .
The Civil Aviation Authority , which regulates UK but not Irish airlines , added that Easa 's safety requirements were " quite stringent " and include rules on restraint during take - off and landing ; restraint during periods of turbulence ; the " crashworthiness " of airline seats ; the ability of the seating to withstand a certain amount of gravitational force ; and evacuation and flammability issues .
Ryanair itself admits both ideas – for standing room and paid - for toilets – were in the " very early stages " .
It first mooted the plans a few months ago when it was in talks with Boeing over a new order for planes .
The order did n't come off , said a spokesman for the airline , but it is now in talks with the aircraft manufacturer over the idea again .
" We are aiming at starting safety testing in about 12 months with a view to going into service with the new arrangements in about 18 months to two years ' time , " he said .
" We think this would work well on our winter services so would hope to eventually introduce it for a winter timetable . "
Toilet charges would be introduced at the same time as the standing area , as the idea to charge £ 1 for using the lavatory only came about after the airline started to look at how to introduce standing room .
It wants to remove both toilets from the back of the plane as well as a row of seats in order to go ahead with its plans .
" This means we 'll only have one loo left at the front of the plane and so clearly we need to discourage overuse , hence the charge , " he said .
The refitted planes would only run on commuter routes of under one hour to start with , such as London to Dublin , although O'Leary hopes to introduce standing room on some longer flights at a later point .
A certain percentage of the standing slots will be free to passengers and the others charged at € 5 to € 10 ( £ 4 to £ 8 ) .
Ryanair defended itself against accusations that the two ideas are nothing more than an attempt to seek publicity .
" People are always slow to accept the changes that face the aviation industry , even though it is already almost unrecognisable from 20 to 30 years ago , " said a spokesman for the airline .
" We have already done away with check - in desks , an idea that two years ago people dismissed as a joke .
We absolutely believe that these new proposals are the future . "
Meanwhile , the airline is upping its prices by increasing the price of check - in luggage from today for the next two months , from £ 15 to £ 20 .
It also announced earlier this week that it will cut the number of winter flights from the UK by 16 % from November , reducing the number of passengers it carries from UK airports by 2 million .
It blamed a rise in air passenger duty , which is due to rise in November from £ 22 to £ 24 for short - haul flights and £ 50 to £ 75 on long - haul returns .
Fainting of the guard : Scots guardsman wilts in heat at a final rehearsal for next weekend 's Trooping The Colour
It was the perfect day for basking on the beach or in a park .
But yesterday clearly was n’t ideal for standing perfectly still while wearing a 2lb bearskin hat – as this unfortunate Scots Guardsman found when he fainted at a final rehearsal for next weekend ’s Trooping The Colour .

Even Prince Philip was looking a touch hot and bothered as temperatures in London hit 80 F ( 27C ) .
Tradition dictates that guards are not allowed to move their heads or eyes while on parade , so the soldiers were unable even to acknowledge their fallen comrade ’s plight .
The MoD said the guard had recovered fully .

A 38 - year - old Taiwanese man froze to death as a heatwave swept the island after he walked into a refrigeration room to cool off and apparently suffered hypothermia .
Chen Sung - mou , a worker at a sugar factory on the offshore island of Penghu , was found unconscious inside the room on Sunday and was pronounced dead in hospital , police said .
He had apparently entered the room to seek refuge from the heat , police said .
But it appeared that hypothermia caused him to fall asleep , trapping him inside the room , even though the door was unlocked .
A heat wave has hit Taiwan in recent days , with temperatures reaching 37C in Taipei today .

Research scientists announced on Monday they had identified the missing piece of a major puzzle involving the make - up of the universe by observing a neutrino particle change from one type to another .
The CERN physics research center near Geneva , relaying the announcement from the Gran Sasso laboratory in central Italy , said the breakthrough was a major boost for its own LHC particle collider program to unveil key secrets of the cosmos .
According to physicists at Gran Sasso , after three years of monitoring multiple billions of " muon " neutrinos beamed to them through the earth from CERN 456 miles away , they had spotted one that had turned into a " tau " neutrino .
Behind that scientific terminology lies the long - sought proof that the three varieties of neutrinos -- sub-atomic particles that with others form the universe 's basic elements -- can switch appearance , like the chameleon lizard .
The discovery is important , scientists say , because it helps explain why neutrinos arrive at earth from the sun in apparently far smaller numbers than they should under the Standard Model of physics that has held sway for some 80 years .
The fact that neutrinos are now proven to switch identities -- as posited by two Moscow scientists in the late 1960s based on earlier work by a U.S. physicist -- suggests that other types of neutrinos could exist but slip detection .
LIGHT ON DARK MATTER
In its turn , specialists say , this could help shed light on what is the dark matter that makes up about a quarter of the universe alongside the some 5 percent that is observable and the remaining 70 percent invisible " dark energy . "
" This is really exciting because it shows that there are things beyond the Standard Model , " said James Gillies , spokesman for CERN -- the European Organization for Nuclear Research on the border between Switzerland and France .
The search for concrete evidence of dark matter and of what it might be is part of the work of CERN 's LHC , or Large Hardon Collider , the world 's biggest scientific machine that began operation near full force at the end of March .
But the beaming of muon neutrinos to the Italian center is not part of the LHC experiment .
The beam is directed south under the Alps from another , smaller , CERN particle accelerator .
CERN quoted Lucia Votano , director of the Gran Sasso laboratories near the town of L'Aquila 112 kms south of Rome that was hit by a devastating earthquake in April last year , as saying that its work had achieved its first goal .
Scientists there were confident that the detection in the centre 's OPERA experiment of a tau neutrino would be followed by others showing that neutrinos can change , she said .
Work on the behavior of neutrinos has already brought Nobel prizes to late U.S. scientist Ray Davies , who first recorded in the 1960s that fewer were coming from the sun than current theories of the universe predicted .
He shared the prize in 2002 , at the age of 87 and 4 years before his death , with fellow U.S. researcher Ricardo Giacconi and Japanese physicist Masatoshi Koshiba for the contribution to astrophysics .
WASHINGTON  Stymied by political opposition and focused on competing priorities , the Obama administration has sidelined efforts to close the Guantánamo prison , making it unlikely that President Obama will fulfill his promise to close it before his term ends in 2013 .
When the White House acknowledged last year that it would miss Mr. Obama ’s initial January 2010 deadline for shutting the prison , it also declared that the detainees would eventually be moved to one in Illinois .
But impediments to that plan have mounted in Congress , and the administration is doing little to overcome them .
“ There is a lot of inertia ” against closing the prison , “ and the administration is not putting a lot of energy behind their position that I can see , ” said Senator Carl Levin , the Michigan Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and supports the Illinois plan .
He added that “ the odds are that it will still be open ” by the next presidential inauguration .
And Senator Lindsey Graham , a South Carolina Republican who also supports shutting it , said the effort is “ on life support and it ’s unlikely to close any time soon . ”
He attributed the collapse to some fellow Republicans ’ “ demagoguery ” and the administration ’s poor planning and decision - making “ paralysis . ”
A motorist from East Jerusalem who ran over and wounded several Border Police officers Friday was shot twice in the face from close range while still lying on the ground , eyewitnesses said .
Neighborhood witnesses said the fatal shots were fired once the officers no longer had reason to fear that their lives were in danger , and could have easily arrested the suspect .
Witnesses in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Wadi Joz told Haaretz that the motorist , Ziad Jilani , suddenly swerved his car and hit the group of officers walking further up the road .
They said , however , that they believed the collision was an accident , and not committed intentionally as initially reported .
Open gallery view Ziad Jilani
Jilani , 39 , was self - employed and the father of three daughters .
His wife is a U.S. citizen , and he himself lived for an extended period in both the U.S. and Switzerland .
Around 2 P.M. Friday , Jilani was driving his van home from prayers in nearby Shoafat .
Several minutes before the incident , Border Police officers were seen riding horses toward the Wadi Joz industrial area .
A number of other officers were deployed around the area , and several started making their way toward Jerusalem 's Old City .
Jilani's car was traveling in tightly packed , slow - moving traffic with no oncoming vehicles .
The neighborhood soon filled up with people returning from Friday prayers , and some stores were already being opened .
Two eyewitnesses said stones were hurled at the officers , one of which struck Jilani 's car .
He then swerved his car left , they said , veering from its lane and striking the group of policemen .
Shots were heard immediately , another witness told Haaretz , and one of the officers fell to the ground .
Two policemen tended to him until an ambulance arrived , and the other officers got in their vehicles and began pursuing Jilani , who had continued driving after the collision , and shooting at his car .
Another witness said that he had not seen stones thrown , but rather believed Jilani had tried to overtake the vehicles in front of him .
Several other witnesses said the windshield of Jilani 's car had been shattered , but were unsure if the damage had been caused by a bullet or a stone .
Jilani turned his vehicle into a dead - end alley where his uncle lives , and the officers continued pursuing his vehicle and shooting .
A mother and her adult daughter present at the scene saw the man emerge from his car .
The daughter told Haaretz , " I was further down the alley , and I heard shots ... I saw a car driving , followed by many police officers .
The car stopped right next to me , and someone got out .
I saw him next to the car door , and he looked at me with an expression I did n't really understand , but I will never forget .
" There was shooting and I started to scream , " the woman continued .
" My mother ran toward me and threw me to the ground .
Everything happened within seconds .
I realized he was n't walking normally , and saw the shattered windshield of the car , maybe from a stone .
He ran until he fell over , " she said .
Ten meters separated the parked car and the spot where Jilani fell to the ground .
" He got out of the car , and they came after him .
Not just one of them shot , but many of them , and then they started yelling in Hebrew for people to go back into their homes , " the daughter said .
Both women said they saw Jilani lying on his stomach with several officers gathered around him , and the daughter said one of the policemen kicked him in the head .
The mother said she saw an officer point his rifle extremely close to Jilani 's head , and when she put her head down to the asphalt she heard a shot ring out .
A Border Police spokesman , Chief Superintendent Moshe Pinchi , did not comment on the questions posed to him by Haaretz .
In his response , Pinchi wrote , " Individuals have been killed and dozens wounded in vehicle attacks in Jerusalem between 2008 and 2009 ...
All of those attacks were committed by East Jerusalem residents , and in each case those close to the perpetrators described the incidents as ' accidents . '
" Four Border Police officers were wounded in this last incident in Wadi Joz and hospitalized for treatment , and only by a miracle were fatalities avoided , " he said .
On Monday morning , nine activists were killed during an IDF sea raid of the Free Gaza Movement 's flotilla of six ships which had wanted to reach the Gaza shore .
The cabinet agreed that Israel must maintain the naval blockade of Gaza so that it could prevent Iran and terrorists groups such as Hizbullah from sending weapons to Hamas .

As the navy prepared to intercept the ship , Netanyahu instructed it not to harm the activists .
The Foreign Ministry said it hoped the activists on board would reconsider their position .
" We have no desire for a confrontation , " said SpokesmanGal .
" We have no desire to board the ship .
If the ship decides to sail the port of Ashdod , then we will ensure its safe arrival and will not board it , " he said .
" Israel is prepared to receive the ship and to offload its contents .
After an inspection to ensure that no weapons and war materials are on board , we are prepared to deliver all of the goods to Gaza , " Gal said .
" Representative of the people on board and relevant NGOs are welcome to accompany the goods to the crossings , " he said .
Free Gaza co-founder :
We wo n't cede to Israel 's request
Greta Berlin , a co-founder of the Free Gaza movement , said those on board the ship had no intention of ceding to Israel 's request .
Nor , she said , were they impressed by Netanyahu 's statements Thursday to UN Middle East envoy Tony Blair , in which he promised to increase the amount and variety of goods which could enter Gaza by land .
" We do not trust Israel anymore , " said Berlin .

" Our mission is to break the blockade of Gaza , " she told .
Unlike the six ship flotilla which had close to 700 people , the , she said , had only 20 people on board .
These people are all non-violent , she added .
The Foreign Ministry in Ireland said it had been in touch with the Israeli government regarding the rights of its citizens on board the ship , but did not elaborate .
In Washington , the State Department said US officials had been in touch with " multiple " countries , including the Israeli and Irish governments , about this latest effort to reach Gaza by boat .
" Everyone wants to avoid a repetition of [ Monday 's ] tragic incident , " spokesman P.J. Crowley said .
He added that the US had been in contact numerous times with Israeli authorities in recent weeks .
" We urged caution and restraint , " he said .
International condemnation continued Friday , with protests in Syria , Greece , Bahrain and Malaysia , where some demonstrators burned Israeli flags and carried mock coffins .
In Norway , the military canceled a seminar scheduled for later this month because an Israeli army officer was to have lectured .

Israel has allowed ships through five times , but has blocked them from entering Gaza waters since a three - week military offensive against Gaza 's Hamas rulers in January 2009 .
Israeli claims that went it intercepted Monday 's flotilla of ships activists on one of them , the Marmara , ambushed the soldiers after they descended onto the board from helicopters .
The military and Turkish TV have released videotape that backs up that claim .
Returning activists admitted fighting with the Israeli commandos but insisted their actions were in self - defense because the ships were being boarded in international waters by a military force .

Since my original post from two years ago did n’t reach yet all the users , and some of the developers as well , I would like to reiterate that you should not be enabling ccache unconditionally .
It seems like our own ( Gentoo ’s ) documentation is still reporting that using ccache makes build “ 10 to 5 times faster ” .
I ’ll call this statement for what it is : bullshit .
The rebuild of the same package might have such a hit , but not the normal emerge process of a standard user with Gentoo .
If anything at all , the use of ccache will slow your build down , and even add further failure cases and make it difficult to identify errors .
Now , since the approach last time might not have been clear enough , let me try a different one , by describing the steps it takes when you call it :
it has to parse the commandline to make sure you ’re calling it for a single compile , it wo n’t do any good if you ’re using it to link , or to build multiple source files at once ( you can , especially if you use - fwhole - program , but that ’s for another day to write about ) , so in those cases , the command is passed through to the compiler itself ;
, but that ’s for another day to write about ) , so in those cases , the command is passed through to the compiler itself ; once it knows that it ’s doing a single compile , it changes the call to the compiler so that instead it simply preprocess the file , and stores the result in a temporary area ;
now it ’s time to hash the data , with md4 ( the parent of MD5 ) , that as the man page suggests is a strong hash ; this has good reasons to be strong , but it also means that it takes some time to hash the content ; we ’re not talking about the source files themselves , that are usually very small and thus quick to hash , but rather of the preprocessed file , which includes all the headers used … a quick example on my system , by just including eight common header files , produces a 120 KB output ( with - O2 and _FORTIFY_SOURCE … it goes down to 93 KB if - O0 is used ) ; to that add the extra information that ccache has to save ( check the man pages for those ) ;
and … it goes down to 93 KB if is used ) ; to that add the extra information that has to save ( check the man pages for those ) ; now it has to search the filesystem , within its cache directory , if there is a file with the same md4 ; if there is , it gets either copied ( or experimentally hardlinked , but let ’s not go there for now ) , otherwise the preprocessed file is compiled and copied in the cache instead ; in either case , it involves copying the object file from one side to the other .
Now , we can identify three main time - consuming operations : preprocessing , hashing and copying ; all of them are executed whether this is a hit or a miss ; if it ’s a miss you add to that the actual build .
How do they fare about the kind of resources used ?
Hashing , just like compiling , is a CPU - intensive operation ; preprocessing is mixed ( you got to read the header files from around the disk ) ; copying is I /O- intensive .
Given that nowadays most systems have multiple CPU and find themselves slowing down on I /O ( the tinderbox taught me that the hard way ) , the copying of files around is going to slow down the build quite a bit .
Even more so when the hit - to - miss ration is high .
The tinderbox , when rebuilding the same failing packages over and over again ( before I started masking the packages that failed at any given time ) , had a 40 % hit - to - miss ratio and was slowed down by using ccache .
Now , as I already wrote , there is no reason to expect that the same exact code is going to be rebuilt so often on a normal Gentoo system … even if minor updates to the same package were to share most of the source code ( without touching the internal header files ) , for ccache to work you ’d have to leave untouched compiler , flags , and all the headers of all the dependent libraries … and this often includes the system header files from linux - headers .
And even if all these conditions were to hold true , you ’d have to have rebuilt object files for a total size smaller than the cache size , in - between , or the objects would have had expired .
If you think that 2GB is a lot , think again , if you were to use - ggdb especially .
Okay now there are some cases where you might care about ccache because you are rebuilding the same package ; that includes patch - testing and live ebuilds .
In these cases you should not simply set FEATURES =ccache , but you can instead make use of the per-package environment files .
You can then choose two options : you can do what Portage does ( setting PATH so that the ccache wrappers are found before the compilers themselves ) or you can simply re-set the CC variable , such as export CC = " ccache gcc " .
Just set it in /etc / portage / env/$CATEGORY /$ PN and you ’re done .
Nicky Clayton is no better at sitting still than are the birds she studies .
Back in the 1990s , her colleagues at the University of California at Davis would stay at their computers at lunchtime , but she would wander outside and watch as western scrub - jays stole bits of students ’ meals and secretively cached the food .
During these informal field studies , Clayton , an experimental psychologist , noticed that the birds returned frequently to their stashes and changed their hiding places .
“ I thought , ‘ This is odd , ’ ” she says .
“ I assumed birds would cache for a long time — days or months .
But this was for minutes . ”
She theorized that the birds were moving their caches to avoid pilfering .
When food was plentiful , they grabbed as much as possible and hid it , then hid it again when they could do so without being observed by potential thieves .
That behavior implied that the scrub - jays might be thinking about other birds ’ potential actions , a type of flexible thinking that was supposedly beyond the capabilities of a scrub - jay ’s little brain .
Clayton realized that if she could capture this caching behavior in the laboratory , she might be able to decode the social cognition of birds — the way they think about one another .
She might learn whether they are capable of deception , if they respond differently to individual competitors , how well they evaluate their degree of privacy , and other aspects of their mental processes .
“ I had a lucky break with caching , ” Clayton says .
“ I saw this as a niche , an area that other people were n’t busy with that might be quite interesting .
Little did I know where it would lead . ”
Scientists had already established the amazing memories of corvids , the family of birds that includes jays , crows , ravens , and nutcrackers .
The Clark ’s nutcracker can hide thousands of seeds at a time and has passed tests of recall up to 285 days later .
Clayton sought to find out how deep those skills run .
Many animals have impressive mental capabilities for certain narrow tasks , but such aptitudes seem to reflect hardwired or conditioned adaptations to specific challenges .
That is distinctly different from a human ’s ability to create and manipulate a flexible mental model of the world .
Within a few years of her lunchtime insight , Clayton was conducting the first experimental demonstrations of a non­human animal engaged in mental time travel .
Her experiments demonstrated that scrub - jays plan for the future , recall incidents from the past , and mentally model the thinking of their peers .
Since then her work has expanded even further .
She has found other mental capacities in birds that rival or surpass those of any other nonhuman species and come uncannily close to abilities we thought were ours alone .
When she left her native England in 1995 for her position at U.C. Davis , Clayton already believed there was much more to corvid cognition than people thought , having studied their memory development during her graduate studies at Oxford University .
The scrub - jays in the park were not the only thing that lit a fire under her .
She also drew inspiration from another English expatriate , a neuroscientist doing related work from a different perspective , studying social cognition in rhesus macaques .
That researcher , Nathan Emery , would later become her husband .
Like many romances , theirs faced some early tests .
Soon after they met , Clayton recalls critiquing a draft paper of Emery ’s on primate eye - gazing .
The paper included a chart listing mental capabilities that were the sole province of primates .
“ I kept writing in the margin , ‘ Oh , no it ’s not , ’? ” she says , “ which I ’m sure he found very irritating . ”

After Clayton ’s groundbreaking work at U.C. Davis , she returned to England in 2000 and rapidly rose to become a full professor at Cambridge University and director of natural sciences at the university ’s Clare College .
Emery made the move as well , becoming a Royal Society University Research Fellow at Cambridge .
They married in 2001 and together have pursued the study of animal social cognition , with Clayton drawing her husband ’s attention more to the avian side of things .
As she waded into the study of complex cognition , Clayton found herself in a field that was full of intriguing but poorly documented research .
Scientists had striven for decades to demonstrate that nonhuman primates have mental abilities similar to ours .
Experiments teaching chimps — like the famous Washoe — to communicate using sign language received enormous publicity but rarely withstood critical analysis .
Other projects aimed to show that animals have a theory of mind , the ability to model the thinking of others ( as when we judge whether a poker player is bluffing or if a potential mate is truly in love ) .
But here , too , the studies seemed to glimpse such abilities in animals without ever delivering definitive proof .
Experimental psychologist Sara Shettleworth of the University of Toronto summed up the shaky history of these studies in a 1998 textbook in which she reported a history of ambiguous and mistaken findings in the field , concluding that little had been accomplished in a century of work on social cognition in animals .
Clayton has taken a different tack from the earlier research .
“ It was n’t ecologically inspired , ” she says .
“ It was psychologically inspired .
We were asking , ‘ How can we understand a chimpanzee mind ? ’ while the mind we really understand is the human’s . ”
From the start , Clayton saw the problem differently .
“ If theory of mind means thinking about how others are thinking , then how you think as a human might differ from how you think as a scrub - jay or an ape , ” she says .
Instead of trying to train animals to do human tasks , she studied mental adaptations that corvids might need in their own setting .
And instead of surmising the animals ’ thinking from field observations or working with a single trained subject , she conducted repeatable laboratory experiments , carefully designed to rule out alternative interpretations , with multiple birds whose history was uncorrupted by previous work .
“ You can look at these birds ’ behavior in the wild , but that does n’t tell you it ’s cognitive , ” she says .
“ It tells you that you should go and do an experiment . ”
At first Clayton ’s captive scrub - jays refused to engage in the caching behavior she had seen on the Davis campus .
She released the birds into a room with food and plenty of places to hide it , but when she returned the birds to their cages , nothing had been left behind .
In the wild , she realized , scrub - jays cache mostly in their home territory .
So Clayton allowed the birds to cache in the enclosures where they lived day to day ; then they quickly began storing the worms and nuts she provided just as they had the booty stolen from students ’ lunches .
Collaborating with Tony Dick­inson , a comparative psychologist at Cambridge , Clayton showed in 1998 that the remarkable cognitive capacities of scrub - jays extend beyond the social realm to include the ability to negotiate the passage of time .
She found that the birds would return to caches when the food they had hidden was about to spoil .
The jays also adjusted their retrieval pattern when presented with new information about how quickly a certain food goes bad , abandoning those caches whose contents had passed their expiration date .
One experiment showed that jays can even prepare for the future .
Given the opportunity in the evening to place a cache in either of two cages — one in which they had previously been hungry at breakfast time and one in which they had previously been fed — the birds made the correct choice , without practice , provisioning the cage where breakfast had not been provided in the past .
Neurologists believe that episodic memory ( the recall of a moment rather than a skill or ? a fact ) uses the same structures in the human brain ’s hippocampus as does imagination .
Both functions demonstrate our capacity for mental time travel , the ability to recall past events or envision new ones .
Clayton ’s experiments raise for the first time the possibility that scrub - jays can mentally time travel too .
“ We thought these abilities were uniquely human , ” she says .
“ The fact that jays have them says no . ”
In Clayton ’s experiments , the scrub - jays ’ social thinking repeatedly proved more complex than anyone had predicted .
The birds remembered if they were being watched by other birds when they cached , and by which ones .
They would wait until a potential thief was distracted before hiding their food , or would choose a spot that was dark or otherwise difficult for the competing bird to see .
If another bird could potentially hear the process of hiding the food , they chose quieter material in which to dig — sand rather than pebbles .
If they had no choice but to cache in plain sight , the scrub - jays would return soon after , when conditions permitted privacy .
Clayton recognized that the birds ’ behaviors could be conditioned , merely reflecting innate skills , or the learned association linking a cue to an action .
To address these possibilities , she , Emery , and colleagues added an additional experiment .
They hand - raised scrub - jays without giving them the opportunity to steal from other birds ’ caches .
Those “ naive ” jays did not take precautions to avoid being victims of theft .
Apparently , the ability to avoid theft by others depended on projecting a bird ’s own experience .
It took a thief to know a thief .
“ The fact that it was only experienced thieves that did it — that really blew my mind , ” Clayton says .
It was at that point that she and Emery began to invoke cognition to explain the birds ’ maneuverings .
She became convinced that they really do have complex cognitive abilities .
Other researchers have also narrowed the mental differ­ences between people and birds .
Bernd Heinrich , a behavioral ecologist at the University of Vermont , has documented ravens ’ extraordinary social organization , secretive storing of food , elaborate communication , and extensive play , both in the field and in an aviary ; he has described these results in books such as Mind of the Raven .
Recently , in collaboration with Thomas Bugnyar , an Austrian biologist , Heinrich measured ravens ’ caching and problem solving in the lab , with results broadly similar to Clayton ’s .
He concludes , even more unequivocally than she , that ravens attribute to their competitors “ the capacity of knowing . ”
Other researchers studied the cleverness of New Caledonian crows , which can spontaneously invent novel tools .
Looking beyond corvids , some animal behaviorists have examined how songbirds use grammar .
And some have ventured farther down the evolutionary tree .
One study attributed higher mental functions to fish , presenting evidence that African cichlids can reason inferentially .
The accelerating stream of discoveries is challenging our understanding of what animal minds can do .
Clayton ’s work also has its fierce critics — not surprising , given the century ’s worth of debunked claims regarding animal intelligence .
Shettleworth suggests that Clayton and Emery need to repeat the thieving experiment in a different way , with a large number of fresh birds divided into groups according to whether or not they have experience as thieves .
“ I think the work is provocative but not proven , ” Shettleworth says , “ because those birds have a history . ”
Daniel Povinelli , director of the Cognitive Evolution Center at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette , objects to the entire trend in animal cognition studies .
He contends there is still more evidence for human - animal differences than for similarities and believes our own theory of mind fools us into seeing our abilities in animals , even when simpler explanations would suffice .
For example , he does not agree that Clayton ’s experiments show birds can mentally place themselves in different times , as humans do .
“ They ’re just representing , as Nicky has elegantly shown , that they can keep track of the relative breakdown of foods in different locations , ” Povinelli says .
“ To step back and say they can reason about time as an unobservable line on which they can place themselves — there ’s no evidence . ”
As for theory of mind , Povinelli argues that Clayton ’s experimental design was inadequate to show it because the birds could have responded to their competitors not by imagining the content of their thinking but just by using rules .
He also notes that the hand - reared , nonthieving scrub - jays may have missed a developmental stage for making the rules .
“ Nicky and those guys want to say the birds are thinking , ‘ I know what it was like when the birds stole from me , ’? ” Povinelli says .
But he believes the naive birds ’ failure to anticipate thievery does not support the interpretation .
“ All it means is that birds that have undergone certain experiences represent those experiences across time . ”
Povinelli ’s fundamental challenge to Clayton and the other scientists studying animal cognition is that they need to produce evidence that animals possess a theory of mind like the one humans have , with the ability to mentally model counterfactual ideas , such as thinking about what another person would do in a hypothetical situation .
Emery counters that there is a limit to what we can expect to learn from animal minds .
“ We will never be able to find human theory of mind in nonhumans .
They have their own social cognition that has evolved for their own problems , ” he says .
“ If they had human theory of mind , they would be little humans . ”
Or , as Clayton says , quoting the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein , “ If a lion could speak , we would n’t be able to understand him . ”
The predominant attitude of Western science , Clayton says , has been that animals are unthinking automatons until proved otherwise , in line with a biblical view of the animal kingdom having been given by God for our use .
But she cites a Hindu colleague who took the opposite point of view , putting the burden of proof on scientists to show that animals are not mentally complex .
“ Why should you start out with the idea that animals do n’t have a theory of mind ? ” Clayton asks .
“ Why not start out with the idea that they do ? ”
The risk , she recognizes , is lapsing into folk psychology and interpreting animal behavior using the mental machinery with which we negotiate our human relationships .
A dog owner comes home to find a mess but shows mercy because the dog seems remorseful .
But does the dog really feel regret as we would ?
Or is the show of regret a conditioned response associated with receiving a less severe punishment ?
Or could the animal be manifesting an instinctive program , treating the owner as a dominant member of the pack ?
Perhaps all three processes are at work .
Clayton has built her career trying to avoid these uncertainties .
She believes that only experiments in the laboratory can escape the thicket of alternative interpretations that confound field observations .
( That is why her team continues to endure the painstaking and time - consuming task of acquiring and working with lab - bound corvids . )
Nevertheless , wildlife biologists keep reporting tales of bird intelligence outside of the lab as well .
In one compelling example , wildlife researcher Stacia Backensto , a graduate student at the University of Alaska at Fairbanks , was stymied by bird cognition when she began studying how ravens used ambient heat from buildings to adapt to life on the dark , frigid oil fields of the Arctic coast .
“ It ’s interesting to be studying something so smart .
You ’re constantly dueling with this bird that you ’re trying to capture , ” she says .
“ You ’re constantly playing these games to outsmart it . ”
Backensto discovered she could get closer to the ravens if she wore an oil field worker ’s uniform .
Still , she found it almost impossible to catch the birds in the second year of her study .
They had learned all her tricks — even ravens she had not seen before , in areas she had not previously visited .
Finally she had to don a complete disguise : a uniform stuffed with pillows plus a shaggy wig , fake beard , glasses , and a mustache .
It worked , although the university ’s business office wanted to know why Backensto was spending research funds at a place called the Party Palace .
Beyond the anecdotes and individual case studies , there is a common thread among the birds that show the strongest signs of intelligence — the ravens , jays , and other corvids , along with parrots .
Each of these species possesses an avian neocortex of exceptional size relative to its body , rears its young for an extended period , and lives in a complex social environment — not merely in a large population of cooperating creatures , such as bees or ants , but in a dynamic setting of alliances and competition .
The same is true of the most clearly intelligent mammals : toothed whales , dolphins , and primates .
“ It ’s not just living in big groups , it ’s the complexity of social life , ” Clayton says .
This social hypothesis gives the animals a reason for evolving intelligence , which their physical environment alone might not demand .
Clayton suggests that a cognitive arms race among their own kind drove corvids to evolve , as the spy - versus - spy game of caching , stealing , hiding , and deceiving escalated the need for an ever - sharper mind .
Once the ability to think flexibly emerges in an evolutionary line , descendants can apply it to face varying challenges .
For example , ravens and killer whales , both highly social , also both alter the ways they gather food and use their habitat so they can live near the equator as well as in the high Arctic .
Last year Emery investigated the latent intelligence of corvids by testing rooks , which do not use tools in the wild , with complex tasks requiring tools .
With each step in his laboratory experiments , the challenges got harder and more complicated , but because of the rooks ’ understanding of cause and effect , they produced solutions without resorting to trial and error .
They chose rocks and sticks to drop down a tube in order to open a door to get food .
In an experiment inspired by Aesop ’s fables , Emery presented the rooks with a worm floating out of reach in a tube of water .
The birds put rocks in the tube to raise the water level to capture the worm .
They even manufactured tools , bending a wire to make a hook to pull a bucket holding food out of a tube .
The tool worked only with a bend of a precise curvature , around 100 degrees .
“ We would n’t have expected that at all , ” Emery says .
“ That ’s why we said in the paper that it is an example of insight .
It ’s coming up with a novel solution , to innovate . ”
Birds and mammals are distant on the tree of life .
Their last common ancestor lived 280 million years ago and their brains are quite different in size and structure ; birds notably lack the mammalian six - layer cortex .
So Clayton and Emery argue that intelligence had to evolve separately in corvids and primates , starting at distant points but converging to solve the same problems of managing social interaction .
Intelligence might turn up anywhere it aids survival — in the use of protective coloring or the ability to molt , for instance .
It may be rare only because it is not needed very often .
“ We think intelligence is this great thing because it ’s the thing that has made us special , ” Clayton says .
“ Yet when you compare us with insects , such as species of mosquitoes , there are a number of measures where we are not the best . ”
We cannot say for certain how important thinking is for action , whether in animals or in human beings .
Shettleworth concedes that Clayton ’s scrub - jays met the behavioral criteria for future planning when they cached their breakfast in the right cage before bedtime .
“ Does that mean they are thinking about breakfast when doing it ? ” she asks .
“ We do n’t know . ”
Shettleworth notes that the unconscious connections of associative learning can , even among people , produce complex behaviors , such as unconsciously eating a bowl of cereal .
“ Conscious cognition may be very much overrated in our conduct of daily life , ” she says .
In the end , we can not be sure of another person ’s conscious thinking , much less the thinking of another species .
A computer can be programmed to seem conscious .
Scrub - jays might be built to seem conscious too .
Presumably even a person could be conditioned to claim consciousness falsely .
As Emery says : “ I could be lying to you .
I could be completely unconscious but telling you I am conscious . ”
NICKY CLAYTON’S BIRD’S-EYE VIEW
Nicky Clayton ’s fascination with birds does not end when she leaves her Cambridge University office .
Over the years , the avian world has infiltrated her personal life as well , informing her off - hours interests in dance and social connection .
And conversely , she has developed ideas related to her research by looking at bird behavior through the prism of her own experience .
With a slight frame and sharp mind , Clayton likes being compared to a bird .
As busy as the corvids she studies , she dances six days a week , even during university terms .
And to push her metaphor further , you might say that she pays close attention to her plumage :
Her dresses come from Milan , and she perches on stiletto heels day and night , whether relaxing at home , practicing salsa , or striding across the medieval flagstones of Cambridge at a breakneck speed .
Last year Clayton had a rare opportunity to bring her two sides together when Mark Baldwin , the artistic director of the London - based Rambert Dance Company , asked her to help create a contemporary dance commemorating the 150th anniversary of Charles Darwin ’s
On the Origin of Species .
She agreed and then spent weeks sorting out how to express evolution in dance .
“ I was thinking I could just give them a straight science talk , but that ’s a bit boring , ” she says .
“ Given that I love to dance , it made sense for me to merge the two . ”
Clayton borrowed elements from tango and then added some moves based on avian sexual selection ; as reference , she showed the Rambert dancers video of the mating ritual of birds of paradise .
“ I referred to it as bird ballet , ” she says of the ritual .
“ The maestro comes on the scene — I call him the principal dancer — and he ’s seen to do this amazing series of jetés across his little stage .
And you see all these females gathering and critically looking , and then you see him benefit from his successful performance by mating with them all . ”
In the resulting work , titled “ The Comedy of Change , ” Baldwin included a solo that evoked the bird of paradise video .
Reviewers found the piece beautiful but , as with the behavior of the birds Clayton studies , a bit mysterious .
One writer who attended a performance in Northampton that was primarily for schoolchildren appreciated it more — thanks no doubt to a talk Clayton gave in advance .
Clayton still glows about this experience .
As a young girl she loved birds , dance , and clothes .
Now she has all three , adding dance company science adviser to her list of titles and honors .
All of that curiosity and optimism spills right back into her academic work , as she attempts to decode the minds of her scrub - jays .
“ I just like watching them behave , ” she says , “ and using that to generate ideas . ”
VIEWPOINT
Harish Hande
As we reach the end of the first decade in the 21st Century , about one third of the world 's population still has no access to electricity , says Harish Hande .
In this week 's Green Room , he argues that poor people should be at the centre of sustainable energy policies , not on the end of handouts .
Many assume that renewable energies like solar electricity are too expensive for the poor
As the world 's leaders consider how to finance our battle against climate change , the financing of practical , affordable solutions for poor people in countries like my own , India , appears to be of little interest .
It is nearly 130 years since Thomas Edison gave us the electric bulb , yet more than two billion people on this planet still do not have the luxury of electricity .
Up to 50 % of households in India still have no access to modern lighting .
Millions of street vendors , whether in the hi-tech city of Bangalore , India , or Kampala , Uganda , still resort to kerosene or candles to sell their meagre wares .
Today , one of the greatest threats to the environment is poverty .
Can we go and tell a poor woman in a rural part of a developing country not to cut wood or stop using kerosene for her lighting because it leads to global warming ?
Does she have a choice ?
We 've invented iPods and flat - screen TVs , but somehow have not invested in ways to eliminate an Iron Age technology that consumes wood inefficiently and creates harmful indoor air pollution .
Millions of poor households around the world use the classic three - stone cooker to prepare their food , while using wood as the basic fuel .
Millions of trees have to be cut to meet the cooking needs of the poor ; for lighting , millions of litres of kerosene are burnt daily .
Yet , in this lopsided world , we are spending millions of dollars on finding solutions for the problems created in the West while the poor in developing countries have no choice but to keep harming the environment .
Cheap and continuous Solutions do exist .
Many assume that renewable energies like solar electricity are too expensive for the poor .
Solar power gives remote villages access to clean electricity True , solar panels alone may be " expensive " but if they are combined with affordable financing mechanisms for the poor , they can be rolled out widely and make clean electricity a sustainable and viable option for millions around the developing world .
The poor spend between 10 - 15 % of their meagre income on energy services like lighting and cooking .
This is a much higher percentage than those people who are better off .
For example , a typical street vendor in Bangalore pays 15 rupees ( $ 0.32 ) for four hours of kerosene lighting each day .
On a monthly basis , she therefore pays $ 9 - 10 to light her street cart .
Today , solar lighting can be provided to her at commercial rates for $ 5 - 6 every a month .
The big bonus is that the vendor is able to pay for it on a daily basis , not on a monthly basis .
As one street vendor told me : " 300 rupees a month is expensive but 10 rupees a day is very affordable . "
Much attention has gone in to reducing the cost of the technology , but much less on the details of supply chains and financing .
This would make technologies like solar , bio - gas and small - hydro affordable today , not tomorrow , to the poor .
Clean and cheap electricity has social benefits as well as environmental ones Sustainable forms of energy can also play a key role in income generation - a primary path out of poverty for the millions who do not have access to reliable grid - distributed electricity .
The poor are also victims of inefficiency - they use inefficient sewing machines , bangle making machines and power looms .
This results in soaring overall costs .
The blame is placed on renewable energy technologies , not inefficiencies of the appliances .
Many of these devices are produced with the assumption that grid electricity is " infinite " so , especially in the developing world , there is little incentive to make more efficient products .
High - efficiency income - generating appliances would increase the attractiveness of renewable energy technologies - leading to higher incomes .
Solutions are simple and do - able , but require approaches that are focused on the poor .
Many of the policies , products ( both financial and technology ) and processes are designed with a top to bottom approach .
This can completely bypass the needs of the poor .
Technology is pushed down with disastrous consequences ; many solar systems used in the rural areas of India do not work well , creating a notion that renewable energies are not reliable .
Clean cooking solutions have been created but with the idea that one size fits all , without considering the different fuel sources , food choices , cooking styles , or the size of the family .
It 's high time that the poor become central to energy policies and not just recipients or " project beneficiaries " .
Only then will sustainable energy be their ticket out of poverty , as well as a vital way to address climate change .
Harish Hande is managing director of Selco Solar , India Selco Solar was the 2007 winner of the Outstanding Achievement Award from the Ashden Awards for Sustainable Energy Do you agree with Harish Hande ?
Are the needs of poor communities overlooked when energy policies are decided ?
Is it wrong that people in the 21st Century do not have access to electricity ?
Will solving developing nations ' energy needs help tackle climate change ?
I agree with Harish Hande .
Solar ovens are cheap and relatively simple devices that could be distributed widely ( although they would mean cooking during the day , the energy used to reheat food would be much less than cooking from scratch )
Also the " banana briquettes " Nottingham University have come up with is an extrememly promising idea .
On a larger scale , we should be building solar farms to electrolyse water ( sea or brackish water preferably ) to produce hydrogen which can be exported .
The addition of a fuel cell for local power needs would also produce heat and pure water as waste products for the benefit of the local community .
But I can't see the " illuminati " going for it .
Peter , london I totally agree with Harish Hande .
Many alternative technologies already exist that are aimed at helping the poor in developing countries to become more energy efficient and provide them with a better quality of life .
One only has to look at the winners of the Ashden Awards over the years to make a long list of these .
If the First World is serious about combatting climate change , one of the things it could do is to provide the finance to make these technologies accessible to those who need them , whose lives would be made better by having them and whose use of them would make a significant contribution to the battle against environmental degradation and climate change .
Paul Edwards , Sandford , Devon , UK
These are all very good points and another point I was reading about today is that the poorest of this world , mainly in Africa , need education and support and that can easily be provided through radio , but batteries or grid electricity is usually not available .
A simple wind - up radio is the answer for many who are eager to learn .
Also a similar device with LED lights can help them after sunset .
Another great tool is a pedal power device to recharge low voltage equipment such as cell phones .
It can also be used as a micro- business to generate some income , again in remote areas with no electricity .
All these little things can provide free energy to the poorest of the poor , and free sustainable energy means a lot when you have nothing .
Vincent , Nanoose Bay , Canada i agree with Harish Hande , for some reason and for some period , poor people actually been overlooked for a while , but right now , we reach a agreement that it is the poor people want to harm the enviornment it is they have no other choice not to .
The large amount of output of energy helping devices is definitely helpful for those poverty striken area .
Give them the most direct help is alway a good way for helping .
Rich countries ' help is definitely needed .
I think Poverty was largely result in short of Education and resources , Let us try our best to meet those gap by doing something that we can actually do to help them .
Carrie Zang , China , Beijing Well I agree with Mr Hande , it make sense .
We used to have that problem as well , poor people was unable to reach electricity , nowadays that problem has been solved and we have like a hundred more problems to overcome .
But here was easier to figure out a solution , because of the region size ( little one ) .
Keep it up , help your people .
Regards from the other side of the world .
Joseph , Central America / El Salvador
I care and would love to help make a change for the poor .
May Noble , Erith I agree with the article completely .
Renewable energy should not be considered as ' expensive ' - it pays for itself by generating a free source of energy , therefore it is not expensive .
It is only labelled as ' expensive ' by those who have a vested interest in keeping us consuming fossil fuels on a centralised grid .
Also if we invested in manufacture of renewables particularly in developing countries , the price would come down and create a virtuous cycle .
Helena , UK I 'd like to see a new era of international cooperation take root , not so much to promote economic growth as to support new enterprises the best of which branch and are replicated when they reach a certain size which maximizes benefits to people and the planet 's health .
Key to that is promoting use of electricity and the spectacular variety of its uses and potential .
The areas that fascinate me most at the moment are bio-electric power generation and transfer of solar generation potential from space to ground use .
Once the skies clear of haze potential for solar generation will increase as well .
In a way some of the less developed nations of the world may have an advantage because they can adopt new technology without having those around who defend old ways of power generation such as coal fired power plants .
Cities and nations can share the best business models and technology from renewable energy and environmentally friendly business incubators so sister cities in less deve !
loped parts of the World can create local jobs that benefit the people and the Earth .
One of the ways the world banking system could help would be to help fund a buy back program for outdated power generation systems so early adopters of new technology would not be at a disadvantage .
Dale Lanan , Longmont , Colorado , USA I thoroughly agree with Harish .
For years I have had the vision that developing countries should avoid making the same mistakes we have made in the past in developed countries , that is to develop their technological and social and business advancements using the same energy inefficient , carbon wasteful technologies .
Instead I have hoped for years that developing countries can progress by going straight into advanced , energy efficient and carbon low technologies and I am extremely frustrated with the ways in which general society does not seem to care about the struggles going on " over there , where its not my problem " .
We need to start caring , after all , the more educated and able we make our developing communities the more they can give back in working to improve technology , minimise climate change and development of their own economies and efficient businesses .
Its time we in the west stopped thinking only of ourselves .
Jennifer Austin , Winchester
If world has to fight global warming , we need to focus on how we can save our green forest & cutting of trees .
This is possible only if we make available economical non conventional energy sources & appliances made available to every poor rural family .

The suggested focus shift will help devise technology solutions that are more consumer friendly , while the financing options need to be poor - friedly .
Developing country needs may be mass scale , but developed countries too need to conserve , towards net eco-improvements .
A more mass level orientation would lead to better adaptation , and a class level involvement would help accelerate its implementation .
May both happen concurrently , we hope to see much improved results .
dr arun varma , Mumbai , india I agree with you that access to electricity and climate change mitigation may have joint solutions that solve both problems .
But i disagree with your statement blaming only the developed nations and not attributing any blame to the effected country .
If we take India as an example .
You rightly point out that electrification in India is about 50 % .
Based on current populations , that means about 25 % of the world 's 2 billion people without electricity can be attributed to India .
If India had followed the example of China which focused their development efforts to the electrification of their country , China has electrification approaching 80 % , then India would have been in a far better position than it is in today .
As i am sure you are aware electricfication is tantamaount to ecomomic growth and poverty reduction , why has India not planned or achieved more ?
I understand that India started their " Industrial Revolution " after China and so cannot directly be compared .
I also acknowledge that the issue of illegal stealing of electricity is a problem as it dissuades the owners or potential owners of the power generation capacity .
But having worked in India , i can't help worry that India will be unable to follow in China 's footsteps and achieve similar electrification and poverty allieviation .
Nick , UK " Are the needs of poor communities overlooked when energy policies are decided ? "
Of course they 're ignored , how can anyone sell them energy ( green or otherwise ) if they have no money ?
Also why do the poor need to build infrastructure to light a market stall with solar power .
I can buy a cheap but robust set of 8 solar powered driveway lamps for $ 25 AU , each $ 4 - 5 lamp puts out a similar amount of light to a kero lamp and a full charge will last about 10hrs ( would need an on / off switch to be usefull in the early morning .
All 8 of mine are still working after spending a maintenance free year on the front lawn .
The irony here is the solar lamps and their components are probably made for a tenth of what I paid by chinese peasants living in similar circumstances to the Indian 's in the article .
$ 4 - 5 lamp is a months worth of kero for the peasant but I belive there is a successfull bank offering micro-loans in india .
Pay the 10R / day for a month and then get " free " light for years .
Alan , Melbourne Australia Having lived in Nepal for 8 yrs I totally agree that the poor are left out .
I suffered from a grid that is fed by hydro but the power lines are knocked down at least once each monsoon .
I think local solar would mean that very remote villages could get power .
But Nepal is focused on hydro - a lot of which is sold to India !
I also agree that most appliances should be designed to reduce power usage , including mobile phones and computers so that as poor areas do get power they can use communication technology as well !
Lois , Surkhet , Nepal
Oh lovely , another naive , out - of - touch article trying to foist expensive alternative technology on the poor .
Let 's have a reality check here : the reason these people are not using renewable power sources is that they have better things to think about ( read : survival ) than worrying if their coal power plant is generating pollution .
Renewable energy sources , like solar power , are expensive and generate very little power compared to other power sources .
For example , the cost of powering a single home in the US with solar power is comparable to a second mortgage -- and that is during the summer .
While the power needs in poorer nations are less , the scale is roughly the same .
Are we to suddenly expect that these people will choose to defer to expensive , low - power , renewable energy sources when less expensive solutions are available from China or other places ?
Do you think they will care that the power plant is pumping out somewhat more pollution , when the cities are already polluted ?
At least people can enjoy having the power rather than think about whether they will be one of th! e select few who get to have some panels out on the top of the shack they live on .
Spending ( wasting ) money on such lofty endeavors as renewable energy sources simply ends up benefiting far fewer people overall .
It 's like the one - laptop - per- child programs where , rather than investing the money on widespread sanitation programs that would benefit large communities , a few select individuals or classrooms get to use the West 's newfangled " pet- project " technologies .
Chris C , Salt Lake City , USA
Yes , I am fully agreed with Mr. Harish Hande .
India is a country where tremendous solar energy is available ; still solar energy remained untapped because of non availability of technology which can provide cheaper options .
Existing solar equipments and technologies need promotion to create an atmosphere for solar energy research .
The research on solar energy must be emphasized .
Reasonable mandatory targets may be fixed for the research institutes , to enhance the research on the solar energy .
But , there is definitely a need to push the existing solar equipments to create an environment for the generation of the new solar technology .
Adopting existing solar energy technologies and equipments definitely reduce the burden on the forest and the climate .
Sanjay Singh Thakur , Indore , India
This is a good idea that has always been put forward , however if this were to be implemented then the balance of dependancy \ power and control would change .
The so called providers who are happier keeping the poor , poor and dependant , would need to change their existing money making models , which they no doubt will .
Untill a clear case of profitablity from such enterprise can be established this is but a dream .
One out the reach of the poor and to far out of the box to consider by the save the planet money men .

Rounding up is caused by many factors .
One is too much wind and force aloft which tends to heel the boat over .
This reduces the amount of rudder in the water and thus the rudder ’s effectiveness .
Another factor in rounding up is the center of pressure of wind on the sails is too far aft which then pushes the aft of the boat downwind and thus the front of the boat up wind .
The NauticEd SailTrim clinic discusses this topic and so what we wanted to do was test it out for sure .
So last weekend we took out a friend ’s Beneteau 373 to test out an anti-round up theory .
Read on to find out the results of our experiment .
First though , we must first understand wind shear .
The phenomenon of wind shear is pretty easy .
Wind moves faster at the top of the mast than is does at the water level because the stationary water slows the down the wind in close proximity .
Secondly , consider the concept of true wind vs apparent wind .
Which is best understood by imagining driving your car in a cross wind with your hand out the window of the car .
At stand still you would feel the wind coming from the side of the car .
The faster you go , the more you feel the wind coming from the front of the car .
But when a gust of wind comes ( which is just an increase in true wind speed ) then you would feel the wind shift back more to the side .
When relating this to a sailboat , if your boat was standing still , the wind at the top of the mast would be the same apparent direction as at the cockpit level albeit , faster ( from the wind shear phenomenon ) .
However as your boat picks up in speed the apparent wind moves forward BUT because of wind shear it shifts forward less at the top of the mast .
IE at the top of the mast the wind tends more to the direction of true wind direction because the true wind speed is higher .
Thus at the top of the mast the true wind is more aft than apparent wind .
Aft means it is coming from a direction further towards the back of the boat .
Get it ?
So – whether you get it or not .
The fact is : at the top of the mast the wind is higher in speed and more aft than at the cockpit level .
Figure A and B show the boat speed , true wind and apparent wind vectors for cockpit level and top of the mast .
Obviously in both cases , the boat speed vector must be the same .
The true wind vector is obviously the same direction but due to wind shear it is longer ( faster ) at the top of the mast .
This results then in the apparent wind direction being more aft .
IE in this case from 135 deg to 125 deg .
Thirdly , you should understand that if a sail is sheeted in to tight it creates more heel .
This then is exactly what is happening at the top of the mast .
Even though at the bottom of the sail you may have perfectly trimmed the sail , the top of the sail is sheeted in too tight against higher wind speed .
No wonder you ’re getting excessive heeling .
And excessive heeling creates round ups .
This is now quite a revelation !
It means that the top of the main needs to be “ out ” further than the bottom of the sail for it to operate efficiently .
This is usually indicated by the top telltale .
Often the leeward telltale will be stalling at the top of the sail .
Especially in high wind because of the phenomena above .
Thus the top of the mainsail needs to be let out further so that the leeward telltale can fly smoothly .
This is commonly referred to as twisting the sail out at the top .
Except people believe you are just spilling out ( wasting ) the wind at the top .
Not quite so now , as you ’ve just learned .
Twisting out the top of the sail is letting the top of the sail fly according to the direction of wind it is feeling .
In the illustration , you can see the top telltale on the downwind side is fluttering .
If you let out the main at the top , the wind can reattach to the sail on the leeward side and the telltale will fly smoothly reducing the force aloft .
Understanding all the above .
How do we stop rounding up ?
Option one : Obviously the first and safe option in higher winds is to reef the sail .
Option two :
Let out the traveler which is what most people do when hit by a gust .
Just so long as you realize what you ’ve done is not twisted the top of the sail out – all you ’ve done is let out the mainsail from top to bottom and thus depower the mainsail .
This reduces the force aloft and thus the heel .
It also moves the center of effort of wind on the sails forward which reduces tendency to round up .
The trouble is that you spend all day fighting gusts with still quite a few involuntary round - ups .
Option three : Let out on the mainsheet .
Here again you ’ve depowered the entire mainsail to handle the gust .
Still , it works .
Option four : Permanently reduce the force aloft by letting out further on the mainsail and tightening up on the traveler .
The trick here is to bring the mainsail bottom back in again using the traveler .
Yes , bring the traveler to windward up past the center point .
Most sailors are reluctant to do this because they ’ve been taught that it detaches the wind on the leeward side .
But not when you ’ve let out the mainsheet .
In effect , by letting out on the mainsheet , you ’ve allowed the boom to rise up and the leech of the sail to slacken .
This creates the desired twist at the top and allows the top of the sail to fly according to its apparent direction .
At the same time , the bottom of the sail can fly according to its apparent direction .
By trimming the traveler and mainsheet together you can manage the twist at the top of the sail as desired yet still keep power on the bottom of the mainsail .
Keeping power on the bottom of the mainsail keeps your speed up which also increases the effectiveness of the rudder .
Increasing the effectiveness of the rudder means it can hold more against any turning effect created by the shifting of center of pressure backwards .
Wow – see how it is all connected .
What happened on our 15 knot gusty sailing day ?
Well , not one round up .
So to summarize , the sailing lesson here is when in higher winds bring the traveler up and sheet out the main .
You ’ll also need to release the boom vang a little .
Letting the boom vang out allows the boom to rise which loosens the leech ( trailing edge ) of the sail and allows the top part to “ twist out ” .
This and many other finer sail trim concepts are discussed in NauticEd ’s Sail Trim Clinic .
“ If I get out of control and start leveling baseless charges , ” Glenn Beck claimed on his Fox News Channel show Monday , “ guess what happens ?
I ’m fired . ”
But that evidently did n’t stop him from later accusing President Barack Obama of allegedly refusing to meet with BP ’s CEO because the British oil giant ’s top executive is white .

The Fox News host played a clip of President Obama declaring , Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ My experience is when you talk to a guy like a BP CEO , heÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s going to say all the right things to me .
IÃ ¢â‚¬â „ ¢m not interested in words , IÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢m interested in action .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
He then went on to rebuke Obama for saying he ’d meeting with the president of Iran , but not the chief of BP .
Lampooning Obama , Beck remarked , Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ IÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ll meet with Mahmoud AhmadinejadÃ¢â‚
¬Â¦ without any preconditions because we have to be able to talkÃ¢â‚ ¬Â¦ WeÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ll sit down , have some tea , some crumpetsÃ¢â‚ ¬Â¦ Yeah , you Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢re a raging lunatic but we can get through to you and trust you .
Now , the BP CEO ?
Depart from me , evil one !
Ã¢â‚¬Â
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ What is it that the dictator of IranÃ¢â‚ ¬Â¦ has in the credibility department that the CEO of BP does nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t have ?
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â Beck quipped .
No , Beck signaled .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ HeÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s a white CEO , ” Beck remarked .
“ Maybe that Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s itÃ¢â‚ ¬Â ¦ White CEOÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢sÃ¢â‚
¬Â¦ they donÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t want to pay their tax dollars and have those tax dollars go to Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœinner city kids .
Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â

He added that some blogger “ at Huffington Post ” or elsewhere would accuse of him of making “ baseless accusations against this president . ”
“ You ’re right , ” Beck said .
“ I ’ll stop , I ’ll just let the president say it . ”
Beck then played a comment Obama made in 1995 , which he proceeded to take out of context : “ And I really want to emphasize the word ‘ responsibility . ’
I think that whether you are a white executive living out in the suburbs who does n’t want to pay taxes to inner-city children for them to go to school … ”
ADVERTISEMENT
As Media Matters notes , Beck left out the rest of Obama ’s comment , which noted “ both of those groups have to take some responsibility if we ’re going to get beyond the kinds of divisions that we face right now . ”
This is n’t the first time Beck has made an inflammatory racial comment .
ADVERTISEMENT
Beck told the host of Fox & Friends last July that Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ this president has exposed himself , I think , as a guy Ã¢â‚¬â€ over and over and over again Ã¢â‚¬â€  who has a deep - seated hatred for white people or the white culture .
Ã¢â‚¬Â 
Moments later , Beck added , Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ IÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢m not saying he [ Obama ] does nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t like white people , IÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢m saying he has a problem .
This guy is , I believe , a racist .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
His comment subsequently sparked a campaign to drive advertisers from his program .
Raw Story reported on a law student ’s campaign against Beck earlier this month .

The Best Classic Video Games Online
We are complete suckers for nostalgia and we can't help but tip our proverbial hats to those sites that have managed to bring us some of the best games from our childhood .
Whether they 're classic casino games classic Nintendo games or Gameboy Online , the internet is a veritable treasure trove when it comes to blasts from the past .
Not all games however are built the same .
While most developers do their best to create flash versions of our beloved classics , most seem to fall short when it comes to quality or game play and are unable to emulate that old feel .
With hundreds of online casino sites to choose from , it 's difficult to navigate through the debris .
Without a doubt , Leo Vegas Casino is Europe 's best casino site for dozens of reasons including top - notch customer support ; the world 's leading mobile casino ; hundreds of online casino games to choose from including live dealer games ; free bonus codes and exciting promotions ; and much more .
Visit the best of the best and you 'll see exactly why Leo Vegas is the number one site for European players .
Card games are actually some of the most nostalgic games you can play online for free .
They could remind you of your childhood when you just passed time before the internet was even around , or played together as a family around the dinner table .
Perhaps it took a thunderstorm before this forced everyone together under candlelight as the electricity went out , or at a holiday cabin .
Some popular card games include rummy , patience , go fish , war , crazy eights and more .
You may have even enjoyed playing gambling type card games like poker or baccarat .
Just like poker , the latter can be played for free online with sites available at http://baccaratfarms.com.
Some of the best games that can be found on the internet however include ;
Contra
We all remember Contra and we just could n't get enough of it .
It is one of the very few classic Nintendo games that have been successfully transferred to the internet .
No matter how great the graphics get , we will never forget where we started and that was aimlessly jumping over ricks towards a destination I can barely even remembers .
Pokémon
Who does n't remember playing Gameboy ?
You were officially one of the cool kids on the playground if you had this little gadget in tow .
Pokémon is what defined our generation and your Pokémon catching capabilities were hat defined your popularity in school .
While there are much more than 150 Pokémon today , we just gotta catch ' em all on its online Gameboy version which has managed to recreate the same magic on the computer .
Legend of Zelda : Links Awakening
No article about classic Nintendo games is complete without a shout out to the Legend of Zelda .
Link was our most constant companion in those days when you had little else to do but play Gameboy .
It 's dangerous to go alone , better take a little bite out of the past with the online version of this classic .
Super Mario World : Yoshi's Island
It was a toss - up between the original super Mario brothers and this golden oldie .
We can tell you for sure that the final decision was not entirely impartial .
We remember playing this one for hours on end as Yoshi kept changing colors for extra powers .
Plus we can never get enough satisfaction from wiping that annoying smile off of Bowser 's face .
Luckily , we got a chance to do just that on its online version which is not a far cry from its original .
Developers have actually done a pretty good job of making it true to the original .
To play this exciting game , as well as many more popular titles , visit our friends for the ultimate gaming experience .
Mortal Kombat
What better way to let off steam after a hard day at school then by punching someone 's head right off their shoulders ?
Mortal Kombat was immensely violent but times were simpler back then and we thank God for that or we would n't have this amazing game to remember .
The online version is just as good .
So head on over and claim your flawless victory .
The price of folly
I hope that all of the people who helped push the UnitedStates to invade Iraq in 2003 read the front - page story in Sunday ’s New YorkTimes about a courageous soldier , Specialist Brendan Marrocco .
It is heart - breaking .
He lostboth arms and both legs to a roadside bomb in Iraq and is now in rehabilitation .
Tens of thousands of others havesuffered or died in that unnecessary and foolish war .
Marrocco ’s story , however , brings us face - to - face with war ’s horrible consequences and reminds us of the price that is paid when policymakers blunder into war .
I can’t help but wonder what George Bush , Dick Cheney , Paul Wolfowitz , Condoleezza Rice , Donald Rumsfeld , William Kristol , James Woolsey , and Doug Feith will think when they read about the damage done to Specialist Marrocco ’s life and his family ?
Do they feel a secret shame , which they are too proud or afraid to voice ?
Do they have any regrets for the pain that they have caused him ?
Do they still believe they were right , even though so many Iraqi and American lives have been shattered , and Iraq is still a wreck of a country ?
Or do they simply turn the page without reflecting on the consequences of their actions , and hope that the rest of us will forget the role they played ?
Wars are sometimes necessary , but that was certainly not true of the Iraq war .
War should always be a last resort , because many of those who get caught up in the maelstrom suffer and die .
The decision to send our armed forces into combat should never be made in a half - baked way .
The decision should only come after there has been a vigorous and serious public debate about the costs , benefits , and possible alternatives to fighting .
Of course , that is not what happened in the run-up to the Iraq war .
Instead , we went to war on March 19 , 2003 because a narrow clique of neo-conservatives dreamed up a bizarre scheme to " transform " the Middle East by spreading democracy across the region at the end of a rifle barrel , and eventually managed to sell that idea to a naïve and gullible president .
We went to war because the Bush administration and its friends in the media and Congress deceived us about the dangers Iraq posed , and because they misled us about how easy it would be to win a decisive victory and exit Iraq .
We went to war because the mainstream media , which is heavily into cultivating favor with influential policymakers , hardly ever asked our leaders hard questions about the case for war .
Indeed , many influential pundits became enthusiastic cheerleaders for the invasion .
We went to war because many politicians in both parties were so worried about their careers that they were afraid to raise doubts about the war , even though some of them had serious reservations about whether we would succeed .
And we went to war because experts who craved influence in Washington or future careers in government wanted to show how tough and resolute they were .
The United States is a remarkably powerful and sheltered country , which is why it can afford to fight stupid wars in places like Iraq and Vietnam at only modest cost to its overall security .
But we should never forget the human cost of these follies , which are paid by brave patriots like Brendan Marrocco as well as the 58,000 - plus names on the Vietnam Memorial .
And when the same people start telling us we need to attack someone else , we should remember just how foolish and ignorant their advice was in 2002 and remind ourselves that they show no sign of either learning or remorse .
Darth Vader ’s body has been banned from all future Lucasfilm - sanctioned Star Wars conventions , according to Cinematical ( via The Force ) .
David Prowse , the actor who portrayed Vader ’s bionic body in the original Star Wars trilogy , posted the news to his website last month stating he learned from organizers of Celebration V , taking place August 12 - 15 in Orlando , FL , that he was not to be invited , nor would he be invited for all future events .
After inquiring into the decision , he claims he was told by Lucasfilm representatives that he had " burnt too many bridges ” between Lucasfilm and himself .
Prowse has notoriously opposed George Lucas over the years for his replacement of Prowse ’s voice as Vader with James Earl Jones in the original trilogy , and for the casting of Sebastian Shaw as the unmasked Vader in Return Of The Jedi .
This ban is a hit to Prowse ’s mini-industry of autograph sales which he has used to fund arthritis and prostate cancer charities .
Nevertheless , he still has a full schedule of conventions ahead which Lucasfilm does not control .
Celebration V is scheduled to feature such regular convention guests as Carrie Fisher , Mark Hamill , Anthony Daniels , Peter Mayhew , and Jeremy Bulloch , with a special appearance by George Lucas himself .
Lucas not wanting Prowse in his sightlines will make Prowse ’s absence a great disappointment to fans , whose only chance of any Darth Vader interaction at the event is at Jake Lloyd ’s table .
North Korea 's ailing leader Kim Jong - il is speeding up the transfer of power to his son Jong - un , intelligence suggests .
" There is intelligence information indicating Kim Jong - un accompanied Kim Jong-il on an inspection tour last week to North Pyongan Province , " a South Korean government official said Thursday .
" One thing that is certain is that posters lauding Jong - un were hung in the factory Kim Jong - il toured . "
On Saturday , North Korea 's official KCNA news agency broadcast Kim's " on -the - spot - guidance " tour of a factory in Sinuiju showing posters urging North Koreans to " match footsteps " with their leader 's " self - sacrifices for CNC . "
The official said the word " footsteps " has been used since last year only in reference to the succession .
" Footsteps " is also the title of a song praising Kim Jong - un .
The song , which was distributed at Kim Jong - il 's orders last year , repeatedly uses the phrase " Captain Kim " for Jong - un .
And a North Korean film reel depicting Kim Jong - il 's birthday celebrations on Feb. 16 shows the North Korean leader at a performance of the song .
" CNC , " which stands for " computer numerical control , " is also a peculiar code for Kim Jong - un .
A Unification Ministry official said the term CNC " is used to convey something new and young and suggests the rise of the new leader Kim Jong - un . "
North Korea has been touting the importance of cutting - edge technology and has been pushing the widespread implementation of computer - automated production technology .
Kim Jong - il 's field inspections target factories that have embraced " CNC " technology .
" This trend became apparent after Kim Jong - un was tapped as heir last year , " the official said .
" It is interesting to see North Korea using foreign terminology , which it usually detests . "
This article , part of a series of articles about Python ’s internals , will continue our preparation to engage the machinery of code evaluation by discussing Code Objects .
To those of you who just now joined in and did n’t even read the introduction ( but why ? ! ) , please note an important disclaimer : while the series as a whole is CPython 3.x centric and might not ‘ apply cleanly ’ to other Python implementations , matters of bytecode and evaluation ( like this article discusses ) are even more likely to deviate between implementations .
So some of what I say in this post may apply to other implementations , some not – I ’m not even checking at the moment ; if and when we ’ll discuss implementations like PyPy , Jython , IronPython , etc , I ’ll highlight some of the differences .
With this disclaimer in mind , we can get back to the plot : Code Objects .
The compilation of Python source code emits Python bytecode , which is evaluated at runtime to produce whatever behaviour the programmer implemented .
I guess you can think of bytecode as ‘ machine code for the Python virtual machine ’ , and indeed if you look at some binary x86 machine code ( like this one : 0x55 0x89 0xe5 0xb8 0x2a 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x5d ) and some Python bytecode ( like that one : 0x64 0x1 0x0 0x53 ) they look more or less like the same sort of gibberish .
Along with the actual bytecode , Python ’s compiler emits additional fields , most of them must be coupled with the bytecode ( otherwise it would be meaningless ) .
The bytecode and these fields are lumped together in an object called a code object , our subject for this article .
You might initially confuse function objects with code objects , but should n’t .
Functions are higher level creatures that execute code by relying on a lower level primitive , the code object , but adding more functionality on top of that ( in other words , every function has precisely one code object directly associated with it , this is the function ’s __code__ attribute , or f_code in Python 2.x ) .
For example , among other things , a function keeps a reference to the global namespace ( remember that ? ) in which it was originally defined , and knows the default values of arguments it receives .
You can sometimes execute a code objects without a function ( see eval and exec ) , but then you will have to provide it with a namespace or two to work in .
Finally , just for accuracy ’s sake , please note that tp_call of a function object is n’t exactly like exec or eval ; the latter do n’t pass in arguments or provide free argument binding ( more below on these ) .
If this does n’t sit well with you yet , do n’t panic , it just means functions ’ code objects wo n’t necessarily be executable using eval or exec .
I hope we have that settled .
Let ’s see when code objects are created .
Code objects are created whenever a block of Python code is compiled .
We have mentioned blocks briefly before , the fine material defines them as “ a piece of Python program text that is executed as a unit .
The following are blocks : a module , a function body , and a class definition . ” ( the fine material also lists other but less - interesting - to - us code blocks , like every command in the interactive interpreter , the string passed to Python ’s executable ’s - c switch , etc ) .
As usual , I do n’t want to dig too deeply into compilation , but basically when a code block is encountered , it has to be successfully transformed into an AST ( which requires mostly that its syntax will be correct ) , which is then passed to ./ Python/compile.c : PyAST_Compile , the entry point into Python ’s compilation machinary .
A kind comment in ./ Python / compile .c explains the general execution flow of this function .
Next , let ’s discuss what is in a code object ; I said it has stuff other than bytecode , but what ?
To whet our appetite about the various fields of a code object , we can look at the compiled Python sample from the first paragraph and disassemble it ourselves ; it ’s easier if we know beforehand that both samples implement a function which simply returns the value 42 .
Unlike the x86 machine code sample , which is self - contained and should be ready to run ( < cough > assuming I did n’t botch it </ cough > ) the Python bytecode sample does n’t include the constant value 42 in it at all .
You absolutely can’t run this code meaningfully without its constants , and indeed 42 is referred to by one of the extra fields of the code object .
We will best see the interaction between the actual bytecode and the accompanying fields as we do a manual disassembly .
From the interpreter ( as usual , slight editing for readability ) :
# the opcode module has a mapping of opcode # byte values to their symbolic names >>> import opcode >>> def return 42 ( ) : return 42 ... # this is the function 's code object >>> return42.__code__ < code object return42 ... > # this is the actual bytecode >>> return42.__code__.co_code b'd\x01\x00S ' # this is the field holding constants >>>
return42.__code__.co_consts ( None , 42 ) # the first opcode is LOAD_CONST >>> opcode.opname[return42.__code__.co_code[0 ] ]
' LOAD_CONST ' # LOAD_CONST has one word as an operand # let 's get its value >>> return42.__code__.co_code [ 1 ] + \ ... 256 * return42.__code__.co_code [ 2 ]
1 # and which constant can we find in offset 1 ? >>> return42.__code__.co_consts [ 1 ] 42 # finally , the next opcode >>> opcode.opname[return42.__code__.co_code[ 3 ] ]
' RETURN_VALUE ' >>>
I hope this was educational , albeit doing it all the time could get boring .
Fortunately , we have dis to do this work for us ( >>> from dis import dis , you already saw I aliased and augmented it as diss ) .
In addition to dis , the function show_code from the same module is useful to look at code objects ( I aliased and augmented a bit as ssc ) .
So let ’s look at return 42 with diss and ssc :
>>> diss ( return42 ) 1 0 LOAD_CONST 1 ( 42 ) 3 RETURN_VALUE >>> ssc( return42 ) Name : return42 Filename : < stdin >
Argument count : 0 Kw - only arguments : 0 Number of locals : 0 Stack size : 1 Flags : OPTIMIZED , NEWLOCALS , NOFREE Constants : 0 : None 1 : 42 >>>
We see diss and ssc generally agree with our disassembly , though ssc further parsed all sorts of other fields of the code object which we did n’t handle so far ( you can run dir on a code object to see them yourself ) .
We have also seen that our value of 42 is indeed referred to by a field of the code object , rather than somehow be encoded in the bytecode .
Code objects are immutable and their fields do n’t hold any references ( directly or indirectly ) to mutable objects .
This immutability is useful in simplifying many things , one of which is the handling of nested code blocks .
An example of a nested code block is a class with two methods : the class is built using a code block , and this code block nests two inner code blocks , one for each method .
This situation is recursively handled by creating the innermost code objects first and treating them as constants for the enclosing code object ( much like an integer or a string literal would be treated ) .
You may be wondering how mutable object literals ( a = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] ) are represented in a code object , and the answer is that rather than referring to the mutable object with the code object , the ‘ recipe ’ to prepare it is kept ( try >>> import dis ; dis.dis( compile ( " a=( 1,2,[3,4, {5:6} ] ) " , " string " , " exec " ) ) to make this immediately clear ) .
Now that we have seen the relation between the bytecode and a code object field ( co_consts ) , let ’s take a look at the myriad of other fields in a code object .
To be honest , I ’m not sure this list would be particularly exciting .
Many of these fields are just integer counters or tuples of strings representing how many or which variables of various sorts are used in a code object .
But looking to the horizon where ceval.c and frame object evaluation is waiting for us , I can tell you that we need an immediate and crisp understanding of all these fields and their exact meaning , subtleties included .
So I ’ll ( tediously ? ) list and categorize them all , building on the rather terse description you can find in the standard type hierarchy .
If this seems to boring right now , you best skim it now but keep it as a reference for later posts ; trust me , it ’s useful .
Identity or origin ( strings )
co_name A name ( a string ) for this code object ; for a function this would be the function ’s name , for a class this would be the class ’ name , etc .
The compile builtin does n’t let you specify this , so all code objects generated with it carry the name < module > .
co_filename
The filename from which the code was compiled .
Will be < stdin > for code entered in the interactive interpreter or whatever name is given as the second argument to compile for code objects created with compile .
Different types of names ( string tuples )
co_varnames
A tuple containing the names of the local variables ( including arguments ) .
To parse this tuple properly you need to look at co_flags and the counter fields listed below , so you ’ll know which item in the tuple is what kind of variable .
In the ‘ richest ’ case , co_varnames contains ( in order ) : positional argument names ( including optional ones ) , keyword only argument names ( again , both required and optional ) , varargs argument name ( i.e. , * args ) , kwds argument name ( i.e. , ** kwargs ) , and then any other local variable names .
So you need to look at co_argcount , co_kwonlyargcount and co_flags to fully interpret this tuple .
co_cellvars
A tuple containing the names of local variables that are stored in cells ( discussed in the previous article ) because they are referenced by lexically nested functions .
co_freevars
A tuple containing the names of free variables .
Generally , a free variable means a variable which is referenced by an expression but is n’t defined in it .
In our case , it means a variable that is referenced in this code object but was defined and will be dereferenced to a cell in another code object ( also see co_cellvars above and , again , the previous article ) .
co_names
A tuple containing the names which are n’t covered by any of the other fields ( they are not local variables , they are not free variables , etc ) used by the bytecode .
This includes names deemed to be in the global or builtin namespace as well as attributes ( i.e. , if you do foo . bar in a function , bar will be listed in its code object ’s names ) .
Counters and indexes ( integers )
co_argcount
The number of positional arguments the code object expects to receive , including those with default values .
For example , def foo ( a , b , c=3 ) : pass would have a code object with this value set to three .
The code object of classes accept one argument which we will explore when we discuss class creation .
co_kwonlyargcount
The number of keyword arguments the code object can receive .
co_nlocals
The number of local variables used in the code object ( including arguments ) .
co_firstlineno
The line offset where the code object ’s source code began , relative to the module it was defined in , starting from one .
In this ( and some but not all other regards ) , each input line typed in the interactive interpreter is a module of its own .
co_stacksize
The maximum size required of the value stack when running this object .
This size is statically computed by the compiler ( ./ Python/compile.c : stackdepth when the code object is created , by looking at all possible flow paths searching for the one that requires the deepest value stack .
To illustrate this , look at the diss and ssc outputs for a = 1 and a = [ 1,2,3 ] .
The former has at most one value on the value stack at a time , the latter has three , because it needs to put all three integer literals on the stack before building the list .
Other stuff ( various )
co_code
A string representing the sequence of bytecode instructions , contains a stream of opcodes and their operands ( or rather , indexes which are used with other code object fields to represent their operands , as we saw above ) .
co_consts
A tuple containing the literals used by the bytecode .
Remember everything in a code object must be immutable , running diss and ssc on the code snippets a= ( 1,2,3 ) versus [ 1,2,3 ] and yet again versus a= ( 1,2,3 , [ 4,5,6 ] ) recommended to dig this field .
co_lnotab A string encoding the mapping from bytecode offsets to line numbers .
If you happen to really care how this is encoded you can either look at ./ Python/compile.c or ./Lib/dis.py : findlinestarts .
co_flags
An integer encoding a number of flags regarding the way this code object was created ( which says something about how it should be evaluated ) .
The list of possible flags is listed in ./ Include / code.h , as a small example I can give CO_NESTED , which marks a code object which was compiled from a lexically nested function .
Flags also have an important role in the implementation of the __future__ mechanism , which is still unused in Python 3.1 at the time of this writing , as no “ future syntax ” exists in Python 3.1 .
However , even when thinking in Python 3.x terms co_flags is still important as it facilitates the migration from the 2.x branch .
In 2.x , __future__ is used when enabling Python 3.x like behaviour ( i.e. , from __future__ import print_function in Python 2.7 will disable the print statement and add a print function to the builtins module , just like in Python 3.x ) .
If we come across flags from now on ( in future posts ) , I ’ll try to mention their relevance in the particular scenario .
co_zombieframe
This field of the PyCodeObject struct is not exposed in the Python object ; it ( optionally ) points to a stack frame object .
This can aid performance by maintaining an association between a code object and a stack frame object , so as to avoid reallocation of frames by recycling the frame object used for a code object .
There ’s a detailed comment in ./ Objects/frameobject.c explaining zombie frames and their reanimation , we may mention this issue again when we discuss stack frames .
Phew !
This is everything in a code object .
In making this list I ’ve compiled quite a few code blocks , looking how changes in the Python source changes the resulting code object .
I recommend you do something similar , and I actually bothered to make it ultra-easy for you to look into how various code blocks affect these fields : in the Mercurial repository I have for this series I created a directory called code_objects , within it you can find a self - explaining little utility that can facilitate looking at a few sample code blocks I wrote alongside with their disassembly and show_code output .
Not all fields are necessarily covered in the sample code blocks I provided , you should be able to add a few more samples ( if anything intrigues you ) yourself and see them disassembled / analyzed .
Also , I ’m sorry , I ’m totally a * NIX bigot ( and will erase all flame or even flame - ish comments about that ) and this toy might not run on Windows .
There ’s no good reason for that , I just wanted to use less for pagination , etc , and could n’t be bothered with achieving the same effect on Windows .
This pretty much sums up what I have to say about code objects at the moment .
Time permitting , I sincerely hope we ’ll soon reach the next article , where we ’ll tackle the final frontier before ./ Python / ceval.c : PyEval_EvalFrameEx itself : frame objects .
¡ Olé !
I would like to thank Nick Coghlan for reviewing this article ; any mistakes that slipped through are my own .
Astronomers have identified a massive comet - like structure - spanning a whopping three million light years - that is tearing through a distant galaxy cluster at more than 750 kilometres a second .
Yes , you read that right .
A great ball of fiery gas* , some five thousand million times the size of the solar system .
Fortunately , it is n't anywhere near Earth .
The flaming gas - ball is in the Abell 3266 galaxy cluster , even more millions of light years away from us than it is across .
The fireball , which is the largest object of this kind ever identified , was spotted by stargazers using the European Space Agency 's XMM - Newton X - Ray telescope .
The researchers have produced an entropy map of the gas - ball , which allows them to pick out the relatively cold dense gas of the comet from the hotter gas of the galaxy cluster .
Analysis of the data has revealed remarkable detail of the stripping of gas from the comet 's core , ESA says , at a rate of about a Sun 's mass , every hour .
The scientists who discovered the object describe it as " truly fantastic " .
" In Abell 3266 we are seeing structure formation in action , " said Professor Mark Henriksen , co-author of the results .
" Dark matter is the gravitational glue holding the gas ball together .
But as it races through the galaxy cluster , a tug - of - war ensues where the galaxy cluster eventually wins , stripping off and dispersing gas that perhaps one day will seed star and galaxy growth within the cluster . "
Zurich - based researcher Dr. Francesco Miniati commented : " What interests astronomers is not just the size of the gas ball but the role it plays in the formation and evolution of structure in the universe . " ®
* Please take note that considerable restraint has been exercised , and no references to ' great balls of fire ' have been made in this article .
