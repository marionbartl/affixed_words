An end to abstinence only , in black and white
A reader points out this passage in the president 's budget ( .pdf ) :
The 2010 Budget proposes a new Teen Pregnancy Prevention Initiative to support community - based and faith - based efforts to reduce teen pregnancy using evidence - based and promising models .
In addition , a new Strengthening Communities Fund will help build the capacity of non-profit organizations and State , Local and Tribal entities to better serve low - income and disadvantaged populations .
This Budget also proposes funding for ( 1 ) a new child welfare initiative , and ( 2 ) a human services case management system for Federally - declared disasters .
This Budget eliminates funding for Community - Based Abstinence Education , the mandatory Title V Abstinence Education program , the Compassion Capital Fund , and Rural Community Facilities .
This is no surprise , but it 's a reminder of the way in which a budget shifts not just money but also priorities and politics .
In this case , it will will cut off streams of funding to religiously oriented groups allied with the Bush White House .
UPDATE : I 'm told there is a pool of money that will be available to -- but not guaranteed for -- abstinence only programs that show promise and agree to rigorous analysis of their results .

For the first time , it could also buy a share of Citigroup Inc C.N , once the world 's largest bank by market value .
The price of a Citigroup share on Thursday fell below $ 1 in a sign that investors are losing confidence that the lender , which operates in more than 100 countries , can be restored to health after $ 37.5 billion of losses in the 15 months ended December 31 .
Shares fell as low as 97 cents , leaving the bank with a market value below $ 6 billion -- down from more than $ 277 billion in late 2006 .
The decline came even though Citigroup has gotten $ 45 billion of taxpayer - funded capital since October , and despite federal efforts to stimulate the economy and lending .
Citigroup was not immediately available for comment .
“ It ’s nothing but bad news , ” said James Barth , a finance professor at Auburn University and a senior fellow at the Milken Institute .
“ One might have thought the stimulus from Washington would have had some positive impact , but nothing is turning around investor confidence .
The concern is that there is a point at which the government looks at Citigroup and says , enough is enough . ”
Citigroup remains part of the Dow Jones industrial average .
DJI of 30 blue - chip companies .
Naomi Kim , a spokeswoman for Dow Jones Indexes , which maintains that index , said : " We are watching the situation closely . "
Other banks in the index are Bank of America Corp BAC.N and JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N .
Vikram Pandit , Citigroup ’s chief executive , is trying to sell poorly - performing businesses and shed risky debt to cap losses , bolster capital and avoid the potential nationalization of New York - based Citigroup that many investors fear .
The Obama administration and regulators including Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke have said they do not want the government to take full control of the nation ’s banks .
In early afternoon trading , Citigroup shares had recovered some losses , and were down 8 cents at $ 1.05 .
The New York Stock Exchange has suspended until June 30 a rule requiring delisting of companies whose share price remains persistently below $ 1 .
THROWING IN THE TOWEL
Citigroup was created in 1998 when Sanford “ Sandy ” Weill merged his Travelers Group Inc with Citicorp .
Weill then persuaded the government to repeal the Glass - Steagall Act , a Great Depression - era law that kept commercial banks from entering investment banking .
The bank was ultimately done in by massive bets on risky debt and securitizations , especially under Weill ’s successor Charles Prince .
These have led to two federal bailouts and a government agreement to share in losses on $ 300.8 billion of toxic debt .
The government on Friday agreed to swap some preferred shares into common stock , giving taxpayers a potential 36 percent stake .
Citigroup has eliminated its common stock dividend .
“ The loss of confidence is pervasive , ” said John Schloegel , vice president of investment strategies for Capital Cities Asset Management in Austin , Texas .
“ With it officially going to a penny stock , those last few institutions are throwing in the towel . ”
Worries about the banking industry are a prime reason that U.S. stocks have lost more than half their value since late 2007 , driving shares to levels last seen in the mid-1990s .
“ What ’s unusual today is that problems are n’t contained to the U.S. banking industry , but have been exported to other industries and countries around the world through securitizations and the capital markets , ” Auburn ’s Barth said .
“ No one knows where the losses are or how big they will be . ”
THE father of missing York chef Claudia Lawrence has hit out at claims by a Labour councillor that praying for his daughter is futile .
In an interview published yesterday in the Church Times , Peter Lawrence said City of York councillor Paul Blanchard had no right to make the remarks .
“ Coun Blanchard is obviously a professed atheist and is entitled to his own views , but he is not entitled to express them in relation to Claudia , ” said Mr Lawrence , who is a steward and regular member of the congregation at York Minster .
He was responding to Coun Blanchard ’s comments on his personal Facebook page attacking the fact church communities across
York were praying for Claudia ’s safe return .
“ Like praying is going to achieve anything , ” he wrote , as previously reported by The Press .
“ Of all the pointless things to do here , praying wins the prize .
Time would be better spent out looking for her surely .
“ Is God some kind of sick kickfest where he makes her go missing , sees how many people pray to him , and then decides to intervene based on the number of prayers received ? ”
Coun Blanchard has since offered an unreserved apology , printed in The Press .
Mr Lawrence , who lives in Slingsby , told the Church Times the Minster community had been hugely supportive .
He also described part of his brain as totally numb , which is why he can tolerate looking at his daughter ’s picture on the posters , or hearing her spoken of by strangers .
The 62 - year - old solicitor said he has maintained a high profile in the media in the hope that somebody , somewhere , has a fragment of information that might help police to find his daughter .
“ It ’s just a matter of getting the idea of hope out there , ” he told the Church Times .
“ However we do it , we ’ve got to keep hoping that somewhere out there someone will have seen Claudia , or seen something happening . ”
Police try to trace couple
POLICE would also like to trace a couple seen in University Road , on the morning of Tuesday , March 17 , and Thursday , March 19 .
Det Supt Galloway said the witness had come forward following last week ’s appeal to identify a couple seen arguing in the same road at 6.10 am on March 19 .
The man is described as white , aged between 50 and 55 , of medium build , and with dark brown hair , which is greying at the sides .
He was wearing a dark - coloured jacket and lighter - coloured trousers .
The woman , who is believed to be younger than the man , is described as white , and her trousers a lighter colour than the man’s .
‘ I still believe my daughter is alive ’
PETER
Lawrence says he still believes his daughter will be found alive , despite police upgrading the investigation to suspected murder .
“ I understand why the police are doing this – it ’s necessary for their investigation , ” he said .
“ But the fact that we believe Claudia is still alive is what keeps us going and motivates us . ”
Mr Lawrence , who is separated from Claudia ’s mother , Joan , also made another direct appeal to his daughter to get in touch .
“ Claudia , it is now five weeks since you disappeared without any trace at all and it ’s just so unusual for you not to be in contact , ” he said .
If I ’m going to tell companies that content marketing is important , I should probably give my thoughts on how to make it useful .
I ’m thinking about blogging , podcasting , shooting photos , making video , and all the other tools social media allows us to use to tell stories ( not market ) .
In my ideas , I give you nuggets of what matters to me in media making , and what I believe will matter to your prospective audience .
Not your customers , per se .
Maybe this is for internal audiences .
Instead of thinking B2B vs B2C , just think “ human . ”

It 's getting to be like The Guardian here with all these posts on the odious BNP .
Still , at least I 've resisted the temptation to compose several articles on how Jade Goody 's death told us something about ourselves .
Anyway , this is quite interesting on the ' by their friends ye shall know them ' level .
We all know Nicholas Griffin is the lead candidate for the BNP in the North West Region ; but what of his lieutenants further down the list ?
His number two ( stop sniggering at the back ) is Martin Wingfield ( more of whom at a later date ) , Steve Greenhalgh of the Liverpool clan ( stop it ! ) is next at P3 but the one often overlooked is little Gary Aronsson ( if this translates as son of Aryan in norse it would n't shock me ) .
Gazza 's got a Facebook and he never sleeps at night .
So what kind of friends has Gary .
Well , his list of friends - unlike some other BNP bods - is open to the public domain ( for now ) and aside from BNP chums he has some strange acquaintances for a member of a party that says it has changed and is no longer the Holocaust - denying , racist thug group it once was .
If you click on the screenshots ( I 'll upload more later ) you 'll see that whilst it may not be unusual to expect Number 8 to have Nick Griffin , Simon Darby and Peter Quiggins as friends , some others are a bit dodgy :
1. Denis Law (? ) who has an avatar of a Guinness sign with SKINHEAD on it .
2. Rhys Lewis whose pic has a German eagle and swastika
3. Alberto TomasLillo Martinez who also favours a Nazi flag replete with swastika and masked skinheads .
4 . Ahs Stefanescu who favours the extremist metal band of Frei Sozial National
5. Michael Stevens who has a hooded KKK picture
6. Jason Stiles who has a German cross and swastika
7. Falange Gottlieb ( German for God love the Falange , Spanish Fascists in the 1930s )
8. Mark Collett - BNP
Hitler lover .

Did you fall for it ?
The photographic ' stuntman ' who asks viewers to take a leap of faith in his art
Flying through the sky , artist Kerry Skarbakka always looks a second away from broken bones or even a sticky end .
His death - defying photos show him plunging from bridges , tripping down the stairs or even - and we 've all been there - slipping over buck - naked in the shower with only a curtain to spare his blushes .
Every picture is guaranteed to raise either a gasp of horror or at least a sympathetic exclamation of ' ouch ! ' - unless , that is , you know the secret of his snaps .
Final fall : Kerry takes the final step from a railway bridge .
Luckily the wires keep him on terra firma
For Kerry has a lot of support during his falls - he is literally strung up in place with harnesses and wires keeping him still and secure during the action shots .
The American daredevil has been creating the portfolio of falling pictures since 2002 , and has been exhibited across the world .
Slip up : Whoops !
One minute you 're sitting down to read a book , the next minute you 're flying up to the ceiling ( note another of Mr Skarbakka 's artworks reflected in the mirror )
Kerry has tried to get models to pose for his work - but everyone he 's asked has preferred to stay grounded , leaving the 38 - year - old with no option but to take the plunge himself .
And with settings including a fall from a skyscraper and plunging from a railway bridge , who can blame them ?
Catch me if you can : Kerry ' falls ' from the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago , USA
He attributes his work to philosopher Martin Heideggar , who ' described human existence as a process of perpetual falling ' .
He said : ' Using myself as model and with the aid of climbing gear and other rigging , I photograph the body as it dangles from dangerous precipices or tumbles down flights of stairs .
' The captured gesture of the body is designed for plausiblity of action , which grounds the image in reality .
' However , it is the ambiguity of the body 's position in space that allows and requires the viewer to resolve the full meaning of the photograph .
Do we fall ?
Can we fly ?
If we fly then loss of control facilitates supreme control . '
Window frame : Kerry appears to plunge past a startled office worker
More domestic settings include plunging from a step - ladder in the lounge or taking a trip down the stairs - or even simply trying to sit down to read and missing the seat - all situations many of us can relate to .
However these can prove just as deadly as the more dramatic photos , so Kerry takes no risks with his safety .
Shower slip : Kerry slips over in the shower - we 've probably all been there , albeit in less dramatic fashion
Do it yourself : Kerry said he tried to find models to pose for his art , but no - one took the plunge so he posed himself
He said : ' It is necessary to point out that I do not consider myself a glorified stuntman ; nor do I wish to become a sacrifice to art .
' Therefore , safety is an important factor .
However the work does carry with it a potential risk of personal injury as I engage the moment .
Stair -ing death in the face : Again the invisible ropes keep Kerry safe from harm
' This is unavoidable as much of the strength of the images lie in the fact that they are all recorded on location . '
This weekend , my Dell laptop caught a virus that made it inoperable less than a week after a complete reformat and reinstall .
So I bought a Mac laptop .
Advertisement
Yeah , I 've used Windows machines for essentially my entire life , but switching turned out to be not that big a deal .
Why ?
Because an OS is n't that important .
What 's kept me from switching all these years is n't because I loved Windows or hated Macs .
No , it was more a combination of laziness and self - identification .
That 's to say I did n't want to switch because I did n't want to deal with learning the ins and outs of a new OS , and also I identified myself as a " Windows guy " and did n't want to become a " Mac guy . "
Both reasons are essentially bullshit .
Advertisement
First , laziness .
Switching from Windows to Mac or Mac to Windows or Windows to Ubuntu or whatever is easier than ever .
There are differences between the operating systems to be sure , but none of them are that huge and none will have a real , fundamental effect on your experience .
These days , most of what you do is online , or at least most of what I do is .
When I switched , my feeds were synced online , as was my IM buddy list .
Both my work and personal email accounts are online , as is my calendar .
All of my files saved on my external hard drive work in , if not the exact same program , one that 's very similar on the other OS .
So really , it takes about a week of adjustment and then you 're fine .
And as for identification , well , that 's a pretty dumb reason to make any kind of decision .
When it comes down to it , nobody is defined by their OS .
Yes , Apple ads would love for you to think of yourself as a cool hipster for owning a Mac and to think of PC users as chubby nerds , but that is n't the case .
Operating systems are just tools to get things done , and you can do whatever you want with any OS .
It 's like a car :
No matter what kind of car you buy , you 're still going to the same places .
Driving a Hummer wo n't make you a tough guy , and using Windows wo n't make you a nerd .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 " 8 K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
I realized both of these things a couple of weeks ago after I bought a Dell Mini 9 with Ubuntu Linux .
I was worried at first that I 'd hate not using Windows , but after about an hour I realized that I was having almost the exact same experience I would be having if it had XP on it .
It just did n't matter .
So why switch ?
Well , having my system taken down twice in a week is not something I can afford to have happen .
Macs , as of now , do n't really get viruses .
And I have a large community of people who can help me out with it if I run into problems .
That 's it .
Advertisement
So how 's switching been ?
Fine .
It 's a nice OS with some features I like and some that I find really annoying .
It 's fun to try something new , but it 's not blowing Windows out of the water or making me run to the returns counter .
It 's a computer .
I 'd be equally happy with a new Lenovo with similar specs and Windows 7 Beta on it , I 'm sure .
The whole experience of using all three major operating systems over the past couple of weeks has been pretty fun , actually .
I enjoy using new software and learning these basics again , and all of it feels pretty familiar .
I plan on installing Windows 7 on my new Apple laptop so I can access any Windows software I miss and can stay familiar with how that OS is progressing .

And in the end , I 'll keep doing what I always do with my laptop :
Work on the internet , where what OS you 're using matters exactly jack squat .
Island species are at greater risk from human activities , the researchers warn Rare species on islands are at risk of being lost forever because they have been generally overlooked by current conservation models , a study suggests .
Although islands had less diversity of species compared to mainland sites , a greater proportion were unique to the remote habitats , researchers concluded .
Yet the impact of human activities was relatively greater on islands because space was at a premium , they added .
The findings appear in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The team from Germany and the US wrote : " Islands are well - known centres of range - restricted species and thus high levels of endemism .
" However , they are also acknowledged for their lower species richness compared to mainland areas , " they added .
" Hence , an index combining both endemism and species richness can provide insight into the question of relative conservation value of islands and mainlands . "
But to date , the team observed , no study had focused on the differences between mainland areas and islands .
Islands are important and should be part of any global conservation strategy
Dr Holger Kreft ,
University of California , San Diego
While some islands , such as the Galapagos archipelago and Madagascar , were well known for their biodiversity richness , the team said the habitat 's biological value had not been quantified .
" Normally , you want to focus on the most diverse places to protect a maximum number of species , " said co-author Holger Kreft , a post - doctoral fellow from the University of California , San Diego .
" But you also want to focus on unique species that occur nowhere else . "
To understand the level of endemic species found in particular areas , the team used a measure of biodiversity that weighted rare species more heavily than widespread ones .
When they calculated the level of weighted biodiversity , they then compared island ecosystems with continental habitats .
Using this measurement , the team found that islands ' populations of flora and fauna were eight to nine times as rich .
The team observed : " Island floras and faunas are usually recognised to maintain a high degree of endemism because of their geographic isolation and the limited interchange with neighbouring mainland or island biota . "
" Islands are important and should be part of any global conservation strategy , " Dr Kreft added .
" Such a strategy would n't make any sense if you did n't include the islands . "
The team also noted that islands were at the centre of " past and imminent species extinctions , stressing even more the need for information on both biodiversity and specific threats in this part of the world " .
Lead author Gerold Kier , project leader at the University of Bonn , warned that threats to islands ' biodiversity were likely to rise more sharply in the coming decades .
" That threat is expected to accelerate particularly rapidly on islands where access to remaining undeveloped lands is comparatively easy , " he explained .
As a result , expanding farmlands , deforestation and other changes in how human populations use land were likely to be more stark than on the mainlands .
" We now have new and important data in our hands , " said Dr Kreft , " but still have no simple solution for nature conservation . "

The qualiity of Citigroup ’s $ 1.6 billion first quarter earnings was so lousy that even the mainstream media took notice .
And the bank ’s stock traded down 9 % .
To give the highlights :
$ 2.5 billion of revenues came from lower market value of its debt thanks to a fall in credit quality .
That was a common pattern of last year , when quite a few investment banks , Lehman in particular , marked down their debt , showing a corresponding increase in income .
The bank posted a number of one - off gains : $ 704 million from the sale of a remaining stake in a Brazilian credit card processor , and $ 360 million in reversals of reserves ( part for a litigation , the rest relating to an audit ) .
The bank posted negative earnings per share .
Do the math .
$ 1.6 billion – ( $ 2.5 billion + 1.1 billion ) is not a positive number .
The EPS will improve on a going forward basis thanks to a pending conversion of preferred stock to common .
And as a result of super cheap funding thanks to the Fed , interest spreads are a healthy 3.3 % , but per the figures above .
unless something improves or Citi can scare up one magic tricks , it needs to see either more revenues or a reduction , not a mere flattening , in credit losses .
In theory , the bank has more latitude regarding how it marks its securities portfolio with the relaxation of mark to market rules , but if the PPIP delivers the phony prices that it is intended to yield , the bank may very well post gains of rather questionable quality in coming quarters on its book ( note this is less likely to occur with its loan book , since banks can and presumably do mark them on a hold to maturity basis , and anecdotal reports are that valuations there are plenty rich , calling into question how much in the way of gains even the PPIP could deliver ) .
But as things stand , the bank is still hemorrhaging losses faster than even richer than usual interest income is bringing in .
Although the rate of increase in losses is slowing , that ’s cold comfort when the absolute level of credit losses is this high .
Note that this follows artificially high earnings at Wells , pumped up by loss reserves that were patently too low , and Jamie Dimon warning that the first quarter may be a high water mark for banks this year .
Both the New York Times and Reuters were up front with skepticism .
From the Times :
After more than a year of crippling losses and three bailouts from Washington , Citigroup , a troubled giant of American banking , said Friday that it had done something extraordinary : it made money .
But the headline number — a net profit of $ 1.6 billion for the first quarter — was not quite what it seemed .
Behind that figure was some fuzzy math .
Like several other banks that reported surprisingly strong results this week , Citigroup used some creative accounting , all of it legal , to bolster its bottom line at a pivotal moment … .
Meredith A. Whitney , a prominent research analyst , said in a recent report that what banks were doing amounted to a “ great whitewash . ”
The industry ’s goal — and one that some policy makers share — is to create the impression that banks are stabilizing so private investors will invest in them , minimizing the need for additional taxpayer money , she said .
Reuters was a tad more polite :
Citigroup pulled a rabbit out of a hat in the first quarter — but can it do it again ?
While the Journal also noted the special gains , the tone of the piece was more Citi friendly .
Felix Salmon also read through the transcript of the tortuous earnings conference call , which he deemed “ horrible ” , and skimming it , I have to agree .
There were almost no direct answers to any questions
That does not mean new CFO Ned Kelly did not say a lot , but the noise to signal ratio was one of the highest I have ever seen .
Update 5:45 PM : From Egan Jones via Tyler Durden , who has additional commentary on Citigroup :
— At the Hillsborough Street Waffle House , a cup of coffee was sure to always come with a side order of personality – if Ms. Betty was the server .
" Everybody knew her , and everybody loved her , " said Charles Barnette , a longtime patron .
She was the restaurant 's most - requested waitress .

Betty Mathis Moody was her full name , but everyone called her Ms. Betty .
For 28 years , the 76 - year - old worked overnights , and she knew how to handle the North Carolina State University college crowd that frequented the place during her shift . "
Ms. Betty always had a way of telling them , ' If y'all do n't quiet down , y'all wo n't be eating tonight , ' " co-worker Maria Winkler said .
" They always had a deep respect for her .
She was definitely grandma amongst us .
" Winkler said Ms. Betty loved her job – so much so that she would make the 80 - minute commute five days a week from her home in Warrenton to Raleigh .
" She always said that the day she stopped working was the day she was going to die , " Winkler said .
On Wednesday , Ms. Betty was driving home on U.S. Highway 401 in Wake Forest , when state troopers said , a car driven by Chad Rodman , 37 , crossed the center line and collided with hers .
She never made it home .
" We 're all gonna miss her very much , " Winkler said .
" I do n't know if Waffle House is going to be the same without Ms. Betty here .
" Those who knew her said Ms. Betty also had a way of helping the homeless .
She 'd pay for their meal , bring them a coat or provide them a place to stay .
" She did it because she obviously loved people and wanted to help them , " Barnette said .
Ms. Betty is survived by two daughters , two sons and 11 grandchildren .
The family will host a visitation at 7 p.m. Friday at Blaylock Funeral Home in Warrenton .
Her funeral is Saturday .
Rodman , who was charged with driving while impaired and death by vehicle , was in jail Thursday afternoon under $ 25,000 bond .

A pea-sized seahorse , the world 's longest insect , a " ghost slug " and the world 's smallest snake were among the top 10 species discovered in 2008 , a committee of scientists said Friday .
A tiny seahorse and the world 's longest insect were among the top 10 new species discovered in 2008 .

These unusual critters were among thousands of species found last year , many in remote or tropical regions of the planet , that hint at the breadth of the Earth 's undiscovered biodiversity .
" Most people do not realize just how incomplete our knowledge of Earth 's species is , " said Quentin Wheeler , director of the International Institute for Species Exploration at Arizona State University , which announced the top 10 new species list .
" We are surrounded by such an exuberance of species diversity that we too often take it for granted , " Wheeler added .
The ASU institute and an international committee of taxonomists -- scientists devoted to species exploration and classification -- compile the top 10 list of new species each year .
Also on the 2008 list are a caffeine - free coffee plant , a snail whose shell twists around four axes , a palm that flowers itself to death and microscopic bacteria that live in hairspray .
See photos of the new species »
Here 's the complete list :
1. Pygmy seahorse : Classified by its Latin name , Hippocampus satomiae , this species measures about half an inch long and was found near Derawan Island off Kalimantan , Indonesia .
2 . A plant that kills itself : Found in a small area of northwestern Madagascar , a rare genus of palm -- Tahina spectablilis -- produces huge , spectacular flowers and then dies and collapses .
Fewer than 100 have been found .
3. Decaf , please : Known as Coffea charrieriana , this plant found in Cameroon is the first record of a caffeine - free coffee species from Central Africa .
4. Spray - on species :
An extremophile bacteria , Microbacterium hatanonis , was discovered in hairspray by Japanese scientists .
5 . A stick that moves :
The world 's longest insect , with a body length of 14 inches ( 22.3 inches including legs ) , Phobaeticus chani resembles a stick and was found in Borneo , Malaysia .
6 . The Barbados Threadsnake : Leptotyphlops carlae measures only 4.1 inches long and is believed to be the world 's smallest snake .
7 . A pale " ghost slug " : Selenochlamys ysbryda was a surprising find in the densely populated area of Cardiff , Wales .
8 . A very limber snail :
This unique species , Opisthostoma vermiculum , is found on a limestone hill in Malaysia and has a shell that twists around four axes .
9 . Damsel in the deep blue sea : Chromis abyssus is a beautiful species of damselfish found in deep - reef habitat off the coast of Ngemelis Island , Palau .
10 . Fossil mama : A fossilized fish , Materpiscis attenboroughi , is an extremely rare find from Western Australia and shows a mother giving birth 380 million years ago .
Scientists are still classifying species found around the globe in 2008 , so final data for that year are not available .
But on Friday , the taxonomists issued a State of Observed Species report card that states 18,516 species new to science -- about half of them insects -- were discovered and described in 2007 .
The vast majority of the 18,516 species named in 2007 were invertebrate animals ( 75.6 percent ) , vascular plants ( 11.1 percent ) and vertebrates ( 6.7 percent ) .
The report was compiled by ASU 's International Institute for Species Exploration in partnership with other scientists .
" Charting the species of the world and their unique attributes are essential parts of understanding the history of life , " Wheeler said .
" It is in our own self - interest as we face the challenges of living on a rapidly changing planet . "
According to Wheeler , a new generation of tools is coming online that will vastly accelerate the rate at which humans can discover and describe species .
The annual release of the top 10 new species list and State of Observed Species report commemorate the anniversary of the birth of Carolus Linnaeus , who initiated the modern system of plant and animal names and classifications .
An estimated 1.8 million species have been described since Linnaeus initiated the modern systems for naming plants and animals in the 18th century .
Scientists estimate that there are between 2 million and 100 million species on Earth , though most set the number closer to 10 million , according to ASU .
" It is estimated that the approximately 1.8 million species named since 1758 represent no more than a fraction of the world 's species , " the report states .
" Rapid environmental changes around the world highlight the urgent need to accelerate our exploration of Earth 's species , " the report says .
" Millions of species -- the majority not yet known to science -- face an uncertain future .
Among these species are keys to understanding the history of the origin and diversification of life on our planet . "

I have been teaching 5th and 6th grade for nine years in Phoenix .
This is the first year I have been told to give grades .
When I was in school you earned it .
Today teachers are not supposed to fail students , especially special - ed students , even if their lack of ability or effort warrants it .
The new " inclusion " policy dictates they are placed with regular - ed students and expected to score as well .
Sometimes they do , as many regular - ed students are lazy .
Not wild about handing out grades for nothing , I , in protest , gave some of the less capable special - ed students 100 percent on every assignment .
This did n't sit well with the special - ed teachers , who told me these students should get C's .
I figured that failure to comply would earn me a visit to the principal 's office and a half - hour tongue lashing during my prep period , so I gave them all 75 percent on every assignment , even if they did n't do it .
The special - ed teachers liked this just fine .
The underlying reality for teachers is that even if a student deserved to get a failing grade for lack of effort , you 're not supposed to give an " F " on the report card .
The driving force behind all of this is that the principal 's office does n't want phone calls from parents complaining about their kid 's failing grades .
As long as I pass everybody , I wo n't have problems from the front office , or so I thought .
My latest visit to the principal 's office resulted in a directive to make my class easier .
Aparent or two complained my class was too hard for their kids .
These are probably the same kids that do n't do their work .
So how to stay out of the principal 's office ?
I give credit where none is due , and pass students on to the next grade at the end of the year whether they 've mastered the skills necessary for them to be successful or not .

Here are some of the enhancements that we 're currently working on for the coreutils project .
You can see the latest changes as they 're added in the NEWS file , and you can subscribe to see those changes .
Newer file systems like ext4 and xfs have support for extents which allows one to efficiently layout blocks of a file contiguously on disk .
To support this we 're going to add fallocate ( ) to gnulib which will return ENOTSUPP if any of libc , kernel or file system do n't support the fallocate ( ) call .
This will allow utilities likeandetc. to unconditionally call fallocate ( ) as a performance enhancement to layout new files efficiently on disk and also get immediate feedback if there is not enough space available to perform the copy .
This is a higher level function than fallocate ( ) as it will allocate space by writing 0's to file if fallocate ( ) is not supported as described above .
We 're adding this functionality to gnulib ( as it 's currently implemented in glibc ) , so that we can add new allocation support to truncate .
This will be made available as a new option like :
This option will create a new empty file with all the meta data of another file .
It 's awkward otherwise to copy meta data from a source file , requiring separate tools like touch and chcon etc .
This option should then make it easy to write aor script that can useto create a temporary file to be populated by an arbitrary filter , and moved back on top of the original .
This common operation is currently surprisingly difficult to achieve using existing tools .
This is an often requested feature that we 've finally capitulated on and will implement .
This will allow one for example to .
It 's not a general solution , in that we 've gone the simple route and assumed that quantities are appropriately minimised .
I.E. 5000 K and 4 M will not be present together in the input .
Also we flag as an error a mixture ofandfor example in the input .
Even with these simplifications , the vast majority of input sources are covered .
I'm a mentor this year for the coreutils project in google 's SOC program .
The project is to enhance the performance of sort on multicore systems .
The first part of this project will be to enhance theutility to easily partition data by number of chunks rather than by size .
Then we 'll figure out how best to run sort in parallel over this data ( perhaps a wrapper script ? ) .
To whet your appetite , preliminary testing on an 8 core system shows a 4.85 times speedup using existing merge sort facilities of the sort command , and process substitution provided by bash :
This is a new utility that will allow one to control the buffering of standard streams of any process .
Some programs have specific options to control this ( likefor example ) , but this will give general control over this feature as in this example to turn on line buffering for the cut utility :
Thanks to Bruno Haible 's fantastic work on libunistring , we 'll finally be able to add correct i18n support to coreutils .
There has been an i18n patch in use by certain distros for years , but was rightly not accepted upstream because of numerous bugs and performance issues .
For example there was a segfault identified just a couple of days ago , when invalid input was given to thecommand .
If you love both the PlayStation brand and ridiculous amounts of overpriced material garbage ( no PS3 jokes , please ) then you might be interested to hear that Sony has got together with Target Entertainment in a bid to produce huge amounts of merchandise for its hardware and first party videogames .
" Many of Sony Computer Entertainment ’s first party software titles and characters are now recognized by millions of people around the world -- from the legendary Ratchet and Clank through to the iconic Sackboy from LittleBigPlanet , " says licensing and peripherals manager Stephanie Freeman , who somehow thinks Sackboy has achieved iconic status .
" We really want our consumers to have the ability to interact with our brands and characters in ways other than just on screen .
We feel Target Entertainment Group has the vibrancy and experience to help us do this successfully . "
Meanwhile , Target 's Helen Howells said things with her mouth : " To work with a brand like PlayStation , and its range of products , is a great opportunity for us .
With a portfolio of fantastic games we will offer new and longer standing fans a range of products that will really add to their PlayStation experience . "
We all knew that LittleBigPlanet merchandise was coming , and I 'll be shocked if we do n't see Sackboy dolls trying to become the next Beanie Babies .
What else could be coming , and what would you buy ?
If they 're going to start producing Helghast masks , you can count me in for one of those .
Gamma Knife
Gamma Knife® is a radiation therapy that uses computerized treatment planning software to help physicians locate and irradiate small targets within the head and brain with very high precision .
The treatment delivers intense radiation doses to the target area while sparing surrounding tissue .
If you 're scheduled for radiation therapy using Gamma Knife® , a treatment team consisting of a radiation oncologist , a medical physicist and a neurosurgeon will work together to provide your treatment .
Safety is ensured by the medical physicist who tests the machine 's mechanical functions and verifies that the imaging and treatment planning computers and software are correct and acceptable .
What is this equipment used for ?
The Gamma Knife® and its associated computerized treatment planning software enable physicians to locate and irradiate relatively small targets in the head ( mostly inside the brain ) with extremely high precision .
Intense doses of radiation can be given to the targeted area(s ) while largely sparing the surrounding tissues .
The Gamma Knife® can be used for a wide variety of problems .
For example , it can be used to treat selected malignant tumors that arise in or spread to the brain ( primary brain tumors or metastatic tumors ) , benign brain tumors ( meningiomas , pituitary adenomas , acoustic neuromas ) , blood vessel defects ( arteriovenous malformations ) and functional problems ( trigeminal neuralgia ) .
Possible future uses are being evaluated for epilepsy and Parkinson 's disease .
Single - session Gamma Knife® treatment is usually unsuitable for targets larger than three or four centimeters in size .
top of page
How does the equipment work ?
The Gamma Knife® utilizes a technique called stereotactic radiosurgery , which uses multiple beams of radiation converging in three dimensions to focus precisely on a small volume , such as a tumor , permitting intense doses of radiation to be delivered to that volume safely .
Currently , the available models use advanced robotic technology to move the patient in submillimeter increments during treatment to focus radiation successfully on all parts of the target .
Treatments using Perfexion
Most treatments are given in a single session .
Under local anesthesia , a special rigid head frame incorporating a three - dimensional coordinate system is attached to the patient 's skull with four screws .
Imaging studies , such as magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , computed tomography ( CT ) , or angiography , are then obtained and the results are sent to the Gamma Knife® 's planning computer system .
Together , physicians ( radiation oncologists and neurosurgeons ) and medical physicists delineate targets and normal anatomical structures .
They use a planning computer program to determine the exact spatial relationship between the target , normal structures and the head frame to calculate Gamma Knife® treatment parameters .
Targets often are best treated during the treatment session with combinations of several successive highly focused treatments , commonly known as " shots . "
The physicians and physicists routinely consider numerous fine - tuning adjustments of treatment parameters until an optimal plan and dose are determined .
Using the three - dimensional coordinates determined in the planning process , the frame is then precisely attached to the Gamma Knife® unit to guarantee that when the unit is activated , the target is placed exactly in the center of approximately 200 precision - aimed , converging beams of ( Cobalt - 60 generated ) gamma radiation .
Treatment takes anywhere from several minutes to a few hours to complete depending on the shape and size of the target , the number of " shots " and the dose required .
Patients do not feel the radiation treatment as it is delivered , although they may experience seeing flashes of light while the treatment is being delivered .
Following treatment the head frame is removed and the patient may return to normal activity .
Treatments using Icon Icon treatments differ from Perfexion treatments in that : Treatments are given in single or multiple sessions .
An external frame is not required .
Icon uses a combination of onboard stereotactic Cone Beam CT imaging and real - time infrared motion detection and management to achieve 0.15 mm treatment accuracy even without a rigid frame .
See the Stereotactic Radiosurgery page for additional information .
top of page
Who operates this equipment ?
A multidisciplinary team approach provides patients with the greatest safety .
The team is most commonly comprised of a radiation oncologist , a medical physicist and a neurosurgeon — all specially trained in the use of the Gamma Knife® — with support from nursing staff , anesthesiologists ( for patients who are unable to cooperate , such as children ) and radiation therapists , who work together to provide patients with the high - quality care they deserve .
It is a requirement of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that an " authorized user , " usually a radiation oncologist , be at the treatment console during the entire procedure .
top of page
How is safety ensured ?
Because placement accuracy of the shots is critical to localization of the radiation ( to a fraction of a millimeter ) , anything that would degrade this precision is unacceptable .
Rigid attachment of the head frame , geographic targeting accuracy of the imaging studies , shaping of the volume of tissue to be treated ( selection of the number , size and relative intensity of the shots ) and accuracy of attachment of the frame to the Gamma Knife® unit are all critical .
As is true of all radiation therapy procedures , correct selection and calculation of the amount of radiation to deliver are essential .
A qualified medical physicist assures that the imaging and treatment planning computers and software are correct and acceptable .
The mechanical functions of the machine are tested on a regular basis to ensure the safety of patients and medical staff .

VANCOUVER–British Columbia Premier Gordon Campbell said leaders of other provinces should adopt his carbon tax plan , after he handily defeated the NDP , which had vowed to dismantle the surcharge , in Tuesday 's provincial election .
" It does n't mean the end of your political mandate , " Campbell told a news conference yesterday , when asked what other premiers could learn from the tax .
Campbell 's Liberal government established the surcharge , the first in North America , last year .
" We understood when we did it that it was going to be challenging but , you know , whenever you do something that 's significant it 's going to be challenging . "
In winning their third straight majority government , the B.C. Liberals took 49 of the 85 seats in the legislature , while the NDP won 36 .
At dissolution , there were 45 Liberals and 34 New Democrats in the legislature .
The addition of six electoral districts boosted the number of seats in the legislature to 85 .
Voter turnout was about 50 per cent , with an electorate more focused on the Vancouver Canucks ' playoff run than a campaign in which no dominant issue emerged .
A referendum on electoral reform in which voters could opt for a new way of electing politicians was also defeated .
Only 39 per cent of voters supported the proposed single transferable vote ( STV ) system – 60 per cent support was required for the system to be adopted .
Under the proposal , voters would rank their preferences .
The candidate who was the first choice of most voters would win a seat , and others would be allocated based on voters ' preferences .
The current first - past - the - post system awards a riding to the candidate who gets the most votes , even if a majority of voters opted for other candidates in the riding .
Campbell said yesterday that after two attempts at electoral reform , voters have made it clear they do n't want to move to an STV system .
The choice was also on the ballot in the 2005 B.C. election , when it lost narrowly with 58 per cent support .
Bruce Hallsor , co-chair of the BC - STV campaign , said the results are disappointing , but there is still clearly an appetite to change the way politicians are elected .
" No one is suggesting that we rush into another referendum , but clearly we have to look at all the options , " he said yesterday .
David Schreck , secretary treasurer for the No side of the campaign , said voters rejected STV because the system would have led to an unbalanced legislature and the process is difficult to understand .
Schreck , who was an adviser to the last two NDP premiers before the party 's defeat in 2001 , said there is no call for the immediate resignation of NDP Leader Carole James , despite her second straight electoral defeat .
" She exceeded expectations in maintaining the status quo and not losing seats .
She deserves credit for that , " said Schreck .
" The caucus will be judged on their performance in the upcoming sitting . "

James brought the NDP to a stronger - than - expected showing in the 2005 provincial election , and has been credited with reviving a party that held only two seats after the 2001 election .
James told supporters Tuesday night the opposition has been a strong voice and will continue that in the next session .
She later told reporters she will spend the next few days thinking about the future .

Bipartite matching and same - sex marriage
My use of the identifiers husband and wife in Thursday 's example code should not be taken as any sort of political statement against same - sex marriage .
The function was written as part of a program to solve the stable bipartite matching problem .
In this problem , which has historically been presented as concerning " marriage " , there are two disjoint equinumerous sets , which we may call " men " and " women " .
Each man ranks the women in preference order , and each woman ranks the men in preference order .
Men are then matched to women .
A matching is " stable " if there is no man m and no woman w such that m and w both prefer each other to their current partners .
A theorem of Gale and Shapley guarantees the existence of a stable matching and provides an algorithm to construct one .
However , if same - sex marriages are permitted , there may not be a stable matching , so the character of the problem changes significantly .
A minimal counterexample is : A prefers : B C X B prefers : C A X C prefers : A B X X prefers : A B C Suppose we match A–B , C–X .
Then since B prefers C to A , and C prefers B to X , B and C divorce their mates and marry each other , yielding B–C , A–X .
But now C can improve her situation further by divorcing B in favor of A , who is only too glad to dump the miserable X . The marriages are now A–C , B–X .
B now realizes that his first divorce was a bad idea , since he thought he was trading up from A to C , but has gotten stuck with X instead .
So he reconciles with A , who regards the fickle B as superior to her current mate C .
The marriages are now A–B , C–X , and we are back where we started , having gone through every possible matching .
This should not be taken as an argument against same - sex marriage .
The model fails to generate the following obvious real - world solution : A , B , and C should all move in together and live in joyous tripartite depravity , and X should jump off a bridge .

At a town hall meeting in Arnold , MO , President Obama took a not so veiled shot at Fox News and the tea bag protests .
Obama talked about a certain news channel where he is n’t very popular and people waving tea bags around .
Obama said that these people are playing games and pretending that the problem is the Recovery Act .
Here is the video courtesy of Media Matters :
Obama said , “ Those of you who are watching certain news channels on which I am not very popular and you see folks waving tea bags around .
Let me just remind them that I am happy to have a serious conversation about how we are going to cut our healthcare costs down over the long term .
How we are going to stabilize Social Security ….
but let ’s not play games and pretend that the reason is because of the Recovery Act , because that is just a fraction of the overall problem that we got . ”

Obama continued by saying that we have to tighten our belts in an intelligent way that helps working American families , and not fall into the trap of eliminating programs that help ordinary people and give tax cuts to the wealthy .
He stated again that he has no intention of going back to the formula of the last 8 years .
There goes the idea that the tea parties got Obama ’s attention , or have him on the run .
The president turned your staged movement into a joke .
This is how little President Obama fears the Republican Party right now .
He made a joke out of you .
Well actually , you made a joke out of yourselves .
It was clear that this was a manufactured political event , and is n’t it funny how Fox News does n’t talk about the tea party movement anymore ?
Even they are trying to bury that bomb , so it should be a shock that President Obama threw his own shovel of dirt on it today .

The day started badly with a rabid policeman waving his Kalashnikov menacingly at us , screaming " where 's your card - get back ! " .
We saw the rusting green remains of Soviet tanks ... a reminder of how a world - class military might had been defeated by a tenacious , low - tech insurgency
My mistake had been , foolishly , to try to drive to the front - gate of the American Embassy where we had been invited to go on a press trip .
But fortress Kabul has become addicted to security - rather like those bodybuilders who cannot stop pumping iron and popping pills until they resemble some hideously bulging comic book villain .
The city keeps building ever more layers of barbed wire , blast walls , checkpoints , guns and angry policemen .
The US and the rest of Nato keep telling us how the security situation in the capital has improved .
But they are unwilling to practice the confidence they preach .
Off limits
Now whole streets of Kabul are off - limits to the majority of us who do n't have " the card " .
I have not actually seen " the card " but rather like the " golden ticket " from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory , I believe it does exist and grants almost magical access to the lucky holder .
The press officer at the US Embassy came to our rescue and persuaded the Kalashnikov - waving guard to let us through .
We had been invited to go on a trip to Balkh Province in the north , for briefings and interviews on counter - narcotics .
The plane arrived in good time but it became immediately clear that the US team were less keen on briefings and more on palming us off on the Afghan officials .
Our luggage was unceremoniously dumped on the runway and we were told the plane would leave at 2.30 pm .
The US team was whisked away by beefy special agents driving super - sized armoured trucks .
We squeezed into the back of a rather beaten - up car to make our way to see the opening of a new school , paid for with American money - donated in exchange for eradicating opium - producing poppies .
Unseemly retreat
It was now midday .
We were told it would be an hour 's journey .
Just enough time to get there , see the project and get back to the plane .
One of the American vehicles broke down en route .
Unknown to us , the agents were inside and decided to cancel the trip and beat an unseemly retreat to the airport .
The journey was through a wilderness with few people
It actually took two hours of bone - crunching , off - road driving to get to the village .
By the time we arrived , the whole district had gathered on either side of a long cordon to greet the Americans who had funded their new school .
Unfortunately , I and the BBC 's cameraman , Sanjay , were the only foreigners to turn up .
We were greeted with silence and a look of awe and ushered through a long line of men and boys to the ribbon cutting ceremony .
Later the minister called me forward and presented me with a chapan , the full - length gold and green - striped cloak that President Karzai is often seen wearing .
I pulled it over my shoulders and smiled rather weakly for the camera .
The Americans had shown an astonishing lack of guile
It was now past two o'clock .
Our American " hosts " were absent without leave .
The plane was due to leave in half an hour and we were in the middle of the middle of nowhere with a story that would not even work its way onto the back pages of the local newspaper .
A few frantic phone calls established the worst .
The plane had already departed without us because of bad weather heading our way .
We started to drive back .
We passed along river - beds and mountain - tracks , waved at by the odd rough - looking shepherd , passing through breath - taking wilderness in a place untouched by modernity .
We saw the rusting green remains of Soviet tanks , kept by locals as a reminder of how world - class military might had been defeated by a tenacious , low - tech insurgency .
Two hours later we were in Mazar - i- Sharif , attending a banquet organised in honour of the minister and the now absent American agents .
Broken brakes Despite facing the prospect of an eight - hour road trip over a snow - bound mountain pass in the dark , we accepted the invitation .
It is the Afghan way .
You see it is not enough to throw money at good causes and leave early because of a little bad weather .
Here face - time and respect matter , deeply .
They are the foundations upon which friendships are built and success achieved .
The Americans had shown an astonishing lack of guile .
By now it was five o'clock .
The minister kindly gave us one of his cars and a guard and we finally started to head back to Kabul .
Three minutes out of town and the driver pulled into a local garage - the car 's brakes were broken .
Another hour on and we left the city - again .
I finally hobbled into bed at three in the morning .
My back was sore , my neck seized - up and I could barely move my head .
We had been on the road for 21 hours and were only home thanks to the good grace , generosity and ingenuity of our new Afghan friends - and no thanks to our US hosts .

PC gamers can return to the islands this fall , as Kalypso Media announces Tropico 3 for North American release this September .
Advertisement
The third title in the popular Tropico series of island management sims once again places players in the role of " El Presidente " , the ruler of an island in the Caribbean during the Cold War era .
The game centers around developing your island nation , keeping the citizens happy while juggling the various political factions trying to win your influence .
It sounds very much like a remake of the original Tropico by Bulgarian developer Haemimont Games , rather than the full sequel delivered by Frog City Software , the developer of Tropico 2 : Pirate Cove .
If it manages to carry over the tongue - in - cheek humor from the original title as well as the themes , characters , and settings , it could very well be worth strategy gamers ' whiles to plan for an island vacation this fall .
There is a reason I call this column Outside the Box .
I try to get material that forces us to think outside our normal comfort zones and challenges our common assumptions .
And this week 's letter does just that .
I have made the comment more than once that is it unusual for two major bubbles to burst and for the conversation and our experience to be rising inflation and not a serious problem with deflation .
Van Hoisington and Dr. Lacy
Hunt give us a seminar on why they think it is deflation that will ultimately be the problem and not inflation we are dealing with today .
This week 's letter requires you to think , but it will be worth the effort .
Now , if you put all of the various inputs together , Hoisington and Hunt show that theory suggests we will soon be dealing with deflation .
It 's counter - intuitive to what we hear today , which is why the Bank for International Settlements used the stagflation word in a recent report .
The transition that is coming will not be comfortable .
Hoisington Investment Management Company ( www.hoisingtonmgt.com) is a registered investment advisor specializing in fixed income portfolios for large institutional clients .
Located in Austin , Texas , the firm has over $ 4 - billion under management , composed of corporate and public funds , foundations , endowments , Taft - Hartley funds , and insurance companies .
And their track record over the last 20 years suggests we should pay attention .
And now let 's jump right in to the essay .
John Mauldin , Editor
Outside the Box
Quarterly Review and Outlook
First Quarter 2009
Inflation / Deflation
Over the next decade , the critical element in any investment portfolio will be the correct call regarding inflation or its antipode , deflation .
Despite near term deflation risks , the overwhelming consensus view is that " sooner or later " inflation will inevitably return , probably with great momentum .
This inflationist view of the world seems to rely on two general propositions .
First , the unprecedented increases in the Fed 's balance sheet are , by definition , inflationary .
The Fed has to print money to restore health to the economy , but ultimately this process will result in a substantially higher general price level .
Second , an unparalleled surge in federal government spending and massive deficits will stimulate economic activity .
This will serve to reinforce the reflationary efforts of the Fed and lead to inflation .
These propositions are intuitively attractive .
However , they are beguiling and do not stand the test of history or economic theory .
As a consequence , betting on inflation as a portfolio strategy will be as bad a bet in the next decade as it has been over the disinflationary period of the past twenty years when Treasury bonds produced a higher total return than common stocks .
This is a reminder that both stock and Treasury bond returns are sensitive to inflation , albeit with inverse results .
Economic Theory
If inflation and interest rates were to rise in this recession , or in the early stages of a recovery , the expansion would be cut short and the economy would either remain in , or relapse into recession .
In late stages of economic downturns , substantial amounts of unutilized labor and other resources exist .
Thus , both factory utilization and unemployment rates lag other economic indicators .
For instance , reflecting this severe recession , unused labor and other productive resources have increased sharply .
The yearly percentage decline in household employment is the largest since current data series began in 1949 .
In March the unemployment rate stood at 8.5 % , up from a cyclical low of 4.4 % .
This is the highest level since the early 1980s .
The labor department 's broader U6 unemployment rate includes those less active in the labor markets and working part time because full time work is not available .
The U6 rate of 15.6 % in March was the highest in the 15 year history of the series and up from its cyclical low of 7.9 % .
The operating rate for all industries and manufacturing both fell to their lowest levels on record in March .
Manufacturing capacity was around 15 % below the sixty year average ( Chart 1 ) .
Given these conditions , let 's assume for the moment that inflation rises immediately .
With unemployment widespread , wages would seriously lag inflation .
Thus , real household income would decline and truncate any potential gain in consumer spending .
A technically superior and more complete method of capturing the concept of excess labor and capacity is the Aggregate Supply and Demand Curve ( Chart 2 ) .
Inflation will not commence until the Aggregate Demand ( AD ) Curve shifts outward sufficiently to reach the part of the Aggregate Supply ( AS ) curve that is upward sloping .
The AS curve is perfectly elastic or horizontal when substantial excess capacity exists .
Excess capacity causes firms to cut staff , wages and other costs .
Since wage and benefit costs comprise about 70 % of the cost of production , the AS curve will shift outward , meaning that prices will be lower at every level of AD .
Therefore , multiple outward shifts in the Aggregate Demand curve will be required before the economy encounters an upward sloping Aggregate Supply Curve thus creating higher price levels .
In our opinion such a process will take well over a decade .
Record Expansion of the Fed 's Balance Sheet and M2
In the past year , the Fed 's balance sheet , as measured by the monetary base , has nearly doubled from $ 826 billion last March to $ 1.64 trillion , and potentially larger increases are indicated for the future .
The increases already posted are far above the range of historical experience .
Many observers believe that this is the equivalent to printing money , and that it is only a matter of time until significant inflation erupts .
They recall Milton Friedman 's famous quote that " inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon . "
These gigantic increases in the monetary base ( or the Fed 's balance sheet ) and M2 , however , have not led to the creation of fresh credit or economic growth .
The reason is that M2 is not determined by the monetary base alone , and GDP is not solely determined by M2 .
M2 is also determined by factors the Fed does not control .
These include the public 's preference for checking accounts versus their preference for holding currency or time and saving deposits and the bank 's needs for excess reserves .
These factors , beyond the Fed 's control , determine what is known as the money multiplier .
M2 is equal to the base times the money multiplier .
Over the past year total reserves , now 50 % of the monetary base , increased by about $ 736 billion , but excess reserves went up by nearly as much , or about $ 722 billion , causing the money multiplier to fall ( Chart 3 ) .
Thus , only $ 14 billion , or a paltry 1.9 % of the massive increase of total reserves , was available to make loans and investments .
Not surprisingly , from December to March , bank loans fell 5.4 % annualized .
Moreover , in the three months ended March , bank credit plus commercial paper posted a record decline .
If this all sounds complicated you are right , it is .
The bottom line , however , is that it is totally incorrect to assume that the massive expansion in reserves created by the Fed is inflationary .
Economic activity cannot move forward unless credit expansion follows reserves expansion .
That is not happening .
Too much and poorly financed debt has rendered monetary policy ineffective .
What about the M2 Surge ?
M2 has increased by over a 14 % annual rate over the past six months , which is in the vicinity of past record growth rates .
Liquidity creation or destruction , in the broadest sense , has two components .
The first is influenced by the Fed and its allies in the banking system , and the second is outside the banking system in what is often referred to as the shadow banking system .
The equation of exchange ( GDP equals M2 multiplied by the velocity of money or V ) captures this relationship .
The statement that all the Fed has to do is print money in order to restore prosperity is not substantiated by history or theory .
An increase in the stock of money will only lead to a higher GDP if V , or velocity , is stable .
V should be thought of conceptually rather than mechanically .
If the stock of money is $ 1 trillion and total spending is $ 2 trillion , then V is 2 .
If spending rises to $ 3 trillion and M2 is unchanged , velocity then jumps to 3 .
While V can not be observed without utilizing GDP and M , this does not mean that the properties of V cannot be understood and analyzed .
The historical record indicates that V may be likened to a symbiotic relationship of two variables .
One is financial innovation and the other is the degree of leverage in the economy .
Financial innovation and greater leverage go hand in hand , and during those times velocity is generally above its long - term average of 1.67 ( Chart 4 ) .
Velocity was generally below this average when there was a reversal of failed financial innovation and deleveraging occurred .
When innovation and increased leveraging transpired early in the 20th century , velocity was generally above the long - term average .
After 1928 velocity collapsed , and remained below the average until the early 1950s as the economy deleveraged .
From the early 1950s through 1980 velocity was relatively stable and never far from 1.67 since leverage was generally stable in an environment of tight financial regulation .
Since 1980 , velocity was well above 1.67 , reflecting rapid financial innovation and substantially greater leverage .
With those innovations having failed miserably , and with the burdensome side of leverage ( i.e. falling asset prices and income streams , but debt remaining ) so apparent , velocity is likely to fall well below 1.67 in the years to come , compared with a still high 1.77 in the fourth quarter of 2008 .
Thus , as the shadow banking system continues to collapse , velocity should move well below its mean , greatly impairing the efficacy of monetary policy .
This means that M2 growth will not necessarily be transferred into higher GDP .
For example , in Q4 of 2008 annualized GDP fell 5.8 % while M2 expanded by 15.7 % .
The same pattern appears likely in Q1 of this year .
The highly ingenious monetary policy devices developed by the Bernanke Fed may prevent the calamitous events associated with the debt deflation of the Great Depression , but they do not restore the economy to health quickly or easily .
The problem for the Fed is that it does not control velocity or the money created outside the banking system .
Washington policy makers are now moving to increase regulation of the banks and nonbank entities as well .
This is seen as necessary as a result of the excessive and unwise innovations of the past ten or more years .
Thus , the lesson of history offers a perverse twist to the conventional wisdom .
Regulation should be the tightest when leverage is increasing rapidly , but lax in the face of deleveraging .
Are Massive Budget Deficits Inflationary ?
Based on the calculations of the Congressional Budget Office , U.S. Government Debt will jump to almost 72 % of GDP in just four fiscal years .
As such , this debt ratio would advance to the highest level since 1950 ( Chart 5 ) .
The conventional wisdom is that this will restore prosperity and higher inflation will return .
Contrarily , the historical record indicates that massive increases in government debt will weaken the private economy , thereby hindering rather than speeding an economic recovery .
This does not mean that a recovery will not occur , but time rather than government action will be the curative factor .
By weakening the private economy , government borrowing is not an inflationary threat .
Much light on this matter can be shed by examining Japan from 1988 to the 2008 and the U.S. from 1929 to 1941 .
In the case of Japan government debt to GDP ratio surged from 50 % to almost 170 % .
So , if large increases in government debt were the key to economic prosperity , Japan would be in the greatest boom of all time .
Instead , their economy is in shambles .
After two decades of repeated disappointments , Japan is in the midst of its worst recession since the end of World War II .
In the fourth quarter , their GDP declined almost twice as fast as that of the U.S. or the EU .
The huge increase in Japanese government debt was created when it provided funds to salvage failing banks , insurance and other companies , plus transitory tax relief and make - work projects .
In 2008 , after two decades of massive debt increases , the Nikkei 225 average was 77 % lower than in 1989 , and the yield on long Japanese Government Bonds was less than 1.5 % ( Chart 6 ) .
As the Government Debt to GDP ratio surged , interest rates and stock prices fell , reflecting the negative consequences of the transfer of financial resources from the private to the public sector ( Chart 7 ) .
Thus , the fiscal largesse did not restore Japan to prosperity .
The deprivation of private sector funds suggested that these policy actions served to impede , rather than facilitate , economic activity .
This recent Japanese experience mirrors U.S. history from 1929 to 1941 when the ratio of U.S. government debt to GDP almost tripled from 16 % to near 50 % .
As the U.S. debt ratio rose , long Treasury yields moved lower , indicating that the private sector was hurt , not helped , by the government 's efforts .
The yearly low in long Treasury yields occurred at 1.95 % in 1941 , the last year before full WWII mobilization .
In 1941 , the S&P 500 , despite some massive rallies in the 1930s , was 62 % lower than in 1929 , and had been falling since 1936 .
Thus , two distinct periods separated by country and considerable time indicate that stock prices respond unfavorably to massive government deficit spending and bond yields decline .
The U.S. economy finally recovered during WWII .
Some attribute this recovery to a further increase in Federal debt which peaked at almost 109 % of GDP .
However , the dynamics during the War were much different than from those of 1929 through 1941 and today .
The U.S. ran huge trade surpluses as we supplied military and other goods to allies , which served to lift the U.S. economy through a massive multiplier effect .
Additionally , 10 % of our population , or 12 million persons , were moved into military services .
This is equivalent to 30 million people today .
Also , mandatory rationing of goods was instituted and people were essentially forced to use an unprecedented portion of their income to buy U.S. bonds or other saving instruments .
This unparalleled saving permitted the U.S. economy to recover from the massive debt acquired prior to 1929 .
Bonds Still an Exceptional Value
Since the 1870s , three extended deflations have occurred -- two in the U.S. from 1874 - 94 and from 1928 to 1941 , and one in Japan from 1988 to 2008 .
All these deflations occurred in the aftermath of an extended period of " extreme over indebtedness , " a term originally used by Irving Fisher in his famous 1933 article , " The Debt - Deflation Theory of Great Depressions . "
Fisher argued that debt deflation controlled all , or nearly all , other economic variables .
Although not mentioned by Fisher , the historical record indicates that the risk premium ( the difference between the total return on stocks and Treasury bonds ) is also apparently controlled by such circumstances .
Since 1802 , U.S. stocks returned 2.5 % per annum more than Treasury bonds , but in deflations the risk premium was negative .
In the U.S. from 1874 - 94 and 1928 - 41 , Treasury bonds returned 0.9 % and 7 % per annum , respectively , more than common stocks .
In Japan 's recession from 1988 - 2008 , Treasury bond returns exceeded those on common stocks by an even greater 8.4 % .
Thus , historically , risk taking has not been rewarded in deflation .
The premier investment asset has been the long government bond ( Table 1 ) .
This table also speaks to the impact of massive government deficit spending on stock and bond returns .
In the U.S. from 1874 - 94 , no significant fiscal policy response occurred .
The negative consequences of the extreme over indebtedness were allowed to simply burn out over time .
Discretionary monetary policy did not exist then since the U.S. was on the Gold Standard .
The risk premium was not nearly as negative in the late 19th century as it was in the U.S. from 1928 - 41 and in Japan from 1988 - 2008 when the government debt to GDP ratio more than tripled in both cases .
In the U.S. 1874 - 94 , at least stocks had a positive return of 4.4 % .
In the U.S. 1928 - 41 and in Japan in the past twenty years , stocks posted compound annual returns of negative 2.4 % and 2.3 % , respectively .
Therefore on a historical basis , U.S. Treasury bonds should maintain its position as the premier asset class as the U.S. economy struggles with declining asset prices , overindebtedness , declining income flows and slow growth .

And yet in 2009 , Hollywood movie studios , radio and the Broadway theater , though smaller and much changed , are not dead .
They learned to adapt and to collaborate with the monster .
In the Internet era , many sectors of American media have been re-enacting their at first complacent and finally panicked behavior of 60 years ago .
Few in the entertainment business saw the digital cancer spreading through their old business models until well after file - sharing , via Napster , had started decimating the music industry .
It ’s not only journalism that is now struggling to plot a path to survival .
But , with all due respect to show business , it ’s only journalism that ’s essential to a functioning democracy .
And it ’s not just because  as we keep being tediously reminded 
Thomas Jefferson said so .
Yes , journalists have made tons of mistakes and always will .
But without their enterprise , to take a few representative recent examples , we would not have known about the wretched conditions for our veterans at Walter Reed , the government ’s warrantless wiretapping , the scams at Enron or steroids in baseball .
Such news gathering is not to be confused with opinion writing or bloviating  including that practiced here .
Opinions can be stimulating and , for the audiences at Fox News and MSNBC , cathartic .
We can spend hours surfing the posts of bloggers we like or despise , some of them gems , even as we might be moved to write our own blogs about local restaurants or the government documents we obsessively study online .

But opinions , however insightful or provocative and whether expressed online or in print or in prime time , are cheap .
Reporting the news can be expensive .
Some of it  monitoring the local school board , say  can and is being done by voluntary “ citizen journalists ” with time on their hands , integrity and a Web site .
But we ca n’t have serious opinions about America ’s role in combating the Taliban in Pakistan unless brave and knowledgeable correspondents ( with security to protect them ) tell us in real time what is actually going on there .
We ca n’t know what is happening behind closed doors at corrupt , hard - to - penetrate institutions in Washington or Wall Street unless teams of reporters armed with the appropriate technical expertise and assiduously developed contacts are digging night and day .
Those reporters have to eat and pay rent , whether they work for print , a TV network , a Web operation or some new bottom - up news organism we ca n’t yet imagine .
It ’s immaterial whether we find the fruits of their labors on paper , a laptop screen , a BlackBerry , a Kindle or podcast .
But someone  and certainly not the government , with all its conflicted interests  must pay for this content and make every effort to police its fairness and accuracy .
If we lose the last major news - gathering operations still standing , there will be no news on Google News unless Google shells out to replace them .
It wo n’t .
With E3 only a few days away , the rumors and speculation have begun to filter around the Internet ; all eyes will be on Los Angeles to see what Sony , Nintendo , and Microsoft have up their respective sleeves .
Luckily , we do n't have to guess , as we have the support of our very well - informed mole .
His information ?
Not only is the PSP
Go real , but we 'll be seeing a slimmed - down PS3 in August or September .
However , this news likely wo n't be announced during E3 .
Allow us to explain .
There are plenty of PS3 systems sitting on store shelves right now , and Sony is planning on sitting back and allowing the supply of those units to dry up over the summer .
We should n't expect a price cut , but the possibility is certainly there .
After retailers are ready for new stock , Sony will begin releasing the slimmer units to retail , although what features have been taken away or added is still anyone 's guess .
This is n't breaking news , as Engadget came into possession of supposedly leaked pictures of a smaller PS3 a few weeks ago ; the story ran around the tech press quickly .
The existence of a smaller PS3 seemed rather unlikely , until the sites that ran the picture received a cease and desist letter from a Chinese company saying that pictures contained " confidential information . "
The other bit of information concerns the worst - kept secret in gaming , the upcoming UMD - less PSP that should be revealed at E3 .
Our mole says that yes , it 's the real thing , and we can expect it to be lighter than its UMD - sporting predecessor , along with lower power consumption and possibly a lower price .
The PSP - Go will be sold right next to its bigger brother , which wo n't be taken from store shelves any time soon .
A good number of titles will be released with both retail releases and digital downloads , with some games like Unbound Saga forgoing a retail release altogether .
I also doubt that Patapon 2 will be the last game sold as a download voucher inside a plastic case , although we do n't have any firm information about that strategy at this time .
Both of these projects have been talked about for some time , but hearing them confirmed by the mole puts them on much more solid footing .
This is the person that broke the story about the Resident Evil V 360 bundle for us , who cracked the Patapon 2 thing wide open before there was any speculation , and who saw the 360 Halo 3 and Fable 2 bundle coming ( and before that the 360 price drops ) .
That 's not even a complete list !
The track record ( 100 percent correct ) of the mole speaks for itself , and with so much buzz around these two Sony - related stories ... there has to be a fire to justify all the smoke .
When will we know for sure ?
The PSP - Go will likely be announced at E3 , so that rumor will be confirmed very soon .
As for the slimmer PS3 , that will be kept quiet for quite a while .
Why tell customers that new hardware is coming when you 're trying to clear the retail channel of your older models ?
The mole did say the hardware could be shown to select partners at E3 , behind very tightly closed doors , so more leaks may provide extra evidence of the system 's existence .

It 's new but not new
It 's built on XMPP
It leverages a huge amount of existing infrastructure
It 's federated by default ( see below ) .
A lot of the underlying protocol is well understood by a lot of people
It 's federated
It 's extensible
It 's persistent
It can be " gatewayed "
It 's encrypted by default
It 's client independent
All of the things in the Wave demo are possible without Wave .
The interesting thing about Wave is not so much the application , but the infrastructure , the protocol and the underlying concepts .
Many limited collaboration apps have offered various subsets of the Wave functionality , for example , and the superficial functionality can be built using existing technology , without fancy new protocols and clients etc .
A lot of people have been comparing Wave to e-mail .
That 's missing the point too .
Wave has the potential to be as important as the Web .
I 'm serious .
Wave is taking the web and making it interactive , embeddable , recordable , and shareable on a whole different level than what we are used to .
And like most great " revolutionary " ideas it does n't actually add all that much new :
When the web arrived , hypertext systems were well known ( and most of them were far more advanced than early web browsers ) , for example .
What the web gave us was two simple innovations :
A simple system for letting anyone create content , and an addressing scheme and protocol that allowed the content to be distributed world wide .
But that existed - sort of - too before the web , in the form of Gopher .
The web was a very tiny evolutionary step in many ways , but they were " just the right ones " :
The web was more chaotic and unstructured and open - ended than gopher ( which was more of a distributed catalog of files ) , and with a number of ideas that spurred people on to extend it in all kinds of weird and wonderful ways .
Wave could be similar .
We have IM .
We have e-mail .
We have document sharing over the web .
We have the web .
All of the functionality of Wave can be achieved with existing technology .
You can chat with your friends .
You can share content .
You can run shared whiteboard apps that you could interface apps to .
But it 's not all seamlessly integrated .
That is the one deceptively small evolutionary step that Wave provides , that could very well be a big game changer .
Especially since
Wave does it in a very simple way .
That means : Jabber / Google Talk / XMPP is powerful because anyone can set up their own server , and Google has promised the same will be the case for Google Wave - it only makes sense anyway since XMPP is built ground up to be a federated protocol , with support for server - to - server connections etc.
Federation allows you to set up your own server , and so act as gatekeeper to information that is critical to you , and so makes Google Wave palatable as an intranet tool as much as an external tool - in fact , barring issues with how the clients are built there 's no reason why an intranet user could not start a public wave ( on a public server ) for an open discussion and then break away a private sub -wave on the intranet wave server - all in the same session - to discuss with his / her co-workers .
This makes
Wave a potentially pretty amazing collaboration tool for situations where you may have multiple parties with information of both public and private nature who wants to share different subsets with different parties .
Systems like Basecamp allows this today ( you can add other companies and users from those companies to your Basecamp setup , and control their access to your information ) but it is fairly static and limited to the specific feature - set of Basecamp , while in Wave it is a feature of the infrastructure and completely orthogonal to the functionality the various users employ .
In fact , nothing stops users from granting access to their own , internal , Wave - enabled apps , on a user by user basis as part of collaboration ( or as a general service ) : Imagine a booking agent ( at any type of business : restaurants , airlines etc. ) that answers live questions .
Lots of companies do that now .
But instead of just talking to you , the agent shares a booking form with you , and help you fill it in , live , while answering questions .
Or someone at your bank walks you through mortgage deals , and shows you a mortgage calculator , fills in details to illustrate the deals they are presenting , and show you graphs of your repayment schedule in real - time .
Because the Wave protocol allows both sides to push relatively arbitrary content , and update it realtime , you can use it to run presentations ; to edit documents together ; to fill in forms together that is then updated live by automated remote services .
Consider it a sort of " remote terminal " you can run applications in .
Only it 's shared .
And graphical .
And has built in playback .
The Wave server is responsible for maintaining a persistent store of the waves .
Depending on your wave server there may be different policies for how long they persist , but due to the openness of the protocol , there 's plenty of opportunity for archiving waves in ways that provides a record the way e-mail does .
Providing search and retrieval functionality for local waves is possible , and the architecture allows searching either at " point - in - time " or building search functionality that would let you search in past states of your waves .
I.e. your client or your local wave server could either snapshot waves at specific times , or maintain a complete record of the wave operations and then let you find that mention of doughnuts in the kitchen that some greedy co-worker deleted seconds later .
Many of the more exciting uses of Wave allowed by the open architecture is that you can create two - way gateways for all sorts of content using it .
Nothing is preventing you from building wave support into your new spreadsheet app , for example , so you can click a button to share the spreadsheet , or a graph from it , or whatever , with other people and have them help you edit it , and comment on it .
Or you can share your word processor document in a phone conference and people can add their own comments .
Or you could export your blog entries , and have people use Wave to add or read comments from your web page .
Or Wikipedia could export every page as a wave so those obnoxiously formatted " talk " pages could instead consist of people adding comments " inline " to the actual text .
Or you could turn it into an IRC client .
Or Facebook could turn the walls into waves and let people read / post to their wall via wave ( though given facebooks past behavior in banning people who post too many updates , perhaps not ) .
Google itself has a suite of apps that could be exported as waves : Docs / Spreadsheets , Gmail , Picasa , Calendar etc. - imagine starting a wave , pulling in a document , adding your pics from Picasa , dragging in the calendar and creating an event , and turning it all into a nicely formatted event invitation e-mail that is gatewayed out via normal e-mail to your friends and family ( or made available as a wave to those who use it ) , complete with nice pictures from the place you 're inviting them too , the price list from Docs , a calendar invite etc.
Encryption by default makes it a lot easier sell as a collaboration tool also internally in businesses , or even in many cases as a replacement for e-mail or other channels that are insecure by default and takes conscious actions to secure .
While Google obviously has a head start , and while extensions may ( or may not ? ) be client dependent , nothing stops other parties from building Wave clients that add new capabilities .
The underlying protocol is really simple - it uses XMPP for federation and layers a thing layer of maintaining shared XML documents and serializing multi-party updates to that document to all participants .
How the client ( or the server ) interprets that document is up to the client ( or the server ) .
Some ways to use this : " Load " snapshots of waves into your word processor when you 've finished collaboratively editing it , and finish cleaning it up ( your word processor could be a wave client ) ; open a wave in Finder / Explorer and drag images from the wave somewhere else ( or open the wave in Photoshop and pick an image to edit ) .
All of course assuming the various app gets wave support .

" When I asked if she intended to keep them as pets she ummed and ahhed and said ' probably not ' .
I could n't believe she thought I 'd give them to her when it was quite clear she planned to eat them . "
Debbie Connolly , a pet behaviour specialist who runs an animal sanctuary in Wales , claims she has received an increasing number of calls from people looking for pets to fatten up .
Last week , she says she heard from a woman about some goats she was trying to rehome who she suspected was more intent on savouring them than saving them .
Last year , the credit crunch was blamed for an increase in the number of people turning to animal rescue centres to give their pets away , but Connolly suggests they are now returning in search of a cheap dinner .
The rush towards self - sufficiency , which has seen a surge in sales of chicken coops and vegetable seeds , has also led to a spate of inquiries at her sanctuary .
" More and more people are trying to buy our animals with the intention of selling them on for their meat , " she says .
" These animals have been brought up as pets , how long will it be before they are literally making a dog's dinner ? "
Connolly says people should be careful who they sell their pets too , " particularly rabbits , goats and pigs " .
Which raises two questions : is there really anything wrong with tucking into animals like these when times are hard , and how bad does the recession have to get before people are tempted to turn Rover into a hot dog or serve up anything à la cat ?
One of the few leaders from Swat who is prepared to speak out against the Taliban is Riaz Khan , a political worker for the PML - N opposition party who described how the Taliban had taken over the valley .
" The Taliban says to people , if you want to live here you will have to support us with money or give us one person from your family .
Antivirals are being used to contain the spread of swine flu
Fourteen new cases of swine flu have been confirmed in England , the Health Protection Agency has said .
The infections bring the total number of cases of H1N1 in the UK to 101 .
The new cases affect six adults and eight children .
Ten are in London , three are in Surrey and one is in the eastern region .
Eleven of those infected are contacts of previously confirmed cases .
Two are recent travellers and the remaining case is still being investigated .
The HPA said there were currently 155 possible cases of the virus under investigation in UK laboratories .
Worldwide , swine flu has affected more than 8,400 people in 39 countries and caused at least 72 deaths .
On Saturday , the first cases were confirmed in India and Turkey , but the UK Foreign Office has lifted its advice against non-essential travel to Mexico , where the virus is believed to have originated .
How a patch of this ground might have looked in daylight .

Academy offers exhibition devoted to the art of anime
Anime has yet to catch on big time for American moviegoers , but that has n't prevented the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences from assembling a huge exhibition devoted to Japanese animation .
" Anime !
High Art - Pop Culture , " which runs through Aug. 23 in the academy 's Grand Lobby Gallery in Beverly Hills , collects 400 figurines , film clips , drawings and cels related to genre classics such as " Akira , " " Dragon Ball Z , " " Ghost in the Shell , " " Pokemon : The First Movie , " " Princess Mononoke , " " Sailor Moon " and " Yu - Gi - Oh ! "
" This kind of storytelling is radically different from American animation , " curator Ellen Harrison says .
" Anime grows out of a visual culture emanating from woodblocks , which then led to manga comics .
So many adults in Japan read comic books , rather than novels , that you get a more free - associative style of narrative that American audiences are n't accustomed to . "
The exhibition includes a section on Studio Ghibli , co-founded in 1985 by Hayao Miyazaki ( " Spirited Away " ) , whom Harrington describes as " the Walt Disney or John Lasseter of anime . "
A special X - rated gallery has also been set aside for erotic anime .
" You have to be 18 to enter this space , where you can see the clips and figurines and art work , " Harrison says , pointing out that " Japanese culture has a lot of restraints and codes of behavior , but as far as sexuality goes , it 's a much more accepted form of artistic expression , which is why you 'll see animated characters having sex .
In America , when Ralph Bakshi's X - rated movie ' Fritz the Cat ' came out in 1972 , it got pilloried .
In that sense , there 's less prudery in Japan . "
Studios have not yet cracked the code for marketing anime to mainstream audiences .
That may change when Steven Spielberg finishes his 3 - D remake of the futuristic thriller " Ghost in the Shell . "
Harrison figures it 's only a matter of time before anime goes Hollywood .
" There 's this upward - trending number of kids , teens and people in their early 20s who are interested in the subject , " she says .
" Any American media company that looks at this fan base will realize there 's a lot of money to be made .
Somebody 's going to figure out how to get feature films to them . "

The importance of family heirlooms
In " Summer Hours , " Juliette Binoche plays a restless designer tangling with relatives during a family reunion .
But the real stars in this leisurely drama turn out to be an antique vase , a desk and a Bauhaus cabinet .
For filmmaker Olivier Assayas , these heirlooms embody bittersweet lessons about the value of memory , place and property .
" The objects of the family legacy are charged with emotion , " he says of the project , which started as a short film commission from Paris ' Musee d'Orsay .
" A chair and an armoire are made to participate in the lives of humans , " Assayas says .
" On display , they lose their meaning .

Expect summer box office to boom
Heading toward Memorial Day in the wake of " X - Men Origins : Wolverine , " " Star Trek " and " Angels & Demons , " an especially robust three - day holiday weekend is in the offing with the release of " Terminator Salvation " ( opening Thursday ) and " Night at the Museum : Battle of the Smithsonian " ( opening Friday ) .
" Heavyweights usually do n't go mano a mano on the same weekend , " says Jeff Bock , box - office analyst at Exhibitors Relations Inc .
" But the ' Terminator ' and ' Night at the Museum ' movies should both fare well and produce some record - breaking grosses . "
This year 's box office , currently 12 percent ahead of last year 's numbers , is expected to experience continued momentum , Bock says .
" We 're looking at the highest - grossing summer on record , possibly $ 4.5 billion , " he says .
" The previous high was $ 4.1 billion in 2007 and 2008 .
We may be looking at the best attendance on record . "
That would be quite a feat , considering the current state of the economy .
When the season tally is finally totaled in September , Bock predicts that " Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen " will have succeeded in topping " Harry Potter and the Half - Blood Prince " to snag the No. 1 spot .
" Before the first ' Transformers ' dropped two years ago , your average moviegoer was a bit gun-shy about plopping down $ 10 to see a film based on Hasbro 's toy line , " Bock says .
" Not any more .

Banküberfall für die Bildung Peter Nowak
Mit dem Bildungsstreik 2009 soll eine Repolitisierung an den Hochschulen eingeleitet werden
Am vergangenen Montag haben das Bundesministerium für Finanzen sowie zahlreiche Großbanken ein Mahnschreiben der besonderen
Art erhalten .
In dem Brief heißt es :
Da sich angesichts der derzeitigen Finanz - und Wirtschaftskrise gezeigt hat , dass innerhalb weniger Wochen hunderte Milliarden Euro mobilisierbar sind , fordern nun auch wir ein umfangreiches Rettungspaket für das marode Bildungssystem .
Die Absender haben auch schon angekündigt , was passiert , wenn das Schreiben ignoriert wird .
Am 18 .
Juni soll die Aktion Banküberfall starten :
Wir klauen nichts , werden aber das Bankgeschäft real blockieren und unmissverständlich deutlich machen : Geld für Bildung statt für Banken .
Die Aktion ist
Teil des bundesweiten Bildungsstreiks 2009 , zu dem Schüler und Studierende in vielen Städten seit mehreren Monaten mobilisieren .
Am Anfang habe die Aktion eher zäh begonnen , aber in den letzten Wochen habe sie deutlich an Dynamik gewonnen , erklärte Ben Stolz von der Berliner Vorbereitungsgruppe gegenüber Telepolis .
Die Krise habe hier eindeutig mobilisierend gewirkt .
" Schließlich sind nicht nur Banken systemrelevant , auch gute Bildung ist unverzichtbar und die hat ihren Preis “ , so Stolz .
„ Schließlich hat sich angesichts der derzeitigen Finanz - und Wirtschaftskrise gezeigt , dass innerhalb weniger Wochen Hunderte Milliarden Euro mobilisierbar sind , “ begründet auch Bildungsstreik - Aktivist Martin Schmalzbauer die Forderung nach einem umfangreichen Rettungspaket für das marode Bildungssystem “ .
Rettungsschirm für Bildung
Dass die Debatte um die Krise und die Folgen für den Bildungsprotesten neuen Schwung brachte , kann man auch auf der Straße sehen .
So waren sowohl auf den beiden Demonstrationen unter dem Motto „ Wir zahlen nicht für Eure Krise “ am 28 .
März , als auch auf den verschiedenen Demonstrationen am 1 .
Mai und der von den Gewerkschaften organisierten Demonstration am 16 .
März Bildungsblöcke vertreten .
Dort trafen sich Schüler und Studierende , die für den Bildungsstreik werben .
Dabei taucht das Motto „ Wir zahlen nicht für Eure Krise “ in unterschiedlichen Formen und Abwandlungen immer wieder auf .
Auch die Figur der „ Rettungsschirme nicht nur für Banken “ findet sich in den Argumenten der Aktivisten häufig .
Banken oder Bildung
Die Misere im Bildungssystem wird von kaum jemand bestritten .
„ Milliarden für die Banken gehen zu Lasten der Unis “ , lautete die Überschrift im liberalen Tagesspiegel .
In dem Artikel heißt es :
Was in den beiden bisherigen Konjunkturprogrammen für die Forschungsorganisationen , die Schulen und Hochschulen vorgesehen ist , kommt allein Renovierungen und Baumaßnahmen zugute .
Nicht ein neuer Lehrer oder Wissenschaftler darf mit diesem Geld bezahlt werden .
Neben den Hochschulen klagen auch die Schulen und die Kindertagesstätten über eine akute Finanzkrise .
" Wer in der Stadt die Vorstellung hat , dass bei uns noch viel zu holen ist , hat noch nicht bemerkt , dass der Speck weg ist .
Wir sind am Knochen angelangt " , bringt Peter Lange von der Freien Universität die Lage auf den Punkt .
Die Finanzmisere hat schon konkrete Auswirkungen .
Weil keine Vertretungsprofessuren an der Freien Universität mehr finanziert werden , wurde am Otto Suhr Institut die Gastprofessur von Klaus Roth gestrichen .
Diese Entwicklung fördere die Einrichtung schlechtbezahlter Lehraufträge und somit die Prekarisierung im Bildungswesen , befürchten Fachschaftsvertreter .
Ben Stolz sieht hier eine gute Grundlage für Bündnis von Gewerkschaftern , Studierenden und Schülern .
Die DGB - Jugend - und die Gewerkschaft Erziehung und Wissenschaft haben schon die Unterstützung angekündigt .
Der Kulturwissenschafter Jens Wernicke analysiert in seiner in der Hochschulpolitischen Reihe erschienenen Schrift " Hochschulen im historischen Prozess " die Misere der Hochschulen nicht nur auf finanziellen Gebiet : Die neoliberale Bildungsreform der 90er Jahre verfestige und zementiere die Ungleichheiten im Bildungswesen weiter , die auch während der Bildungsreform der späten 60er Jahre nicht abgebaut worden waren .
Bildung werde durch die Implementierung marktwirtschaftlicher Wettbewerbsmechanismen vollständig von der ökonomisch - technischen Entwicklung abhängig , so Wernicke .
Sein Band endet mit der Hoffnung , dass die Interventionen von Studierenden und Wissenschaftlern hier Änderungen einleiten könnten .
Ob der Bildungsstreik diese Aufgabe erfüllen kann , muss sich zeigen .
Das wird vor allem davon abhängen , ob es gelingt , die unpolitischen Kommilitonen zu aktivieren .
Empört reagiert die Vorbereitungsgruppe auf eine Polizeiaktion im Zusammenhang mit dem Bildungsstreik .
Am 15 .
Mai wurden alle Teilnehmer eines Pressegesprächs mit internationalen Teilnehmern des Bildungsstreiks aus verschiedenen Ländern festgenommen und erst nach mehr als 2 Stunden wieder freigelassen .
Auch die anwesenden Pressevertreter waren davon betroffen .

Sourabh sat like that outside the station just to be around other Indians .
There were always taxi drivers there .
He 'd been in Melbourne only eight months then and felt alone .
His father died suddenly when Sourabh was four .
Sourabh is bright but , said Ravi , " very innocent .
The first time I spoke to him he called me ' bhai ' , which means ' bro ' .
He wanted me to like him . "
Ravi began to drive Sourabh home to the sparsely furnished house in Mallee Hen Street he shared with seven others .
Sourabh slowly gained confidence as his jobs and studies went well .
Sometimes he dared to walk home from the train .
Then last weekend Sourabh was brutally bashed and robbed , the latest in what a police source told The Age was an " epidemic " around western suburbs train stations .
In just a few minutes his whole life changed again .
The Federation of Indian Students of Australia say they know of 60 serious assaults in Melbourne in a few years .
Many go unreported .
The police and the State Government have a reference group to talk about the issue and play down race but it's an open secret around Werribee that attacks are usually racial by local gangs of mixed ethnicity .
Solicitor Scott Ashley from the Wyndham Legal Service said he heard that some assailants had called it " Indian hunting " .
He had seen police and medical files and " it is fortunate someone has not died " .
He was on the train home last Saturday night when it happened .
He 'd done a shift at KFC in Melbourne Central .
That 's the job his devout Hindu vegetarian mother did n't like  " she said to wear the gloves and not to touch the chickens , " he said .
It was about 8.45 pm .
He was listening to the radio through his phone .
He had a backpack containing $ 650 in cash for rent and fees for his hospitality management course .
At Aircraft station , between Laverton and Hoppers Crossing , six young men got on .
" Hair untidy and smelling bad , " said Sourabh .
They took his phone and bag and kicked him in the head and face and ribs , laughing and racially abusing him .
He cried .
" It was like they were playing a cruel game . "
The attackers got off at the next stop , Hoppers Crossing .
Sourabh was helped off at Werribee by an older man in a cap who laid him on a bench and called an ambulance .
Sourabh was unconscious .
He was taken to the Mercy Hospital , bleeding , with broken teeth and a fractured cheekbone .
When the man in the cap left the station he saw Ravi the taxi driver and told him one of his countrymen was in strife and an ambulance was coming .
Ravi delivered a passenger and returned but Sourabh had already been taken away .
Ravi did n't know it was his innocent bhai .
Across town in Hawksburn , Sourabh 's mate Sourabh Bakshi was at a friend 's house and found 20 messages when he turned on his phone .
It was 11 pm .
" The nurse said , ' Come now , we need someone . ' "
The two Sourabhs knew each other in India .
Sourabh Bakshi is 26 , a permanent resident and casual waiter .
He lives at Mallee Hen Street , too ; they sleep in the same room .
When he got to the hospital the nurses noticed that his semi-conscious friend 's pulse rate went up .
At 3 am older Sourabh took younger Sourabh home .
He had no health cover .
His head had been scanned but they figured they could n't afford any more .
The doctors said he would n't work for a month .
School fees , rent , food and now this , no income .
He could n't tell his mother because she would be hysterical with worry .
The next morning older Sourabh went to a chemist for painkillers and saw Ravi .
The story emerged .
" We thought Melbourne was supposed to be liveable , " Ravi said .
" But it is not . "
For most of the week Sourabh lay under a rough blanket on a bottom bunk .
Figurines of the Hindu deities Lord Shiva and Shri Ram looked down on him from the top of a wardrobe yet he began to doubt his karmic faith : " If you kind , then good will come , " he said , " but if you cruel , bad things happen .
I have never been cruel .
There is no reason for anyone to do this to me . "
Sourabh could n't eat solids , could n't sleep .
Older Sourabh brought sodden Weet - Bix to the bed .
He rang his mother on Tuesday .
" I only tell her that I got hurt accidentally and have two weeks off , " he said .
The police came on Wednesday , the transit safety division .
Meanwhile Victoria Police revealed they would send officers to India to brief Melbourne - bound students and that the latest western suburbs sting on street crime and assaults had netted 20 offenders .
A helpline began operating .
By the end of the week , in Sourabh 's words , a " ray of hope " emerged .
Solicitor Scott Ashley from the Wyndham Legal Service , who Sourabh found through Ravi , had organised a dentist and psychologist and applied for State Government money to cover costs .
Loading Yet Sourabh is deeply scarred .
He hurts all over but his heart is also wounded because any trust he had found has vanished .
Last night he said he was considering going home to his mother .
" It makes me worry , " he said .
" I was so scared of this happening and then it did happen .
So it is possible that in Melbourne it will all happen to me again . "

Iran is reporting huge new discoveries of oil that contain " billions " of barrels of reserves , state radio quoted the managing director of the country 's National Oil Co. as saying today .
Seyfollah Jashnsaz said Iran has discovered seven new oil fields in unspecified locations around the country .
" Billions of barrels of oil will be added to the country 's existing oil reserves , " he said in comments broadcast on state radio .
According to Jashnsaz , just one of these oil fields has 9 billion barrels of oil .
" Even if we make calculations based on the minimum 12 % recovery rate , " he said , " it means that 1 billion barrels of oil can be recovered from this field alone . "
He added that further details of the find will be announced by the country 's minister of oil in coming days .
WASHINGTON / NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - U.S. credit card companies are expected to use a White House meeting to put their best foot forward , despite an avalanche of negative publicity , aiming to blunt a congressional push for tougher regulations .
Fees and interest rates will be topics at the meeting set for Thursday between 14 credit card company executives , President Barack Obama , National Economic Council Director Lawrence Summers , and other government officials .
Executives from Bank of America Corp BAC.N , American Express Co AXP.N , Citigroup Inc C.N , Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N , JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N , Capital One Financial Corp COF.N , MasterCard Inc MA.N and Visa Inc V.N are expected to be at the meeting .
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said on Monday the discussion will include the transparency of the credit card companies ’ lending practices , and the interest rates and fees they charge .
“ The president believes that we can increase transparency involved , cut down on these deceptive practices , and ensure that any system that is involving fees is done in a way that is fair , ” Gibbs said .
Lenders are expected to argue that they are asking customers to contact them if they lose their jobs or feel under financial stress to try to renegotiate the credit card debt -- even by suspending fees or interest rates .
Scott Valentin , an analyst at Friedman , Billings , Ramsey , said credit card companies could also eliminate some late payments , or over - limit fees , to please Washington .
“ The card companies are sensitive to what is going on around them , and public perception , and the government actions that are being contemplated , and are trying to put on a good face , ” he said .
Credit card issuers have received over $ 120 billion in taxpayer funds since October , money the government has asked them to use to expand lending .
But with U.S. credit card defaults at record highs , lenders are trying to protect themselves by tightening credit limits and closing accounts , actions that have infuriated lawmakers , consumers , and even triggered a New York state attorney general inquiry .
“ Some of the very banks we rescued compound the hardships of ordinary Americans with unfair fees and interest charges , ” said Senator Carl Levin , a Michigan Democrat who has co-authored credit card legislation .
Citigroup Chief Financial Officer Ned Kelly said in a conference call Friday with analysts to discuss the bank ’s quarterly results that the credit card business has shifted from growth to risk management .
He added that higher prices on credit cards helped the bank , one of the largest U.S. credit card issuers , to cushion its losses .
In some cases , public anger has forced banks to withdraw fee hikes .
JPMorgan stopped charging a new monthly fee to cardholders and agreed to refund the money collected , while Bank of America suspended a planned increase in some fees .
TIGHTER RULES
The White House meeting is scheduled for a day after a U.S. House of Representatives committee is set to consider legislation aimed at curbing deceptive billing and interest rate practices .
The Federal Reserve tightened rules on credit - card practices in December , but the proposed legislation would take that further : it would give customers more time to pay their bills , limit interest rate increases , add more regulations , and ban credit cards access to people under 21 or 18 years of age .
Credit card companies are concerned that the legislation could become a way to severely restrict their discretion to charge fees , especially at a time when banks are struggling to emerge from the financial crisis .
“ Our expectation is that discussions will involve broad - based economic factors such as purchasing trends , delinquencies , and challenges ... that affect the funding of credit card loans , ” the American Bankers Association ( ABA ) spokesman Peter Garuccio said .
Valentin said credit card companies would prefer to stick to the Fed ’s rules , but could scrap some more fees to meet government demands .
“ The industry would like to avoid what is being discussed now , but it ... has to make some type of deference to meet what the administration and Congress want , ” Valentin said .
He said further limits on interest rates and fees like those proposed by Congress could cost the industry $ 12 billion in revenue per year , with 70 percent coming from fewer interest and 30 percent from lower fees .
The ABA trade group , which represents the biggest credit card companies , has warned that more rules could make it more difficult to price a customer ’s risk level and therefore reduce the availability of credit .
“ The administration clearly wants to keep the money flowing to the consumer , and the credit card companies are trying to protect themselves , hopefully there will be a middle ground some place , ” said Anton Schutz , president of Mendon Capital .

Is this real ?
If you have the stomach , click on the image to head to an image gallery and our very ordinary investigation .
So , are these photos real ?
And the answer , amazingly is … probably yes .
Here in Brazil we have our very own Minhocuçu ( Rhinodrilus e Glossoscolex spp ) which can easily grow beyond half a meter in length an almost an inch in diameter .
And it ’s not by far the longest earthworm recorded .
The Microchaetidae family in South Africa is a group where all species can reach over a meter in length .
This is no folk tale or cryptozoological rumor : specimens of this size have been duly recorded for over a century already .
And even those are not the champions .
The title goes to the Megascolecidae family from Australia .
The record : 2,1 meters by 24 millimeters thick .
The worms in the images all look they are up to a meter in length , compatible with the recorded dimensions for the many species of the families we discussed .
They are probably real , though exactly from where and what species my ordinary investigation did n’t come up with .
Specialists , do enlighten us with further confirmation and identification !
The first image of a girl holding up one , for instance , may not be of an earthworm but of is a caecilian .
Giant earthworms are harmless , but perhaps because of their plain appearance and our instinctive disgust of them all kinds of legends are associated with them , even in places where we ca n’t find those “ little ” couple - meter - earthworms .
The most curious legend is not exactly about an earthworm , but of a worm .
A death worm .
The Mongolian Death Worm .
It can allegedly kill its victims by either spraying a lethal and blinding venom , or sending electrical discharges .
In Brazil , where we do have our Minhocuçus , there ’s also the legend of Minhocão , 25 meters in size .
Like the Mongolian Death Worm , its not very plausible such a creature exists .
Earthworms over a couple of meters in length are real and they can more than make up for a mix of disgust and fascination .
Not only they can harm nobody and are actually important part of the ecosystem , in Brazil they are in danger as they make really excellent fishing bait .
This is no joke ( link in Portuguese ) .
UPDATE : Identified !
Well , at least the where and who for the second photo .
It ’s from Lisa B , available on her flickr account .
As Lisa wrote in the comments below , “ that image was taken in the Bellavista Cloud Forest Reserve in Ecuador , and it is indeed a real worm . ”

GENEVA , Switzerland , May 23 ( UPI ) --
The World Health Organization in Switzerland says it 's revising its warning system to reflect the deadliness of a disease and not just its geographic spread .
The current six - point system was created in 2005 amid the threat from H5N1 bird flu , which has a fatality rate of about 60 percent .
The six - point system reflects the spread of a virus but not its lethality .

Some countries have complained the current warning system caused panic when WHO announced the swine flu epidemic in April , though the strain has proved less deadly than bird flu .
In revising the warning system , WHO will try to " walk a fine line between not raising panic and not being complacent , " Dr. Keiji Fukada , WHO 's deputy director - general said in Geneva Friday .
With the swine flu , WHO quickly raised its alert level to 4 and then 5 after the virus was reported spreading from Mexico in April .
The agency has not gone to level 6 -- signifying the spread to a new continent -- even though cases of swine flu virus have been reported in Britain , Spain and Japan .

Despite the studio publicly wailing , they actually have a hit on their hands on now :
Over 1 million people have downloaded the rough workprint , which , in terms of DVD sales , that 's fantastic .
But more than that , " the leak " and " the hunt for the perpetrators " has generated more hype and awareness of the film than the studio could have possibly drummed up in their wildest dreams using legit tactics .

The non -alpha fans who downloaded it because of press coverage — who might 've skipped the flick entirely — are going to see it in theaters just for the train wreck factor : " Is it really gonna be as bad as the version I saw online ? "

Late Friday , the federal government signaled its intention to keep fighting for its right to prevent a judge from requiring that plaintiffs attorneys in Al - Haramain Islamic Foundation , Inc. , et al. v. Obama , et al.case be given access to classified information .
On April 17 , Judge Vaughn Walker ordered the attorneys for the Al - Haramain charity and the government to design a mechanism for protecting classified information .
( Background here : the government investigated whether the charity was a conduit for terrorist financing ; inadvertently , the charity 's lawyers received documents suggesting that the charity 's phones had been tapped by the NSA ; the charity is suing the government . )
The plaintiff 's lawyers quickly sent a proposal to the Justice Department 's lead attorney , Tony Coppilino .
Late last week , Coppolino sent word that the administration still was not ready to comply with the judge 's order .
As a result , the " joint filing " of 38 pages contains two parts .
joint submission 5 15.pdf
One is a comprehensive security program to protect classified information ; the other is a repetition of the government 's argument that it ought not be required to share highly classified information with the plaintiffs .
Though the two Al - Haramain attorneys have been cleared to see " Top Secret / SCI " information , the government argues , based on an affidavit filed by the National Security Agency , that the lawyers do n't have the requisite " need to know " about the specific intelligence in question here , which relates to the NSA 's domestic collection program .
" In the circumstances of this case , any disclosure of classified information to plaintiffs ' counsel , even under seemingly secure terms and conditions , would abrogate the state secrets privilege , and thus none of the terms of the proposed order would be consistent with the law or sufficient to protect the Government 's national security interests in the circumstances of this case , " the government claims .

GOATMILK introduces its original and exclusive month long series entitled “ Muslims Talking Sex ” featuring diverse Muslim writers from around the world discussing a gamut of topics in their own unique , honest and eclectic voices .
Much Ado About Nothing : the Hymen
Fatemeh Fakhraie
Riddle :
If you ’ve got this , you ca n’t share it .
If you share it , you have n’t got it .
The actual answer to this riddle is “ a secret . ”
But the case could be made for an alternative answer : the hymen .
Women are taught that our hymens are a secret : a gift representing our virginities that we should never share with anyone but our husbands .
Instead of being a gift , however , it really functions more as a curse .
Our early lives are often shaped around the hymen and its protection : we may be kept from playing sports , using tampons , having male friends , and riding horses for fear that our hymens may break ( or be broken ) and our virginities rendered void .
What is all this commotion over a hymen ?
MedicineNet defines the hymen as a “ thin membrane [ that ] completely or partially occludes the vaginal opening .
The hymen is a fold of mucous membrane usually present at birth at the orifice of the vagina . ”
WebMD ’s definition is similar , stating that the hymen consists of a “ thin , membranous fold of highly variable appearance that partly occludes the ostium of the vagina before its rupture ( which may occur for a variety of reasons ) .
It is frequently absent ( even in virgins ) , although remnants are commonly present as hymenal caruncula tags . ”
Notice both definitions admit that not all women are born with hymens .
Hymens are as varied as women themselves : some hymens never come to be , some are so delicate that they tear without cause , some are so stubborn they must be surgically removed for a woman to have intercourse or give birth .
Despite the fact that hymens are too varied and unreliable to serve as an indicator of virginity , this is precisely how they are used .
Virginity is also synonymous with the female gender .
When you think of a virgin , your thoughts most likely automatically go to a young woman — never a man .
This touches on a serious problem within all communities , but especially Muslim communities : sexual double standards .
The fact that a young man can get freaky with anyone he deems suitable and still be an acceptable candidate for marriage ( maybe not the most desirable , but acceptable ) is troublesome when his sister faces rumors , slander , and rejection from suitors , friends , community members , and even her own family if she does the same thing as her brother .
We need to get rid of these double standards about sexuality and sex .
They ’re not fooling anybody .
And often , those of us who catch on , or fall victim to , the community ’s double standards about sexuality start to feel resentment for how our hymens are given importance above our achievements , our feelings , and our minds .
I ’m sure everyone remembers the French divorce case where a Muslim husband sought to divorce his wife because she “ faked ” her virginity .
This case was problematic from all sides : a wife was untruthful with her husband , and a husband wanted an intact hymen more than he wanted a wife .
This case illustrates that many Muslims are unable to talk openly about sexuality with their loved ones and that we ’re equating virginity with perfection , going to extremes in search of it .
Even more problematic are the far - reaching effects of hymen - worship .
Specifically , virginity - related honor killings and hymen reconstruction surgery .
In March of 2008 , a Jordanian man shot his sister and her boyfriend , killing them both , because her family suspected that she was no longer a virgin .
Forensic tests conducted after her death revealed that she was a virgin when she was murdered .
So her brother killed two people based on …what ?
A rumor ?
Gossip ?
This is n’t the first time that rumor and gossip have murdered a woman , and it most likely wo n’t be the last .
Lina Nabil , a journalist whose brief prison sentence in a Jordanian jail revealed that the overwhelming majority of her cellmates were being held for their own safety because they were thought to no longer be virgins , realized that false accusations fuel a majority of virginity - related honor killings .
And if a woman is no longer a virgin , what is she ?
She ’s still a living , breathing person .
Is a hymen worth more than a life ?
These murders do n’t just happen in Jordan .
They happen anywhere that a woman ’s virginity is prized and considered to be an important part of her feminine charm .
These murders can happen everywhere until we rethink the importance we ’ve placed on a hymen .
Hymen reconstruction surgery ( commonly known as “ hymenoplasty ” — it ’s the surgical restoration of the hymen ) is another worrisome outcome of our obsession with hymens and virginity .
Recent news stories from outlets such as Reuters and the New York Times highlight the increasing popularity of hymenoplasty among women in Muslim communities .
If it ’s to the point where surgical reconstruction of a hymen seems like a better idea than owning up to the fact that one has had sex , for whatever reason , we ’re in a lot of trouble .
We have to rethink our priorities .
Which is more important : a smart , caring , kind partner / wife , or a woman with an intact hymen ?
When we care more about a fuzzy idea of virginity than what kind of person a woman is , we have a seriously skewed idea of women , their value , and their sexuality .
A relationship is between two people , not between a person and a hymen .
An intact hymen does n’t guarantee fidelity , fertility , or friendship — and in our era of hymenoplasty , it does n’t even guarantee virginity .
It ’s time to do some serious thinking , folks .
We have to start asking ourselves why we let men get away with premarital sex without a scratch , but why we force women who behave in a way we do n’t like into shame , isolation , or death because of our gossip , rumors , and judgments .
It ’s time that all of us measure a woman by who she is , not what is ( or is n’t ) between her legs .

[ Jim Rossignol is a games critic for Offworld , an editor at Rock , Paper , Shotgun , and the author of the fantastic This Gaming Life : Travels in Three Cities .
A full - length interview with Rossignol will appear on BLDGBLOG next week ] .
Game developers are unconstrained in their designs for the enemy .
Such designers will be punished with poor sales , not death in the gulag , if their designs for the overlord are unpopular .
They could go anywhere with the homes of evildoers : halls of electric fluorescence , palaces carved from corduroy , suburban back yards .
And yet , in spite of this freedom , most videogame designers choose to make a definite connection to familiar – or real - world – architecture .
Perhaps they think that the evil lairemanate evil .
There 's surely no room for ambiguity with videogame evildoers : the gamer needs to know that it 's okay to aim for hi-score vengeance .
Conveniently , evil already has a visual language .
Put another way : I have seen the face of evil , and it is a caricature of gothic construction .
There 's barely a necromancer in existence whose dark citadel does n't in some way reflect real - world Romanian landmarks , such as Hunyad or Bran Castle .
The visual theme of these games is so heavily dependent on previously pillaged artistic ideas from Dungeons & Dragons and Tolkien that evil ambiance is delivered by shorthand .
( Of course , World of Warcraft 's Lich King gets a Stone UFO to fly around in – but it's still the same old prefab pseudo - Medieval schtick inside ) .
Where the enemy is extra-terrestrial , HR Giger 's influence is probably going to be felt instead .
But , I suspect , these signposts – or the ways in which game designers architecturally represent evil – are becoming too much a part of our everyday imaginative discourse to remain affecting .
They 've begun to lose their danger .
The connection with the inhumanity that makes the enemy so thrilling has started to fade via over - familiarity .
Where the evil lair becomes a little more interesting is when its natureambiguous – but nevertheless disturbing .
Half - Life 2 's Citadel is an example of this .
The brutal gunmetal skyscraper that looms over a nameless Eastern European city , below , appears deeply threatening .
But , like everything else in theuniverse , it is unexplained .
It does not seem inherently evil .
The structure moves and groans ; it is a machine of some kind .
It is something constructed and mechanical , rather than the clear manifestation or emanation of an evil force .
The Citadel is not a fire - rimmed portal to hell , nor a windswept ruin .
Nor is it a volcano base .
It could even be somehow utilitarian .
In fact , it 's reminiscent of the real Moscow 's own television tower .
It is , perhaps , even incidental to the scourge that 's denizens face : alien infrastructure .
It is only later , as the plot uncoils the inner architecture of the Citadel , that you come to realise that itthe enemy : the lair of an alien force that must , ultimately , be destroyed .
Where the lair is itself the enemy , games are able to excel .
This is the case in both System Shock and System Shock 2 , the finest of SF horror games .
Both are set aboard spacecraft , but these spacecraft are also the " bodies " of the enemy : SHODAN , a malevolent Artificial Intelligence that controls each vessel .
In a provocative climax of virtuality - within - virtuality , the final act ofis to enter into the cyberspace realm of the AI and defeat SHODAN inside the graphical representation of her own programming .
The evil lair is within the mind of the enemy – a motif repeated even more literally in Psychonauts , a game about exploring the physically manifested psyches of various bizarre characters .
More interesting visually , and far more ambiguous in its delivery of the evil lair , is the underwater city of Rapture , in Bioshock .
The designers of this game ( some of whom also worked on theseries ) poured the early part of the twentieth century into their designs , creating opulent , decaying , Art Deco corridors down which the genetically - enhanced super - human player goes thundering , searching for the enemy .
The ostentation of the city 's innards suggests that the city 's objectivist overseer , Andrew Ryan , must be the enemy we seek .
He has , after all , created himself an entire city with a single , over - arching theme : a trademark act of the all - powerful videogame nemesis .
Yet , as the story unfolds , it becomes clear that , although you will inevitably kill Ryan , his architecture tells you nothing about the nature of the enemy you face .
Indeed , the true enemy has nothing to do with the stylised nature of this lair at all .
But perhaps the most extraordinary and unearthly of evil videogame architectures are the wandering colossi of Shadow of the Colossus .
Great , living structures , lonely behemoths , that stride magnificently across the game world .
These sad , shaggy giants of stone and moss must be climbed and slain by the hero , often via use of the surrounding environment of ancient ruins and meticulously designed geological formations .
Lairs within lairs .
Of course , monsters areevil , but the reality of the colossi remains ambiguous for much of the game .
When the game is up , the player - character suffers a terrible price for destroying these strange , animate monuments .
It is one of the few videogames in which the protagonist dies – horribly and permanently – when the game is over .
It is a game where destroying the evil lair might well have been the wrong thing to do .
And yet it isyou can do .
Such is the inexorable , linear fate of the videogame avatar .
The H1N1 flu continues to spread around the world , with cases now confirmed from more than a dozen countries , from Hong Kong to Canada .
Yet the first genetic analysis of how well this virus transmits from person to person concludes that it spreads barely well enough to keep itself going .
The analysis also suggests the virus may have started circulating as long ago as January .
But because there have been so few cases to analyse , the calculation is uncertain .
It could have started more recently , or as far back as September .
Nicholas Grassly of Imperial College London and Andrew Rambaut of the University of Edinburgh , UK , have analysed the rate of spread .
Their analysis is based on the small mutations that have accumulated in almost two dozen genetic sequences produced so far , from viruses collected from patients in Mexico and the US .

In contrast to H5N1 bird flu , all the genetic sequences of this H1N1 are being posted on bulletin boards like GISAID , where scientists can access them and compare preliminary analyses .
The GISAID system was set up in 2006 by scientists who protested that H5N1 sequences were not being made freely available .
“ The limited sampling so far gives rise to considerable uncertainty in the estimate , ” cautions Rambaut .
But if the rate at which genes mutate is about the same for this virus as for other H1N1 viruses , the number of mutations that have accumulated so far suggests it has been circulating since January – or even September 2008 .
Weak virus
If the new virus spreads from one infected person to the next at about the same speed as ordinary flu , that gives an idea of how many cases there may have been in that time .
A mathematical model permits the calculation of an important variable called R 0 – the number of additional people infected , on average , by each case .
If R 0 is less than one , an infection dies out .
Grassly also cautions that the estimate is very preliminary .
But with the data available now , he gets an R 0 of 1.16 – enough for the virus to keep going , but only just .
This could be good news .
In epidemiological theory , at least , the lower the R 0 , the easier it may be to snuff the virus out by further hindering its spread .
But it may be too early for celebrations .
The 1918 flu pandemic , caused by another H1N1 virus , started with a mild , early wave in spring and early summer .
The flu lab at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the US estimates that the R 0 of the 1918 virus in spring was only 1.45 .
That shot up , they estimate , to 3.75 when the virus began its lethal second wave the following autumn .
Much may now depend on how quickly the new H1N1 virus from swine adapts to people .
Hypertension ( high blood pressure ) is called “ a disease of our epoch ” .
For the last 50 years its incidence has been drastically increasing .
Statistics shows that currently every one of four Americans suffers from this health problem .
Hypertension affects thousands of people throughout the world regardless of their age , gender and general health condition .
High blood pressure is usually associated with narrowing of the arteries , fastened heartbeat or greater volumes of blood .
These conditions are among the most common causes of hypertension , along with such factors as overweight and obesity , sedentary life style , poor diet , stresses , etc .
Hypertension can be treated by using a complex program , which should include proper nutrition , exercise , maintaining healthy weight and , certainly , the gifts of our Mother Nature .
Garlic is considered to be among the most effective natural remedies for high blood pressure .
Some “ gurus ” suggest preparing a unique “ hypertension relief ” , which is a mixture of garlic with raisins , but I believe that there are really few people who would wish to try this exotic remedy .
Another suggestion of the experts can be more attractive : those who are trying to combat high blood pressure should eat lots of grapefruit .
This fruit contains a lot of Vitamin P , which is known for its property to lower blood pressure .
Carrot juice is one more very effective and beneficial natural remedy for hypertension .
Other natural and herbal remedies for the people with hypertension include , first of all , Hawthorn berries , Garcinia ( Garciniacambogia ) and a wonderful herb known as Shepherd ’s Purse ( Capsella bursa - pastoris ) .
These herbs can help to cleanse and relax blood vessels .
It is also possible to try an infusion of Lime Blossom ( Tiliaeuropea ) , Sarpagandha ( Rauwolfia Serpentina ) , Siberian Ginseng , Motherwort and Mistletoe ( Viscum album ) .
Taking a spoonful of lemon juice mixed with 2 - 3 drops of honey every morning can assist in lowering blood pressure , strengthening blood vessels and heart muscle , and also in increasing flexibility of the arteries .
At that , in this mixture you can use onion juice instead of lemon juice .
For the people who suffer from hypertension it is recommended to eat regularly such fruits and vegetables as apples , bananas , tomatoes , boiled potato , spinach and other leafy vegetables , cucumbers , watermelon , papaya , oranges , guava , pumpkin , berries and so on .
It can be very effective to fest one day a week .
On that day , instead of eating usual meals it can be good to drink fresh fruit juices or natural juice mixtures .
Also , specialists strongly recommend to reduce the consumption of salt and red meat , as well as to refrain from drinking coffee and alcohol , avoid smoking and eating too spicy meals .
Finally , in order to keep your blood pressure under control , it is very important to avoid stresses and learn some effective techniques of relaxation , including yoga , deep breathing , distraction , positive thinking , etc. Aromatherapy and relaxing massages can also be helpful .
Hi !
My name is Carla and I am a 5th year medical student at HYMS .
I am interested in alternative medicine and I have done months researching the topic of herbal medicine .
Besides , I like interviewing people and learning more about their experiences with one or another type of herbal treatments .
I am willing to contribute to this site with my knowledge , and I would be happy to help you out to the best of my ability with any specific questions or problems related to alternative medicine .
PrimerDesign Ltd , a UK firm founded by University of Southampton scientists , has won the race to produce the first DNA test kit for the Mexican swine flu .
The first shipment of rapid - results tests has been sent today directly to Mexico as well as many other territories to help authorities monitor the increasing number of suspected cases .
Project coordinator Dr Rob Powell said : " This past Sunday at midnight was a very special moment for us .
We were able to show conclusively that the test works . "
The rapid test has results in only two hours compared to current diagnostic tests which take two days .
" Monitoring the spread of the virus is now the key weapon against a possible pandemic .
These tests will contribute to the global effort to halt the disease , " said Dr Jim Wicks from PrimerDesign .
The company is part of the University 's SETsquared Business Incubation programme .
The PrimerDesign swine flu real - time PCR kit is sold primarily for research use but could be used to diagnose the disease in laboratories globally .
I am an iPhone newbie .
I just got it last week .
So the first thing I did was sift through the app store in search of cool apps I could install .
I instantly zeroed in on the Public Radio Tuner , an iPhone app that “ features hundreds of public radio streams available for free ! ” I was very excited .
Imagine being able to listen to KCRW or WWOZ anywhere !
But before I downloaded it I did the smart thing and read the reviews .
Two out of five stars ?
What happened ?
How could an NPR app score so low ?
So I dug in further to see what all the negativity was about .
Here is a sampling of the low - rated reviews :
This shameful app does not even deserve a full star .
The music on here is terrible , just jazz and classical in my area .
There are only two reasons you would download this .
1 ) You are over 60 years old 2 ) You have no good taste in current music .
Where ’s the Lil Wayne tracks ?
This app is hella weak fo sho …
yeah sure its a great idea but theres no hip / hop rap rock metal latin ( besides the one station in puerto rico ) its all just classical and jazz
So it ’s obvious they did n’t read the description .
They just saw “ Free Radio ” , downloaded , and then griped about it not doing what they wanted it to do .
Does n’t quite fit the image of the guy in the Mac / PC commercials , does it ?
No matter how hard you try to clarify and niche your product offering , you are going to have people gloss over even the most basic of descriptions before diving in with a sledgehammer .
In the world of web - based project management apps , it is not uncommon to have a prospective customer go through a similar routine .
The customer logs in , clicks around long enough to find out it does n’t do this one obscure thing that it really should , and then gripes about it either in an email to your support staff or on your public forums .
Despite the app never claiming to support said feature , or in fact , disclaiming support for it in the first place , that bit of copy never gets read , and a great application , like this Public Radio Tuner , gets bogged down with negative reviews .
Even a great app like Basecamp , which is great at what it claims to do , gets beaten down for not doing enough .
And apps like Intervals get critics who say it ’s doing too much .
It ’s well understood that you ca n’t please all the people all the time , but how do we zero in on the market we do want to please ?
Most of us uphold Apple as the authorities on making stuff simple .
If not even Apple can fend off these types of reviews , the rest of us will probably have to suffer through them as well .
No matter how simple you make a web - based app , you are always going to have detractors .
And its not your fault .
It ’s just the nature of the Internet .
Economic sanctions continue to spread into cyberspace as Microsoft announced last Friday that customers in sanctioned countries would receive an error message if they tried to log into their Windows Live Messenger accounts and would no longer be able to use the service .
When you try to sign in to Windows Live Messenger , you receive the following error message : 810003c1 :
We were unable to sign you in to the .NET Messenger Service .
Microsoft has discontinued providing Instant Messenger services in certain countries subject to United States sanctions .
Details of these sanctions are available from the United States Office of Foreign Assets Control [ “ OFAC ” ] .
Why it took Windows so long to get with the program when arch- rival Google had disabled downloads to Sudan and other sanctioned countries ages ago is not clear .
Although the shutoff applies to Cuba , North Korea , Iran , Sudan and Syria , Sudan seems to have taken it most to heart , judging from this report on the shutoff in the Sudan Tribune , a Paris - based on - line newspaper covering Sudan :
The software , Microsoft ’s Windows Live Messenger , allows users to chat directly with one another , send photos , play games or send messages to mobile phones .
The Messenger is widely used by the Sudanese diaspora to contact their families and until last week had been available for free downloading in the countries targeted by US sanctions .
Of course , Microsoft ’s action is incredibly easy for users to circumvent .
First , users can log back into their accounts and change their country to a non-sanctioned country .
( Oddly , Microsoft ’s drop - down list for countries on its Live Messenger sign up page– still includes Sudan — not to mention Cuba , North Korea , Iran and Syria ! )
Second , if Microsoft is also using geolocation filters on the IP addresses , the user can always connect through a proxy server located in a non-sanctioned country .
Et voilà , the Sudanese ( or Syrian , Cuban , Iranian or North Korean ) resident can IM to his or her hearts content , Microsoft is in full compliance with the law , and OFAC is none the wiser and can still believe that it has hastened the downfall of these governments by keeping their citizens from communicating with their family and friends .

Made to reassure the public about the safety and quality of McDonald 's meat , this tour of one of their meat providers ' factories is interesting , partly because of the complex , bewildering preparations that the beef patties go through and the amazing machines that do the work , but mostly because of how much the procedure resembles that child - grinding scene from The Wall .
The video has it all : masked employees earnestly voicing the virtues their " USDA - inspected " product while behind them , a torrent of beef spews out of a giant mechanical meat - hole onto a speeding conveyor belt ; tubs , pipes and boxes of various sizes and shapes carrying a roiling mass of beef slurry ; countless , mysterious processing chambers , each of which does who knows what else to the patties .

The final step of the process : after all the processing , grinding , forming and freezing , the last device the patties pass through before packaging is a metal detector .
In other words , go to McDonald 's , because your Big Mac is practically guaranteed not to have a lug nut in it .
It 's not that this is necessarily surprising , it 's just that we 're used to companies keeping this kind of thing as out of view as possible .
So some credit is due to McD's , I guess ?
Witness all the mechanical wonder / horror here .

Teachers need to be honest about faults in the exam system if they are to gain more respect and esteem for the profession , the shadow Education Secretary says today .
Michael Gove , in an interview with The Independent to coincide with the start of the teacher union conference season , makes it clear that the priorities of a new Conservative government would be to restore respect for teaching .
Countries that do better than England in international league tables – such as Finland , Singapore and South Korea – are able to recruit top graduates into teaching because the profession is held in higher esteem there .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
As a result , one of a new Conservative government 's first moves would be to take action to give teachers greater protection , Mr Gove says .
That would involve guaranteeing anonymity for all teachers accused of abuse by pupils , until proven guilty .
In addition , there would be a commitment that any investigation into a pupil 's allegation would be completed to an agreed timetable .
Some teachers have had to wait for up to two years before unfounded allegations are disproved .
Mr Gove also promises action to strengthen teachers ' powers to search pupils for weapons or drugs .
" We want to remove from teachers the fear factor of ending up in court or some disciplinary procedure if they intervene , " he says .
His pledge coincides with a survey by the Association of Teachers and Lecturers , whose conference opens in Liverpool today , which reveals that almost one in four staff have endured physical violence at the hands of a student .
Mr Gove makes it plain that teachers ' leaders will have to be more openly critical of items like the " dumbing down " of exam standards to improve their public esteem .
Only last week , Ofqual , the new exams regulatory body , voiced concerns over science GCSEs , saying that questions had become easier and no longer taxed the brightest pupils .
He also argues that it is the duty of organisations like the National Union of Teachers and National Association of Head Teachers – who advocate scrapping tests for 11 - year - olds and are threatening to boycott them – to come up with a convincing alternative .
And he rejects the idea that the Conservatives would have to allow private sponsors to make a profit out of running schools if they introduced Swedish - style " independent free schools " – run by a range of private organisations with state funding – in the UK .
" People are prepared to become involved for philanthropic and idealistic motives , " he says , " so should n't we make that the prime goal ? "
Senior advisers to the Swedish government , however , have said that they believed allowing people to make a profit out of running schools was essential to the success of the scheme .
For those talking about the logo change .
If I remember rightly , Sony has already changed the use of the logo from PLAYSTATION back to PlayStation in a lot of advertisements , so do n't be so surprised if it were the case that they decide to backtrack with the hardware itself .
They 're pretty desperate at the moment and changing the logo back to the old style may be an attempt at emulating past glories .
This system does not look nice but I can underestand how they would fit the hardware inside .
If you see the guts of a current 80 GB compared to a launch 60 GB you will see just how much it has been refined .
It 's completely different architecturally and the hardware is almost rattling around inside where as with the earlier versions every gap was filled with it 's bloated guts .
I 'm 65/35 on this being real .
Based on the logo changes in publications and sports advertising and the alterations to current hardware , plus the savings thhe company would make on shipping and packing materials with the added savings of a cheaper case this could make sense for a global company with billions in losses .
Overfishing and disease have decimated shellfish populations in many of the world 's temperate estuarine and coastal ecosystems .
Smithsonian scientists , led by Whitman Miller , ecologist at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center in Edgewater , Md. , have discovered another serious threat to these valuable filter feeders — rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide that contribute to the acidification of open ocean , coastal and estuarine waters .
Their findings are being published in PLoS One .
For shellfish and other organisms that have calcium carbonate shells and structures , the problem begins when atmospheric CO 2 dissolves in seawater and creates carbonic acid that is then rapidly transformed into carbonate and bicarbonate ions in the water .
Increased acidity tips the balance toward bicarbonate formation and away from carbonate .
Less carbonate in the water means that shellfish have fewer building blocks to generate their shells .
If the water is acidic enough , shells can even begin to dissolve .
" Estuarine and coastal ecosystems may be especially vulnerable to changes in water chemistry caused by elevated CO 2 because their relative shallowness , reduced salinity and lower alkalinity makes them inherently less buffered to changes in pH than in the open ocean , " said Miller .
For many calcifying organisms , CO 2 - induced acidification poses a serious challenge because these organisms may experience reduced rates of growth and calcification that " when combined with other environmental stresses , could spell disaster . "
Larval oysters are thought to be particularly susceptible to acidification since larvae produce shells made of aragonite , a crystalline form of calcium carbonate that is prone to erosion at low pH .
Adult oysters continue to build shell but generate calcite , a more durable form of calcium carbonate .
In Miller 's study , the larvae of Eastern oysters ( Crassostrea virginica ) and Suminoe oysters ( Crassostrea ariakensis ) were cultured in estuarine water that was held at four separate CO 2 concentrations , reflecting atmospheric conditions from the pre-industrial era , the present , and those predicted in the coming 50 and 100 years .
To test the effects of acidification , Miller monitored their growth and measured the amounts of calcium carbonate deposited in larval shells over the course of one month .
Miller and his team found that Eastern oysters experienced a 16 percent decrease in shell area and a 42 percent reduction in calcium content when specimens in the pre-industrial CO 2 treatment were compared with those exposed to the levels predicted for the year 2100 .
Surprisingly , the closely related Suminoe oysters from Asia showed no change to either growth or calcification .
The results reported suggest that the impacts of acidification may be tied to a species ' unique evolutionary history and environmental setting , implying that predictions may be more complex than previously thought .
" In the Chesapeake Bay , oysters are barely holding on , where disease and overfishing have nearly wiped them out .
Whether acidification will push Eastern oysters , and the many species that depend on them , beyond a critical tipping point remains to be seen " said Miller .
With numbers so critically low — the oyster population in the Chesapeake Bay today stands at just 2 percent of what it was in colonial times — future losses could have dire consequences , both environmentally and economically .
Indeed , the recently enacted Federal Ocean Acidification Research and Monitoring Act of 2009 recognizes the urgent need to begin addressing impacts of acidification on estuaries and their biota .
With the continued burning of fossil fuels , further acidification is unavoidable .
Miller 's team is keenly interested in what the biological and ecological responses will be in order to better inform current and future environmental restoration efforts .
" In a high CO 2 world , calcifying organisms may well begin to lose out to competition with non-calcifiers , a situation that could fundamentally change benthic communities .
Understanding how such changes may play out in estuaries and coastal waters , which teem with calcifying biota , and which are also the centers of many commercial fisheries and human activities , seems especially urgent " said Miller .

LOS ANGELES  Direct democracy has once again upended California  enough so that the state may finally consider another way by overhauling its Constitution for the first time in 130 years .
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger returned home from a White House visit on Wednesday to find the state dangerously broke , his constituents defiant after a special election on Tuesday and calls for a constitutional convention  six months ago little more than a wonkish whisper  a cacophony .
As the notion of California as ungovernable grows stronger than ever , Mr. Schwarzenegger , a Republican , has expressed support for a convention to address such things as the state ’s arcane budget requirements and its process for proliferate ballot initiatives , both of which necessitated Tuesday ’s statewide vote on budget matters approved months ago by state lawmakers .
“ There could not be more of a tipping point , ” said Jim Wunderman , chief executive of the Bay Area Council , a business group that moved forward on Wednesday with plans to push for a constitutional convention .
“ We think the interest is going to grow by orders of magnitude now . ”
Blagojevich indicted on 16 federal corruption charges RAW STORY
Published : Thursday April 2 , 2009
Print This Email This Former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich has been indicted by federal prosecutors , the AP reports .
" According to a statement issued by the Justice Department , Blagojevich will be charged along with his brother , two former aides and two business associates , " reports Roll Call .
'Since 2002 , even before he was first elected governor that November , and continuing until he was arrested on Dec. 9 , 2008 , former Illinois Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich and a circle of his closest aides and advisors allegedly engaged in a wide - ranging scheme to deprive the people of Illinois of honest government , ' Patrick Fitzgerald , U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Illinois , said in a statement . "
The AP continues : " A federal grand jury handed down the 19 - count indictment against Blagojevich , his brother , two former aides and two businessmen on Thursday .
It accuses Blagojevich of corruption involving billions of dollars in state pension bonds .
FBI agents arrested the Chicago Democrat in December on allegations that also include trying to auction off President Barack Obama 's vacant U.S. Senate seat . "
" All six defendants will be arraigned on dates yet to be determined before U.S. District Judge James B. Zagel in Federal Court in Chicago , " said the Department of Justice in a press release .
" Blagojevich was charged with 11 counts of wire fraud , two counts of attempted extortion , and one count each of racketeering conspiracy , extortion conspiracy , and making false statements .
The specific counts and maximum penalties each defendant is facing are listed separately . "
The Department of Justice made a full copy of the indictment available online .
As The Chicago Sun-Times earlier reported , " Blagojevichs indictment is highly anticipated , and its no secret that there is a Tuesday deadline to return the charges .
The grand jury considering the matter meets on Thursdays .
" Blagojevich and his then chief of staff John Harris were arrested Dec. 9 on corruption charges .
Blagojevich was accused in a criminal complaint of trying to sell President Obamas open Senate seat .
He was also accused of trying to shakedown firms seeking state business for campaign cash before a Jan. 1 law went into effect banning the practice .
Charges also included an alleged plot to have Chicago Tribune editorial board members fired in exchange for helping Tribune Co. structure a state - backed deal to sell Wrigley Field . "
U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald did not hold a press conference when the indictment was released , The Washington Post reports , nor will Blagojevich be making any court appearance today .
On Wednesday , The Sun-Times reported that the former governor would not be in town when the indictment was handed down as he had taken his family on a trip to Disney World .
The Sun-Times said that Blagojevich " checked into a resort earlier [ Wednesday ] and is expected to be at one of the theme parks [ Thursday} if an indictment comes down .
The timing of an out - of - town escape was likely no accident .
Blagojevich knew an indictment was likely to be returned this week because the grand jury had an April 7 deadline ( Tuesday ) to return it . "

*** Update 12/2/02 by Alex Mohr ***
Adrian Ilie has created a neat looking cartoon - style renderer using NPRQuake .
You can find the new renderer and lots of great information on how to use it from the project 's web page : http://www.cs.unc.edu/~adyilie/comp238/Final/Final.htm
*** Update 5/21/02 by Alex Mohr ***
Michael Olson has created binary and source packages for RedHat Linux 7.3 .
They are available from http://www.cs.odu.edu/~olson/linux.
Thanks Michael !
*** Update 2/9/02 by Alex Mohr ***
NPRQuake has been ported to the Mac !
There 's no fancy web page but you can download the code by following this link : http://homepage.mac.com/tigital/ .
Thanks to tigital for doing this port !
*** Update 1/29/02 by Alex Mohr ***
Jeremy Green has very kindly ported NPRQuake to Linux .
You can either grab the code on his page , or from right here .
NPRQuake.tar.gz
*** Update 5/13/01 by Alex Mohr ***
Seems NPRQuake has been discovered .
Just a small bit to address some common questions / comments .
First , a " get started quick " thing .
Download this into your quake directory , unzip it , and run nprquake .exe .
When the game comes up , bring down the console and type : " r_load sketch " without the quotes .
Also try " r_load bprint " and " r_load brush " .
To go back to the default , do " r_load dr_default " .
The Quick Info :
NPRQuake was a class project that we did back in the spring of 2000 in about two weeks .
Since then , nobody 's touched it . :)
Although we did get some research out of it .
You can see that here .
I appreciate comments and questions , so feel free to send them ( amohr@cs.wisc.edu ) ( no reply guarantees though .. ) .
If you have good things to say , you can send them to all of us .
If you have nasty things to say , you can take a deep breath and then calmly remind yourself that we wo n't care .
Bug reports and feature requests probably wo n't be honored because we 've all pretty much moved on .
However , someone else can certainly pick this up ( please do ! ) .
The source code is n't pretty ( hey , it was two weeks ! ) , but it 's all here and you can play with it .
Finally , since this source mod is network compatible with regular Quake , it can be used to cheat .
Please do n't .
Cheaters suck .
Bigtime .
Even playing with these renderers might be considered cheating by some , in the right circumstances .
Anyway , best of luck , and enjoy .

Taking a gigantic leap backwards , the crack staff of MBGH&D has concocted a Quake completely unknown to the current population of Earth .
Why the silly pencil sketch webpage ?
Why the ' npr ' before the word Quake ( at the top of the page , silly ) ?
Well I 'll tell you why ...
Do you remember that kid you sat next to in grade school ?
That one who could draw a nigh - perfect shoe in a matter of minutes ?
The one who everyone in the fifth grade thought would be the world 's best artist ?
Have you ever wondered what happened to that kid ?
You never saw his shoe - sketches after the fifth grade , and there 's a pretty darn good chance you never saw him after junior high .
We at MBGH&D finally have the answer to what happened to that poor soul ...
To put it bluntly , we have kidnapped him / her .
Yes folks , we have kidnapped - all - of those great pencil - sketchers from your collective past (s ) , and forced them to give us their sketching expertise .
We assure you , this measure was utterly necessary , as without the hundreds of " sketchers " ( we like to call them ) we would not have been able to draw so many lines for each frame in the world 's first , realtime , Non-PhotoRealistically - Rendered GLQuake .
( Took me long enough to get to the point , did n't it ? )
And , in case you were wondering , we 're not giving them back ...
Sincerely ,
M , B , G , H , and D .
( see ' who we are ' page to flame us for stealing your friends ... the final product was worth it though , do n't you think ? )
* Oh , and a special thanks to Planet Quake for the webpage inspiration ...
Ca n't sleep ...

From NetEase :
According to internet media reports :
On the morning of May 5th , a cremation ceremony in Taiwan was held for the three victims from last month ’s [ April ] 24th incident in Taipei where a crane smashed a mainland tour bus .
After the cremation , the family brought their ashes back to Guangdong .
The initial investigation results , the construction contractor compensated for each victim7,500,000 NT , which is over 1,800,000 yuan [ RMB ] .
Upon release of this news , it attracted a lot of attention online .
First was because the astronomical figure truly made mainland netizens sigh / sob , with some netizens even humorously saying : those who want to commit suicide , loan some money to go to TW ( sorry , those two words / characters are sensitive words ) to vacation , then wait under a crane to die , as this is the new age ’s “ waiting for good things to fall in your lap ” ; Second was because many netizens complained “ why is the death compensation for the mainland so little ?
When the railway hit and killed a person they only paid 200 yuan … ” ;
Third was because some netizens felt being born in mainland China was unfair , that even death was not worth anything …
Although netizens feelings are a little emotional , from another angle it shows that in mainland China , there are indeed many problems / issues regarding the value of life .
Coincidentally , similar things have happened at the beginning of 2008 .
In an explosion and large fire of a refrigerated logistics warehouse in Korea ’s Kyeonggi Province where 12 Chinese citizens died , the final agreement reached between the victim ’s family members and “ Korea Refrigeration [ ? ] ” was : “ Victims ’ families got at least 145 million WON to at most 480 million WON compensation , with an average compensation of 240 million WON ( about 1.95 million yuan RMB ) .
1.80 or 1.95 million , to the ordinary common people in China is definitely an astronomical figure .
According to present income standards / norms , over 80 % of China ’s married couples can struggle / work an entire life and , even without eating or drinking , not earn this amount .
Because of these two accidents , the moment the compensation agreements were announced , people in the country were shocked , and being saddened is already very normal .
However , apart from being shocked and saddened , combined with China ’s death compensation standards , people also could not help but be amazed and have many questions .
Not only is it surprise with the huge difference between the enormous sums of compensation compared to the standards of death compensation in mainland China , it is more the indignation seeing the difference in principles between how China and foreign countries treat death compensation , the difference in understanding the value of life , and also how China looks down upon and treats the lives of its own citizens !
China ’s death compensation , having changed over the years , at present , the highest limit is 400,000 .
Please note , there is a probem with a highest limit here because itself is an unbelievable thing .
The value of a life is supreme / paramount , intrinsically unable to be measured by money , which is also to say , the value of life should not be a highest limit problem .
Life is not merchandise , it should not be haggled over , and even less have a highest limit .
Instead , there should be the opposite regulation , which is to have only a lowest limit , and even without one , there should not be an upper limit standard .
The 400,000 upper limit , actually is us standardizing the value of our own citizens ’ lives , treating Chinese people like merchandise , whose lives have a price tag , and what more is a low price !
If this is not us insulting ( prostituting ) ourselves , then what is it ?
Moreover , how often do the families of victims get 400,000 in compensation ?
Just looking at “ 2007 ’s Shanxi Hongtong mine accident ” compensation , with such a large storm , such broad affects , with 104 coal miners dead , each victim ’s family only received 215,000 yuan .
The most exasperating and incredible is the railway department , which completely deviates from the country ’s unified standards and created its own system , unilaterally setting its own compensation standards .
Its compensation is based upon the State Council ’s 1979 document # 178 “ Provisions for accidents involving collisions between trains and other vehicles and railway staff casualties ” .
“ Provisions ” point out : “ The victim ’s families indeed will have difficuties , so the railway department at its discretion can give 80 - 150 yuan for cremation or burial expenses , and also at its discretion give a one - time relief payment of 100 - 150 yuan , but the patient ’s hospital food expenses mus be paid by the patient himself … ” no matter what the reason , even suicide , it will be these few hundred yuan compensation .
I bet even African refugees would mock Chinese people ’s cheap price !
However , this is how it is in China , and it continues to exist confidently !
Seriously speaking , the compensation amount TW and Korea gives Chinese victim family members in comparison to China is of course a lot more , but it is still far inferior whome compared to America and other even more developed countries .
However no matter what , their understanding and attitude towards the value of life is the same .
It is said , Chinese people who die in Korea are basically third - class citizens , also what is known as “ illegal workers ” .
However , in the process of compensation , Korea ’s company did not bring up their legal status issue , but treated them like other ordinary citizens , and compensated them as they would other ordinary citizens , because from their perspective , people are people .
On the other hand , let us again look at mainland China .
We ourselves have divided ourselves into various levels .
The cities and rural areas are not the same ; and the cities from different areas are also not the same .
The so - called “ after the Chinese people have stood up ” has been over 50 years now , all day shouting and screaming that everyone is equal , but now , even death compensation can be divided into various grades , so what face do we have to say everyone is equal ?
Mainland China ’s insult ( prostitution ) toward itself also directly encourages the citizens or oneself to disregard life .
How many news reports have there been of cars , after hitting people , repeatedly running them over [ to kill them ] ?
You cannot remember clearly , right ?!
Why does this kinda of tragic thing repeatedly happens in China ?
The reason is simple , because Chinese people ’s lives has an upper limit , and if they die , there is a standard for death so there is no need to worry .
If they are injured , and must receive ongoing care , that would be a bottomless pit …
If instead there were a lower limit provision , just like America and other developed democratic countries where every life must be compensated 1 million to 800,000 , even several million , I bet all drivers would know how to drive even without warnings .
Also , why is it that coal mine accidents keep happening ?
It is because the coal mine bosses who make huge amounts of money each day know very well that each life is only 400,000 and under and only a loss of a day ’s or even a few hour ’s profit .
So everyone , would they take safety seriously ?
Moreover , there are even more similar phenomenon …
Even more frustrating is that China ’s laws has reduced the worth of Chinese people ’s lives to less than animals !
Previously there was a new report in Xinjiang where a wild horse was accidentally hit and killed by a driver , and in the end the sentenced compensation amount was actually 810,000 !
It is not to say that wild horse is not worth that amount of money , nor is it to say that the driver should n’t have been sentenced to pay that much , but just like killing a giant panda , the price of 8 million would even be low .
What people find hard to understand is how could the value of human lives not be that high ?
How could human lives in China be inferior to animals ?
Another thing , as long as you are a foreigner who dies in China or dies riding a Chinese cargo vessel , it will immediately be in line with international standards , and huge differences immediately appear in the compensation standards !
Why is it that simply being born in China automatically means a cheap life ?
Yet foreigners are born automatically noble ?
Either way , foreigners look down upon us Chinese , and even act as if they are aggrieved .
Just take a look at China , we ourselves reducing the value of life , so what face do we have to still say anything ?
Indeed , in mainland China there are a lot of people , and the level of consumption is relatively low , so drawing up the compensation sums of developed countries is not very practical , but we still cannot stipulate an upper limit for compensation .
Stipulating an upper limit is essentially devaluing human life .
Seriously , seeing news about compensation similar to the TW crane crushing people and Korea ’s refrigerated warehouse explosion incidents , the first thought of this author first is :
If it is possible , I want to go to a place or country like Taiwan , Korea , America to die , because at least there is gain in dead … otherwise , it will be like that popular phrase on the internet — being born in China and also dying in China is truly a lot of misfortune !

It is because these who can go travel are all those who have money and power .
If you do not believe , go and search about these deceased people yourselves .
If they are not officials , they are bosses .
Their lives are expensive .
惊弓↑鸟 :
There is an even more traffic example , a car hit and killed three children , and it turns out that two had city hukous while one had a rural hukou .
The ones with city hukous were compensated over 200,000 each , but the rural hukou only got 40,000 .
This is the mysterious China …
我很Book14 :
First , let us see if what would happen if Chinese tourists at a mainland China tourist attraction suffered the same accident .
I bet the death compensations would be between 200,000 - 300,000 .
Yet Taiwan paid 1.8 million , which is 6 - 9 times the mainland ’s standards .
According to America ’s authoritative “ World Wealth Report ” , Taiwan ’s per capital income is already over 16,000 USD , but mainland China ’s per capita income is 2000 USD , which means Taiwan is 8 times more than mainland .
It is therefore easy to see that the compensation amount is determined in accordance with the per capita income and price index .
Taiwanese people ’s per capital income is 8 times the mainland ’s and death compensation is 6 - 9 times , very fair and reasonable , so where does the “ astronomical figure ” come from ?
If the lou zhu is envious , you can illegally immigrate to Taiwan before dying .
卧槽他吗 :
With so many Chinese people to go , more dying is no big deal , it will even alleviate the employment pressure and traffic congestion .
Some have to give way for others !

This is the lack of human rights problem that America often points at China for .

haotaiyang 12345 :
I do not understand what your point is .
When something like this happens , how much money can heal the wound ?
Money for the disabled / deceased is determined by so many factors :
The financial ability of the party responsible , the kindness of the responsible party ’s leadership , the level of importance to the government , the identity / social status of the victim , the government ’s relevant laws , and the human rights we scream about daily .
Which factor can determine how much the compensation should be ?
I personally believe , that the deceased is deceased , and so long as the family members get comfort / appeased it is good .
Everyone be well .
ppl666 :
Taiwanese people have said :
If Taiwanese people were united [ with China ] , the value of life would immediately drop N fold .
If it were you , would you do it ?
重庆一棒棒 :
Chongqing ’s newest compensation standards have been promulgated / released / announced .

Bullshit comparison !
You obviously know you live in the great socialist China , yet you still take things from the outside to compare compare compare !
Comparing bullshit , you TMD leave the country !
ayczq :
Not agreeing with some of your points , I personally believe :
1 . In most circumstances , a train hitting a person is the pedestrians responsibility , and the train should not have to compensate .
2 . On highways , when a car hits a person , it is also the pedestrian ’s responsibility , and the driver should not have to compensate .
This is not a problem of how much money , this is a problem of responsibility .
and it is not related to your discussion of compensation being higher outside of the country and low inside the country .
You should not have discussed the railway problem .

I get angry whenever I see these kind of posts , TMD Chinese people are not worth anything , living like dogs .

zhangrui_tr :
You think Guangdong tourists who can afford to go to Taiwan for vacation are only worth 1.8 million ?
I do not understand the victim ’s background , I speculate that the victims in the incident can at least earn 1.8 million a year .
I even feel they paid too little .

So pointless .

Yeah , us Chinese always put down ourselves .
When we do not respect ourselves , how can we raise our heads ?

daiyun1975 :
Hehe , all you know are what normal Chinese citizens are compensated .
I heard that some bureau - level leader from Hunan died while on a trip with his little secret [ mistress ] , his family was compensated with 1.2 million .
And it was considered dying in the line of duty .
( This is just something I heard .
I am not legally responsible . ]
bubiao -liao :
How can life be measured with money ?
The problem of compensation should be determined by regulations .
I personally hope this kind of thing will not happen to me .

Anthony Jourden remembers the vomiting , the days spent lying in bed when he could n't muster the energy to stay up .
Jourden 's first week of chemotherapy was the stuff bad dreams are made of -- nausea , shaking , depression , a three - day stint with no food .
" I was real pale and sickly looking , " said Jourden of Muskegon Township , who uses chemotherapy to treat a rare form of cancer that formed in his abdomen and resulted in small tumors forming on his liver .
If it was n't for medical marijuana , Jourden , 29 , does n't want to imagine what condition he would be in today .
" Without it , I would be skin and bones , " said Jourden , who has been undergoing chemotherapy since July 2008 .
" It kind of gave me a reason to get up in the morning to be honest with you . "
Despite a few rough patches on a path to implementation , medical marijuana patients are still praising the law that gives them the right to use the substance in peace .
" We 're very , very happy , " said Greg Francisco , executive director of the Michigan Medical Marijuana Association , who has been pushing to legalize medical marijuana for about 10 years .
As of May 28 , there were 1,188 Michigan residents who had received identification cards from the Michigan Department of Community Health certifying they legally could use medical marijuana , said James McCurtis , the department 's spokesman .
Applications are pending for another 2,144 Michigan residents who want to use medical marijuana , he said .
More than 280 applications have been denied .
Patients like Jourden praised the law .
He says three daily doses of marijuana gives him energy , an appetite , and eases his severe nausea .
" I just got a big old appetite and started sleeping better , " said Jourden , who started smoking medical marijuana shortly after beginning chemotherapy .
While medical marijuana has drawn praise from many , it still has plenty of critics .
The Michigan State Medical Society , an association of more than 15,000 Michigan physicians , opposed the proposal to legalize medical marijuana , said spokesman David Fox .
He says smoking is a health hazard , and there are no quality controls or regulations governing how much marijuana each patient should use .
" There 's no way to regulate dosage , " Fox said .
" We 're opposed to smoking in every other form and it did n't seem like a good idea . "
Studies on the benefits of medical marijuana also remain hazy .
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration , for example , says smoking marijuana is harmful and other , more - effective medications exist .
Others , such as the Michigan Nurses Association , support the substance , saying it's an effective treatment for patients suffering from cancer , Aids , and other debilitating medical conditions .
" Nurses across Michigan who are on the front lines of health care recognize that seriously ill patients should not face the threat of arrest and jail for simply following the advice of their doctor , " Michigan Nurses Association President Diane Goddeeris said in a statement .
Nurses point to a 1999 Institute of Medicine report that says " Nausea , appetite loss , pain and anxiety are all afflictions of wasting , and all can be mitigated by marijuana . "
Terri Jourden , Anthony 's mother , does n't need studies to know medical marijuana works .
All she has to do is look at her son .
" If it was n't for marijuana , I think he would be skinny as a rail , " she said .

Hit musical The Producers , which features a chorus line of goose - stepping Nazis , is being staged in Germany for the first time .
The show is taking place in a theatre once frequented by Adolf Hitler .
Steve Rosenberg reports from Berlin .
That 's the bottom line .
Seat Al Franken and give him his committee assignments now , or we 'll block a new organizing resolution that would let you reassign Specter 's previously Republican committee seats to one of your own .
Until a new organizing resolution is adopted , Specter 's committee seats ( Appropriations , Judiciary , Veterans ' Affairs , Environment & Public Works , Special Aging ) are locked in .
He 'll be caucusing and ( sometimes , anyway ) voting as a Democrat , but will be occupying Republican seats .
Democrats should demand Republican agreement to seat Franken and give him his committee assignments now , or they 'll just block a new organizing resolution until he arrives , and change it as they see fit later on .
After all , with 60 Democrats ( once Franken is finally seated ) , they can give themselves any ratios they want , whether they opt to remain true to the 60/40 split in the Senate or not , since there wo n't be enough votes to filibuster an unfair organizing resolution .
But we would n't want it to come to that , would we ?
Until there 's a change , Appropriations goes effectively from 17 - 13 in favor of Democrats to 18 - 12 .
Judiciary to 12 - 7 . Environment to 12 - 7. Veterans ' Affairs to 10 - 5 . Special Aging to 12 - 7 .
I guess we could wait if we had to .
Those are mostly ratios we should be getting once Franken is seated anyway , even without exceeding the ratio of Democrats to Republicans in the body as a whole .
So it 's not even like we 're taking any more unfair advantage in doing this than Republicans are by denying Franken his seat .
( Photo of crazy expensive Kindle DX courtsey of Amazon.com )
The internet is having a very public love affair with Amazon 's Kindle DX .
So let 's cut through the foreplay , and get right to it .
Will the $ 489 Kindle DX replace the textbook for Gen Y ?
All the buzz has been about how the Kindle DX is going to replace the textbook and how it's the future for college campuses everywhere .
Mashable reports that Princeton , UVA , Case Western , Arizona State , and Reed College are all onboard with the Kindle DX and helping to digitize textbooks .
While I 'm all for digital textbooks , since textbooks are hugely inconvenient , we need to address the numbers first .
To get some other insights , I opened this topic up to HARO and to Twitter .
Two of my responses were quite interesting ( and polarizing at the same time ) :
Tim Lytle writes : " With a not quite a year old daughter , I think about what her education will be like .
I would n't be surprised if she had most of her ' books ' on a Kindle , and did most of her work on a tablet pc styled netbook or a ' smart ' pen ( the livescribe ) .
The technology exists today , and it will only get better , more portable , and more accessible .
Sure , maybe it wo n't be the ' Kindle ' from Amazon that she uses - it will probably be something even more integrated , more ' natural ' .
Maybe something like a netbook with a second screen instead of a keyboard .
She 'll use it as a laptop with one touch screen displaying a keyboard .
She 'll use it as her book , flipping it 90 degrees to view two pages .
She 'll lay it flat and grab a stylus to take notes or work on her art project .
As for cost ?
Ask any college student if they 'd rather pay $ 500 once then $ 10 / ebook , or buy all paper books .
Of course , textbook publishers wo n't be happy , but there 's a change growing in that field as well . "
Kit Yarrow , Consumer Psychologist and Professor of Business at Golden Gate University writes :
" What Gen Yers will love most is the mobility .
They lead active lives and are famous for multi-tasking .
I think the idea that they could snatch a few minutes of reading in anytime will appeal to them .
Those texts are weighty in more ways than one .
The problem lies in their ability to buy used texts via Kindle .
Now that they have multiple online resources available to them many college students are circumventing their college bookstores in favor of less expensive options . "
Tim and Kit bring up an interesting point - costs associated with adoption .
Kit says that the abundance of online resources for buying and selling textbooks drive the cost of textbooks down already and that the inability to resell texts via the Kindle is a deterrent to adoption , while Tim brings up the idea that if the ebooks are cheap enough , it 'll increase adoption rates .
So Let 's look at the numbers :
The National Association of College Stores conducted a study that found that students spend on average $ 702 / year on textbooks .
This equates to a total expense of $ 2808 on textbooks over a 4 year college experience .
It is also important to note that e-books are already available and contrary to popular belief , textbooks will not be $ 10 – publishers and authors still want their share .
E- books were generally around 70 % of the price of the regular print textbooks at the college bookstore and could not be sold back ( Looking at the UO bookstore , MKTG 420 Section : 41830 has their required book ISBN : 9780132224154 for sale at $ 159.75 new , $ 120 Used , $ 95.75 e-book .
The e-book is 60 % of the new price and 80 % of the used price , or an average of 70 % )
Also important to note , is that the website states that an e-book can only be downloaded once , and will be auto - deleted after 150 days .
The Kindle :
1 Kindle DX = $ 489
Yearly E- Book expenses = $ 491.4 /yr ( 70 % of the yearly $ 702 average )
$ 491.4 x 4 years = $ 1965.6 + $ 489 for the Kindle
= $ 2454.6 for four years of e-books and a Kindle DX
The Traditional Textbook
$ 702 ( avg cost / year ) x 4 years = $ 2808
Given the alternative online resources for reselling textbooks , ( Amazon.com , half.com , eBay.com , or simply selling them to my friends ) I was on average able to recoup 40 - 60 % of what I paid for my textbooks .
For argument 's sake , let 's average that out at 50 % .
If I 'm able to make 50 % back when I resell books at the end of the term I get :
$ 2808 x 50 % = $ 1404
Total cost of traditional textbooks over four years =
$ 1404
Total difference in cost over 4 years between traditional textbooks and a Kindle DX : $ 1050.60
While the Kindle DX may be slim and sexy , I 'm pretty sure that any college student on a strapped budget is going to elect to carry their heavy books if it means saving $ 1 K .
Moreover , according to the National Association of College Stores , 26 % of students said they usually pay for course materials with scholarships and grants .
If the Kindle DX is n't can't be purchased with scholarship money ( like some high - end electronics , i.e. computers ) then the DX has even more pit against it .
Most importantly , you can buy a pretty sweet netbook for $ 489 which has way more functionality than a Kindle DX .
Or alternatively , buy 489 rounds of drinks at Dollar Beer nights … just sayin .

La televisión húngara transmitió una entrevista inédita con Eduardo Rózsa Flores en la que se revelan los planes de su presencia en Bolivia : declarar la independencia de la región de Santa Cruz del resto del territorio boliviano .
" Estamos preparados para declarar en pocos meses la independencia y crear un nuevo país " , reconoce Rózsa Flores en la entrevista divulgada el martes .
Rózsa Flores fue abatido por la policía boliviana el pasado 16 de abril en un hotel de la ciudad de Santa Cruz en lo que el gobierno boliviano llamó una " operación antiterrorista " .
Junto a él - que tenía nacionalidad boliviana , húngara y croata- , murieron un ciudadano irlandés y un militar rumano .
Además , fueron detenidos un ingeniero húngaro y un militar boliviano - croata .
Lea : Rózsa Flores , de Santa Cruz a Croacia
La entrevista por el canal estatal húngaro MTV fue concedida en septiembre de 2008 al periodista Andras Kepes .
Rózsa Flores le dijo a Kepes que sus declaraciones sólo se podían transmitir si " le pasaba algo " .
El gobierno boliviano asegura que los planes del grupo presuntamente liderado por Rózsa Flores incluían el asesinato del presidente Evo Morales .
El caso está generando una polémica internacional , ya que los gobiernos de Irlanda , Hungría , Rumania y Croacia le han pedido explicaciones a La Paz por la muerte y detención de sus ciudadanos .
Este martes , Morales calificó de " muy grave " que algunos de estos países intenten defender a los que han sido calificados de mercenarios internacionales .
" ¿Cómo semejante gente que viene aquí a atentar hasta ( contra el ) presidente va a ser defendida ?
Es muy grave , yo puedo pensar que ellos entonces son los que han mandado acá a atentar contra la democracia " , se preguntó el mandatario .
' Independencia '
En la entrevista , Rózsa Flores hace referencia a la situación política boliviana y manifiesta sus planes .
" La situación va empeorándose y se temen actos violentos en el país " , afirma y agrega que su meta era " declarar la independencia de Santa Cruz , con métodos pacíficos , pero mostrando fuerza " .
He sido llamado para organizar la defensa de la ciudad y la provincia de Santa Cruz Eduardo Rózsa Flores
Santa Cruz y otras tres regiones de Bolivia han insistido en sus reclamos de autonomía , lo que ha llevado a un fuerte enfrentamiento con el gobierno central boliviano .
En la entrevista , Flores asegura que " se teme que el gobierno ataque la provincia " de Santa Cruz .
Por ello , dice Rózsa Flores , " he sido llamado para organizar la defensa de la ciudad y la provincia de Santa Cruz " y luego añade " esto no se trata de que iré a la selva boliviana a ser el Che Guevara " .
Rózsa Flores no especifica quién fue a " llamarlo " , lo que ha generado especulaciones en Bolivia .
En la entrevista , Rózsa Flores dice que su misión en Bolivia tenía un fundamento " legal " .
" No estoy yendo para atacar La Paz o para organizar un ataque a la capital o para derrocar al presidente ...
Tenemos que organizar la defensa , la resistencia " , dice Rózsa Flores .
Rózsa Flores tiene un largo historial de participación en movimientos de derecha , desde el Opus Dei a una milicia paramilitar durante los primeros años del conflicto en los Balcanes , en la década del '90 .
Oposición
Por su parte , la derecha opositora en Bolivia negó tener vínculos con el supuesto complot contra la vida del presidente Evo Morales .
Autoridades del bastión de la oposición en el departamento de Santa Cruz dijeron que no tienen ninguna relación con el grupo .
Además , los líderes de la derecha pidieron una investigación internacional sobre la muerte de los tres hombres .
" Censuramos la tendenciosa actitud de altas autoridades nacionales de intentar vincular a los líderes de la institucionalidad cruce ña con estos hechos de violencia " , declaró el prefecto de Santa Cruz , Rubén Costas , al leer un comunicado de autoridades y líderes cívicos y empresariales de la región .
Desde La Paz , la colaboradora de la BBC Mery Vaca destacó que el vicepresidente Álvaro García Linera había manifestado que los cabecillas del grupo son ciudadanos bolivianos y acusó a algunos empresarios de estar involucrados en actividades irregulares .
Vaca agregó que el Palacio de Gobierno anunció que reforzará la seguridad de Morales , quien junto a García Linera , estarían encabezando la lista de personalidades que estaban en la mira de los presuntos delincuentes .

My results are rather unscientific , but I invite you to do your own probing and see what you come up with .
My approach was simple .
I did a series of 6 searches for specific words and phrases and took note of how old the last post on the first page was .
There are always 15 entries on the front page .
Thus , the age of the last entry gives you a concept of how often the word is used .
If the last entry is 3 hours old , that means the word or phrase is used about 15 times in 3 hours .
Simple enough .
Lets begin .
Search for “ misogyny ” : 15th result was 21 hours old .
Search for “ misandry ” : 15th result was 25 days old .
Search for “ I hate women ” : 15th result was 3 days old .
Search for “ I hate men ” : 15th result was 1 day old .
Search for “ women suck ” : 15th result was 5 days old .
Search for “ men suck “ : 15th result was 1 day old .
Note : Love Added 4/14/09 for reflection :
Search for “ I love women ” : 15th result was 5 days old .
Search for “ I love men “ : 15th result was 1 day old .
So the spread between the use of “ misogyny ” and “ misandry ” is huge .
The term “ misogyny ” is used considerably more frequently .
However , open expressions of hatred towards men were significantly more frequent than expressions of hatred towards women .
There definitely seems to be some kind of imbalance here .
Conclusion :
While there is a significantly higher use of the term related to woman - hating , there ’s more evidence supporting the occurrence of man-hating .
Why I Did This
My introduction to the term Misogyny came from an interaction with a girl .
We were having a conversation on dating etiquette .
I brought up a common question I often ask during that type of discussion .
“ If a woman is seeking a relationship and a man is seeking a sexual experience , assuming the women has not expressed her intentions , and assuming she never explicitly asks , is the man responsible for expressing his intentions before a sexual act happens ? ”
I know , asking a question like that is asking for trouble .
However , it also exposes a lot of important personality information you may want to know before dating someone .
Her response was that the man has the responsibility of expressing his intention because , when it came to what the woman wanted , “ he should know better . ” I thought this was unbalanced .
I felt the woman should be responsible for verifying that the man ’s intentions matched hers before choosing to sleep with him .
That was about the time she called me a Misogynist .
I had to go look the word up .
That was years ago .
It set a bit of a negative connotation to the term for me .
Now , I keep seeing the word used .
I just ran into the word again , on Discover Magazine of all places .
The author brought the word up while citing unwanted compliments .
It kicked up a few emotions in me .
I ’ve heard that word so much lately , and I find it a bit frustrating to see it used , so often , in a context that I believe is unwarranted .
The spark of frustration motivated me a bit .
Hence , this post .

If
reports coming out of Brazil
are accurate , an abortion performed against the unborn baby of nine - year - old rape / incest victim has resulted in the declared
excommunication
of the doctors who committed the abortion * (
1983 CIC 1398
) and of those who directly assisted in the deed (
1983 CIC 1329
) .
The mother of the aborted baby * ( the term " mother " hardly seems to make sense here ) was not excommunicated for a number of reasons , but her age alone would have been sufficient to prevent her incurring any penalty (
1983 CIC 1323
) .

Houston Chronicle :
A North Texas legislator during House testimony on voter identification legislation said Asian - descent voters should adopt names that are “ easier for Americans to deal with . ”
The comments caused the Texas Democratic Party on Wednesday to demand an apology from state Rep. Betty Brown , R - Terrell .
But a spokesman for Brown said her comments were only an attempt to overcome problems with identifying Asian names for voting purposes .
The exchange occurred late Tuesday as the House Elections Committee heard testimony from Ramey Ko , a representative of the Organization of Chinese Americans .
Ko told the committee that people of Chinese , Japanese and Korean descent often have problems voting and other forms of identification because they may have a legal transliterated name and then a common English name that is used on their driver ’s license on school registrations .
Brown suggested that Asian - Americans should find a way to make their names more accessible .
“ Rather than everyone here having to learn Chinese — I understand it ’s a rather difficult language — do you think that it would behoove you and your citizens to adopt a name that we could deal with more readily here ? ”
Brown said .
Brown later told Ko : “ Ca n’t you see that this is something that would make it a lot easier for you and the people who are poll workers if you could adopt a name just for identification purposes that ’s easier for Americans to deal with ? ”

We get a lot of press releases from companies big and small touting their green initiatives .
I usually dismiss the ones from major corporations like Disney and Barbie as greenwashing , but I still pass them on to our writers .
After much prodding and persuading from my online friends , I usually take up the issue myself , as I just ca n’t help myself .
Disney ….it ’s your turn .
Disney has just issued the company ’s first ever comprehensive corporate responsibility ( CR ) report .
For a company that was founded in the 1920s and is the largest media and entertainment corporation in the world , this report is a long time overdue !
The long term environmental goals outlined in the report are :
Zero waste
Zero net direct greenhouse gas emissions from fuels
Reduce indirect greenhouse gas emissions from electricity consumption
Net positive impact on ecosystems
Minimize water use
Minimize product footprint
Inform , empower and activate positive action for the environment
These are great goals , but what do they mean ?
When such goals are accompanied by statements like , “ While Disney has always been a leader in environmental stewardship , we are taking ambitious steps to help preserve our planet for future generations , ” said Disney Senior Executive Vice President and CFO Thomas O. Staggs , the red flag starts waving !
If Disney is such a leader in environmental stewardship , how come this is their first CR report ever ?
The Orlando Sentinel reports :
For example , Disney ’s two cruise ships in 2006 generated nearly 270,000 tons of “ carbon - dioxide equivalents , ” a measure of the various gases thought to contribute to climate change .
The two ships , which sail out of Port Canaveral , accounted for 48 percent of Disney ’s companywide emissions of 566,000 tons for the year .
Yep , long record of environmental stewardship for sure !
What about the six figures of energy consumed and garbage generated at Disney theme parks annually ?
Disney has also pledged to move towards green and chemical free cleaning , but the Center for Health , Environment & Justice thinks they can do better :
Disney World just released its first Corporate Responsibility Report but leaves us wondering —
“ Why does n’t it include a comprehensive section on the reduction of hazardous cleaning chemicals ” ?
The report does make strong commitments towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions and water conservation , which we feel is extremely important for all businesses .
Top 5 Reasons Disney World Can Do Better 1 . Discuss eliminating toxic chemicals holistically and embrace the precautionary principle in its over arching goals ; 2 . Guests and potential guests should be able to easily access cleaning product information online and through written materials within Disney ’s property ; 3 . List and set goals to eliminate hazardous chemicals of concern such as reproductive toxins and endocrine disruptors ; 4 . Provide concrete timelines , regular chemical assessments , and benchmarks that will lead to safer parks and resorts ; and 5 .
Show preference to independent third party certified products .
Granted , Disney did purchase 8,500 acres of the Everglades ’ headwaters to create The Nature Conservancy ’s Disney Wilderness Preserve in 1993 , but in the large scheme of things , does this mitigate the overconsumerism associated with Disney brands ?
Does it undo the abandoned cruise ship destination Treasure Island in the Abaco Islands , where the company left hazardous materials , electrical transformers , and fuel tanks , as well as introduced invasive alien species of plants and insects that threaten the natural flora and fauna of the island ?
I guess my greenwashing skepticism stems from the fact I cannot connect what I have seen at Disneyland itself and what I have read in the CR report .
Yes , I succumbed to the pressure of parenting and the effort to provide my children with a “ normal ” childhood by visiting Disneyland once .
I was shocked at the entry free of $ 69.00 and disgusted by the walk down Main Street stores selling overpriced Disney paraphenalia as you enter and exit the park .
I tried a veggie burger that was disgusting , and I had to buy a $ 40 pair of sweatpants for my son when he had an accident ( this was the cheapest pair of pants in the park ! ) .
As I watched little girls adorned in princess costumes , I felt like I was in Vegas .
At Disneyland , it is all about money .
There was nothing that spoke to me about environmental stewardship .
Even the recycled toilet to tap water served at the park was not advertised ( I wonder why ? ) .
Disney , I hope you really will go green .
I do n’t want to hear any more excuses or promises :
During the coming year , we ’ll begin the process of estimating the magnitude of the footprint resulting from product - related activities .
In coming years , Disney intends to engage suppliers and licensees in a collaborative drive to reduce the environmental footprint of Disney merchandise .
The sheer volume of products and intermediate parties , as well as the absence of firmly established protocols for determining the environmental impact of products in an unambiguous manner for all possible combinations of materials , are daunting issues associated with this goal .
Make it happen , then maybe I can visit your park again without experiencing eco-guilt .
Remove the overconsumerism associated with your brand ; we do n’t need a cup , t- shirt , stuffed animal , etc. for every character from every movie .
Corporate responsibility goes beyond issuing a report and sending press releases to bloggers .
Stop selling junk , stop using chemicals , only use recyclables , put a solar bank in the parking lot of all theme parks that could provide shelter for cars , create more green spaces in the parks , serve organic food , offer free park admission to people that ride mass transit , stop violating human rights in factories that produce your goods , etc .
Disney , you have a long way to go before being green !

Video : Lost robot
Robots are getting better at finding their way around unknown areas , and making their own maps as they explore .
But robots lost in urban areas do n’t need to rely on their own faculties to get from place to place , German roboticists have shown .
Their mobile robot simply rolls up to any humans nearby and asks for directions .
By using that strategy , their robot has become one of the first to be properly let loose in the real world , not just carefully controlled environments .
Martin Buss ‘s team at the Technical University of Munich dumped their mobile robot outside the university and instructed it to find its way to the Marienplatz in the centre of Munich , some 1.5 kilometres away .
Help and hindrance
The robot – called ACE for Autonomous City Explorer – lacks an inbuilt map of Munich or a GPS system .
Like a lost human in a similar situation , all it could do was ask for directions .
Advertisement
ACE uses cameras and software to detect humans nearby , based on their motion and upright posture .
As it closes in on a likely helper , ACE ’s “ head ” – bearing a touchscreen and a second screen displaying an animated mouth – turns to face the chosen person .
A speaker working in sync with the animated mouth is used to get the person ’s attention and to ask them to touch the screen if they want to help .
Willing guides are then asked to point the robot in the correct direction , with the response being analysed by posture recognition software .
Direction set , ACE says “ thank you ” before trundling off .
That way
Pointing , rather than telling the robot where to go , avoids confusion caused by the fact that the robot and the facing pedestrian each have a different sense of left and right .
Although it interacted with 38 people over a period of nearly five hours – ACE did eventually reach its destination .
In fact , the team report that the robot was making very good progress until it reached a busy pedestrian area where its own popularity became a problem .
ACE had interacted with just 12 people before that point , but 21 curious passersby stopped to talk to the robot as it crossed the busy pedestrian zone .
Only once was ACE given the wrong directions , eventually having to stop due to obstacles after which it asked someone else for help , who put it back on course .
“ In theory the robot has to continue on its incorrect path until it needs new information , ” says team member Andrea Bauer , “ this is why we are currently working on a system to check the information from humans for plausibility . ”
‘ Way to go ’
Paul Newman , a roboticist at the University of Oxford in the UK , is impressed with the new study .
“ It ’s absolutely the way to go , ” he says .
Navigating a changing environment can be a complicated cognitive task , and “ invoking humans when appropriate ” could be a relatively simple way for robots to meet the challenge .
Earlier this year , Newman ’s team showed that the sophisticated image recognition system developed for their robots could recognise places it had been before even when a scene changed – when parked cars appeared or disappeared , for example .
The Oxford group has just commenced a European - wide project that will attempt to have robots interact more naturally with populated environments .
The Munich study is an example of the kind of solutions they will consider , Newman says .
“ Robots use mathematics internally to navigate , but that ’s not the way you want them to relate to people cohabiting with a machine , ” he says .
“ If there ’s a building on fire you do n’t want to give a fireman a robot - drawn map or a mathematical model , you want to say : ‘ down the corridor , third door on right ’ . ”
Teaching map - making robots to communicate in human terms will make them ready for use in the real world , he says .

The Republicans are like the gang that could n't shoot straight .
They 've been attacking Colin Powell ever since he put a voice to some of his complaints about the GOP .
Who is America siding with in this debate ?
CNN 's new poll says : Colin Powell .
As Colin Powell fires back against Dick Cheney and Rush Limbaugh in the latest skirmish in the battle over the future of the Republican Party , a new national poll indicates that Americans have a much more favorable opinion of Powell than Cheney or Limbaugh .
The CNN / Opinion Research Corporation survey , released Monday , suggests that 70 percent have a favorable opinion of Powell , who was Secretary of State during President George W. Bush 's first term , and who served as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the Persian Gulf War .
Only 30 percent of those polled have a favorable view of Limbaugh , the popular conservative radio talk show host , with 53 percent saying they hold an unfavorable opinion .
In poll numbers released Thursday , 37 percent say they have a favorable opinion of Dick Cheney , with 55 percent indicating they hold an unfavorable view of the former vice president .
I have n't seen a poll including Karl Rove , but outside of his FOX audience , his numbers would be in the basement and he too hates Colin Powell :
WALLACE : Dick Cheney said if it ’s a battle between or a choice between Rush Limbaugh and Colin Powell , he sides with Limbaugh .
You ?
ROVE : I -- yes , if I had to pick between the two .
But you know what ?
That ’s -- neither one of those are candidates .
Neither one of those are going to be people who are offering themselves for office .
I 'm no fan of Colin , the role he played to persuade American that we should attack Iraq will never be forgotten , but it 's interesting to see the GOP rip themselves apart .
Here 's Colin Powell on Face the Nation :
" You can only do two things with a base .
You can sit on it and watch the world go by , or you can build on it .
I believe we should build on it . "
- Colin Powell today on " Face The Nation , " responding to Dick Cheney 's comment that he would choose Rush Limbaugh over Colin Powell .
At this point , only the most extreme right wingers will get any kind of support from their base so I 'd like to thank them .
Keep up the good work !
The possibility that Girl Guides of Canada will drop any reference to religion from its all - important Guiding Promise is drawing an angry response from parents , who have taken to Facebook to debate the issue .
" This speaks to people 's fundamental values , and I think that 's why it 's touched a nerve , " says Louise Simos , whose 9 - year - old daughter Alexandra is a Girl Guide in Toronto .
Discussion began almost immediately on a Girl Guides Facebook page late last week after a survey on the promise arrived in the homes of Guiding leaders and families .
Parents from across Canada soon joined the debate , almost universally condemning the survey for containing no option to keep God or faith in the promise .
Chief commissioner Myrtle Corkum said polling found Guiding is seen by most Canadians as a predominantly Christian group .
" We were not viewed as inclusive as we thought we were . "
So the group began reviewing its programs , and launched the survey to gauge how members view the promise and its role , Corkum said .
The current promise includes the line , " To be true to myself , my God and Canada . "
Girls can replace the word " God " with " faith . " if they like .
Simos , who has been involved with Guiding since she was a Brownie and served as a district commissioner , wants the reference to God or faith to remain , but can accept removing religious references if that 's what most want .
She 's upset , however , that the survey sent does not explicitly allow for keeping a faith - based option .
" There 's a large number of Guiders who think this is an important part of what Guiding is all about , " Simos said .
" Their voices need to be at least acknowledged . "
The promise was last changed 15 years ago to remove reference to the Queen , prompting the Monarchist League of Canada to call for a boycott of Girl Guide cookies .
Less noticed was the softening of religious references in the promise to give girls the choice between saying " God " or " faith . "
Last week 's survey asks respondents to choose between two new versions of the line , neither of which makes any reference to religion or faith , or a third option to choose neither .
Simos said choosing " neither " is n't good enough .
The impression given by the survey 's set - up , she said , it that people are expected to pick one of the two versions that are spelled out .

Corkum , stressing that no decision has been made on final wording , said the survey also asks respondents to rate the importance several possible passages , including , " Being true to your beliefs . "

Occasionally a bored business publication , goes to the zoo , rents a monkey and pits him or her against a mutual fund manager .
Lo and behold the monkey who does n't know a beta from a bunghole beats a significant majority of the active managers .
Barron 's should probably create a yearly Monkey Roundtable
These Journalists must be pretty good monkey pickers and should probably start a MFoF ( Monkey Fund of Funds ) charging 2 % and 20 % .
We are the Third Chimpanzee and it seems as if evolution must have robbed us of our stock picking skills , but boy can we pick monkeys .
So what is going on ?
Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett both hint at it in various writings and books , my favorite is Charlie 's Poor Charlie 's Almanack .
Warren calls it de-worsification , or the fact that many portfolios get worse as more components are added to them .
The theory which he pretty well proves via his actions is that the more holdings you have the less likely you are to know a lot about any of them .
He does n't say it , but most managers also jump the median , the investment equivalent of jumping the shark .
Buffet and Munger both hint at investing being similar to paremutuel betting .
The reason mean monkeys beat median jumping clowns is that most fund managers really do n't understand the sustainable economic value drivers behind the businesses they invest in and therefore can't allocate well at the individual equity level .
Mean Monkey 's picked by journalists have one of the key behavioral principals in investing ; ignorance .
They do n't know or even pretend to know anything .
Stock returns as exhibited on page 73 of Meb Faber 's great new book , The Ivy Portfolio shows the problem .
Stock returns are log normally distributed having fat tails .
The charts are sourced from Blackstar funds and reflect data from 1983 - 2007 .
The Mean Ignorant Monkeys .
I tell my wife that ignorance and apathy are key investment traits , she just rolls her eyes .
Put another way , know what you do n't know and be patient , activity kills in this game .
Ignorant Mean Monkeys beat funds because they allocate naively , ie equally in their portfolios .
God forbid the monkey 's start running mean variance optimizers or the game is over .
Mean variance portfolio allocation is probably one of the most costly rear view mirrors of all time .
Suppose , that out of the Universe of 8,000 equities above Mr. Mean Monkey takes on Mr. or Ms. Median jumping manager by throwing his darts .
Most of the these competitions stop right there .
Rarely do the journalists ask the monkey about next quarters earnings projections or where the Dow will be next week .
The Monkey 's bets are spread equally across the selected equities and the race with the clowns is on .
The clowns performance is usually measured by their funds returns .
The Monkeys should perform roughly the same as a naive ( unweighted ) index with a small cap bias .
Why ?
The monkeys are simply taking a random sample of the markets , so the returns should be roughly equivalent to the chart above .
The smaller cap bias will reflect the greater number of smaller cap firms present in any sampled universe of investable firms .
Imagine that from the 8,000 stocks the monkey selects 8 .
One could think of the chart above broken into 8 bins .
That is what the monkey 's return will equate to .
The monkey is an approximate unbiased sample of the market .
Send in the median jumping Clowns .
The active fund manager " median jumper " clown does the same thing with his or her 8 picks , ideas , gambles , allocations or whatever glossy euphemism he or she , uses in their marketing literature .
But the clown is at a disadvantage because they do n't know what they do n't know , so they decide to weight the portfolio according to the " best " picks .
Uh oh , here is where the trouble starts , they just jumped the median and probably picked something closer to the mode , the most commonly occurring sample .
The median is not the mean .
The statistical mean is what most people consider the average of returns .
More importantly is the median and mode , the most likely sample to be chosen and the number separating the higher and lower half of the sample .
It works like this .
You and 7 of your friends find yourself in a room playing bridge with Bill Gates and Warren Buffet .
The mean ( average ) net worth of the individuals in the room is measured in the billions , but you do n't feel any richer because most likely you are one of the 8 representing the mode or most common sample in the room which is below the median and the mean .
The median and mode for share 's returns is actually well below the cap weighted index which is closer to the mean .
The charts above indicate 64 % of shares under perform the index .
This means that managers who " tilt " or weight their portfolio to their best idea are statistically taking a random sample and doing bad things , increasing the odds of picking a sub - index performer and in so doing also diminishing the allocations to the potentially significantly positive outliers that help deliver the mean performance .
This is classic behavior flaw 101 , people with more information believe they know more about something .
So the fund manager takes the useless sell side research reports , technical analysis and other hocus pocus that they have n't back tested or thought and parks a few more chips on red .
Few managers really understand businesses .
Not many money managers have actually run a competitive business and understand the dynamics of a " market for goods and services " .
When it comes to fund management and equity selection , I will bet on a humble person who has run a successful small business over somebody who can tell me what they think the Fed is doing .
Stock " business " selection skills are different from macro economic analysis and best learned by doing .
People straight from school and fed into the investment banking world are put into an environment that demand answers even when there any .
Smart people who do n't have answers or admit ignorance get weeded out .
This is an environment rarely interested in posing interesting new questions which is a far more interesting and important skill requiring imagination .
Even Buffet ran a gas station into the ground and probably learned as much from it as his Columbia MBA .
Transaction and operational costs etc. also injure manager returns .
This is the case of apathy / patience proving things out .
Fund managers are like trapped animals .
They get caught , then get nervous and waste energy trading and allocating instead of sitting quietly and thinking about what the dynamics of the game they play truly are .
My suggestion shut off the screen and blackberry and go fishing etc. for awhile and reflect , maybe a few answers will pop into your head , if you are truly lucky a profound question will arise .
The well known reality is that most fund managers underperform a passive representative index .
Managers do n't know what they do n't know .
They are often in the giving answers business as they rise from analysts to portfolio managers , some are just great salesman stock brokers .
Cramer is the worst public example of an analyst gone wild .
He is a bottomless pit of useless answers filling the airwaves to pimp cars , cereal and pills for CNBC .
Felix Salmon has his own equivalent answer hole in Ben Stein .
An answer hole ( my term ) is a bottomless pit where questions are thrown in and answers are always on offer .
The only thing not found in the answer hole is an honest phrase such as " I do n't know . "
Most Mutual Fund Managers could significantly increase their long term performance with an equivalent naive asset allocation across the board and less activity , assuming they have a random sample .
They could at least aspire to mean monkey performance and still get the fun of throwing darts while causing less harm .
$ 6.24 Trillion dollars of clown self delusion
For fun take a look at your funds top few holdings ideally representing 80 % of the portfolio , and allocate them equally .
You might find that a Mean Monkey portfolio approach beat your managers median jumping .
Calling mutual fund managers clowns may be rough , but if a $ 26 trillion industry under performs the Naive approach by 1.0 % and the average fund has expenses of 1.4 % that means you or your pension fund loses $ 26 trillion x 2.4 % =
$ 624 billion a year playing the fund game .
The label clown does n't seem to harsh and is more fun and light hearted than the anger going around these days .
Over 10 years that lost clown value would equate to $ 6.24 trillion , not including opportunity costs and compounding .
Send in the Monkeys !
Figures like that sound almost stimulating do n't they ?
( groan inducing macro pun intended :)
Hedgies lost 18 % on average in 2008 which beat most indexes by 20 % and blew away most mutual fund managers .
Please note the even with the Madoff 's etc. in aggregate the Hedgies who have light regulation outperformed the highly regulated mutual fund industry scam .
If I wrote the pension laws .
I would limit the allocations to active mutual fund managers significantly .
I have a crude outline for a book called Circus economics & investing , it is all about how economics and investing works .
It will have stories about monkey 's , clowns , 3 ringed circuses , yield totters , horse races , magic tax tricks and leveraged tight ropes describing how life works under the lights in the big tent we call capitalism .
I have also developed some nice " naive " parameterless algorithms for swap spreads , rates , volatilty etc. with +3.0 sharpe ratios if there are any interested hedgies out there .
If you have a large equity portfolio , I offer a portfolio risk elimination service which makes a recommendation on which of your top 10 holding to eliminate in order to boost returns .
Horses are increasingly being used rather than machines to log land as traditional forestry skills make a comeback
Ella , a 16 - hand Percheron mare , is pulling a felled piece of wood weighing around a tonne out of dense brambles and woodland near Bosbury , Herefordshire .
Her handler , Doug Joiner , chairman of British Horse Loggers , quietly guides her massive footsteps through difficult terrain .
" Gee off ... come here , " he calls .
The commands sound like those at sheepdog trials , and Ella is as responsive as any trained dog .
At Joiner 's instruction , she steps over logs into thick undergrowth .
He guides her , on long reins , with calls and subtle commands into an area of fir trees that is slowly being cleared .
Then he attaches a 12 ft - long fir trunk to a chain , gives the command , and Ella strides downhill , dragging the enormous trunk as if it were a matchstick .
After an hour , they have cleared half a dozen similar - sized trees , ready to be turned into planks .
Ten years ago , it would have been rare to have seen anyone working the woods with horses , but it is becoming more and more common as landowners and foresters learn to appreciate its benefits .
The ancient art of horse logging , which dates back 10,000 years , nearly died out during the 1980s as machines took over .
By the mid-80s , there were only three full - time horse loggers left in the country .
Today , there are 15 full - time horse loggers in the UK , and up to 1,000 people working part - time .
Such is the demand for the skills that a new apprenticeship scheme was launched at the end of last year , backed and partly funded by the Prince of Wales , who has used horse logging on the Duchy estate in Cornwall .
Joiner frowns at the idea of using a quad bike or tractor .
" Horses do n't damage the environment , " he says .
" This way of working takes more care of a woodland .
The aim is that you would n't know we had been here except for a few hoof marks and the fact that the trees are n't there . "
But it is in environmentally sensitive areas - such as bogs , by streams and in ancient woodland - that logging is really taking off .
As Joiner explains : " There are all sorts of delicate ecosystems that need our protection .
We have just been working in an area where there were wild daffodils , which are a protected species .
Using machines would have decimated them , but using a horse did n't .
" An increased interest in ecology and environmental issues has made a big difference to our trade .
Horse logging has a real future .
It 's definitely something that 's coming back . "
The Forestry Commission , National Trust and many wildlife trusts have all used horse loggers in recent years .
Nick Walmsley , a forestry adviser for the Forestry Commission , says people are choosing horse logging more and more , " not just because the carbon footprint is lower , but because horses are better in environmentally sensitive areas .
" Heavy machinery can cause rutting , soil compaction and erosion .
If you damage the soil , anything will struggle to grow .
You can almost kill the soil this way .
It 's taken thousands of years to generate the soil in British woodlands .
If we destroy it , our natural history is under threat .
So we need to manage these sites in a sensitive way , and that 's where you would bring in a horse logger . "
In addition , he says , there 's less pollution from a horse .
" There 's horse wee and poo , but no danger of hydraulic fluid leaking into streams . "
Horses are now used regularly instead of machinery to clear woods across the UK .
Tarn Hows in the Lake District , Hafod wood in Ceredigion , and Craigvinean forest in Perthshire have all been maintained using horses .
They are also used on archaeological sites , where machines can't be used for fear of destroying historic remains .
Rob Stoneman , chief executive of the Yorkshire Wildlife Trust , says : " The benefit of logging woodlands is to encourage new growth , which is good for , and attracts , a host of species - for instance pearl - bordered fritillary butterflies , woodland flowers , and dormice , which eat blackberries that spring up when the canopy is cleared .
" Often it is difficult to get logs out of ancient woodlands using heavy machinery .
The most sensitive way of removal for all these species is to go by traditional options , such as using horses , which cause far less damage than heavy lorries . "
Joiner now runs five - day training courses in Childer wood , Herefordshire , where novices can pick up the basic skills .
He aims to train 20 people this year , and three of his five courses are already fully booked .
Using one of his five horses , Joiner moves an average of 10 tonnes of wood each day , and says that he once moved 35 tonnes in a day .
At the end of the working day , Ella joins the other horses back in their field adjoining the woodland .
And in Childer wood you would hardly know that anything had changed , apart from a pile of tree trunks by the side of a path .

President Obama is distancing himself from the National Day of Prayer by nixing a formal early morning service and not attending a large Catholic prayer breakfast the next morning .
All Mr. Obama will do for the National Day of Prayer , which is Thursday , is sign a proclamation honoring the day , which originated in 1952 when Congress set aside the first Thursday in May for the observance .
For the past eight years , President George W. Bush invited selected Christian and Jewish leaders to the White House East Room , where he typically would give a short speech and several leaders offered prayers .
Obama White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said Tuesday that the president is simply reverting back to pre-Bush administration practice .

“ Prayer is something the president does every day , ” he said .
“ We ’re doing a proclamation , which I know that many administrations in the past have done . ”
Pressed by reporters as to the lack of a formal ceremony , Mr. Gibbs said the proclamation was Mr. Obama ’s choice .
“ That ’s the way the president will publicly observe National Prayer Day - privately , he ’ll pray as he does every day , ” Mr. Gibbs said .
Shirley Dobson , chairwoman of the National Day of Prayer Committee , said the group was “ disappointed in the lack of participation by the Obama administration . ”
“ At this time in our country ’s history , we would hope our president would recognize more fully the importance of prayer , ” said Mrs. Dobson , who occupied a prominent seat in the front row for the ceremonies during the Bush administration .
Although the annual East Room events started with Mr. Bush , President Reagan hosted a Rose Garden event in 1982 and President George H.W. Bush scheduled a breakfast in 1989 .
President Clinton did not host any special observances , according to the National Day of Prayer task force .
Some evangelicals said they were not surprised by Mr. Obama ’s decision .
“ For those of us who have our doubts about Obama ’s faith , no , we did not expect him to have the service , ” said Wendy Wright , president of Concerned Women for America .
“ But as president , he should put his own lack of faith aside and live up to the office . ”
Referencing a remark the president made at a recent press conference in Turkey that Americans “ do not consider ourselves a Christian nation , ” she added : “ That was projecting his own beliefs , but not reflecting what the majority of Americans feel .
It ’s almost like Obama is trying to remake America into his own image .
This is not a rejection of Shirley Dobson ; it ’s a rejection of the concept that America is a spiritual nation and its foundation is Judeo - Christian . ”
David Brody , White House correspondent for the Christian Broadcasting Network , said in a column that , “ within the conservative evangelical community , there was never any real expectation that the White House would hold an event . ”
However , the White House did host an April 9 Passover Seder for family and friends - the first time a president has hosted that Jewish religious meal .
But the president passed up the fifth annual National Catholic Prayer Breakfast , scheduled for the Washington Hilton and expected to have 1,300 participants .
Joe Cella , a spokesman for the effort , said the White House never asked for Mr. Obama to attend .
Mr. Bush did ask to come and always made a few brief remarks .
But the new president , Mr. Cella said , would not have been allowed to speak because of a 2004 directive from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops saying that public figures who have taken positions opposing Catholic doctrine should not be publicly honored .
“ We ’d host him graciously , but we ’d not give him a platform to speak , ” Mr. Cella said .
All major presidential candidates were invited to attend last year , he added , but none responded .
For this year ’s prayer breakfast , Catholic members of the administration have been invited .
They include Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. , Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius , Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano .
None has responded , Mr. Cella said .
The keynote speech will be given by Archbishop Raymond Burke , the former St. Louis prelate who now heads the Signatura , the Vatican ’s top court .
He has recommended that pro-choice Catholic politicians such as Mrs. Sebelius not be allowed to receive Communion .
Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia is scheduled to speak .
Despite the White House snub , National Day of Prayer ceremonies are still slated from 9 a.m. to noon in the Cannon House Office Building on Capitol Hill .
Speakers include former NFL all - pro running back Shaun Alexander and Dick Eastman of Every Home for Christ .
An estimated 40,000 coordinators and volunteers will host locally organized events nationwide at courthouses , state capitols , city halls , parks and school flagpoles .
Nathan Diament , an Orthodox Jewish leader who has attended National Day of Prayer events in the East Room , said co-religionists should not find fault with the president .
“ While some will no doubt criticize the Obama White House for this decision , we think that is inappropriate , ” he said , “ and , moreover , not in keeping with the purpose of the observance which is to unify Americans through a national moment of reflection and aspiration to higher purposes . ”
Last fall , the Wisconsin - based Freedom From Religion Foundation sued Mrs. Dobson and the Bush administration over the National Day of Prayer .
The lawsuit , which has been changed to name Mr. Obama and Mr. Gibbs , the press secretary , says state governors and the U.S. government should not follow task - force directives on themes , wording , prayers and Scriptures for the event .

" The Curious Case Of Dr. Manhattan 's Wang "

When the story first surfaced the other day about Daniel Hood signing a scholarship with the University of Tennessee , I reacted the same as most of you -- with rage and revulsion .
How could a school be this desperate to allow someone with Hood 's background within 500 miles of the UT campus ?
It 's been well documented that when Hood was 13 he participated with a 17 - year - old friend , in the rape of Hood 's 14 - year - old cousin .
Like many of you , I was nauseated reading the gruesome details of the case .
But the more I reflected , my outrage simmered and I began to wonder whether the school was perhaps doing the right thing .
Instead of casting away Hood , now 19 , they are giving him a second chance .
What I really like about Tennessee 's handling of this case is the transparency -- so refreshing in today 's cloak and dagger and deceptive world of intercollegiate athletics .
Unlike so many other schools who keep everything under wraps to gain some sort of competitive advantage , UT has made the young man available for interviews -- which he has passed with poise .
The school has not run away from the controversy and perhaps , some good can come out of this family tragedy .
For starters , Hood has not been in any trouble since the incident and even the harshest cynics would have to agree the overwhelming fault in this case was on the friend , who is now serving a 10 - year prison sentence .
Had Hood been older , the case would be dramatically different .
And while we can debate ad nauseam the maturity of a 13 - year old , I think Hood was clearly not able to handle the situation .
Would you have been at 13 ?
It does n't really need to be said that there will be zero tolerance at UT for Hood , whose future behavior will be closely scrutinized .
But unlike many of his new teammates , the young man has excelled in school ( 3.8 GPA ) and has been a model citizen at Catholic High School in Knoxville .
The high school 's administration has staked its reputation on its high recommendation of Hood .
Was he the star player on a high school team that won the state ?
Sure .
But Hood has talked of his newfound faith and unlike many who use this as a crutch or a means of convenience , he appears sincere and genuinely remorseful .
Someone said to me the other day he would have less of a problem with Hood being accepted at Tennessee if he had committed murder .
Clearly , rape is a heinous crime .
However , in a murder case , the victim would not have been around to write a letter on his behalf -- which was the case here .
Obviously , the victim 's letter carried significant weight .
" I know ... Daniel on a personal level and believe that he has been very remorseful towards me , " said the letter , which was published in the Knoxville News Sentinel .
" He is a very caring individual .
We are now working on rebuilding our relationship .
Hoping to become a family like before .
He is becoming a very mature adult and will be a great asset to any college and to society as a whole . "
Of all of the impromptu and bizarre things that Lane Kiffin has said and done in his short tenure at Tennessee , at least this one seems well thought out .
Is he doing this because he really cares about Hood or because lineman is a position of need ?
Who knows , but at least Kiffin and UT are willing to take a chance and give a second chance .
It 's also worth pointing out that scores of schools wanted Hood .
Well , that was until Hood 's past caught up to him .
Even former coach Phil Fulmer bailed on him until Kiffin showed up .
And if we 're honest with ourselves , does the fact that UT and Kiffin are involved affect how we feel ?
If Hood had signed with Alabama and Nick Saban stood up for him , how would you feel then ?
Some would n't be swayed .
But I think many of us would be influenced by that fact and would be applauding instead of bashing Tennessee .
I do n't know what the odds are of this story having a happy ending or whether the reward for Hood and UT outweigh the risk being taken .
It chaps me when coaches coddle players when they get into trouble .
That only enables the star athlete to believe he is bulletproof .
When you factor in reports that one in three NFL players has had some brush with the law , you know the lack of discipline in college ( and before ) rarely results in a positive ending .
But this case is n't about the arrogance of a Michael Vick or a Pacman Jones .
This is about a young man who participated in a gruesome crime and paid a price by being in state juvenile custody for several of his teenage years .
Perhaps , not the price you would have doled out , but a price nevertheless .
The story here is n't that the University of Tennessee has given him a second chance .
The real story is what he does with the precious gift and opportunity .
Ultimately , that will determine whether this was the right call .

Department of Defense
" No meaningful insistence on accountability has been discernible from either the Gonzales Justice Department or the Rumsfeld Defense Department .
It has been left to human - rights organizations to piece together the alarming history of the CIA and U. S. Army 's illegal descent into torture . "
— BRIGADIER GENERAL DAVID R. IRVINE ( RET . )
The rented car blasts down the Strom Thurmond Highway toward Georgia , taking Marc Garlasco to his meeting with the Army interrogator .
Balmy air pours in the window .
It is spring .
Garlasco has one hand on the wheel , light glinting off his wraparound mirrored sunglasses .
He is talking about his wife and kids as he passes through countryside so brimming with green life that it 's strange and almost obscene to imagine his goal .
Garlasco works for Human Rights
Watch , a group that started in 1978 to monitor the Soviet Union and recently expanded its mission to include America 's war on terrorism .
With a partner named John Sifton , in the past year he has helped expose the secrets of CIA prisons and extraordinary renditions and discovered Captain Ian Fishback , the decorated West Point graduate whose account to the Senate Armed Services Committee last fall pushed the Congress to pass a historic and politically charged amendment banning torture .
Now Garlasco is chasing after a fresh story of prisoner abuse committed by members of the United States military .
Until now , the Bush administration has insisted that all prisoner abuse has been caused by low - ranking rogue elements .
But the man Garlasco is coming to meet has a story about abuses at a secret camp used by Task Force 121 , the ultimate Special Ops team , the elite titanium tip of Donald Rumsfeld 's spear .
Their names are state secrets .
Their work is closely monitored and highly systematized .
And they acted under the supervision of ranking officers and even — in one extraordinary instance that Garlasco expects to be exploring tonight — with the direct encouragement of lawyers from the Army 's Judge Advocate General 's office .
At the hotel , he checks into his room and goes back down to the lobby to wait .
It 's a vast , dismal place that reeks of some kind of fake mortuary perfume .
Half an hour later , the interrogator arrives .
He 's broad and muscular and his hair is shaved to a small top patch in the military style .
He 's wearing civilian clothes .
He tells Garlasco to call him Jeff , which is not his real name .
The hotel restaurant is empty and overlooks the empty lobby , but still they take the most hidden booth and make nervous jokes about the little private roof that makes it a perfect cone of silence .
Ordering dinner , Jeff says he grew up in a conservative Christian family and became " secular , " then got bored with college and joined the military .
That was just before 9/11 .
The Army gave him some tests and decided he was smart enough to handle one of the hardest languages , Arabic .
That 's how he became an interrogator .
He is here now , he says , because his conscience tells him it's the right thing to do .
Then Garlasco pushes the button on a small digital recorder .
" It is now Wednesday , May seventeenth , at 6:30 P.M.
Jeff , I just want to have your permission that I can record you . "
" Yes , you do . "
" Okay , great , " he says , warming Jeff up with a few questions about his military experience in Iraq .
" Your MOS ? "
" 97 Echo . "
" 97 Echo .
You 're a trained interrogator .
That means that you went to Huachuca , you went to DLI out in Monterey , is that correct ? "
Huachuca is the Army 's interrogation school , DLI the language - immersion academy .
Garlasco knows these things because he spent six years as an intelligence analyst at the Pentagon , where he interrogated prisoners , briefed the Secretary of Defense , and charted the coordinates for the bombing campaign against Saddam Hussein in the early days of the war .
It makes him an ideal confessor for a soldier with a troubled conscience .
Jeff was in Iraq early in 2004 .
That January , a sergeant named Joseph Darby at Abu Ghraib prison gave Army investigators a disc of pictures of naked human pyramids and a naked man on a dog leash , the seed of evidence that grew into the prisoner - abuse scandal .
After that , Jeff heard that things at Abu Ghraib were changing fast .
They were still doing things in January that were impossible by ' 04 May , he says .
" Like what ? "
" Like put a prisoner in a stress position , or cuff them to the middle of the floor and scream at them and throw a chair .
Hooding , cuffing , transporting a prisoner by yourself — all of that was forbidden later on . "
But at the very same time the Army was cleaning up Abu Ghraib under scrutiny , Jeff arrived at an elite secret interrogation facility near Baghdad where nudity and hooding and stress positions were still routine , where ranking officers knew exactly what was going on and promised to protect the interrogators at all costs .
Now , at this deserted hotel , Jeff is taking an outsider into that program for the first time .
The waitress brings salads .
In the pause , Jeff reminds Garlasco that he 's still enlisted .
The United States government can bring misery to a soldier who crosses it , so he does n't want to be too specific about exactly who he is or when he started his assignment , giving himself the cover of reasonable doubt .
Sometime in February or March , then , he reported for duty at an unmarked compound .
This was Camp Nama , the home of Task Force 121 , the Special Ops team that chased Osama bin Laden and caught Saddam Hussein and would ultimately locate and kill Abu Musab al - Zarqawi , the self - described leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq .
It was Rumsfeld 's baby , the Platonic ideal of his fast and mobile army .
From its size to its mission , everything about it was and remains an official secret .
Except for the concertina wire , Camp Nama was a nondescript cluster of buildings .
The only thing Jeff knew about Camp Nama was that he'd be able to wear civilian clothes and interrogate " high value " prisoners .
In order to get to the second step , he had to go through hours of psychological tests to ensure his fitness for the job .
Nama , it is said , stood for Nasty Ass Military Area .
Jeff says there was a maverick , high - speed feeling to the place .
Some of the interrogators had beards and long hair and everyone used only first names , even the officers .
" When you ask somebody their name , they do n't offer up the last name , " Jeff says .
" When they gave you their name it probably was n't their real name anyway . "
To this day , Jeff has no idea of the true names of his superior officers .
His supervisor was a colonel who called himself Mike , although Jeff is sure that was n't his real name .
It was a point of pride that the Red Cross would never be allowed in the door , Jeff says .
This is important because it defied the Geneva Conventions , which require that the Red Cross have access to military prisons .
" Once , somebody brought it up with the colonel .
' Will they ever be allowed in here ? '
And he said absolutely not .
He had this directly from General McChrystal and the Pentagon that there 's no way that the Red Cross could get in — they wo n't have access and they never will .
This facility was completely closed off to anybody investigating , even Army investigators . "
Given Task Force 121's history , that was a remarkable promise .
Formed in the summer of 2003 , it quickly became notorious .
By August the CIA had already ordered its officers to avoid Camp Nama .
Then two Iraqi men died following encounters with Navy Seals from Task Force 121 — one at Abu Ghraib and one in Mosul — and an official investigation by a retired Army colonel named Stuart Herrington , first reported in The Washington Post , found evidence of widespread beatings .
" Everyone knows about it , " one Task Force officer told Herrington .
Six months later , two FBI agents raised concerns about suspicious burn marks and other signs of harsh treatment .
Then the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency reported that his men had seen evidence of prisoners with burn marks and bruises and once saw a Task Force member " punch [ the ] prisoner in the face to the point the individual needed medical attention . "
Despite this record , The New York Times has reported that as late as June 2005 , the Army dropped yet another investigation into torture at Camp Nama because of the confusion created by the use of " battlefield pseudonyms . "
The confusion extends to the name of the task force itself , which is also known as Task Force 6 - 26 and Task Force 145 .
During his first six or seven weeks at the camp , Jeff conducted or participated in about fifteen harsh interrogations , most involving the use of ice water to induce hypothermia .
By his reckoning , at least half of the prisoners were innocent , just random Iraqis who got picked up for one reason or another .
Sometimes the evidence against them was so slight , Jeff would go into the interrogation without even knowing their names .
Then he got a few days off and did a lot of thinking .
" I had time to step back and say , Wait , this is not right .
This is not who I am .
This is not the way I was brought up .
This is not the way I want to remember myself and my actions . "
Finally a small group of interrogators went to the colonel and told him they were feeling uneasy — he was a nice guy , always approachable , and it was completely informal .
The colonel snapped into action .
Within two or three hours , a pair of JAG lawyers showed up and gathered the entire staff into the main duty room at Camp Nama .
" It was very fast .
It was like they were ready .
I mean , they had this two - hour slide show all prepared , and they came in and gave it to us and they stopped interrogations for it . "
" What kind of slide show ? "
" It was a PowerPoint . "
This is a remarkable event , in part because there was significant opposition to harsh interrogation within senior elements of the JAG corps , who feared that the Army was opening itself to war - crimes prosecutions .
As Jeff tells the story , there were between twenty and thirty people in the room ; a third were interrogators , the rest were leadership and support staff .
Most had folding chairs but a few stood against the walls .
The lawyers did not dim the fluorescent lights , and as the PowerPoint slides flashed on the wall , starting with a review of the laws of war and the Geneva Conventions , the soldiers interrupted with questions .
" Is this legal ? " they asked .
" Are we going to be investigated ? "
The military lawyers explained the distinction between prisoners of war and enemy combatants to the packed room , insisting that the methods they were using at Camp Nama were appropriate .
The JAG lawyers explained that none of these interrogation techniques were inhumane because they left no lasting mental or physical effects .
But that prompted more questions .
" What if another authority comes along that disagrees on the rules ? "
The JAG lawyers insisted that would n't happen , that any punishment would come from the top down and never get to them .
Someone asked about the innocent people , the ordinary Iraqis who were n't enemy combatants at all .
" We 're in a new era , " one of the JAG lawyers said .
" We 're in a war on terror , and these are things we have to do . "
( Officials at the Pentagon , the Special Operations Command , and JAG headquarters did not respond to repeated requests for comment on these events . )
Before Jeff , there was another soldier .
A year ago last May was about the worst time in Marc Garlasco 's entire life .
His wife was very ill , so clearly wasting away that one night he caught his toddlers playing " dead mommy . "
Then a call came one Friday afternoon at around four o'clock , just as he was planning to slip out of the office to get home early .
" I 've got this guy on the line who says he's in the military , " a coworker told him .
" I 'm going to patch you in . "
With this began the episode that would put Human Rights Watch at the center of a controversy that has threatened America 's standing in the world and sullied the American national character .
The stranger on the line said he served in Iraq and had seen some things that might have been violations of the Geneva Conventions , Abu Ghraib - type things .
He had talked to his professors at West Point and an Army attorney but he still had some questions .
The man 's voice was so serious and solid , Garlasco felt a hunch .
This could be significant .
" Okay , " he said , playing it cool .
" Send me your RFIs . "
That 's Armyspeak for " Request for Information . "
Soon they were clicking through ROEs and FOBs and the coworker dropped off the line .
Then Garlasco backed off and gave the man his e-mail address .
" Look , I do n't have your number .
I do n't know your name .
If you want to keep this on a telephone basis , that 's okay — I do n't want to get you in trouble . "
It was a long weekend .
Monday came and went .
But late that night , a message appeared in his in - box :
Mark ,
Here is a summary of my RFIs :
Which of the following activities violate the Geneva Conventions : stripping prisoners naked and chaining them to the floor , intense periods of exercise , sleep deprivation , hitting or threatening to hit prisoners ?
How did the U. S. interpretation of the Geneva Conventions change after September 11 ?
Can you send me any government reports related to prisoner abuse or Abu Ghraib ?
( Taguba report , IG report , the recently released investigation ) ?
Documents showing that senior U. S. officials permitted harsh interrogations ?
Is this a case of the Army trying to tell the truth and poor media coverage , or of the Army intentionally misleading America ?
Are there other officers with similar concerns ?
International case law ( other countries ' standards ) on the Geneva Conventions .
For example , I remember that a Japanese general ( or admiral ) was found guilty for War Crimes because of the Bataan Death March even though he was unaware of it at the time .
Documentation of warnings to U. S. officials not to change the policy .
There are a lot of reasons not to do this and I suspect that at least JAG would have brought them up .
Constitutional case law on officer responsibilities to speak up . . .
I do n't know of any cases either way .
Congressional testimony about what is permitted before and after 9/11 .
As it happened , all of the soldier 's questions involved the very thing Garlasco was researching .
Known as the doctrine of command responsibility and formalized by the Geneva Conventions of 1949 , it is the idea that officers must shoulder the blame when they know their troops are committing war crimes and fail to take " all feasible measures " to stop them , the principle linking the Nazi trials at Nuremberg to Lieutenant William Calley and Slobodan Milo_eviÃ , Â´c .
That history took an unexpected turn five months after 9/11 , on February 7 , 2002 , when President Bush signed the memo titled " Humane Treatment of Taliban and Al Qaeda Detainees . "
Because Al Qaeda was not a High Contracting Party to the Geneva Conventions , he said , " none of the provisions of Geneva apply to our conflict with Al Qaeda in Afghanistan or elsewhere throughout the world . "
He especially rejected Article 3 , the clause that forbids torture and other insults to human dignity .
On December 2 , 2002 , Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld authorized twelve new methods of interrogation , including stress positions , hooding , nudity , and the use of threatening dogs — and also four harsher methods that were " legally available " but did not have blanket approval , including exposure to cold , mock executions of prisoners ( or their family members ) , and the sense of drowning suffocation caused by the method known as waterboarding .
A month later Rumsfeld rescinded blanket approval but still permitted harsh techniques as long as interrogators first asked permission .
For three years , not a single ranking military officer had raised a critical word in public about any of this .
But the e-mail in Garlasco 's in - box was signed :
" w/ Respect , CPT Ian Fishback . "
In person , on a spring day , in a pair of cargo shorts and a KEEP ON TREKKING T - shirt , Ian Fishback looks like any twenty - six - year - old guy , maybe a high school swim coach .
He 's stocky and short , does the cowboy squint as he takes things in , talks about his plans for the weekend .
It 's no surprise that he grew up in a small town in northern Michigan , the gentle type who protected kids from bullies and campaigned against drinking at football games .
Then he puts on his uniform and presto , he 's Captain Ian Fishback , West Point graduate , creased and gleaming with two Bronze Stars , son of a Vietnam veteran and married to an Iraq veteran , now training to go back to Iraq at the head of a twelve - man Special Forces team .
This is a man who has excelled at everything .
He was voted most valuable player of the football team and president of his senior class in high school , made squad leader and company commander at West Point .
The only regular complaint he seems to have inspired is that he is maybe just a bit too obsessed with following every rule to the letter .
In subsequent e-mails he sent to Garlasco , Fishback was relentless and detailed :
Afghanistan ( Sep 02 - Jan 03 ) : witness deliberately planned , harsh interrogations sanctioned by the chain of command .
Prisoners are referred to as PUCs ( persons under control ) or detainees for the express purpose that they are not afforded Geneva Convention rights .
My chain of command states this explicitly .
Trained OGA ( other government agency ) interrogators conduct interrogations including sleep deprivation , intense exercise , and stripping prisoners and exposing them to elements .
These activities violate the Geneva Conventions as I learned them at West Point .
Iraq ( Sep 03 - March 04 ) : while operating throughout Sunni triangle witness OGA interrogators take prisoner into a building and instruct infantry not to allow anyone into the building .
I heard banging noises from inside the building and assumed that the prisoner was either being hit or being threatened to be hit .
This activity took place in the middle of the day in the center of a cavalry squadron base camp .
It was commonplace to hold family members until someone gave himself up in Iraq .
When he was in Iraq , Fishback thought all of this was permitted under the Bush administration 's new " take the gloves off " policy .
So when the Abu Ghraib scandal broke and Rumsfeld appeared before Congress to blame the conduct on rogue elements , Fishback got so steamed he wrote up a memorandum for the record and took it to his commanding officer , Lieutenant Colonel Marshall A. Hagen .
It started off on the strongest possible note .
" The Secretary of Defense 's testimony on Friday 7 May was inaccurate .
He stated that the United States follows the Geneva Convention in regards to both the Taliban and Iraq .
My personal experiences show this is not true . "
Listing specific Geneva Conventions by clause and subsection , Fishback said that he worked with some of the most disciplined units in the world — the 82nd Airborne , the U. S. Army Rangers , and Special Operations Forces — and it was an insult to call them rogue troops .
Furthermore , all three of his battalion commanders not only allowed troops to violate the conventions but " provided reasoning " why it was morally acceptable to do so .
Therefore it was his duty and also his moral obligation to register an objection .
After a conversation that lasted nearly two hours and went nowhere , Hagen put his signature at the bottom of the document .
" I have read and understand the above statement , dated 10 May 2004 .
I am aware of LT Fishback 's concerns . "
Fishback persisted up the ladder , going to his battalion commander to an Army lawyer to his congressman to Senator Carl Levin , a ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee .
Some took notes , some shrugged him off , some asked him to consider the gray areas .
The Secretary of the Army told him that corrective action had been taken .
That was the summer of 2004 , when his wife was deployed to Iraq to work with the 519th Military Intelligence Battalion .
This was the same outfit that had helped set up the Army prison at Abu Ghraib one summer earlier .
She heard that back then , they 'd started right off with stripping prisoners naked and harsh interrogations , and anyone who expressed concern was scapegoated .
Finally the battalion commander objected to the harsh techniques and requested new " rules of engagement , " and it took four months to get the new ROE from the Pentagon , a shocking delay in the rule - obsessed world of the Army .
And the new ROE called for the same harsh interrogation techniques as before .
It was another damning piece of evidence , especially because the famous night - shift abuse episodes began soon afterward .
If the rules of engagement had taken a clear stand against torture , those terrible events might not have happened .
So Fishback started up again , taking his concerns to the Inspector General at Fort Bragg — who told him to work within the system .
Do n't do something stupid , like go to the media .
Why not wait for Vice - Admiral Albert T. Church to finish the official investigation ?
So that 's what Fishback did .
But when Church issued his report in March 2005 , it found " no link between approved interrogation techniques and detainee abuse " and blamed all the trouble with torture on rogue soldiers .
That 's when Fishback contacted Garlasco .
Bottom Line : I am concerned that the Army is deliberately misleading the American people about detainee treatment within our custody .
This behavior violates the professional military ethic of " I will not lie , cheat , or steal , nor tolerate those who do " and it violates the constitutional principle of a government accountable to the people .
Marc Garlasco pushes the tape recorder across the table , a little closer to Jeff .
At Camp Nama , Jeff says , the tone was set right at the beginning , when he was still in his observing phase .
One day they arrested a man who was believed to have given money to al - Zarqawi or helped found his resistance group .
They dragged him into a courtyard between the buildings and stripped him naked , then sprayed him with a hose of freezing water and rolled him in a mud puddle and stood him up in front of an air conditioner .
It was winter and bitter cold .
Then they pushed him back into the mud puddle and sprayed him with the hose and did it all over again .
" This happened all night .
Everybody knew about it .
People walked in , the sergeant major and so forth , everybody knew what was going on .
And I was kind of walking back and forth seeing — this is how they do things . "
Jeff was n't sure how to react .
It all seemed very official .
There was a range of treatment for prisoners available to the interrogators .
If a suspect cooperated he might get the red room or the blue room or even the soft room , which had rugs and black leather chairs .
But if he was difficult or important he went to the black room with the black door and black speakers in four black corners blaring earsplitting music .
" What techniques were authorized for the black room ? "
" There was a checklist template on a computer with entries for environmental controls , hot and cold , strobe lights , music , working dogs , and so on .
You would just check what you want to use and get it signed off , and they were always signed off . "
" Do you know where those techniques came from ?
I mean the techniques you describe , are they in the Army Interrogation Field Manual ? "
" No , they 're not . "
" So where did you get those from ? "
" Oh , they 're just not hard to come up with .
There 's really no manual to take somebody 's clothes off .
But you find it in Mosul , you find it in Baghdad , you find it at Abu Ghraib , you find it in Tikrit , you find it everywhere .
Disrobing and these type of methods .
But humiliation is on the interrogator 's mind .
You know , I want to humiliate this person to get them to talk to me .
What 's more humiliating than , I mean , just take off your clothes ?
That 's just the first thing that pops into people 's minds , apparently .
And then you 've got some ice water and pour the ice water on them and make them very uncomfortable that way . "
The harshest frequent technique used at Nama was the use of cold water , Jeff says .
Cold can be a serious torment to a naked man on a winter night ; in Afghanistan , one prisoner died from hypothermia .
Sometimes , to maximize the humiliation of the Iraqi men , American women would be brought in to watch them undress .
Sleep deprivation was also used to an extreme extent , especially in Jeff 's early days at Nama .
They could keep a prisoner on his feet for twenty hours , and although the rules required them to allow each prisoner four hours of sleep every twenty - four hours , nowhere did it say those four hours had to be consecutive — so sometimes they'd wake the prisoners up every half hour .
Eventually they 'd just collapse .
" This was a very demanding method for the interrogators as well , because it required a lot of staff to monitor the prisoner , and we'd have to stay awake , too , " Jeff says .
" And it 's just impossible to interrogate someone when he's in that state , collapsed on the ground .
It does n't make any sense . "
Since these techniques violate both the Geneva Conventions and the Army Field Manual , the all - important rule book that carries the force of military law , the Bush administration has attempted to finesse the issue by creating the distinction between " prisoners of war " and " enemy combatants , " promising to reserve the harsh techniques only for hardcore Al Qaeda members and not for the Iraqis or even the Taliban .
This creates a conflict with existing laws , as well as a more practical problem .
Camp Nama is a perfect example of this , because Task Force 121 was in fact looking for a hardcore Al Qaeda member , al - Zarqawi — but to find him , it was using the techniques reserved for the " worst of the worst " on ordinary Iraqi civilians .
" What was the level of occurrence of these harsh techniques ?
Was it weekly ? "
" Sometimes it was every day if it was a multi-interrogation plan on one individual .
Sometimes we did n't have anybody to talk to for maybe a day or two . "
" Was the colonel ever actually there to observe this ? "
" Oh , yeah .
He worked there .
He had his desk there .
They were working in a big room where the analysts , the report writers , the sergeant major , the colonel , some technical guys — they 're all in that room . "
To Garlasco , this is significant .
This means that a full - bird colonel and all his support staff knew exactly what was going on at Camp Nama .
" Do you know where the colonel was getting his orders from ? " he asks .
Jeff answers quickly , perhaps a little defiantly .
" I believe it was a two - star general .
I believe his name was General McChrystal .
I saw him there a couple of times . "
Back when he was an intelligence analyst , Garlasco had briefed Stanley McChrystal once .
He remembers him as a tall Irishman with a gentle manner .
He was head of the Joint Special Operations Command , the logical person to oversee Task Force 121 , and vice - director for operations for the Joint Chiefs .
That put responsibility right in the heart of the Pentagon .
Within the unit , the interrogators got the feeling they were reporting to the highest levels .
The colonel would tell an interrogator that his report " is on Rumsfeld 's desk this morning " or that it was " read by SecDef . "
" That 's a big morale booster after a fourteen - hour day , " Jeff says with a tinge of irony .
" Hey , we got to the White House . "
Since leaving the church , Jeff had been going through a period of reexamining his values .
Joining the Army was part of that , and he was always prepared to fight in a battle if it came to that .
But this was different .
One time , they had a prisoner who was obviously lying and stalling .
He was one of those red - flag guys , the kind where a memo shot up the chain of command and everyone was waiting for the interrogation results .
Supposedly he knew where al - Zarqawi was .
Finally a soldier from the elite British SAS unit took him out to a kind of bunker behind the main building .
Two or three other people followed , and Jeff 's supervisor told him to tag along to keep an eye on things .
" He gave the guy a pretty good pounding , " Jeff says .
" Nothing really in the face .
A lot of stomach shots , and I would say two or three groin shots , very harsh .
A knee to the abdomen .
Thrown against the wall and so forth . "
Someone reported the beating to the sergeant major , but no one in a position of responsibility seemed to care much .
" They were n't upset about any type of abuse or anything .
They were just upset that he was interrogating , because he was n't signed on to do that type of job . "
Jeff saw the effects of beatings " all the time " in the captives as they arrived , usually after they were arrested by Delta Force members working for Task Force 121 .
" They 'd fall on their knees and beg you not to kill them , " he said , " completely terrified because of the way they were treated the previous forty - eight hours . "
And it was n't easy to clear suspects , either .
One time Jeff told the senior interrogator that the guy he was interrogating was a chump , just a nobody picked up by accident , and the colonel dressed him down in an open meeting : " You do n't know that !
You just could n't break him ! "
Then for Jeff the doubting began .
" Even if these people did do these things , I do n't want to do these things to them , " he says .
" I want to be humane about it .
I want to keep my dignity . "
Experimenting with more - traditional " soft " techniques like the appeal to a man 's pride or to the futility of resistance , he found them both more successful and more reliable .
At least you knew it was more likely to be genuine when a person decided to cooperate .
" From what I 've seen of harsh physical tactics , " Jeff says , " [ it 's ] harder to tell if they 're just saying something to stop the discomfort .
But if a prisoner breaks by the more - traditional means , you instantly know it .
" I 'd done harsh interrogations , with little or no results at all .
And I saw a lot of other people do harsh interrogations , too , and just never saw any type of results to speak of at all . "
But most of the interrogators in the camp were totally gung ho and wanted to go harsh on everybody .
It was that kind of unit .
" They thought that was their job and that 's what they needed to do , and do it every time . "
He began to feel more and more repelled , he says .
I do n't want to hang out with these people .
I do n't want to see them do these things .
By then it was spring and the Army was starting to hum with tales of Abu Ghraib , although it had not yet broken in the media — the first story would hit TV on April 28 .
But Jeff and some of the other interrogators started talking about the things they were doing at Nama .
They were n't as sexually abusive as the things that went on at Abu Ghraib , but they were making a daily mockery of the Army Field Manual and the Geneva Conventions .
" Nobody was stupid enough to take pictures , but you know , it 's the same stuff , " says Jeff .
" You kind of got the sense that some people thought it was fun .
And I think kind of an underlying thing was it was fun for people , but they had this guise of like it was always , you know , for the information . "
Then the JAG lawyers were summoned by the colonel to put down feelings of unrest among a few of the Camp Nama interrogators by offering a legal justification for their conduct .
The lawyers brought up September 11 a lot , Jeff says .
That put him off .
" I never thought Iraq had anything to do with 9/11 , " he says .
" But I was very annoyed with them because they were saying things like we did n't have to abide by the Geneva Conventions because these people were n't POWs .
It just went against everything we learned at Huachuca .
And just faulty logic , you know ?
Just really bad argument . "
Over and over , Jeff says , the JAG lawyers told them that blame would never get down to their level .
" It would go through us first , " they said .
" You will never have any culpability whatsoever . "
That 's the last thing the interrogators heard from the colonel , too .
" It will never come down to you .
You guys have nothing to worry about .
You 're not doing anything wrong . "
Then he sent them back to work , case closed .
The interrogators of Camp Nama were still working a few weeks later when the Abu Ghraib story blew up and Donald Rumsfeld went before Congress to insist that the United States was following the Geneva Conventions in Iraq .
Twenty years ago , Marc Garlasco was a pudgy science - fiction geek whose social life was going to Star Trek conventions for autographs .
He toughened himself up in ROTC and went to work for the Defense Intelligence Agency , where he interrogated more than fifty Arabs and spent a year searching for a pilot who was lost in the first Gulf war .
He was in his office at the Pentagon when the plane hit on September 11 , and in the run-up to the war he was the guy who came up with the idea of putting the faces of Saddam Hussein and his top henchmen on a deck of cards .
By the start of the war , the DIA put him in charge of high - value targeting , which is how he came to be watching on a monitor at the Pentagon when they dropped the bombs on Chemical Ali .
The monitor flashed white and when the image came back , they saw two tiny flapping legs and took bets on how many times they would flap — after all , it was Chemical Ali , the guy who had gassed thousands of Kurds .
But when the bombing campaign ended , Garlasco abruptly quit the Pentagon and flew to Baghdad to visit the crater at Chemical Ali 's house for Human Rights Watch .
The bombs had hit unintended targets .
And although he 's the low - key type , always joking , it 's not hard to read his emotions in his report .
In the early morning hours of Saturday , April 5 , Abd al - Hussain Yunis al - Tayyar , a fifty - year - old laborer , went to his garden to get water .
Moments later an American bomb slammed into the targeted house next door , destroying his house as well .
He picked himself up and immediately began to search the debris .
He spent the rest of the day working to pull the dead bodies of his family from the rubble of his home , finally reaching his dead son at 4:00 P.M .
The dead included :
As'ad ' Abd al - Hussain al - Tayyar , 30 , son .
Qarar As'ad al - Tayyar , 12 , grandson .
Haidar As'ad al - Tayyar , 9 , grandson .
Saif As'ad al - Tayyar , 6 , grandson .
Intisar ' Abd al - Hussain al - Tayyar , 30 , daughter .
Khawla Ali al - Tayyar , 9 , granddaughter .
Hind Ali al - Tayyar , 5 , granddaughter .
Garlasco wrote down the names and ages , trying to keep his emotions off his face .
Seeing the effects of his own handiwork might have changed him , might suggest some kind of conversion , but that 's not exactly the case .
Garlasco still maintains close ties to his old colleagues , even taking part in a conference on counterinsurgency at Fort Leavenworth this past February .
He 's probably the only human - rights activist who is also a member of the NRA , certainly the only one with a gun collection that includes an M4 assault rifle , a Sig P229 , and his beloved Pardini competition pistol .
He even ended his Chemical Ali report with a modest suggestion that is probably a first in NGO history .
Since the size of the crater suggested " the smallest PGM available , " a five - hundred - pound laser - guided bomb , it might be a good idea for the military to develop " smaller munitions with lower yields that will reduce collateral damage . "
Somehow this odd collection of qualities made him the perfect man to meet Captain Ian Fishback .
Setting up their first face - to - face meeting late last May , they chose a little town in Georgia called La Grange , a dot on the map with a Baptist church in every direction .
It felt safe enough at 450 miles from Fort Bragg .
They met at an Applebee's .
At first , things were awkward .
Garlasco suggested a beer and Fishback said he 'd prefer a lemonade .
When the food came , Fishback said grace .
I 'm sitting with a Jesus freak , Garlasco thought .
He began to wonder if this was some kind of religious crusade .
Soon , though , they clicked on the peculiar mutual grounds of guns , military history , and Battlestar Galactica .
But
Fishback balked when Garlasco asked to talk to the soldiers in his unit .
He was their superior officer and it was his duty to protect them , he said .
He was n't ready to do a taped interview yet , either .
And he did n't feel comfortable talking to any more Democrats .
It might come off as partisan and soldiers should n't get mixed up in politics .
He had to make it clear that he was fighting for a principle and not a party , and the best way to do that , he thought , was through a Republican .
" Do you think you could set up a meeting with John McCain ? "
Fishback asked .
Garlasco flew home empty - handed .
A month later , still trying to set up a meeting with McCain , he kept sending Fishback friendly e-mails :
" Hope all is well .
I just watched Occupation : Dreamland .
Really brings home how freaking random the violence is over there . "
When Fishback got through to one of McCain 's aides , he sent Garlasco an update .
" He agreed with almost all of my points and agreed that the Army is misleading Congress and America .
I asked point - blank for reasons that I should not go to the media and he could give me none other than concern for my own career . "
Finally Fishback agreed to a formal recorded interview .
Flying to another anonymous southern city , Garlasco met him in a hotel room and hit the button on his little digital recorder .
" It 's the twenty - first of July , 2005 , at four o'clock , and this is Marc Garlasco from Human Rights Watch , and I am with LG - Alpha from the U. S. Army .
LG - Alpha , I just want to have your permission to record our conversation . "
" You have my permission . "
For the next four hours , he took Fishback through every detail of his story .
" Did you actually observe detainees stripped ? "
" Down to their underwear , yes . "
" Do you know who stripped them ? "
" No . "
" Did you observe them placed in the stress positions ? "
" Yes . "
" And when you speak about sleep deprivation , how did you observe sleep deprivation ? "
" They had a horn , a really loud horn .
Any time the detainee would go to fall asleep they would blare the horn in his ear so that he had to wake up and they would do that until he stood up again and stayed awake . "
" And you observed that ? "
" I observed that once .
I observed them carrying the horn to the detainees multiple times . "
" And ' exposure to the elements . '
Can you explain that to me a little bit better ? "
" Leave them outside , in the cold , and it got pretty cold . "
" How did you feel about the treatment of these people at the time ? "
" My feelings were that it clearly violated what I had learned as the appropriate way to treat detainees at West Point . . . .
You do n't force them to give you any information other than name , rank , and serial number .
That 's the gist of the Geneva Conventions . "
If he had thought they were supposed to follow the Geneva Conventions , he said , he would have immediately stopped what was going on .
That is a failure of command responsibility that he feels acutely , and he can't understand why so few officers feel the same .
" It is infuriating to me that officers are not lined up to accept responsibility for what happened .
It blows my mind that officers are not .
It should 've started with the chain of command at Abu Ghraib , and anybody else that witnessed anything that violated the Geneva Conventions or anything that could be questionable should 've been standing up saying , ' This is what happened .
This is why I allowed it to happen .
This is my responsibility . '
That 's basic officership .
That 's what you learn at West Point . "
Last July , amid news of abusive interrogations at GuantÃfÂ¡namo featuring a disturbingly familiar story of a prisoner forced to wear a leash and women 's underwear , John McCain started floating an amendment to ban torture .
In an immediate and surprisingly aggressive counterattack , Vice - President Dick Cheney began meeting with leading Republican senators to urge them to kill any such measure .
To bring the point home , the White House threatened to veto any bill that would " restrict the president 's authority to protect Americans effectively from terrorist attack and bring terrorists to justice . "
In August , Fishback finally agreed to put Garlasco in touch with some of his men .
Working together , he and Sifton were able to tape six interviews that uncovered a host of ugly new details .
" We would give them blows to the head , chest , legs , and stomach , " the soldiers said .
" Pull them down , kick dirt on them . . . withhold water for whole guard shifts . . . withheld food , giving them the bare minimum like crackers . . . poured cold water on them all the time to where they were soaking wet and we would cover them in dirt and sand . . . broken bones did n't happen too often , maybe every other week .
. . . "
It was much worse than anything Fishback had seen .
Dismayed , he went back for another meeting with Lieutenant Colonel Hagen , then one more .
In an e-mail , he told Garlasco that the stuff on TV was breaking his heart .
He could n't watch the administration 's " highly crafted talking points " without wanting to weep for his country .
" I 'm almost ready to go forward .
Can you get to McCain ? "
Finally , Senator McCain gave him an appointment .
But just before the appointed day , a Senate staffer called the Pentagon to clear the interview .
A few hours later at Fort Bragg , Fishback 's supervisor asked if he had a pass to leave the base .
No , Fishback said , he had n't applied for one yet .
Do n't bother , the supervisor told him .
You wo n't get one .
Also , the Army Criminal Investigation Division was going to begin an investigation into his charges .
He would be needed to answer questions .
So would the sergeants who talked to Garlasco and Sifton .
Starting with an implicit threat to the whistle - blowers , the CID promised to investigate only the beatings and broken bones , ignoring the larger point about the collapse of standards that gave rise to those extreme acts .
Bristling under the pressure , Fishback gave Garlasco permission to pass on his much - revised Summary of Concerns .
" I want Mr. McCain 's office to control the information ; use it however they want . "
A week later , a Senate staffer leaked Fishback 's story to Time magazine and Garlasco rushed out his report , which still referred to Fishback as " Captain C. "
With that , the story jumped onto front pages and TV news all over the world .
Down at Fort Bragg , as CID investigators continued to grill Fishback , he allowed himself a rare burst of public frustration in a phone call with The New York Times .
" They 're asking the same questions over and over again , " he said .
" They want the names of the sergeants , and they keep asking about my relationship with Human Rights Watch . "
But the story gave wings to McCain 's amendment .
He had honed it to its purest form , simply asking the Army to follow the rules in the Army Field Manual .
On October 5 , he rose to the Senate floor and paid tribute to Fishback .
For seventeen months , " this one brave soldier " stood up and took a stand , he said , demanding an answer to a simple and essential question .
What did America really stand for ?
What are the standards ?
It was like a scene out of a Frank Capra movie .
" I thank God every day that we have men and women the caliber of Captain Fishback serving in our military .
I believe the Congress has a responsibility to answer this call . "
That afternoon the Senate passed his amendment with an overwhelming vote of ninety to nine — an unprecedented rebuke of the President of the United States of America by members of his own party .
It would be nice to end the story there , with the balance restored to our happy land of dreams .
But the counterattack came swift and fierce .
The first target was Fishback .
The Army allowed one spokesman to dismiss his concerns as " verbiage " and another to say they were just philosophical , not a formal complaint .
" It 's just a shame that he did n't bring it to somebody in the chain of command in some kind of written form , " said Major General Bill Caldwell .
Back at the office , Garlasco went through his hate mail :
" Your organization sucks donkey balls .
Your entire organization is anti-American .
Your bosses are assholes and your friends are scumbags . "
And another :
" Fuck you dickless pukes . "
And another :
" You bunch of bed - wetting assholes want to pamper monsters who kill women and children regularly and gleefully .
Why do n't you get the fuck out of this country and join your fellow shitheads in Paris ? "
Then we tumble down the rabbit hole .
In January , President Bush adds a " signing statement " to the McCain amendment that says that he will construe the law " in a manner consistent with the constitutional authority of the President , " meaning that the White House will do exactly as it pleases and Congress be damned .
A fight explodes over a secret ten - page section on interrogation being added to the new Army Field Manual , which subverts the McCain amendment by other means .
In the trial of an Abu Ghraib dog handler , the general who originally introduced the snarling dogs and stress positions at the prison refuses to testify on the grounds that he might incriminate himself .
The colonel who supervised the Abu Ghraib interrogators is given immunity to testify against his troops , which is like giving a drug lord immunity to testify against a small - time user .
The Justice Department begins investigating reporters and their sources .
The pressure reaches down to John Sifton and Marc Garlasco .
While Garlasco had been consumed with taking the testimony of soldiers , Sifton , a scholarly thirty - two - year - old lawyer , had committed himself to searching for the truth about the CIA 's secret prisons .
For his troubles , Sifton finds himself on a collision course with the government .
In February he receives a solid tip from a reputable source that the CIA has put a new secret prison in Mauritania .
So he hops on a plane and two days later , he 's walking up a flight of marble stairs at the presidential palace to meet a senior government official and ask a bunch of pointless questions about Mauritania 's security arrangements before coming to the point .
What about the secret prison ?
The government official laughs .
That sounds like nonsense to me , he says .
Back in New York , at the modest Empire State Building offices of Human Rights Watch , looking glum and tired , Sifton briefs Garlasco .
" I went at it from every different angle .
I set up interviews with all these officials and politicos and army people .
They all said the old government would have done it in a heartbeat — not these new guys . "
" So our source was wrong ? "
" I think he got bad information . "
A year and a half ago , through a reporter at Newsweek , Sifton got a look at a batch of flight logs that linked CIA planes to the secret prisons that hold several dozen " high value " prisoners , including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , the architect of 9/11 .
The logs seemed to point to one location in Poland and another possibly in Romania .
On a trip to Afghanistan last September , Sifton was able to connect the transfer of the ghost prisoners to a specific flight that had landed at a small airfield in Poland , which suggested that the world 's most notorious terrorists were being held in an old Soviet - era intelligence facility nearby .
A couple of reporters were coming to the same conclusion , but nobody had published anything .
Twice the story was about to hit the press , first in the Washington Post piece that won Dana Priest a controversial Pulitzer prize .
After the editor of the Post was summoned to a meeting with President Bush himself , Priest withheld the words Poland and Romania from her story when it was published in early November , adding this disclaimer : " The Washington Post is not publishing the names of the Eastern European countries involved in the covert program , at the request of senior U. S. officials . "
Stunned by this , Sifton told every journalist who called where he thought the prisons might be .
From then on , every newspaper or news broadcast that ran a story on the secret prisons in Poland and Romania attributed the information not to its own reporting but to Human Rights Watch .
Finally , on December 5 , an ABC reporter named Brian Ross told Sifton he had made the breakthrough , confirming the prison sites through his own CIA sources .
Would Sifton give a supporting quote on camera for the evening show ?
He certainly would .
But when the show aired that night , it started with an announcement : " ABC News has been able to identify two countries in Eastern Europe where there were in fact CIA facilities to hold terror suspects in secret , but the CIA has asked ABC not to name the two countries , citing security concerns . "
Once again , the information was attributed to John Sifton .
But this time , his pale , earnest face was caught on camera .
" The military and the CIA are not infallible , " he told ABC .
That 's when the Justice Department began leak investigations , and Sifton did n't even have the thin protection of being a journalist .
In the weeks that followed , he and Garlasco stopped talking freely on the phone .
There were nervous jokes about wiretaps .
They grew careful of e-mails .
Their sources dried up .
On a crisp day in March , Garlasco is running cold calls from a thick duty roster of all the soldiers and contractors who have served at Abu Ghraib , complete with their home addresses and phone numbers — just a little telemarketing in hell .
This number has been disconnected .
. . .
The number you are calling has call intercept ....
The number you are calling has call intercept .
. . .
The number you are calling has call intercept ....
Sometimes there are sudden breaks , tantalizing with possibility .
Like the day Garlasco 's sitting in his office when the phone rings and it's Sifton with a tip about a secret prison on a Navy vessel .
Garlasco finds it in a military database .
" It 's part of the Military Sealift Command Fleet 's Maritime Prepositioning Force , operating out of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean , where it prepositions Naval Mobile Construction Battalion equipment , fleet hospital equipment , expeditionary - airfield material , and headquarters - unit - support material .
It also alternately holds evil Arab terrorist motherfuckers . "
The source seems credible and the story has a certain logic , but the lead proves impossible to confirm .
Late in March , Garlasco flies to Little Rock to meet a soldier with a story about abuse at a detention facility in a small base in a town called Al Qa'im .
" We 're here with Ben Allbright , and the date is the twenty - first .
Ben , I just wanted to make sure that we have your permission to record you . "
" You do . "
" So you were there when Abu Ghraib broke ? "
" We were at Habbaniyah at the time . "
Allbright is twenty - five years old and already has eight years in the military , having joined as a junior in high school .
He 's bright and patriotic and says that he would blindfold prisoners and bind their hands , then put them in metal Conex boxes that were like big ovens in the heat and that he'd hit the box with metal rods or rocks to keep the prisoners awake .
Allbright saw some guys get beaten .
" I mean beat — bloody nose , bloody face .
One guy , it started off with a couple gut shots , a punch to the neck .
The chair had a little bar down here , you know ?
Shoved him down , put the chair on top of him .
" There was definitely a push to get more intel , " he says , a sense of " do what you have to do . "
On April 9 , Garlasco gets an update from Captain Fishback on the Army 's investigation into his charges .
Marc ,
Like I said on the phone , I wo n't be surprised at all if the investigation wraps up while I 'm out in the field .
I expect that the Army will try to portray HRW in a negative light .
I am also still concerned about the investigation " scapegoating " younger soldiers with no officer accountability .
By now the plates are long gone , and Jeff has friends waiting .
The mood turns for a moment .
He does n't know if it is true , Jeff says , but someone reliable told him they stopped the harsh interrogations after he left Iraq .
Garlasco says he wants to give credit for the good things , and he would love to write that if he can confirm it .
At the end of confessions like this there is always a feeling of emotional overflow , a kind of patriotic stir in the blood as these young men struggle with their vision of American decency .
Jeff looks like a college boy with an especially aggressive sports buzz .
Garlasco has the long patient mug of the coach who just decided to recruit him .
" The things I saw were wrong , " Jeff says .
" I made a decision there in Iraq to start doing what I think is right .
This is about clarity .
Clarity is a good thing . "
They stand up and shake hands and there is a sense of mutual gratitude , a sense that something good has been accomplished .
For Garlasco , the feeling lasts the whole time he walks down the hall and opens the door to his room and sits down at his computer , and also during the time it takes him to log on to Yahoo !
News .
Back in December , the Army said the new Army Field Manual would soon be finished and coming to a footlocker near you .
It would answer Fishback 's questions and McCain 's amendment with some clear rules and old - fashioned standards .
Then the delays began .
Now it is being held up again , and this time Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld explains :
" There is a debate over the difference between a prisoner of war under the Geneva Convention and an unlawful combatant in a situation that is different from the situation envisioned by the Geneva Convention , and those issues are being wrestled with at the present time . "
And so it is that Garlasco drives back up Strom Thurmond 's insanely green highway and misses his connecting flight and gets stranded in the City of Brotherly Love , finally arriving home in a small plane that slips through a battery of black clouds .
At home , his wife is healthy again .
His five - year - old is thrilled with her birthday doll , which can drink from a bottle .
On his answering machine , he finds a message from a friend at the CIA who wants to talk .

A man about forty years of age tells the story from when he was a teenager in upscale suburban Detroit of his and three of his friends ' fascination with the mysterious and doomed Lisbon sisters .
In 1974 , the sisters were seventeen year old Therese , sixteen year old Mary , fifteen year old Bonnie , fourteen year old Lux , and thirteen year old Cecilia .
Their fascination still remains as they try to piece together the entire story .
The sisters were mysteries if only because of having a strict and overprotective upbringing by their father , who taught math at the girls ' private co-ed school , and overly devout Catholic mother , who largely dictated the household rules .
The story focuses primarily on two incidents and the resulting situations on the girls ' lives .
The first was an action by Cecilia to deal with her emotions over her life .
And the second was the relationship between Lux - the sister who pushed the boundaries of the household rules most overtly in doing what most teenagers want to .

Researchers had never found a subject with a perfect memory — then along came Jill Price .
Photo : Bryce DuffyIt 's a Monday afternoon in November , and I 'm driving down Ventura Boulevard with Jill Price , the woman who can't forget .
Price , who is 43 , has spent most of her life here in Los Angeles , and she remembers everything .
In the space of two minutes , she tells me about the former motel lodge with a bear in front , the Courtyard hotel that used to be a Hilton , and a bowling alley — since replaced by a Marshalls — where a Nicolas Cage film was shot .
All this comes pouring out so fast , I wonder aloud whether Price has had too much coffee .
She laughs , says no , pulls slightly at her blond hair , and starts up again .
Right over there , she says , is a car wash : " I was talking to the guy there last summer , and I was telling him about the first time I ever went to the car wash — on August 30 , 1978 .
And he was freaking out . "
Soon , Price , generally a gentle soul , has moved on to a rant about a TV program she just saw : " It was about an event that happened in 2002 .
So they kept going back to Saturday , June 19 , 2002 .
Well , June 19 , 2002 , was not a Saturday !
It was a Wednesday .
It was pissing me off . "

Diane Sawyer interviews Jill Price on ABC News .
I first saw Price last May in a YouTube clip of her on 20/20 .
Diane Sawyer asks Price , an avid television viewer , to identify certain significant dates in broadcast history .
When did CBS air the " Who shot JR ? " episode of Dallas ?
When was All in the Family 's baby episode shown ?
And so on .
Price nails every question .
She not only gives the date for the final episode of MASH but describes the weather that day .
The most remarkable moment comes when Sawyer asks Price when Princess Grace died .
She immediately answers , " September 14 , 1982 — that was the first day I started 12th grade . "
For once , it seems that the memory lady has blown it .
Sawyer laughs nervously and tries gently to right her guest : " September 10 , 1982 . "
Price misunderstands , thinking she 's being prompted to identify another event — the possibility that she 's being corrected apparently does n't occur to her .
No , Sawyer says , she has made a mistake ; according to the book that 20/20's producers were using as a source , Princess Grace died on September 10 .
Price stands her ground , and not 60 seconds later , a producer breaks in : " The book is wrong . "
Price is right after all !
Until recently , no one had ever heard of Jill Price .
Her friends and family knew her memory was remarkable , but nobody in the scientific community did .
Her road to stardom started in June 2000 ( Monday , June 5 , to be exact ) , when she stumbled upon a Web page for James McGaugh , a UC Irvine neuroscientist who specializes in learning and memory , and decided to send him an email describing her unusual ability to recall the past .
McGaugh wrote back 90 minutes later .
He tells me he was skeptical at first , but it did n't take long for him to become convinced that Price was something special ; he soon introduced her to two of his collaborators , Larry Cahill and Elizabeth Parker .
The three researchers interviewed Price many times over the next five years , but they kept the story to themselves .
Finally , McGaugh and company were ready to share what they had found .
In February 2006 , their article , " A Case of Unusual Autobiographical Remembering , " appeared in the journal Neurocase .
Shortly thereafter , the UC Irvine press office peddled the story to The Orange County Register — and Price 's world was turned upside down .
The newspaper article , which identified her only as " AJ , " appeared on March 13 , 2006 .
Within hours , UC Irvine was besieged with inquiries .
Four weeks later , the story went national : Price was interviewed on NPR's Morning Edition ( still under the AJ pseudonym ) .
An editor at Free Press eventually tracked her down , and a book deal followed ; Price would tell her own story , this time under her own name .
The media played along , withholding further news on the woman who could n't forget until the book 's release .
Since then , Price has been on a nonstop media junket .
Diane Sawyer actually had her on twice in one day ( on Good Morning America and 20/20 ) .
By the time I met Price , she had been interviewed by Oprah and had been featured in every major newspaper from USA Today to The Wall Street Journal .
Often the pieces focused on the pain she felt because of her inability to forget difficult moments .
As I followed Price 's story , I was fascinated but doubtful .
I am a cognitive psychologist , and to me something did n't smell right .
Everyone seems to have an uncle or cousin with " photographic " memory , but damned if they can actually give you a phone number to reach that person .
The only serious scientific paper documenting photographic memory was published nearly 40 years ago , and that study has never been replicated .
Price , however , is eminently real .
I spent the better part of two days with her , meeting her friends and family and watching her at the office .
At the end , I can honestly say that in my decade as a professor of psychology , I 've never encountered anyone remotely like Jill Price .
Ordinary human memory is a mess .
Most of us can recall the major events in our lives , but the memory of Homo sapiens pales when compared with your average laptop .
It takes us far longer to store data ( you might have to hear a phone number five to 10 times before you can repeat it ) ; it 's easy for us to forget things we 've learned ( try reciting anything from your sophomore history class ) ; and it 's sometimes hard to dislodge outdated information ( St. Petersburg will always remain Leningrad to me ) .
Worse , our memories are vulnerable to contamination and distortion .
Lawyers can readily fool us with suggestive questions ; false memories can easily be implanted .
The fundamental problem is the seemingly haphazard fashion in which our memories are organized .
On a computer , every single bit of information is stored at a specific location , from which it can always be retrieved .
Human recall is hit or miss .
Neuroscientific research tells us that our brains do n't use a fixed - address system , and memories tend to overlap , combine , and disappear for reasons no one yet understands .
The one thing we do know is rather vague : Memories live in the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex .
After that , the entire question of how memory works is up for grabs .
For example , where precisely in the hippocampus ( or prefrontal cortex ) is my memory of reading Kurt Vonnegut for the first time ?
If I try to summon that experience , I am likely to wind up with a blur — a half dozen indistinct recollections .
And no brain - scan technology will help me bring it into better focus .
So when I hear about Price 's feats , my mind boggles .
From the perspective of evolution , finding a human being with memory that works with the precision of a computer would be like finding someone with bones made of steel .
The type of memory system we have — in technical terms , context - dependent rather than location - addressable — has been around for several hundred million years .
The existence of a human brain that works completely differently is astronomically unlikely .

The three UC Irvine scientists who studied her decided that her case deserved its own name — hyperthymestic syndrome , academic Greek for " exceptional memory " — and it 's not hard to see why .
I come prepared with a stack of questionnaires , and when we return to her house , Price is kind enough to let me administer my tests , easily blowing through the first few .
I ask , for example , if she can tell me some dates of famous accidents and airline crashes ; she 's all but unstoppable .
She instantly retrieves from memory the exact dates of the explosions of space shuttle Challenger and Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie , Scotland .
She remembers not just that September 25 , 1978 , was when a PSA flight crashed in San Diego but also that the jet collided with a Cessna .
She can go in either direction , disaster to date or date to disaster .
When I say " January 13 , 1982 , " Price has no trouble recalling the Air Florida flight that plummeted into the Potomac .
A Day in the Life
Jill Price keeps a detailed diary of her activities , including the time she spent with the author .
According to McGaugh 's Neurocase article , Price is even more astounding on the events of her own life .
At the scientists ' behest , for example , she recalled — without warning and in just 10 minutes — what she 'd done on every Easter since 1980 .
" April 6 , 1980 : 9th grade , Easter vacation ends .
April 19 , 1981 : 10th grade , new boyfriend , H. April 11 , 1982 : 11th grade , grandparents visiting for Passover ... " Soon , though , the limitations of her memory begin to show .
My next questionnaire is on the just - concluded 2008 presidential election , and here things go less well .
She is off by a few days on Hillary Clinton 's withdrawal from the race and clueless on the Iowa caucuses .
Price nails both the Republican convention and the St. Louis vice presidential debate ( she was at a regular Thursday dinner that night ) but can't say the precise date when Obama clinched the nomination .
When it comes to the 2004 election , she opts out entirely .
I soon find that except for her own personal history and certain categories like television and airplane crashes , Price 's memory is n't much better than anyone else 's .
She struggled in school , is no good at history before 1965 , and seems genuinely miffed that she was once asked when the Magna Carta was signed ( " Do I look like I 'm 500 years old ? " ) .
For a scientist like me , the real test is to see how well Price can remember something new .
I am especially interested in memory distortions .
If you read an average person a list of words like thread , pin , eye , sewing , sharp , point , prick , thimble , haystack , thorn , hurt , injection , syringe , cloth , and knitting , and then ask them to repeat the words , they 'll likely imagine they 've heard needle even though it 's not on the list .
Can Price sail past the trap of memory distortion ?
No , she can't .
I read her five lists of words drawn from a psychological test known as the DRM , and not only does she miss a number of words , she also recalls hearing three I did n't say .
Her performance may be a little above average , but no more than that .
If Price 's memory of her own history is so precise , why is it so average for everything else ?
Or , more to the point , if her memory for everything else is so ordinary , why is her memory of her own history so extraordinary ?
The answer has nothing to do with memory and everything to do with personality .
Price remembers so much about herself because she thinks about herself — and her past — almost constantly .
She still has every stuffed animal she 's ever gotten , enough ( as she showed me in a photograph ) to completely cover the surface of her childhood bed .
She has 2,000 videotapes and countless audiotapes , not to mention more than 50,000 pages of diary entries in idiosyncratic handwriting — so dense that it 's almost unreadable .
Until recently she owned a copy of every TV Guide since summer 1989 .
I 'm not sure Price wants to catalog her life like this , but she can't help herself .
When she tells me that one of her biggest regrets in life is that no one followed her around with a microphone during her childhood , I 'm not the least bit surprised .
In her own words , she lives as if there 's a split screen running in her mind — one half on the present , the other on the past .
The onset of Price 's exceptional recall seems to be closely tied to a painful event : her family 's move from South Orange , New Jersey , to Los Angeles on June 29 , 1974 .
For Price , life can be neatly divided into periods before and after that childhood trauma , and her detailed memories begin just after the move .
Even as an adult , Price continues to be haunted by separation anxiety .
She has lived with her parents her entire life , and her anxiety about moving recurred in 2003 , at age 37 , when her parents decided to take a smaller house .
Just as Price had n't wanted to leave South Orange as a child , she dreaded leaving the only home she 'd known since she was 8 .
Packing her memorabilia for storage took more than a month .
Perhaps the hardest part was the thought that she'd have to leave behind a piece of wallpaper on which she 'd recorded minor personal details for nearly 30 years .
In the end , and much to the consternation of the family 's realtor , Price took a razor blade to the wall and peeled off one more cherished souvenir .
In the time I spend with her , I notice that the not - particularly - foulmouthed Price is very fond of the expression that so - and - so " shits and farts just like the rest of us " — as in " Joe Movie Star might make a lot of money , but he still shits and farts like anyone else . "
By the third time I hear her utter this phrase , I can't help but notice its relevance to her own life :
Price may display unusually complete recall of her own past , but her memory is the same blurry patchwork as everyone else 's .
The difference is that she scans her past relentlessly .
Every time we think about something , and especially how it connects to something else , we get better at remembering it — a phenomenon that psychologists call elaborative encoding .
Price has spent her whole life ruminating on the past , constructing timelines and lists , and contemplating the connections between one February 19 and the next .
Dates and memories are her constant companions , and as a result she 's really good at remembering her past .
End of story .
The memory woman clings tightly to her past .

Why were Price 's abilities blown so far out of proportion ?
I would n't blame Price ; she 's as happy to tell what she does n't remember as what she does .
But her story has taken on a life of its own .
It started with that 2006 journal article : Although the scientists knew about Price 's diaries and compulsions , little in the paper speaks to the question of whether it might be personality , not memory , that makes her extraordinary .
Then there was the editor at Free Press who gave Price 's book the manifestly false title The Woman Who Can't Forget , along with the equally overblown subtitle The Extraordinary Story of Living With the Most Remarkable Memory Known to Science .
And do n't forget the credulous media that ate up the story — without , apparently , ever seeking a second opinion from scientists not involved in the case .
Lost in all the hype is an inconvenient fact :
Price 's brain was scanned more than two years ago , and the results — not yet published — apparently do n't support the notion that she 's some kind of memory goddess .
Her hippocampus and prefrontal cortex are reportedly normal .
The one significant aberration , according to Price — who was told about the scans by doctors who wo n't discuss them publicly — is that her brain resembles those of people with obsessive - compulsive disorder .
The true nature of Price 's memory becomes clear to me by the end of our first day of interviews , but I do n't know whether to tell her .
I try to keep my thoughts to myself when I meet her on day two in her office , where she works as a hyperkinetic , hyperorganized school administrator .
But she wants to know what I 'm going to write .
I panic — worrying that her feelings will be hurt — and wonder how I 'm going to explain .
While I 'm stalling , she tells me about an article on memory published that morning in The Wall Street Journal ; she 's mentioned and wants to know what I think .
She prints it out for me , and I skim through it .
McGaugh , the lead author of the original Neurocase article , is quoted — talking , of all things , about elaborative encoding .
I start slowly — griping about the newspaper article , which I find to be a bit sloppy scientifically ; I scarcely mention Price or what the author has to say about her .
But eventually I come to the main point and read aloud from the critical paragraph : " What if you want to remember more about each passing day ?
One simple method is to keep a journal .
Writing down a few thoughts and events every day not only makes a tangible record , it also requires you to reflect .
" Is n't that Price to a T ?
Does n't it explain why her forte is autobiographical memory rather than , say , recalling dates in ancient history ?
I think the answers are obviously yes , and I tell her so .
" But I did n't search this out , " she protests , denying that her obsessions have anything to do with her memory .
No , but that does n't matter , I say .
I explain how her rumination on the past is n't something she does voluntarily , but whenever she does it , the connections between her memories are strengthened .
Price is quiet for a moment , thinking about what I 've said .
" This is OCD , " she says softly .
" I have OCD of my memories .
" Three similar hyperthymestics have come forward since the 2006 journal article , each with spectacular autobiographical memory , and all three have similar OCD - like habits .
They all collect things and are obsessed with dates and events .
( One went so far as to write an unpublished work titled The Book of Bob . )
The truth is , most people could remember their lives in considerable detail if they contemplated them with the same manic intensity .
When I bring my theory about Price to McGaugh , he concedes that I could be right .
" We remain puzzled and open to alternative interpretations , " he says .
But even if Price 's memory is just the byproduct of obsession , she 's still amazing .
I 've come to think of her as the Michael Jordan of autobiography .
Jordan was n't born the greatest basketball player of all time ; he became the greatest , combining considerable but not unique innate talent with an incredible amount of hard work shooting free throws and practicing jumpers long after most of his peers were out carousing .
Whether intentionally or not , Price has shown the same sort of daily dedication to chronicling her own life .
For her , it 's been a mixed blessing .
Price does n't just remember the past , she feels it — vividly — and bad personal experiences linger .
But she can't really imagine being like the rest of us , either .
For two days , she 's been asking what it 's like to be me .
Do I remember what happened on November 10 , 2003 ?
Or November 10 , 1998 ?
Nope , nada .
I have n't a clue .
When I jokingly ask , " So , you think the rest of us are retarded ? " she just giggles .
She does n't , she says , but she also would n't give up her memory for anything .

Last week , the venerable media tome Entertainment Weekly published a list titled 20 All - Time Coolest Heroes in Pop Culture .
As with any list of this kind , everyone with an opinion and a keyboard will take issue with some item or another , and we at GeekDad are no different .
While we were surprised by the inclusion of many an iconic geek - favorite character , the list was , in the end , still too mainstream for our tastes .
As such , we feel the need to nip and tuck , with an eye towards including more favorites from the geekier side of pop culture ( while keeping as close as possible to the nature or type of the original character referenced on the list ) .
Here then is our edited version :
# 20 : The EW list had Sydney Bristow of Alias in this slot .
While we approve of Mr. Abram 's first successful show , we feel Ms. Bristow could n't hold a candle to another lady spy-adventurer , either in combat prowess or looking good in a leather jumpsuit .
Replace Sydney Bristow with Emma Peel .
# 19 : EW says Atticus Finch , from To Kill a Mockingbird .
Awesome character from an awesome movie adapted from an awesome book .
But Finch just does n't make it into the geek pantheon .
Problem is , how many lawyers do you know who qualify to be on a geek favorites list ?
Well , we can think of one who went so far as to be appointed the acting president of all ( remaining ) humanity .
Replace Atticus Finch with Romo Lampkin from Battlestar Galactica -
So say we all !
# 18 : Batman in the EW list , and that sounds fine to us .
But the Frank Miller version instead of the Christian Bale version , mayhap ?
# 17 : Nancy Drew .
Yes , she 's a mighty smart young sleuth , but is she geeky enough ?
We think not .
We 'd like to suggest her spiritual successor is a better fit for this geeky list .
__Replace Nancy Drew with Velma __from Scooby - Doo .
# 16 : EW likes them some terr 'ist - killin ' Jack Bauer from 24 .
While it's hard to resist a character whose fictional exploits became the justification for a change in America 's attitude towards habeus corpus rights , we think we can .
In fact , we can think of more than one character as alternate to this stalwart defender of American pie .
Replace Jack Bauer with the original Mission : Impossible team .
# 15 : EW seems to have a thing for a good cop breaking the rules for a greater justice , and in this slot they pick Dirty Harry .
Once again , we love the man with the .44mag , but he just does n't fit into the geeky realm quite as much as some others might .
And if we 're going with vigilante lawmen , why not go all the way ?
Replace Dirty Harry with Judge Dredd .
# 14 : Delving back to the classic westerns , EW celebrates Will Kane from High Noon .
How about we find another classic " western " hero just trying to make his way in a universe that 's out to get him .
__ Replace Will Kane with Mal Reynolds__ from Firefly / Serenity .
# 13 : EW gives a nod towards the classic blacksploitation character Foxy Brown .
While we would never want to argue with Foxy ( as played by Pam Grier ) , we still can't consider her quite geeky enough for our list .
But you know who would be geeky enough ?
Storm , from the X - Men , if she were played by Pam Grier .
Replace Foxy Brown with Storm .
# 12 : It 's only here that EW really starts hitting the true geeky heroes .
At # 12 is the man who started it all , as far as science fiction military heroes go .
Keep Captain James T. Kirk .
# 11 : EW goes for a little post - apocolyptic , pre-DUI Mel Gibson as Mad Max .
We 're cool with that !
Keep Mad Max .
# 10 : Spider - Man was ours first !
It seems almost unfair that he's hit the big time with pop culture .
He lived the geek dream : he was a nerd who got superpowers and got to be a jock , at least when no one knew it was him .
Keep Spider - Man .
#9 : EW gets truly medieval on us by picking Robin Hood .
But if we 're going to be talking arrow - slinging do - gooders in green with liberal , wealth - redistributing agendas , let 's at least make sure he 's got cool facial hair .
Replace Robin Hood with Green Arrow .
# 8 : You 've got to say this about EW – when they get it right , they really get it right .
The eighth slot goes to Buffy the Vampire Slayer , and we say they can keep Buffy the Vampire Slayer .
# 7 : As we round the clubhouse turn , EW starts to demonstrate just how much geek heroes have begun to pervade the highest echelons of pop culture .
They can keep Han Solo right here , thank you very much !
# 6 : The man who made the witty rejoinder a staple of summertime action films ( even though Die Hard was actually a Christmas Movie ) , EW puts John McClane at # 6 .
He 's cool , but he 's not quite part of the geek fabric .
We really think there 's one other reluctant hero with excellent hunting skills who knows how to get out of tight places who fits our bill .
Replace John McClane with Aragorn .
# 5 : When EW says " Ellen Ripley , " we say " how high ? ! "
No , it does n't make sense , but neither would our replacing her on the list .
Keep Ellen Ripley .
# 4 : You do n't get more mainstream pop culture than Harry Potter , but that 's mostly because of pop culture 's shift towards geekdom than anything else , and we 're fine with that .
Keep Harry Potter .
# 3 : Who would leave Superman off this list , geeky or not ?
EW did n't , and neither will we .
Keep Superman .
# 2 : No muss , no fuss : keep Indiana Jones .
#1 : In the top spot , EW puts the spy with suave dripping from his Saville Row suits , and if we were just talking about cool heroes and plain old pop culture , then James Bond would have earned this throne .
But we 're not , and so he does n't .
The quandary , then , is who is so super cool , and also rocks the geek world like no other ?
We know who .
Yes , we know he's not really a spy , per se , but he is an intergalactic ( inter - dimensional , inter - temporal ) troubleshooter , which is close enough .
And he sounds British , too .
So we say replace James Bond with The Doctor from Doctor Who ( fixed , because Doctor Who fans are very particular ) .
But that 's just our opinion .
Any more substitutions you 'd like to see ?
Let us know in the comments !
You never know , maybe EW will amend their list !
Government troops were posted to Fort Augustus
Archaeologists are to investigate if a military encampment used by government troops in the 18th Century lies under a proposed location for a caravan park .
A landscape painting of Fort Augustus by 18th Century artist Thomas Sandby depicts Redcoat tents in the area .
The Redcoats were in the Highlands to fight the Jacobites .
An initial survey has prompted archaeologists to suggest remains of a camp maybe found .
The details are reported on a Highland Council online database .
The Highland Historic Environment Record holds records on thousands of historical sites dating from prehistoric times to the modern day .
Barracks were first built in Cill Chuimein - which would become known as Fort Augustus - following the collapse of the Jacobite uprising of 1715 .
A new fort was later constructed and named in 1729 after William Augustus , the second son of King George II .
William , the Duke of Cumberland , went on to crush Bonnie Prince Charlie 's forces at Culloden in 1746 .
Stones marking the boundary of Crown lands in Fort Augustus from the same period of time have also been identified by historians .
They are believed to be on land seized from a supporter of the Jacobite cause .

Update :
Just think of the efficiency that bikers could bring to the workplace , unconstrained in high - tech fibers , warmed to peak performance by a brisk ride to the office , the sweat of exertion staining desks and documents .
...
Well , maybe not .
But you can still accrue the energizing and planet - sparing benefits of bicycle commuting while reporting for duty fresh - smelling and professionally attired .
And next Thursday 's Bike to Work festivities are the perfect time to give it a try .
We consulted mountain bike pioneer , cycle - industry titan and fashion icon Gary Fisher , whose eponymous company is at the head of a resurgence in practical urban bicycles .
According to Fisher - who checked in from the airport on his way to London to be fitted for a cycle - worthy suit - skeptics who see biking as the enemy of professionalism may actually be looking at things exactly backward .
" It 's impressive to people when you arrive on a bicycle looking elegant , " he says .
" Obviously a bike rider is a superior species . "
And it does n't have to be hard .
" People say , ' I 'm going to get too dirty ; I 'm going to get too sweaty , ' " acknowledges graphic designer Meli Burgueño , whose clientele can have her schlepping from downtown to the Richmond to the Marina and back in one workday .
She suggests using straps or clips for pants leg and bringing along a clean undershirt on hot days or dry socks on wet ones to mitigate these worries .
The Bay Area never gets extremely humid , she points out , and " if you take it easy , if you take your time and you organize your ride " to minimize hills and traffic , sweating should n't be so much of an issue , though on hotter days she totes a little soap and deodorant .
Generally , she says , " whatever you feel comfortable with while walking , you should be able to do with your bike . "
And though you can bring along sneakers or flats for riding , most dress shoes work fine .
You should watch out for toe clips or spiky BMX pedals that may mar your kicks ( cheap , rubber - block pedals are ideal ) , but Burgueño does n't hesitate to wear high heels .
" It 's easier to pedal than to walk in them , " she claims .
In the spirit of improvisation , Fisher even suggests trying out an umbrella when things get wet .
His favorite dryness solution , though harder to find , is a bike - specific poncho with thumb loops , which offers head - to - toe shelter and plenty of airflow .
But the point is that it 's easier to adapt to commuting than some assume .
The right bike also helps .
One of the best solutions is a European - style machine , with fenders , full chain guards and ladies ' models with a step - through frame that wo n't interfere with skirts - but many of these features can be cobbled onto any street or mountain bike .
Not only does the Euro configuration keep clothing clean and untangled , but its upright stance encourages a mellower , less perspiration - intensive style of locomotion .
Quick - change artistry
Which is not to say you can't ride far , quickly or over hill and dale while making it work .
It just takes a different kind of planning .
Three or four times a week , Anthony Justman commutes 30 miles from the Western Addition to Sony 's offices in Foster City , in full Lycra kit and riding , he says , " as fast as I can . "
It helps that his work site has lockers and showers ( for which a nearby gym can provide a decent substitute ) , allowing him to make the transition from racer to lawyer in 20 minutes or less .
Justman keeps several changes of work clothes at the office , occasionally dropping items off at the local dry cleaners and taking laundry home as needed .
Fresh bike gear for the trip home is n't a bad idea , or you can use Justman 's trick of drying his clothes in the sun during the day .
It 's certainly a different approach than that of Burgueño and Fisher , but with similar results :
He rides to work in the manner he enjoys while maintaining an air of respectability .
And while he usually gets by with slacks and a crisp dress shirt rather than a suit , he adds , " I like to look dapper . "
Wear it well
Avoid black marks on your pants cuffs with a good chain cleaning from the SFBC Bike Doctors ' maintenance booth at the Fillmore Farmers ' Market , 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. Saturday ( www.sfbike.org/chain#3225).
And then dial in your functional finery next Thursday from 6 to 10 p.m. at the San Francisco Bike Coalition 's Bike Away from Work Party ( www.sfbike.org/chain#3078) at the Rickshaw stop , with raffles , DJs and a bike - wear fashion show .
Also , keep a monocle peeled for the dashing wheelmen ( and women ) of the San Francisco Tweed Ride ( www.sftweed.com) and their occasional sartorially advanced jaunts through the city .
For a full schedule of next Thursday 's Bike to Work Day events , go to www.sfbike.org/btwd.
Bike About Town is presented by the San Francisco Bicycle Coalition , a 10,000 - member nonprofit dedicated to creating safer streets and more livable communities by promoting the bicycle for everyday transportation .

As sea levels rise , we need to find ways to adapt .
Ancient civilisations could give us some tips ( Image : Paul Kay / SplashdownDirect / Rex )
The village of Los Buchillones in northern Cuba is now 150 metres out to sea .
This photo shows the dyked excavation area , as it was in 2004 ( Image : Jago Cooper ) Los Buchillones is a rare chance to study how ancient civilisations adapted to rising sea levels ( Image : Jago Cooper ) Field directors Jago Cooper and Roberto Valcàrcel Rojas , and colleagues , study the remains of Los Buchillones ( Image : Jago Cooper ) Cooper is seen here with the original discover of the site , Nelson Torna ( Image : Jago Cooper ) Houses in Los Buchillones were built on stilts over a lagoon .
The 2004 excavation revealed many structural house posts like this one ( Image : Jago Cooper )

WITH rising seas lapping at coastal cities and threatening to engulf entire islands in the not - too - distant future , it ’s easy to assume our only option will be to abandon them and head for the hills .
There may be another way , however .
Archaeological sites in the Caribbean , dating back to 5000 BC , show that some ancient civilisations had it just as bad as anything we are expecting .
Yet not only did they survive a changing coastline and more storm surges and hurricanes : they stayed put …
Wondering why Engadget still has a permanent ban on covering Monster Cable products , even after the company tried to make amends for its frivolous lawsuit and strong - arm settlement offer against Monster Mini Golf ?
Well , it 's because the company has n't actually changed its ways -- not only did we just catch them trying to peddle their overpriced snakeoil cables using rigged displays for the third time , Noel Lee 's lawyers have dusted themselves off and filed a lawsuit against Monster Transmission , a performance auto supplier in Florida .
Yes , Monster Cable is suing an American automotive manufacturing company in the middle of a recession .
Brilliant PR move , do n't you think ?
So yeah , the ban stands -- and we 'd recommend steering your friends to any number of cable brands that are just as good , much cheaper , and far less burdened with the stink of desperation than any of Monster 's products .
Monster Cable 's sending out a statement saying " Monster does not have an issue with Monster Transmission " and that the " case was filed last year , before the Monster Mini Golf matter was settled " but it sounds to us like they 're playing fast and loose with their timeline to distract people -- we just spoke to Achilles Thomas , one of the owners of Monster Transmission , and he said the initial lawsuit was filed between October and November of 2008 and has n't come close to settling , even though the Mini Golf case settled in January .
Naughty , naughty .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - U.S. power plants will burn about 2.3 percent less coal in 2009 than they did last year as the recession trims electricity demand , the government ’s top energy forecaster said on Tuesday .
Power plants will burn about 1,017.49 million short tons of coal in 2009 , down from 1,041.6 million tons burned in 2008 , the Energy Information Administration said in its monthly short - term outlook .
This month ’s EIA forecast called for the burning of a bit more coal in 2009 than last month ’s outlook , which expected U.S. power plants to burn about 2.6 percent less coal .
U.S. coal production in 2009 should fall amid weak power demand .
U.S. coal production will fall about 4.9 percent in 2009 “ in response to lower total domestic coal consumption combined with export declines , ” the EIA said .
Softer global coal demand was expected to cut 2009 U.S. coal exports by about 12 million tons , a 14 percent decrease , the EIA said .
But the EIA said an expected increase in global coal demand in 2010 should result in a 15 percent jump in exports in 2010 .

FOX news trys to win over the massive movement of loosely affiliated groups numbering in the millions .
The " Freedom Movement " thanks to the Ron Paul Revolution and the power of syndicate radio and film is gaining momentum .
So much so like synchronized swimmers FOX news pundits spanning radio and tv have done a 180 , talking about the constitution , gun rights and Ron Paul non -stop .
Glen Beck has gone so far as organizing the 9/12 campaign and tea party tax protests , Anne Coulter likes Ron Paul all of sudden .
Freaky twilight zone or hardcore psychological op ?
Well now here is the kicker , you ’re one click away from becoming the " FOX nation " .
The Foxnation.com website is the most blatant attempt yet at how the Right Wing paradigm is trying to reabsorb all of the elements of conservative society who saw through Bush .
The very same " fringe " they were just months ago calling radical , and deserve to be in camps .
The site layout and their " slanted content " is exactly like infowars.com , how low and parasitic these criminals will stoop to maintain control over the political paradigm is astounding to say the least .
Unfortunately to them the true patriots of this country will own the boards on this site and FOXnation.com will simply be a nexus point in the battle .
Education for the FOXoholic ’s will be swift , and will serve only to dethrone what little if any credibility FOX news ever had .

A 7 - year - old boy who loved playing outdoors and riding on the back of his daddy ’s Harley died Saturday morning after a Liberty County couple opened fire on him and three other alleged trespassers , Liberty County Sheriff ’s Cpl. Hugh Bishop said .
“ He was just a little country boy … who liked to kick off his shoes , ” said Joseph Breland , a neighbor and close family friend .
Donald Coffey Jr. , his father and friends were on their way back from joy riding near a levee and swimming in the Trinity River around 9 p.m.
Thursday when homeowners Gale and Sheila Muhs fired at them with a 12 - gauge shotgun , police say .
The Muhses , both 45 , are charged with aggravated assault and are being held in the Liberty County Jail in lieu of $ 25,000 bail each .
The couple is expected to appear in state district court in the coming week .
Authorities are considering upgrading the charge to murder or capital murder , Bishop said .
The boy , struck in the face , was among eight people , including four children , who had been on the river outing .
Four people , including another child , were shot .
The boy ’s 5 - year - old sister , Destiny , and their father , Donald Coffey Sr. , 36 , were hit but have been treated by doctors and released .
The fourth shooting victim is family friend Patrick Cammack , 30 , whose condition has improved since surgery .
Doctors had to leave a bullet in his head , said his wife , Cindy Nelton , who was also there that night .
Nelton said the ordeal happened over two or three minutes in “ pitch darkness . ”
She said she was driving a sport utility vehicle with the boy ’s mother , Becky Coffey .
Two of the women ’s children , including Destiny , were in the back .
Driving alongside them in a Jeep were Cammack , the elder Coffey , “ Little Donald ” and Cammack ’s son .
The men stopped to use the bathroom and got out of the Jeep near the Muhses ’ home in the Westlake subdivision south of Dayton when a woman ’s voice boomed through the darkness , Nelton said .
In a message peppered with expletives , she said , the voice ordered the group to get their vehicles off the property .
“ And then I heard a shot and our windows were blown out , ” Nelton said .
Nelton , who never saw a shooter , said she immediately stomped on the gas and screamed , “ We ’ve got kids in this vehicle !
Y’all need to stop shooting ! ”
A second shot , and possibly others , came in reply .
‘ There was blood all over ’
Nelton said she sped to safety near a bridge , unaware of the Jeep ’s location .
Becky Coffey opened the door to the SUV to go look for her husband and son .
When the inside light came on , a bloodied Destiny was in the back seat screaming .
“ She said , ‘ Mama , they shot me .
Mommy , they shot me . ’
There was blood all over her , ” Nelton said .
Nelton rushed the girl to a nearby fire station while Becky Coffey frantically searched on foot for her other family members .
The victims were taken to Memorial Hermann Hospital via air ambulance .
Meanwhile , Sheila Muhs — whose home is fronted by a sign warning : “ Trespassers will be shot .
Survivers will be reshot !!
Smile I will ” — had called 911 .
Bishop said the woman told a dispatcher : “ They ’re running over our levee in big - wheel vehicles , and I shot them . ”
Officials have not released the 911 tape .
Nelton said justice , for her , is simple .
“ They need to be dead , ” she said of the Muhses .
On Saturday , authorities were trying to determine details , such as the visibility that night , distance between the victims and the shooters , and property lines in the rural area along the river .
“ Little Donald ” lived his entire life in the area , riding four - wheelers and running along the Trinity ’s banks .
“ You could n’t ask for a better - spirited kid , ” Breland , the neighbor , said .

METRO VANCOUVER ( NEWS 1130 ) – “ Calling it a crisis is no exaggeration , ” according to economists at the Royal Bank , looking at the costs of home ownership in Metro Vancouver .
It says mortgage payments , property taxes and utilities take up more than 88 per cent of typical household income , the latest in a series of record highs for any Canadian market .
The cost of home ownership is up more than eight points over the past year .
The bank says single - detached homes are “ for the rich only , ” requiring nearly 120 per cent of household income to cover the costs .
It even says “ settling for a condo also increasingly looks like a luxury for many . ”
The bank ’s economists conclude that rising interest rates mean “ the situation is poised to deteriorate further , ” meaning “ rental housing will become the only viable option for a growing proportion of households . ”
After Vancouver , the highest cost of carrying a home is in Toronto at 76 per cent while the nationwide average is 54 per cent .
RBC also says Victoria has joined what it calls “ the unaffordable club , ” with costs that eat up 65 per cent of household income .
The B.C. capital had the nation ’s biggest increase in home ownership costs at 2.4 per cent .
While rising prices were the main reason affordability fell between 2015 and 2017 , the bank says that since the middle of last year “ rising interest rates have been the main factor squeezing affordability . ”
RBC adds ,
“ No wonder the current generation of local buyers feels overwhelmed — no other generation has faced as much affordability pressure in this country . ”
It ’s official : Obama creates more czars than the Romanovs
It has finally happened .
With yesterday ’s naming of Border Czar Alan Bersin , the Obama administration has by any reasonable reckoning passed the Romanov Dynasty in the production of czars .
The Romanovs ruled Russia from 1613 with the ascension of Michael I through the abdication of Czar Nicholas II in 1917 .
During that time , they produced 18 czars .
While it is harder to exactly count the number of Obama administration czars , with yesterday ’s appointment it seems fair to say it is now certainly in excess of 18 .
In addition to Bersin , we have energy czar Carol Browner , urban czar Adolfo Carrion , Jr. , infotech czar Vivek Kundra , faith - based czar Joshua DuBois , health reform czar Nancy - Ann DeParle , new TARP czar Herb Allison , stimulus accountability czar Earl Devaney , non-proliferation czar Gary Samore , terrorism czar John Brennan , regulatory czar Cass Sunstein , drug czar Gil Kerlikowske , and Guantanamo closure czar Daniel Fried .
We also have a host of special envoys that fall into the czar category including AfPak special envoy Richard Holbrooke , Mideast peace envoy George Mitchell , special advisor for the Persian Gulf and Southwest Asia Dennis Ross , Sudan special envoy J. Scott Gration and climate special envoy Todd Stern .
That ’s 18 .
This is a very conservative estimate , however .
I will allow you to pick whom you would like out of the remaining candidates .
For example you could count de facto car czar Steve Rattner even though the administration went out of its way to say they were n’t going to have a car czar … before he ultimately emerged as the car czar .
You could count National Director of Intelligence Dennis Blair , often referred to as the intelligence czar , although you might not want to because his job has a different kind of status on the org chart .
I ’m not going to count Paul Volcker who was referred to as Obama ’s economic czar because Obama is not making much use of Volcker ( at least according to reports ) .
But you certainly might want to count people deemed by the media to be the “ cyber security czar ” or the “ AIDs czar ” or the “ green jobs czar ” even if there are reasons to quibble about the designation of one or two of them .
I also wo n’t count Michelle Malkin ’s designation of White House science advisor John Holdren as “ weather czar ” because as a matter of principle I wo n’t count anything that horrifying woman does .
Nonetheless you could certainly call the talented Holdren the nation ’s science “ czar ” without stretching things .
The point is , disqualify who you may for your own list , there are still plenty of czars on the bench who will step up to make the comparison work in favor of Team Obama , if you think have lots and lots of czars is actually something in favor of Team Obama .
( And to be fair : they did n’t create all these slots … just a lot of them . )
Personally , I think from a purely process standpoint all this czarism is a risky business that ends up producing bureaucratic bottlenecks , tensions and inefficiency when not managed extremely carefully .
For now we will give them the benefit of the doubt that they will manage it well .
Though please , please guys , stop now that you are ahead , now that you are officially the most prolific czarist dynasty in history .
For the record , the czars produced by Team Romanov were : Michael I , Alexis I , Fyodor III , Ivan V , Peter the Great , Catherine I , Peter II , Anna , Elizabeth , Peter III , Ivan VI , Catherine the Great , Paul I , Alexander I , Nicholas I , Alexander II , Alexander III , Nicholas II .
For the purposes of giving the Russians an even chance against the president , I am including both the original Romanov line and the descendants of the Holstein - Gottorps , who kept the Romanov name .
I am not including the regency of Sophia , although if you want , go ahead .
Our team still wins .
( Although , I ’ll admit it , it is almost as hard of tracking the Russian succession as it is the structure of our own government these days . )

— Beat The Pain Naturally
When you first feel the signs of a migraine attack coming along , do you immediately pop the pills that your doctor prescribed ?
If you have the common headaches , muscle or joint pains , do you ‘ prescribe ’ a medication for yourself and look for an over - the - counter pain killer ?
It ’s good to rely on medications for the more serious medical conditions that you may have - but for the common aches , pains and health complaints , it really makes much more sense to rely on natural home remedies .
This is especially true because of the recent spate of health news about how some over - the - counter medications are discovered to actually cause more complications to your health after treating a supposedly simple ache or pain in your body .
Why ‘ Natural ’ is the Way to Go when Treating the Most Common Aches , Pains & Health Conditions
Let ’s say that you feel a headache coming along and you swallowed a couple of Aspirins .
This over - the - counter drug is used to relieve minor aches , pains and is also used to reduce fever .
Aspirin is also used as an anti-inflammatory medication and when given in low doses , can be used to repair damaged blood vessels ; that is why it is used on a long - term basis by some individuals who have problems with their heart .
But the side effects of aspirin include stomach bleeding and gastrointestinal ulcers .
When improperly given to children with flu or chickenpox , taking Asprin may cause Reye ’s Syndrome to appear .
This is not to say that Aspirin is something that you should completely steer clear of .
In fact , this drug is one of the most widely - used medications in the world .
However , it does pay to realize that rather than risking the possibility of experiencing undesirable side effects when you are taking over - the - counter medications for the most minor aches and pains – you do have the option of going ‘ natural ‘ .
Although some individuals may scoff at natural treatments being old - fashioned or mere old wives ’ tales , there really are a lot of natural home remedies which are equally effective as over - the - counter drugs .
And the one advantage that natural treatments have over pills is that they do not cause any side effects .
In addition , natural treatments are less expensive , more effective , they are gentler to your body and they are environment - friendly .
The Top 10 Best Natural Home Remedies for the Most Common Aches , Pains & Health Concerns
So what are some of the best natural home remedies for the most common aches , pains and health concerns that people experience on a regular basis ?
Read on to find out :
1. Apple Cider Vinegar
Apple cider vinegar may be a staple ingredient in most kitchens , but did you know that this is a great natural remedy for heartburn ?
If you are experiencing heartburn , it could be due to overeating , stress , indulging on too much spicy food or having too many trips to the refrigerator to steal a snack or two at midnight .
Rather than taking your typical dose of antacids , you can down a spoonful or two of apple cider vinegar .
What this does is to break down the excess foods that you have consumed and restore the normal balance in your stomach .
2. Natural Oils
If you feel a headache coming on , try rubbing lavender or peppermint oil on your temple .
You can also apply the soothing natural medication on your neck – and sniffing its aroma may actually lessen the pain that you are feeling – as indicated in science of aromatherapy .
Another type of natural oil that you can use to treat toothaches is clove oil .
That shooting pain on your gum is no fun at all and while you are waiting for your dentist to address the problem , place a couple of drops of clove oil on your tooth and gum .
Another alternative is to bite on a crushed garlic clove , which has antibacterial properties .
3. Green Tea
Yet another natural home remedies that you can use as a substitute for antihistamines is green tea .
When you have this habit of reaching for the really strong prescription medications like antihistamines the minute that even the mildest of allergies attack – it will actually cause your body ’s immune system to get weak .
As such , it pays to go for natural and body - friendly treatments like green tea .
Down two to three cups of this soothing beverage when you have an allergy attack and wait for this natural wonder to work .
In addition to being a natural antihistamine , green tea also has the following benefits to your health :
Lowers the blood pressure and prevents hypertension .
Provides protection against cardiovascular diseases .
Protects against certain types of cancer .
Speeds up the body ’s recovery after a heart attack .
Thins the blood and helps prevent blood clotting .
4. Cayenne Pepper
Although cayenne pepper puts the sizzle and spice in most foods , it can be actually soothing when used as a natural remedy for cuts .
Aside from stopping the bleeding immediately , sprinkling cayenne pepper on the affected area will actually ease the pain .
5. Flaxseed
Women who are experiencing discomfort due to undergoing the menopausal stage will be glad to know that there is a natural remedy for it : flaxseed .
Hot flashes are a particularly common problem for menopausal women and flaxseed can effectively prevent this .
All you need to do is mix about 1.4 ounces of ground flaxseed into the foods that you are eating and it will relieve menopausal symptoms as effectively as prescription medications .
6. Honey - lemon Tea
If you ’re in a job which requires you to talk almost all day , then you might often experience sore throats .
This could also be a sign of the common colds or a flu coming on – and you can counteract the pain on your throat by gargling with warm salt water .
Then , follow it up with a cup of hot honey - lemon tea and you ’ll feel better in no time at all .
7. Honey , Mustard , Potato
No , this is not a recipe for a salad – they are actually the natural first - aids which you can use to treat a burn .
Do n’t subscribe to the myth that rubbing toothpaste on the burnt area will help heal the burn .
Sure , it may feel cool and soothing to your skin but it is not actually doing anything to help heal your burnt skin .
What you can use instead is honey which has antibacterial properties ; a slice of raw potato whose juices will soothe the burn ; or mustard which can also double up as a burn salve .
Finally , Aloe Vera gel is also a great natural treatment for burns , which you can apply after rinsing the affected area with cold water .
8. Chamomile Tea
If you have digestive problems , down a cup or two of chamomile tea .
What the herb in the tea does is to relax the spasms in your stomach .
9. Tart Cherry Juice
One of the most common pains that most people immediately treat with medication is muscle pains .
Let ’s say that you just came from a workout and you feel drained , and it seems as if every muscle in your body is aching .
For this , you can depend on the natural treatment of drinking a bottle of tart cherry juice .
This helps the sore muscles on your body recover , and it also has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties .
10 . Turmeric
If you are experiencing arthritis or joint injuries , the Indian spice turmeric will work wonders for you .
All you need to do is include a couple of tablespoons of turmeric or yellow curries while cooking meat or any curry dish – and you will generally feel better afterward .
With these top 10 natural home remedies for the most common aches , pains and health complaints , you will feel better afterwards – and you would not have to go through any side effects at all .

The news has now been leaked that President Obama intends to nominate Aneesh Chopra as the nation ’s first Chief Technology Officer .
The Federal CTO will be an assistant to the President , as well as the Associate Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy .
He will work closely with Vivek Kundra , the recently - named Federal CIO , to develop and implement the President ’s ambitious technology agenda .
According to one background document I was given access to , the White House describes the relationship between the CIO and CTO roles as follows :
The responsibilities of the CIO are to use information technology to transform the ways in which the government does business .
The CTO will develop national strategies for using advanced technologies to transform our economy and our society , such as fostering private sector innovation , reducing administrative costs and medical errors using health IT , and using technology to change the way teachers teach and students learn .
Some in Silicon Valley have hoped for one of their own , a CTO with a deep technology pedigree and ties to the technology industry .
For example , the Techcrunch coverage leads with the title Obama Spurns Silicon Valley .
This is a narrow view .
I ’ve been working for much of the past year to understand what many have been calling Government 2.0 , and in that process , Chopra has been one of those who have taught me the most about how we can build a better government with the help of technology .
He is an excellent choice as Federal CTO , for many reasons :
At least in the science fiction community , there ’s a lot of false community wisdom floating around about the editorial process .
Some of them may have been true once .
Some were probably invented to mess with the heads of noobs .
Some of them are carefully nutured lies , like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny .
Well , no longer .
I ’m here to tell you the truth , no matter how ugly it may be .
LIE # 1 : Editors give every story fair consideration .
OR : Editors reject stories without reading them at all .
The truth is , the slush is deep , and it ’s rarely an editor ’s favorite part of the job .
Why do you think so many places have slush readers ?
Every story does n’t get fair consideration .
Not every story deserves it .
If you ca n’t be bothered to read the submission guidelines and follow them , it ’s an easy rejection .
If you have five grammar and spelling mistakes in the first two paragraphs , it ’s an easy rejection .
If it ’s a story about vampires , and I hate vampire stories , it ’s mostly an easy rejection .
Most stories get at least a page out of me .
Then I skip to the last 3 paragraphs , if I ’m feeling generous .
Some get less .
Some work is so obviously bad that it ’s startlingly easy to know it ’s not going to work .
But every story gets looked at .
Nothing ever gets rejected without being partially read .
Honest .
LIE # 2 : Editors never reject a good story .
I rejected plenty of really good stories at the Fortean Bureau .
I ’ve even rejected a couple at Escape Pod .
The reason is pretty simple : editorial vision or scope .
The Fortean Bureau was looking for a particular kind of story .
Your space opera , no matter how good , was never going to appear there .
Likewise , we do n’t accept horror or fantasy at Escape Pod .
If the story is good , and sucks me in , I will recommend sending it over to the other editors .
Stories get rejected for being too long , too short , too similiar to another story the editor has already bought … there are as many reasons for rejection as there are stories .
And not all of them involve you making mistakes .
There are aspects of the process that a writer cannot control .
Best to just relax about it .
LIE # 3 : Editors do n’t foster new writers like they did in the old days , and do n’t care about new talent .
John W. Campbell was a meddlesome bastard who sent his writers specific ideas for stories .
He was not what you call a “ hands off ” kind of editor .
He wrote his fair share of stories , and some of the tales I ’ve heard about him make me think that he was often thinking as a writer as much as he was an editor .
He was n’t afraid to rewrite someone else ’s story .
For whatever bizzare reason , some people wish editors would take that level of interest in their work , and they lament that editors no longer foster new writers , giving them the kind of constructive criticism that leads to their personal growth .
Everything for writers was just wonderful back then but these editors today are jerks !
Not true .
Campbell may have had time to do this with a larger percentage of his submissions , but the field was smaller then .
Today , there are tens of thousands of writers all trying to break in to the same publications .
We simply do n’t have time to give personal feedback to each submission .
These days , sometimes the best you get is an encouraging rejection .
My first came from Stanley Schmidt : “ I like your writing , so I hope you will send more in the future . ”
Not very specific , but it does the trick .
It tells you that you ’re on the right track .
As much as I give Gordon van Gelder a hard time for his opposition to online media , the man writes a very succinct and helpful rejection letter .
Even the form letters have a system to them to help you figure out why the story was rejected .
I always simultaneously feared and looked forward to his short notes .
Editors do build a stable of writers .
The reason most people do n’t see it is because by the time you come along , the editor has already established a group of authors he or she can count on .
But short story writers in particular are always going on to write novels , so openings do occur from time to time .
If you really want feedback on your work , join a workshop or critique circle .
It ’s not the editor ’s job to help you become a better writer .
Sometimes , we ’re helpful , but we ca n’t do it for everyone .
LIE # 4 : Editors are people too .
“ Editors are just like us . ”
No , we ’re not .
You do n’t have a neverending stream of bad writing coming at you day in , day out .
You get to read for pleasure , selecting material that has been through at least one filter .
Whereas you turn on the tap and get a stream of nice drinkable water , we put our mouths to a sewer pipe and hope to get at least one swallow that wo n’t give us raging diarrhea .
I know the sentiment of the phrase is meant to imply that we ’re not godlike arbiters of taste , making and breaking careers on a whim .
But editors do wield power .
And it changes us .
Generally it makes us ill - tempered and easily distracted by shiny objects .
I ’ve yet to feel godlike , but I ’m not ruling out the possibility .
Maybe when something I ’ve published wins a Hugo , I will ascend to Asgard .
LIE # 5 : Editors ( and critics ) are failed writers .
As a rule , no .
A lot of us are moderately successful writers .
Some of us have never wanted to write and never will .
There are a few who have started out as writers and given it up for the editing / publishing game ( Gordon , I think ) , but not all of us have .
We ’re not driven to become editors out of bitterness .
We all come to the position for different reasons , but I think most of us start out as optimistic and hopeful .
We think that maybe we have a vision for a type of story that nobody else has seen before .
We day dream about finding writers that amaze us and publishing them before anyone else .
It takes a peculiar sort of ego to take up editing .
And thank god .
If it was n’t for editors , we ’d all have to sort through the kind of self - published garbage that made it possible for Geocities to stay in business for so long .
I shudder to think of a world without editors .
And finally , a well - known truth :
You can bribe an editor .
Most of us are broke and driven to drink copious amounts of alcohol .
See the sewer pipe analogy above .
That gives us a weakness you can exploit .
Next time you ’re at a convention , go to the bar , and buy a drink for your favorite editor .
Make sure you do it early on , because seven or eight drinks in , we ’ll never remember your name .
We ’ll be lucky to wake up in the right hotel room , or even the right state .
Who bought the drinks on a night like that will be the least of our concerns when we wake up naked atop a desert mesa covered from head to toe in blue paint .
Putting a name to a face , along with a mental database note of “ bought me a beer ” does n’t hurt .
One of the things that makes editing easier is pretending that the stories are n’t all written by human beings with heart .
Sometimes , we have to put that out of our minds .
And if you find a way to politely shatter that illusion , well , it can be good for you .
But only if you are likely to start selling stories anyway .
There are no great secrets to being published .
Read lots .
Write stories .
Lots and lots of stories .
Submit the work until the stories are either accepted or rejected by every market you could bear to see your name associated with .
That ’s pretty much all there is to it .
Everything else is basically unimportant .

The Taleban in Afghanistan have publicly killed a young couple who they said had tried to run away to get married , officials say .
The man , 21 , and woman , 19 , were shot dead on Monday in front of a mosque in the south - western province of Nimroz .
Nimroz is an area where the Taleban have a strong influence .
Governor Ghulam Dastageer
Azad told the AFP news agency the killings followed a decree by local religious leaders and were an " insult to Islam " .
Dangerous region Mr Azad said : " An unmarried young boy and an unmarried girl who loved each other and wanted to get married had eloped because their families would not approve the marriage . "
Officials said the couple were traced by militants after they tried to go to Iran .
They were made to return to their village in Khash Rod district .
" Three Taleban mullahs brought them to the local mosque and they passed a fatwa ( religious decree ) that they must be killed .
They were shot and killed in front of the mosque in public , " the governor said .
He said there were some reports that the families of the young couple could have links with the Taleban .
The Taleban could not be immediately reached for comment .
Correspondents say that the killings took place in a remote and dangerous region , where the government has no access .
The Taleban ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001 and during that time implemented its austere interpretation of Islamic Sharia law , carrying out public killings and floggings .
Unmarried men and women were forbidden from talking or meeting in public and women were not allowed out of their homes without a male relative .
Girls were discouraged from going to school .
Extrajudicial " honour killings " have been widely carried out in Afghanistan since then by conservative families angered by a relative who has brought them shame - usually by refusing to marry a chosen partner .
The Taleban have widened their influence over the past three years and now control many remote districts where there are not enough coalition forces to establish a permanent presence .

An event hosted by Samsung Singapore gave birth to a second hands - on video demo of the Samsung i7500 Android phone .
If you ’ve been lusting over Sammy ’s latest and greatest Android phone , here ’s one video I recommend watching – until Android Community get our own review unit in for a more in - depth look .
The AMOLED display is probably capacitive and it is nothing short of gorgeous .
Based on the demo , the camera shoots really good pictures featuring what seems to be an LED flash .
There ’s a standard 3.5 mm headphone jack and a microUSB port for charging / syncing .
Unfortunately there was n’t a SIM in the i7500 in order to test call quality .
[ vms 4c3a763a7e62d825349f ]
Overall , I ’m pretty impressed with what I ’ve seen here and cannot wait to put the i7500 up head to head with the HTC Magic .
If you had your choice , which one would you go with ?
Feel free to list out any features , questions or concerns you see from the video that I ’ve missed or omitted from the article .
Thanks , and enjoy !

Look away now if you 've got a weak stomach : Ronnie and Ekaterina 's very public display of affection
The very public love affair between Ronnie Wood , 61 , and his young girlfriend Ekaterina Ivanova appears to be very much still on .
Rolling Stones guitarist Wood and Ekaterina were seen cosying up for a kiss in the back of their car as they left bar Whisky Mist last night .
With their arms wrapped around each other , holding on tightly , the ageing rocker and 20 - year - old former waitress smooched like teenagers in the back of the car .
Kiss me Ronnie : Rocker Wood and girlfriend Ekaterina Ivanova lock lips in the back of their car after a night out at bar Whisky Mist
Public display of affection :
The rocker comes up for air but Ekaterina continues to hold on and whisper sweet nothings in his ear
But not everyone was so enamoured by the couple 's presence .
Ronnie found himself drinking with the regular Joes at Whisky Mist last night after finding himself banned from the VIP area .
The 61 - year - old Rolling Stone guitarist , who was with 20 - year - old girlfriend Ekaterina Ivanova , was given the cold shoulder by staff — as the club ’s PR Michael Evans is good mates with Ron ’s estranged wife Jo .
Young at heart : Despite the age gap of 41 years the couple both enjoy clubbing and partying
A source said : ' Ronnie arrived shortly after midnight with his girlfriend .
Everyone was staring at them and it looked like they were loving all the attention .
' A few minutes later a member of security came over to the PR of the club and told him that Ronnie had arrived .
Jo Wood : Ronnie 's estranged wife filed for divorce two weeks ago
The PR was overheard telling security that they were not allowed in the VIP room under any circumstances . '
A source added : ' Ronnie was forced to stand in the main bar along with all the other clubbers but , to be fair to him , he did n’t seem to mind too much . '
The couple left at 2 am , and Ronnie was so hammered when he got home that one of his minders had to help him inside his house .
Meanwhile estranged wife Jo Wood started divorce proceedings two weeks ago , and confirmed that she wants half the Rolling Stone 's assets .
She told the Sunday People : ' Why would I want to be Ronnie 's wife after everything he has done to me ?
I am having a great time without him .
' Yes , it was hard at first but now I am used to being single .
' The only way forward was to get divorced and I 'm looking forward to it all being over . '
Ronnie is said to be working on a new album for release later this year inspired by his marital troubles .
The record - Wood 's first new material in eight years - is being produced by Black Grape guitarist Danny Saber and will feature Red Hot Chili Peppers bass player Flea .

When Matt McKinney took a 39 - day road trip in 2012 , he experienced one version of the American dream , just before he reached the Pacific Ocean : a flawless burger .
“ It was a really big , juicy patty and a perfectly moist bun , ” says the Dallas - based credit analyst , who had stopped at gastropub Father ’s Office , in Santa Monica , CA , on the recommendation of a friend .
It was so satisfying that , McKinney says , “ it was my only meal that whole day . ”
Served with caramelized onions , cheese , applewood bacon , and arugula , the Office Burger typifies what has become , in recent years , the “ destination burger . ”
Steakhouses , gastropubs , and hotels around the U.S. are serving well - crafted burgers topped with anything from house - made pickles to mushrooms sautéed in Cognac , and rendered from grass - fed or Wagyu beef ( which refers to various breeds of Japanese cows , including the fat - marbled Kobe ) .
But you do n’t always need a pedigreed cow to create a fantastic hamburger .
When we searched for the best around the U.S , we found some with enticingly 21st - century sensibilities — locally sourced ingredients , or globally inspired toppings such as roasted poblanos or Sriracha sauce — as well as classics that have wooed meat lovers for 40 or even 100 years .
“ To me , a great burger does n’t have to be made of the finest ingredients — it simply has to be memorable , ” says Jared Strichek , a digital marketing analyst from Charlotte , NC , who recently enjoyed such a burger in Charleston , SC , nestled between two grilled cheese sandwiches .
“ A burger is the quintessential American food , ” he says , “ because , with just a little ingenuity , it can be anything you want it to be . ”
As a result , defining the best burgers can spur heated debate .

As I wrote yesterday , I think Eric Holder made the right decision , taking all the facts into account , in abandoning the prosecution of now - former Sen .
Ted Stevens ( R - AK ) .
But as Zack Roth reports in this new post at TPMMuckraker , we ’re now in the midst of an outpouring of tributes to Stevens claiming that the effective dismissal of the case makes Stevens an aggrieved victim and confirms that the prosecution never should have been brought in the first place ( see this post for a list of encomiums ) .
In other words , they seem to have mistaken him for Don Siegelman , who ’s still looking at a lengthy prison term .
I can only think these people are either blinded by affection and insiderism or simply have n’t reviewed the facts of the case .
But let ’s remember that none of the misconduct on the prosecutors ’ part , which was serious , touched upon or minimized Stevens ’ basic bad acts .
In the course of advocating for the interests of a major political contributor in his state , Stevens accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars of goods and services from that contributor .
Our ethics and corruption laws , in certain areas , are so tight these days that politicians often get tripped up for accepting box seats at sporting events or fancy meals .
But what Stevens did is like a textbook case of being on the take .
Stevens had Bill Allen hire contractors to take his Alaska home , slice it up off the ground and add a whole new floor to it — in addition to various new goodies and emoluments .
Quite apart from whether the DOJ should refile the charges and even whether the acts can be fit into the criminal statutes , beyond a reasonable doubt , those facts were true and widely reported on long before the charges were ever brought .
And the behavior was disgraceful .
It ’s always easier to forgive or contextualize or downplay bad behavior when we know the people as actual people rather than names or numbers or two dimensional cardboard cutouts we ’re happy to ship off to years or decades of rotting in prison — a fact we should take more deeply into account when we revisit our entire system of criminal justice .
But context and forgiveness or just plain mercy is n’t the same as simple denial — which seems to be the order of the day today in our nation ’s capital .
The Obamas escaped Washington on Saturday in search of a quintessential New York evening  dinner and a Broadway show .
They found it at Blue Hill , a low - key Greenwich Village restaurant , and at the Belasco Theater near Times Square for a performance of “ Joe Turner ’s Come and Gone , ” the Tony - nominated August Wilson play .
It was the Obamas ’ first joint visit to the city as the first couple .
And even cooler - than - thou New York allowed itself a bit of excitement over their arrival .
“ I thought I was dreaming , ” said Kecia McCowen , a 45 - year - old utility worker and student from Brooklyn ; she bought tickets for the show three days ago , but found out that the Obamas would be there only after she arrived .
“ I was like , stop playing ! ”

In an interview with Christianity Today , Joe the Plumber first defended calling gay people queers , then he said , “ I would n’t have them anywhere near my children . ”
Joe the Plumber has many sides and none of them are good .
Joe was asked about same sex marriage at the state level , “ At a state level , it ’s up to them .
I do n’t want it to be a federal thing .
I personally still think it ’s wrong .
People do n’t understand the dictionary — it ’s called queer .
Queer means strange and unusual .
It ’s not like a slur , like you would call a white person a honky or something like that .
You know , God is pretty explicit in what we ’re supposed to do — what man and woman are for .
Now , at the same time , we ’re supposed to love everybody and accept people , and preach against the sins .
I ’ve had some friends that are actually homosexual .
And , I mean , they know where I stand , and they know that I would n’t have them anywhere near my children .
But at the same time , they ’re people , and they ’re going to do their thing . ”
Joe ’s “ gay friends ” are cool with the fact that he wo n’t let them near his children ?
Is he serious ?
I am going to take a guess here , but do n’t think that Joe has ever had any gay friends , or maybe he used to have gay friends , and then he would n’t let them near his kids , so they are friends no longer .
What ’s Joe afraid of ?
Does he think that homosexuals will rape his children , or maybe they will gay up his kids ?

This kind of backwards attitude is reason why the GOP has driven completely off of the cliff .
I do n’t understand why the GOP keeps putting Joe the non-Plumber out there front and center .
Every time this guy appears in the media , it results in another black eye for the Republicans .
Joe looks like an uneducated racist homophobe , which some would argue makes him the perfect face for the current Republican Party .

A man named Vinny dies and goes to hell .
The Devil says to him " Hey Vinny we 've been waitin for ya ! " .
Vinny smiles and walks with the Devil and the Devil says " I gotta ask you a couple questions , do you like to smoke ? "
Vinny answers " Ya , I love to smoke . "
The Devil says " Good you 'll like Mondays we smoke everything cigarettes , cigars , weed everything . "
" Now do you like to drink ? "
Then Vinny says " Of course I love to drink . "
The Devil replies " Great we drink everything on Tuesdays you will fit in great . "
" Do you like to have sex ? "
Vinny says " Hell ya sex is the best . "
The Devil smiles and replies " We have sex with every type of woman you could think of on Wedesdays . "
And the Devil finally says " Now , are you gay ? "
Vinny frowns and answers " NO I 'm not gay !
And the Devil looks down and finishes " Your gonna hate Thursdays . "
Naysayers aside , the world appears to have nudged its way towards the view that there is a scientific consensus that human activity has changed our climate .
For many academics , the question is now about finding ways of dealing with the consequences of climate change .
In that endeavour , natural scientists are increasingly being joined by other academics - most notably social scientists - in teams where many disciplines can interact .
But there is concern that a government desire to protect science , technology , engineering and mathematics ( Stem ) subjects by ringfencing funding could , in the long term , affect the ability of these teams to conduct research .
For Professor Paul Wellings , chairman - elect of the 1994 group of smaller research - intensive universities , it is a question of getting together what he calls a " dream team " , comprising not just scientists , but researchers from the social sciences and humanities , to deal with the nightmare scenario recently conjured by the government 's chief scientist , John Beddington , in which the world is gripped by a " perfect storm " of war , starvation and mass migration .
Coming up with answers
For Wellings , it is not enough simply to rely on science and technology to come up with the answers we need .
Looking at individuals ' behaviour and getting them to change that is , he argues , as important as new technology .
While not opposed to ringfencing per se , he argues for a more nuanced approach , with support maintained for social sciences and humanities .
The 1994 group estimates that the ringfencing of funding for Stem subjects during the 2008 research assessment exercise ( RAE ) cost its institutions 20 p in the pound per researcher .
" If we were asked as institutions to help solve major global challenges , and asked what is the ' dream team ' that we would want to field for doing that , " says Wellings , " as soon as you start to put that together , there are engineers , technocrats and very often people in the humanities and the social sciences . "
At the sharp end of what he is talking about are people such as Sarah Curtis , a geographer heading a group of Durham University academics working with engineers from Edinburgh 's Heriot - Watt University on a project to discover how storms , floods and heatwaves caused by climate change might affect the elderly and how infrastructure can be tailored to cope .
" Multidisciplinary work helps engineers and scientists , as well as the professional carers , tackle extreme weather events in the future and keep services running , " Curtis says .
" They also need to understand from the people receiving those services what 's important to them and that 's where the social science perspective comes in - really being able to interpret events and problems from different social perspectives .
" The social science perspective is n't just about individual behaviour , but helps us to think about the way that people work and interact together .
I would argue that what 's important to people and how they tackle problems is not just down to individual characteristics but also to the social circumstances they 're in . "
She is concerned about an over - reliance on Stem subjects to provide solutions to climate change .
" This is n't just about sharing academic knowledge , but also the public debate as well , because in all honesty I do n't think that natural scientists have all the answers to the problems we 're facing over climate change and neither do I think that social scientists have the solutions .
So we are going to have to negotiate across these different points of view if we are going to move forward . "
Wellings , a population ecologist , says there is a pool of expertise within the 1994 group , with its strength in social science and humanities .
He would like to see it drawn upon when it comes to tackling environmental issues .
" If we do n't get a grip on climate change we are going to see the world 's largest diaspora , when a huge area of sub -Saharan Africa will be forced into absolute water shortage .
At that point 300 million people could walk off the land and towards Europe .
There are a family of issues that , if we get them badly wrong , will produce a perfect storm within about 40 to 50 years around some of those big picture issues .
" So who are the people who understand the culture of these areas and the management of diaspora ?
By and large , it 's not scientists but social scientists and humanities people . "
He points to the School of Oriental and African Studies , a member of the 1994 group .
" I do n't know what the future of geopolitics is , but I do know that in the future we are going to have to turn to people such as those at Soas , who are experts in languages and anthropology from that part of the world .
It will be an inevitable response that we will need a world - class centre of excellence of the sort that we already have there . "
In the meantime , Wellings , who is also vice - chancellor of Lancaster University , fears there will be less money for academics to engage in speculative research in social sciences and humanities .
" You can have a pretty shrewd guess there will be substantially less money going back into those departments than there was before , " he says .
" And so over the next 18 months you will see a sharp diminution in research activity .
Some of that will be a reduction in the number of projects that are being run and some of it will be in the support to postgraduates .
" Less money will cause colleagues to be more entrepreneurial and in the short run they will be more market - facing , or recruit more international students , but it wo n't maintain research capacity and that is the thing that will be eroded .
The intellectual need for there to be multidisciplinary research will not go away and that will put tremendous pressure on universities to ensure that the financial resources are there . "
Wellings , who sits on the board of the Higher Education Funding Council for England , is calling for more transparency when it comes to the new funding mechanism that will replace the RAE , the Research Excellence Framework - in particular , in the funding of Stem subjects relative to social sciences and humanities .
" In the future , there will have to be transparency about what the likelihood is of resource in each area , " he says .
A wider research base
Diane Berry , Reading University 's pro vice - chancellor for research , echoes this argument .
" It is clearly important to protect funding for Stem subjects and medicine .
However , we cannot afford to conceive our science base too narrowly - we must protect our wider research base .
" This is because addressing current and future global challenges depends on the successful interplay of all subjects .
Furthermore , the boundaries between the natural sciences and the social sciences and humanities are becoming increasingly fluid as research at the frontiers of knowledge becomes increasingly inter- and multidisciplinary . "
David Delpy , the chief executive of the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council , says : " Obviously , there needs to be a balance between arts and science funding .
Both are important .
However , there remains a shortage in physical sciences and engineering graduates .
We agree that when it comes to priority areas such as climate change a cross - disciplinary approach is vital if we are to be successful . "
Delpy points to the Research Council UK's Living With Environmental
Change programme as an example of how the seven research councils are working together " to try and solve major problems that face society " .
" Increasingly , " says Berry , " success in markets , which many people might assume to be dominated by technological advances , depends just as much on factors such as design , economics , branding and consumer understanding .
" Similarly , effectively tackling some of the most significant health and environmental challenges will depend just as much on changing people 's behaviour as on advances in medicine , physics , or chemistry . "

Miss California and Miss USA runner - up , Carrie Prejean , tossed around in the battle over gay marriage , will be a one - day guest host for Fox News Channel 's popular morning show Fox & Friends , Whispers learns .
She will host the 6 a.m. - to - 7 a.m. slot on May 27 , filling in for Gretchen Carlson — the 1989 Miss America — who will be off that day .
The decision to make her a one - day cohost was finalized yesterday — the same day Prejean and Miss USA owner Donald Trump appeared on Fox & Friends .
Suzanne Scott ,
Fox vice president for programming , filled me in on the details of the gig for Prejean , who was thrust into the headlines when she rejected gay marriage during the Q&A part of the pageant .
" We 're just using her one time , " she said , " to sit with the boys and have some fun . "
The boys are cohosts Steve Doocy and Brian Kilmeade .
" She has become a national celebrity in the last few weeks , and it's a fun thing to do , " said Scott .
" It 's a good way to try get a little buzz and fun for the show .
We 'll see what happens with it , " she added .
Fox & Friends has used news celebs before , and some have gone on to bigger and better things .
Scott recalled using Tiki Barber on Fox & Friends while he was a member of the New York Giants .
" He went off to become a TV star , " she said .
However , said Scott , there have been no talks with Prejean about a future with Fox .
Scott did n't know yet what the focus of the May 27 show will be , and Prejean might have to come in the day before to prepare .

Whitney spotted a Google - branded , camera - equipped tricycle in his local San Diego , CA bike shop .
But it 's packing a generator and about eight cameras — what kind of muscle - bound man -monster can pedal this thing ?

The trike features a number - pad in the center of the handlebars , presumably to control the cameras ( dangerous while riding ! ) .
We 're not really sure what advantages the pedal - powered vehicle would have over a car , besides possibly a smaller footprint , allowing it to reach alleys or park paths .
Mostly , we 're just impressed that anybody short of a Tour de France competitor has the strength to pedal it ; it must weigh a ton !

Vienna , Austria :
New light has been thrown on how humans choose their partners , a scientist will tell the annual conference of the European Society of Human Genetics today ( Monday May 25 ) .
Professor Maria da Graça Bicalho , head of the Immunogenetics and Histocompatibility Laboratory at the University of Parana , Brazil , says that her research had shown that people with diverse major histocompatibility complexes ( MHCs ) were more likely to choose each other as mates than those whose MHCs were similar , and that this was likely to be an evolutionary strategy to ensure healthy reproduction .
Females ’ preference for MHC dissimilar mates has been shown in many vertebrate species , including humans , and it is also known that MHC influences mating selection by preferences for particular body odours .
The Brazilian team has been working in this field since 1998 , and decided to investigate mate selection in the Brazilian population , while trying to uncover the biological significance of MHC diversity .
The scientists studied MHC data from 90 married couples , and compared them with 152 randomly - generated control couples .
They counted the number of MHC dissimilarities among those who were real couples , and compared them with those in the randomly - generated ‘ virtual couples ’ .
“ If MHC genes did not influence mate selection ” , says Professor Bicalho , “ we would have expected to see similar results from both sets of couples .
But we found that the real partners had significantly more MHC dissimilarities than we could have expected to find simply by chance . ”
Within MHC - dissimilar couples the partners will be genetically different , and such a pattern of mate choice decreases the danger of endogamy ( mating among relatives ) and increases the genetic variability of offspring .
Genetic variability is known to be an advantage for offspring , and the MHC effect could be an evolutionary strategy underlying incest avoidance in humans and also improving the efficiency of the immune system , the scientists say .
The MHC is a large genetic region situated on chromosome 6 , and found in most vertebrates .
It plays an important role in the immune system and also in reproductive success .
Apart from being a large region , it is also an extraordinarily diverse one .
“ Although it may be tempting to think that humans choose their partners because of their similarities ” , says Professor Bicalho , “ our research has shown clearly that it is differences that make for successful reproduction , and that the subconscious drive to have healthy children is important when choosing a mate . ”
The scientists believe that their findings will help understanding of conception , fertility , and gestational failures .
Research has already shown that couples with similar MHC genes had longer intervals between births , which could imply early , unperceived miscarriages .
“ We intend to follow up this work by looking at social and cultural influences as well as biological ones in mate choice , and relating these to the genetic diversity of the extended MHC region ” , says Professor Bicalho .
“ We expect to find that cultural aspects play an important role in mate choice , and certainly do not subscribe to the theory that if a person bears a particular genetic variant it will determine his or her behaviour .
But we also think that the unconscious evolutionary aspect of partner choice should not be overlooked .
We believe our research shows that this has an important role to play in ensuring healthy reproduction , by helping to ensure that children are born with a strong immune system better able to cope with infection . ”
For at least the past six years , one of the fiercest struggles in the federal government ’s war with the states over medical marijuana has been waged from a nondescript Santa Cruz warehouse , tucked between an auto repair shop and an electrical contractor .
These days , there is unprecedented optimism inside that warehouse , where the feisty Wo / Men ’s Alliance for Medical Marijuana appears to be on the brink of outlasting the feds and winning the most important legal fight still left in the courts over California ’s nearly 13 - year - old voter approved medical pot law .
The Obama administration , through new Attorney General Eric Holder , has publicly indicated in recent weeks that it will not enforce federal drug laws against medical marijuana providers in states with medical pot laws , as long as those providers are obeying their state laws .
For WAMM ’s leaders and patients , such a policy shift would not only end their 6 - year - old lawsuit , but also an era of raids , uncertainty and near - extinction for an operation that tends to the sick and dying .
The Santa Cruz case also could be the first in the country that forces the new administration to lay out its exact policy on medical pot in writing .
On a recent morning inside WAMM , Valerie and Mike Corral , who cofounded the cooperative in the early 1990s , appeared visibly relieved as they discussed the prospects of the feds finally leaving them alone .
As they spoke , the unmistakable , pungent smell of pot wafted through the corridor outside their cramped office .
“ We ’ve been barely scraping by , ” said Valerie Corral , a medical pot user since a 1973 car accident left her suffering from epileptic seizures .
For now , the Justice Department is mum on the WAMM lawsuit , which was backed by the city and county of Santa Cruz .
The suit argued the federal government under the Bush administration had been enforcing drug laws selectively to interfere with California ’s medical marijuana provisions .
San Jose U.S. District Judge Jeremy
Fogel gave the lawsuit a boost last summer , allowing it to proceed on its central claims .
The U.S. Supreme Court has twice found that federal drug laws trump state medical pot laws , but the Santa Cruz case raised a novel legal theory .
U.S. Attorney Joseph Russoniello , whose office directs federal law enforcement in Northern California , did not respond to a request for an interview .
But during a hearing last week , Fogel said it appeared Holder ’s comments would apply to WAMM .
And Justice Department attorney Mark Quinlivan told Fogel the administration is evaluating how the policy change will impact the WAMM case , and suggested “ something in paper could be forthcoming . ”
In California , such a policy change would alter the landscape for medical pot providers , who ’ve been raided dozens of times in recent years .
Federal and state agents would still enforce drug laws against providers who hide behind medical pot laws to deal in black market sales of marijuana , but outfits that keep close tabs on patients and ensure they have valid prescriptions from doctors appear to be safe from raids .
Legal experts say the feds will stay out of the 13 states with medical marijuana laws as long as they regulate pot operations carefully .
But medical pot providers will not be immune — federal drug agents raided a San Francisco cannabis club last week .
“ It could be kind of a test , ” said Robert Mikos , a Vanderbilt University law professor and expert on the state versus federal conflict over medical pot .
“ The federal government is telling California that as long as you control these cooperatives , we ’re going to let it slide . ”
American Civil Liberties Union attorney Graham Boyd , who represents the Corrals , said resolving the case would send an important message .
“ It ’s not just California , ” he said .
“ A number of people have been very careful to comply with state law , and yet live in constant fear of federal prosecution . ”
Valerie Corral chuckles at the notion that her operation is an easy way for people to get marijuana .
She serves about 150 patients suffering from serious ailments ranging from AIDS to cancer .
In a room where patients light up , one wall is a reminder of the stakes — it is covered with pictures of WAMM patients who have died .
Corral said she makes sure only proper candidates get pot through WAMM .
“ I ’m such a stickler , ” she says .
“ I ’m brutal . ”
Sitting around a table on a recent Friday afternoon , a number of WAMM patients said they are relieved the threat of federal raids may waft away like so much ﻿pot smoke .
“ I think it ’s about time , ” said Carol Meyer , who ’s suffering from cancer .
“ I think the federal government needs to back out of it .
The people voted . ”

Dan Choi Explains ' Why I Cannot Stay Quiet '
After stating that he 's gay on TV , Lt. Choi asks Obama to spare his job .
May 13 , 2009  -- A West Point graduate who is being discharged from the National Guard because of " homosexual conduct " has appealed directly to President Obama to repeal the military 's " Do n't Ask , Don't Tell " policy on gay soldiers .

In a letter to the president , Lt. Dan Choi said the discharge letter , dated April 23 , 2009 , was " a slap in the face to me .
It is a slap in the face to my soldiers , peers and leaders who have demonstrated that an infantry unit can be professional enough to accept diversity , to accept capable leaders , to accept skilled soldiers .
" My subordinates know I 'm gay .
They do n't care , " he said .
" They are professional .
" As an infantry officer , I am not accustomed to begging .
But I beg you today :
Do not fire me , " Choi wrote .
Choi , 28 , who majored in Arabic language at West Point , announced he is gay during an appearance March 19 on MSNBC's " The Rachel Maddow Show . "
Soon after , the army made plans to fire him , saying he had " negatively affected good order and discipline in the New York Army National Guard . "
Choi said he was disappointed and angry , and it took him only 30 minutes after receiving the letter to decide : " I 'm fighting this . "
Despite the professional consequences , Choi said he does n't regret his decision to come out .
He said it 's his platoon that 's being punished , not him .
" I got fired because I was being too honest , " he said .
" That has nothing to do with performance or going to war .
I 'm angry , not for myself , I 'm ready for all the consequences .
I 'm really angry because my unit is so professional .
...
They are the ones being punished .
They are losing a member of their team . "
Bob Maginnis , a senior strategist with the U.S. Army who helped craft the law 10 USC 654 that bans homosexual conduct in the military , opposes a repeal of DADT .
" [ Choi's ] command did what they had to do under the statute and regulations , " Maginnis said , who added that he does n't think there 's enough momentum for Choi 's strategy to have any effect on the law .
" You have people that are throwing themselves on the mercy of public sympathy to persuade Congress to change direction , but if you want to rescind the law you need both houses to rescind it and then get the president to agree .
I 'm not sure we have sufficient votes to rescind the law , " Maginnis said .
" This is not one of the more important issues , frankly .
It has little consequence to effectiveness of the organizations .
A few hundred people a year is n't of any significance . "
' How Can I Lie and Keep Quiet '
Choi told ABCNews.com that , until now , he had never confided about his sexuality to anyone in the army .
He stayed silent for nearly 10 years .
" I have never , ever done anything homosexual while on duty and I never engaged in heterosexual conduct while on duty because the army is not about sexual anything , " he said .
" I had never had a boyfriend or girlfriend because of ' Do n't Ask Don't Tell . ' "
But in 2008 , Choi said he found the man he describes as his first love , and that relationship spurred his decision to come out .
Difficulties of Staying in the Closet
" It has been one of the greatest things .
I grew as a person .
You know , you have the support .
You have the encouragement to be a better solider .
You have someone to share your very difficult times with , " he said .
" I was able to experience that and how can I lie and keep quiet because it 's so good . "
Staying in the closet , he added , " traumatizes people in a way ...
Number one , I 'm taught the honor code at West Point : do not lie .
Units are based on honor code .
But ' Do n't Ask Don't Tell ' says you have to lie .
It forces people to lie , to hide .
Hiding and lying are n't army values . "
As one of the founding members of Knights Out , a new organization that supports West Point grads who are gay , Choi said he receives hundreds of e-mails every day from people looking for support , or simply thanking him .
" People are saying , ' I 'm in Iraq right now and I got kicked out ' or ' I 'm in Afghanistan ' or ' I 'm at West Point right now and keep going because we need to know there are other people out there , ' " Choi said .
" One said he wanted to commit suicide , but ' Now I know there is someone else . '
That 's the main reason why I cannot stay quiet . "
Knights Out Chair : ' I Was Investigated '
Knights
Out formed on March 16 and now has 97 members , 59 of whom are out .
Choi is the only member on active duty .
" We think this is a really urgent issue , for national security reasons .
We cannot afford to lose one more Arabic linguist like we did with Dan Choi , " said Becky Kanis , a 1991 West Point grad and chairwoman of the Knights Out Board .
" His board has n't met yet .
It 's not too late for him . "
It may be more than a month before Choi's Show Cause for Retention Board meets to deliberate his fate .
Until then , Choi continues to train with his unit .
Kanis said Choi's unit " shook his hand and said we support you , we 're behind you " after he came out on TV .
" How many more people like that are we going to lose in the name of maintaining these old - fashioned prejudices ? " she asked .
' Do n't Ask , Don't Tell
" Do n't Ask Don't Tell " was introduced under the Clinton administration in 1993 .
The policy allows gay military personnel to serve , but says that they are n't to disclose their sexuality or engage in homosexual acts .
Under the policy , saying you are gay counts as homosexual conduct .
Since then , according to the most recent numbers released by the Pentagon , 12,500 service members have been dismissed because of their sexuality .
" We have to ask why are people coming out ?
What is it about this policy that makes it tough for people to serve ? " said Nathaniel Frank , senior research fellow at the Palm Center think tank in Santa Barbara , Calif .
that examines public policy related to gender , sexuality , and the military .
Frank , the author " Unfriendly Fire , " acknowleged that the number of gay men and women dismissed for their sexual orientation is a small number in comparison to the total number of people dismissed from the military .
However , he says the quality of the people being dismissed under DADT is troubling .
Kanis , for example , left a sought - after job commanding a special operations unit because she wanted to live openly in a same - sex relationship .
" I was investigated when I was a cadet for my sexual orientation .
In fact , I denied being a lesbian and carried the guilt over lying for many years , " she told ABC News .
" I was in the thick of things , I had a really good job actually .
It was very hard to make the decision to go , but once I made that decision there was no looking back , " she said .
Kanis is now working for Common Ground , a non-profit focused on trying to prevent homelessness .
Will Do n't Ask Don't Tell Be Overturned ?
On Sunday the president 's National Security Advisor General Jim Jones spoke about DADT on " This Week with George Stephanopoulos . "
When asked if " Do n't Ask , Don't Tell " will be overturned , he answered , " I do n't know , " angering groups that have pushed for DADT 's repeal .
" ' I do n't know ? '
The answer should have been a one - word answer : ' Yes , ' " Aubrey Sarvis , executive director of Servicemembers Legal Defense Network , said in a statement accusing Obama of caving to senior military leadership and the religious right .
The Servicemembers Legal Defense Network ( SLDN ) , a non-profit legal group dedicated to helping military personnel affected by DADT , has been working with Choi since he decided to come out .
" All of this movement has to come from the president .
He is the ultimate enforcer of Do n't Ask Don't Tell , " SLDN spokesman Kevin Nix said .
On Sunday 's " This Week " Sen .
John McCain said he 's open to revisiting the DADT policy , reiterating that he would rely on a study by the Joint Chiefs of Staff before making any judgements .
" Right now the military is functioning extremely well in very difficult conditions , " McCain told Stephanopoulos .
" We have to have an assessment on recruitment , on retention and all the other aspects of the impact on our military if we change the policy .
In my view , and I know that a lot of people do n't agree with that , the policy has been working and I think it 's been working well . "
The movement to repeal DADT , however , is growing impatient .
" The decision to just shut up and wait would certainly made my life a lot easier , " Choi said .
" But at West Point we recited in the cadet prayer to choose the harder right over the easier wrong . "
On the White House Web site , it says Obama " supports repealing Don't Ask Don't Tell in a sensible way that strengthens our armed forces and our national security , and also believes that we must ensure adoption rights for all couples and individuals , regardless of their sexual orientation . "
Before Choi came forward , 2nd Lt. Sandy Tsao , an army officer in St. Louis , had decided to come out to her superiors .
She wrote to Obama to tell him about her decision and on May 5 she received a hand - written note in response .
" It is because of outstanding Americans like you that I committed to changing our current policy , " Obama 's note said .
" Although it will take some time to complete ( partly because it needs congressional action ) I intend to fulfill my commitment ! "
Tsao will be discharged from the military on May 19 .
In short ?
Bad .
To give an overall flavor , here is a collection of data from a number of polls on American belief in evolution , correlated to a number of factors :
The Majority of Republicans Doubt the Theory of Evolution | Gallup , 2007
40 % - 50 % of the public accepts a biblical creationist account of the origins of life | Pew , 2005
Only 26 % of Americans believe in Natural Selection | Pew , 2005
In the year 2009 , 200 years after Darwin ’s birth , only 39 % believe in the theory of evolution , and 36 % have no opinion either way | Gallup , 2009
79 % of those with a high school education or less either do n’t believe in evolution or have no opinion either way | Gallup , 2009
27 % of those with postgraduate degrees in the United States either do n’t believe in evolution or do n’t have an opinion either way | Gallup , 2009
in the United States either do n’t believe in evolution or do n’t have an opinion either way | Gallup , 2009 Among those who seldom or never go to church , 45 % either do n’t believe in evolution or have no opinion either way | Gallup , 2009
Of those who go nearly weekly or monthly , 70 % either do n’t believe in evolution or have no opinion either way | Gallup , 2009
And finally , in the year 2009 , in the United States of America , only 39 % believe in evolution | Gallup , 2009
Here ’s Gallup ’s implications summary :
As Darwin is being lauded as one of the most important scientists in history on the 200th anniversary of his birth ( on Feb. 12 , 1809 ) , it is perhaps dismaying to scientists who study and respect his work to see that well less than half of Americans today say they believe in the theory of evolution , and that just 55 % can associate the man with his theory .
This makes me sad . ::

I hoped she would pull her weight and do her part .
It seems that her attending a rival school 's football game 200 miles away the day before our paper was due was more important than our grade !
I had no time to do all the research and write it all my self and to be honest I would have never ordered from a writing service but it was either that or fail because of my irresponsible partner .

Mariah R. , Bemidji , MN Custom Essay , Term Paper and Research Paper Writing Service Why Do Students Need a Custom Paper Writing Service like Superior Papers ?
Have you ever wondered why so many students keep searching for the best paper writing service ?
They are desperate to find an agency that allows them to order essay online in a simple way , pay an affordable price for a superor paper , and have it by the deadline .
We ’ll list the main reasons that we managed to identify through direct communication with students :
1. Lack of Time
This is the major reason for students coming to us with the plea : “ I need you to write my paper . ”
Let ’s take a look at the usual daily schedule of an ideal college student :
Wake up at 8 AM .
Get ready for classes .
Classes from 9 AM to 4PM .
Late lunch and rest until 5.30 PM .
Do homework until 8 PM .
Study until 10 PM .
Relax a bit , have a shower and get ready for bed .
That ’s the schedule of an idea college student ; the one who is resistant to all kinds of distractions .
The usual student will spend some time with friends , watch a TV show , and check out social media .
Even without those things , they ca n’t fit essay writing within that schedule .
So they have to outsource that task .
2. Lack of Skills
Some people are just not that good at writing .
Yes ; it ’s a skill they can develop with practice , but they ca n’t risk considering essays as opportunities to practice .
These papers are being graded and they have to show some skill .
If they do n’t have it , the only way to get a good grade is by getting some help from a professional essay writing service .
3. Not Enough Resources on the Topic
Some topics are really cool .
They inspire you and you immediately find what to write about .
Others , however , are a complete disaster .
You ca n’t find any online resources .
The ones you find through Google Scholar are not accessible for free .
So what do you do ?
You hire professional paper writers to write this essay for you .
4. ESL Speakers
When foreign students get accepted to universities in the USA , Canada , Great Britain , or Australia , they are expected to meet the same standards as native English speakers .
They do n’t have the same level of skill in academic writing in English , but no one cares .
To save their grades , they simply have to rely on online writing services .
5. Too Challenging Projects
Let ’s say a student is pretty good at writing essay .
But will they be able to write research papers , case studies , lab reports , business reports , book reviews , and all other kinds of projects ?
They will inevitably hit a dead - end street at one point or another .
Some assignments are simply too challenging .
6. Not Enough Experience with the Specific Type of Assignment
Let ’s talk about MA and PhD candidates .
They ’ve written multiple projects so far .
But when they come down to the Master ’s thesis or doctoral dissertation , they face a paper that ’s much more complex than anything else they ’ve faced .
That ’s the point when most of them start searching for a top rated essay writing service .

Nokia has been hard at work building Maemo 5 , the next major version of its Linux - based mobile platform .
This new version , which is codenamed Fremantle , brings a user interface overhaul and some compelling new capabilities .
Although Maemo 5 is still at the beta stage of development and Nokia has not yet announced when it will ship on actual hardware , details are already emerging about the version that will come next , which is codenamed Harmattan .
Nokia first published the preliminary roadmap for Harmattan last year at the Maemo wiki but disclosed very few additional details .
Earlier this week , alleged screenshots of Harmattan and a considerable amount of new information about the platform were leaked and published by MobileCrunch .
According to their informant , Harmattan could arrive at the end of 2010 and is potentially going to be available on a smartphone device .
The informant also claims that Nokia 's long - term plan is to eventually ditch its Symbian - based S60 platform and adopt Maemo across its handset line .
These are all highly speculative claims and none of it has been confirmed yet by Nokia , but there are some very clear signs that suggest some of it could be true .
A very significant point that appears to have been overlooked by MobileCrunch and other gadget sites that are covering this news is that Nokia recently launched a joint project with Intel to build a full Linux telephony stack — one that could be used to bring voice calling to Maemo .
This project , which is called oFono , was announced earlier this month .
Nokia clearly aims to build the software that will be necessary to deliver a Maemo smartphone .
A big question here is what this will mean for Symbian .
Nokia is investing considerable resources in an effort to open the Symbian platform and make it more competitive relative to Linux - based phone operating systems .
Given Nokia 's strong affinity for Symbian and the lengths to which the company has gone to make itself the arbiter of Symbian 's destiny , it seems hard to imagine Nokia simply phasing it out and walking away .
One possibility is that Nokia intends to continue using both platforms for a long time during a gradual and highly protracted transition process .
Another possibility is that Maemo will never completely displace S60 and Nokia will simply commit to using each one in certain segments .
Regardless of which approach Nokia takes , it seems likely that Qt is going to be the common layer that facilitates the transition .
Nokia 's recent port of Qt to S60 makes it easier to build applications that can target both S60 and Maemo .
Harmattan is said to make extensive use of Qt , unlike Maemo 5 and all previous versions which have been built on GTK +.
I 'm inclined to think that Maemo would make a pretty good smartphone platform .
Its strong Linux roots and close alignment with upstream desktop Linux technologies would make it a more appealing option than Android for many third - party developers and hardware makers who do n't want to get locked into Android 's insular ecosystem .
The ability to take the vast number of existing desktop GTK + and Qt applications and port them trivially to a smartphone is also an appealing factor .
The advantage that Maemo offers over Symbian is easier application development and a more modern platform stack .
Ever since the first Nokia Internet Tablet device hit the market , a number of our readers have challenged the relevance of the product and argued that there is no compelling reason to carry an extra handheld device alongside a smartphone .
Indeed , my own use of the Nokia Internet Tablet has largely declined as a result of significant advancements in smartphone browser quality — a trend that is clearly accelerating .
Several other staff members who owned N800s have expressed similar sentiments .
A Maemo smartphone could have the potential to be a real winner and would make the platform highly relevant again .
The legitimacy of the information that was leaked to MobileCrunch is still in question .
The timing of the leak — the night before the official release of the Moblin 2 beta — makes it look a bit suspicious .
I 'm enthusiastic about the prospect of a Maemo smartphone , but I think it 's still too early to draw a whole lot of solid conclusions from the information that was exposed by the leak .
Herschel mated with Ariane 5 ECA Launcher
11 May 2009
Move to the final assembly building
On Wednesday 29 April the Herschel spacecraft was transported from the S5B building to the final assembly building ( Bâtiment d'Assemblage Final , or BAF ) at the Ariane launch site of the European spaceport in Kourou .
For this transport , over about 10 kilometres , the Herschel spacecraft was placed inside the payload transport container ( Conteneur Charge Utile 3 , or CCU3 ) at the S5B building .
The CCU3 transport container was used to maintain a cleanroom environment during the transport to the BAF .
Upon arrival at the BAF , the CCU3 container was placed inside the BAF airlock .
This 47 - m - high part of the BAF building at its top has an opening into the adjacent 90 - m - high hall where the Ariane 5 ECA launcher stands .
Herschel mating with launcher
After ensuring cleanroom conditions inside the BAF airlock , on the next morning the spacecraft was rolled out of the CCU3 container .
The launcher ring adapter , which was already installed at the base of the spacecraft 's service module , was disconnected from the raising cylinder on the CCU3 pallet .
With the spacecraft secured by the three arms of the vertical lifting device , Herschel was lifted from the CCU3 pallet and hoisted up inside the BAF airlock and into to the high bay of the BAF .
Inside the high bay stood the Ariane 5 ECA launcher with the Planck spacecraft and the SYLDA 5 support structure , which were mated already on top of the launcher on 23 and 27 April , respectively .
The SYLDA 5 ( Système de Lancement Double Ariane 5 ) is a support structure that can be used during joint launches on an Ariane 5 launcher to carry the upper part of the launcher 's payload , which in this case is the Herschel spacecraft .
It consists of a load - bearing carbon structure that at its base is fixed to the launcher .
With its high cylindrical shell and truncated conical shell at the top the SYLDA 5 encapsulates the lower part of the launcher 's payload ; in this case the Planck spacecraft .
The top of the SYLDA 5 is open through which the top 25 centimetres of the Planck spacecraft protrude .
This part of the Planck spacecraft will be enclosed in the space just under the Herschel spacecraft , inside the about 0.33 - m- high launcher adapter ring ( ACU ) .
In the morning on 30 April an overhead crane manoeuvred the Herschel spacecraft over the SYLDA 5 support structure .
The Herschel spacecraft was lowered into place after which the launcher adapter ring and the SYLDA 5 structure were bolted together and the flight torques were applied .
The electrical connections between the ACU and SYLDA 5 were installed and verified , followed by a functional check of the Herschel spacecraft after its mating with the SYLDA 5 on the Ariane 5 ECA launcher .
The launcher carrying the two spacecraft ( which is over 35 metres tall ) is hidden from view by the two movable access platforms that surround the top of the launcher at the level just below the base of the SYLDA 5 and at the top of the SYLDA 5 or as convenient .
How old is the universe ?
Scientists agree that the answer is somewhere around 14 billion years ( give or take a few million ) ... unless you happen to be a student in the state of Texas .
Advertisement
The Texas Board of Education voted on Friday to remove the universe's age from the state 's educational standards , used as source material for the state 's school textbooks .
According to Dan Quinn of the Texas Freedom Network , this decision is a backdoor entrance for creationists and fans of intelligent design :
The goal here was to make science more tentative and vague so that teachers have room to tell students , ' This is only one explanation and the scientists are not even sure about it themselves ' – which is , of course , utter nonsense .
Advertisement
The decision was only one of many made on Friday , and sadly , only one of many that suggested an anti-science agenda ( Other decisions included specific language requiring scientific explanations on evolution to be " evaluated " by students and teachers , ominously enough ) .
Chair of the Board Don McLeroy testified to the reason why that may be the case at the meeting :
I disagree with these experts .
Someone has got to stand up to experts .
That 's right !
Standing up to experts and facts is exactly what the chair of an educational board 's job is supposed to be !
Well , at least there 's always the internet to fill in gaps in these kids ' education ...
Texas vote leaves loopholes for teaching creationism [ New Scientist ]
Any child confronting an outraged parent demanding to know " What were you thinking ? " now has a new response : " Scientists have discovered that my brain is organized differently than yours . "
But all is not well for errant kids .
The same new study also provides parents with a rejoinder :
While the overarching organization scheme differs , one of the most important core principals of adult brain organization is present in the brains of children as young as 7 .
" Regardless of how tempting it might be to assume otherwise , a normal child 's brain is not inherently disorganized or chaotic , " says senior author Steven E. Petersen , Ph.D. , the James McDonnell Professor of Cognitive Neuroscience at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis .
" It 's differently organized but at least as capable as an adult brain . "
The findings are published online in PLoS Computational Biology by researchers at Washington University and Oregon Health and Science University .
Petersen and his colleagues study normal brain organization and development to learn more about how developmental disorders and brain injury can impair mental capabilities .
They plan to apply what they learn to develop new treatments for such disorders .
The researchers use resting - state functional connectivity MRI to identify and study brain networks .
Instead of recording mental activity when volunteers work on a cognitive task , resting - state connectivity scans the spontaneous activity that takes place in their brains while they do nothing .
When this brain activity rises and falls at the same time in different brain regions , researchers conclude that those areas likely work together .
Through such studies , scientists previously revealed four brain networks with varying responsibilities in the adult brain .
Two of those networks , for example , appear to be co-captains in charge of most voluntary brain function ( see http://mednews.wustl.edu/news/page/normal/9639.html).
The networks typically involve tight links between several brain regions that are physically distant from each other .
In the new study , this is where the organizational contrast arises : Instead of having networks made of brain regions that are distant from each other but functionally linked , most of the tightest connections in a child 's brain are between brain regions that are physically close to each other .
The study was led by Damien A. Fair , Ph.D. , a former Washington University graduate student now at Oregon Health and Science University , and Alexander L. Cohen , a current Washington University graduate student .
They directed analysis of data from 210 subjects ranging from 7 to 31 years old .
" We took a group of the youngest subjects , analyzed their results , then dropped data from the youngest and added data from the next - oldest and redid the analysis until we had worked our way through all subjects , " Fair says .
" The result was a detailed movie of how the organizational transition from a child 's brain to an adult 's brain takes place .
It clearly shows a switch from localized networks based on physical proximity to long - distance networks centered on functionality . "
Researchers also checked children 's brains for " small - world " organization , another organizational quality present in adult brains .
In less formal contexts , this is sometimes called " Kevin Bacon " organization after the trivia game known as " six degrees of Kevin Bacon . "
The game highlights how easy it is to connect any actor or actress to Kevin Bacon in six movies or less through links among various co-stars .
" It 's the idea of a large network that lets you connect one node with another in a relatively short number of steps via special nodes , " Fair says .
" Like Kevin Bacon , these special nodes have many connections to other nodes , allowing them to help shorten the amount of steps that have to be taken when connecting nodes . "
Scientists already knew that children had many fewer long - distance links among brain regions than adults , but when they looked more closely they found there were enough of these links and nodes with multiple connections to establish small - world organization .
Researchers set the lower limit for study subjects at 7 years of age because the brain is approximately 95 percent of its adult size at this age , but they are currently examining ways to adapt the study to the changing physical geography of younger brains .
They have also begun looking at the same phenomena in subjects with brain injuries and developmental disorders .

In a recent PHP conference in London some great speakers spoke about new features in PHP to be released in PHP 5.3 .
PHP 5.3 contains functionality that was scheduled for PHP 6 , which takes PHP 5.3 from being a minor release to a significant and huge release .
A release that no PHP developer should ignore .
Most of these features are pretty complicated additions for novice PHP programmers .
I have listed some features and some ways to use them .
1 ) Namespaces for classes and functions
This feature will help us shorten the class names and function names .
To appreciate this feature , we need to go back to the days before there was Object Oriented Programming in PHP .
Imagine all the function names with name save ( ) .
How would you differentiate if the call save ( ) was to save a blogs or save comments ?
The solution was to use blog_save ( ) or comment_save ( ) before the introduction of classes in which we could write the save ( ) function within the Blog class or the Comment class .
Using classes is obviously a much more elegant solution .
We now have the same situation with the large number of classes and functions .
Using namespaces , we could simply separate the two functions above in the code below :
<? php namespace Blog ; function save ( ) { echo " Now saving the blog ! " ; } namespace Comment ; function save ( ) { echo " Now saving the comment ! " ; } // To invoke the functions Blog\save ( ) ; //
This prints - Now saving the blog !
Comment\save ( ) ; //
This prints - Now saving the comment ! ?>
EDIT : A final decision was made on October 2008 .
Developers will have to use \ backslash operator to dereference namespaces .
2 ) MySQL Native Driver
PHP 5.3 has a native driver specific to PHP , optimised for the ZEND engine .
It is an alternative to connect to MySQL server versions newer than 4.1 .
Being a native driver we should be able to get much faster execution times .
The native driver will also be licensed under the PHP license .
If you are like most users , you are currently using libmysql ( A MySQL database client library ) you will be able to easily switch over to mysqlnd without making any changes to your existing PHP Scripts !
3 ) phar – PHp ARchive
This is a cool new feature .
Think of it like an archive , like a .zip file or a . tar file .
Besides just being able to group all the files into one simple file , we will be able to deliver and run an entire PHP application from a single file !
We will also be able to use phar archives within PHP , so the following will work in PHP 5.3 and above
<?php include " singlefilelibrary.phar " ?>
Obviously , there will be a performance hit but the possibilities are endless , imagine being able to upload phpMyAdmin to the server as a single phar file instead of hundreds of small files .
4 ) Closures & Lambdas
This gets into the list because this is something most web developers would have been familiar with while working on Javascript .
A lambda can be declared anywhere and they can be assigned to a variable .
A closure on the other hand are lambda funcions but have access to the variables where they were declared .
This is something called lexical scoping .
To see this in action take a look at this example .
<? php $ hellolambda = function ( ) { echo " Hello world via Lambda " ; } $ hellolambda ( ) ; // Outputs Hello world via Lambda ?>
5 ) All of the rest !
There are a lot of other things in PHP 5.3 which I thought are nice , I have just described all of them very succinctly .
Functors :
This allows an object to be invoked as a function .
Traits :
This is a new unit of reuse , traits can be incomplete , provides reusability , modularity and structure .
In short it is copy - paste glorified !
Magic functions :
We have a couple of new magic functions for classes ( interceptors ) __callstatic ( ) and invoke ( )
Ternary operator :
You can now display the a value that exists $ value1 or $ value2 using this simple statement echo $ value1 ?:$ value2 ;
There are many more things added like Late Static Binding , Variable Static Calls , Changes to PHP Error Levels , new PHP functions , improvements to help with OpenID , Command line and many more .
Final Thought
Well , this gives us much more to play with .
It is definitely a lot to include into PHP 5.3 and I would have expected so many changes to go into PHP 6 .
I sometimes wonder if there will be anything new left to add into PHP 6 given the fact that so much has been released already .
If you are interested in PHP 5.3 , do give it a try here , it is in beta at the time of the writing .
Engine Yard , which has offered services for the Ruby language and Ruby on Rails , has taken over maintenance responsibilities for an older release of the language .
The company will maintain the Ruby 1.8.6 line , offering fixes for security and bugs as well as looking to increase the speed of the Ruby interpreter , said Ezra Zygmuntowicz , founder of Engine Yard , on Thursday afternoon .
[ Related : Ruby developers urged to use test - driven development . ]
With many of its clients using Ruby 1.8.6 , Engine Yard was concerned that the Ruby development team in Japan might discontinue support for the line as it focuses on the newer Ruby 1.9 version .
Engine Yard offered to take over maintenance for the older line , Zygmuntowicz said .
There are some incompatibilities between the two lines , Zygmuntowicz said .
" Not all of the libraries and frameworks work with Ruby 1.9 yet , " he said .
In a blog post , Engine Yard 's Kirk Haines sought to reassure Ruby users about the company 's new role with Ruby 1.8.6 and allay fears about possible forking .
" I have heard some people express concerns about Engine Yard maintaining Ruby 1.8.6 :
That we 're going to fork it or do other unfriendly things with it .
I want to make it clear that our plans are to be conservative as maintainers , " Haines said in a blog post .
" We will fix bugs and performance issues , address security issues , and test to ensure that when releases are made , they are of as high a quality as possible .
Anything else , like adding new API 's or behaviors is completely outside of a maintainer 's role , so we wo n't be doing that . "
Engine Yard anticipates supporting Ruby 1.8.6 for at least two years , said Zygmuntowicz .
Bug fix requests can go to the same bug tracker as before , found at this Web page .
The company has offered cloud - based hosting for Rails applications .
Well that did n’t take long .
Was n’t it just last week that the health insurance lobby pledged to work with President Obama to help rein in health care costs , as part of the overall health care reform effort ?
And now , just seven days later , Blue Cross insurance is going all out to kill a major plank in Obama ’s health care reform plan .
You ’ll recall that Blue Cross is the “ insurance ” that Joe and I both have .
Joe ’s insurance just went up 25 % this year .
That ’s about how much mine has been going up for a few years now as well .
As I ’ve written before , funny , but Blue Cross ’ benefits do n’t go up that much each year .
In fact , Blue Cross caps my prescription drug benefits at the same level they were at 14 years ago .
In another decade I should be able to buy a Frappuccino with the value of my Blue Cross prescription drug benefits , after inflation .
Blue Cross is the worst .
Well , not the worst .
They all stink .
I remember my friend Michael , who had an HMO at the time , and was working on health care issues on the Hill , being told that he could n’t go to the emergency room , even though he was having trouble seeing in one eye that was scratched and now swelling shut , because all the folks at his HMO were at lunch .
Seriously .
They told him they were at lunch and he should call back later to see if he would be permitted to go the emergency room .
I remember how Blue Cross tried to screw my dying Spanish teacher in Chicago , Fernando Mendoza , and then tried to screw his wife after he died .
I remember how I tried to cut back on my health care expenses by buying drugs online , by buying generics , only to have Blue Cross make the process so impossibly hard , only to have Blue Cross ’s own staff be so totally incompetent , only to have Blue Cross refuse to let me use my insurance to purchase cheaper drugs online from Costco ( supposedly because Blue Cross has a more - costly sweetheart deal with Walgreens ) .
Thieves .
And now Blue Cross is trying to kill the provision of Obama ’s plan that would give us the option to buy into some kind of public health care program .
Why ?
So they can ensure that all of us still have to pay for their lousy insurance , so they can continue to milk us dry with 25 % annual premium increases , so they can continue to let your prescription drug benefits wither away with the years .
Honestly , the government should look into regulating Blue Cross and its brethren as posing a danger to public health .
We ought to be having a debate as to whether the government shuts down Blue Cross , or takes over its management , rather than whether Blue Cross gets the option to kill our only hope at getting real health care .
One final word .
Blue Cross wants to play the socialism card , which is exactly what its new ads are doing sotto voce .
They want to suggest that government involvement in health care is bad , like in Europe , as Blue Cross ’ Republican friends keep telling us ?
Okay , let ’s talk about health care in Europe .
Let ’s talk about why France is number one in health care in the world .
About how I went to the doctor to check on a chest cold I ’d had for six weeks .
About how I saw the doctor within 12 hours of requesting the appointment .
About how my appointment cost me only 30 bucks .
About how she told me I needed a chest X - Ray .
About how I was able to make the appointment for the X - Ray four hours from when I called .
About how I arrived and they had me in the X - Ray in three minutes after I arrived .
About how in 15 minutes the doctor was diagnosing me .
About how in 20 minutes , I walked out the door , X - Rays and diagnosis in hand , having paid only 40 euros ( 50 bucks ) or so for the entire thing .
About how the chest x-ray in the states would have cost me $ 400 , and certainly would n’t have happened four hours after I called , and I sure as hell would n’t be permitted to waltz into the office and get the X - Ray three minutes after arriving .
Let ’s talk about how I called Blue Cross to find out if they ’d cover my chest X - Ray – this was before I knew it was so cheap , the French doctor told me it was going to be “ expensive . ”
I spent almost half an hour on the phone with some idiot at Blue Cross – I was calling her from Paris , mind you – who could not figure out if they would cover my stupid chest X - Ray while I was in France .
Nice lady , but a blithering idiot .
I finally gave up , after nearly half an hour , and figured I ’d take my chances and just pay the bill anyway – better option than getting pneumonia .
I ’ve been through American health care .
I ’ve done my time at Georgetown Hospital ( truly a horror show ) .
I ’m only 45 years old and I already have enough minor health care problems that Blue Cross cut my prescription coverage off last year at the beginning of November .
God forbid if I live another ten , fifteen years .
What new ways will Blue Cross find to torture me then ?
America can’t afford to have people like Blue Cross deciding if we live or die .
Enough is enough .
If these pigs are going to try to Harry and Louise health care reform again , then the groups running this battle , and the administration , need to take Blue Cross down .
It ’s time to stop playing nice .
It ’s time to stop doing what Washington politicians and Washington non-profits always do .
It ’s time to play hardball .
Blue Cross and its ilk either need to help us pass this legislation , or we need to take them down , hard .

PARIS , France ( CNN ) --
The Church of Scientology went on trial this week in France , accused of fraud in a case that sheds light on the group .
The Church of Scientology 's bookshop in Paris is part of the case being heard in France .
If found guilty , the church could be forced to shut down in France , though appeals could see the case continue for years .
" This is a process in heresy , " Daniele Gounord , the spokeswoman for Scientology in France , told reporters .
The two plaintiffs , both women , say they were defrauded by the organization , which is classified as a sect in France .
Their complaints focus on the use of a device that Scientologists say measures spiritual well - being .
Members use the electropsychometer , or E - Meter , to " locate areas of spiritual duress or travail so they can be addressed and handled , " according to Scientology 's Web site .
The women say that , after using the device , they were encouraged to pay for vitamins and books .
They say that amounted to fraud .
The first plaintiff , Aude - Claire Malton , is a housekeeper at a Paris hotel who says she spent about € 21,000 ( $ 29,000 ) in " sauna therapy " and classes to " heal the mind , " according to French media .
Her fellow plaintiff is Nelly Reziga , who has told French media that her boss fired her because she refused to attend classes at the Scientology church .
Reziga 's boss , Max Barbault , was originally a defendant but has died , according to French media .
Six Scientology members are now on trial , along with two corporate entities -- the church and the bookshop it runs in Paris .
If found guilty , the Scientology members would face a maximum of 10 years in prison and fines of as much as € 10 million ( $ 13.9 million ) each .
The church and the bookshop could be liable for as much as € 5 million ( $ 6.95 million ) in fines and could be forced to shut down if found guilty .
The trial began Monday and is scheduled to last until June 17 .
The defendants are expected to appeal if found guilty .

A woman jailed for trying to flee the witness box , while giving evidence against a man she claimed raped her , has called for the judge to be sacked .
Ann Robertson , 43 , was remanded by Roger Craik QC during the case against George Cummings at the High Court in Edinburgh earlier this month .
She was arrested and taken to police cells overnight after failing to deliver her testimony .
Ms Robertson made a complaint about the temporary judge to the Crown Office .
The trial resulted in George Cummings , from Grangemouth , near Falkirk , being found guilty of abusing two young girls during the 1970s .
The man 's totally out of line .
Absolutely appalling
Ann Robertson
Pensioner jailed for child abuse
However , the charge of raping Ms Robertson was dropped .
He has been sentenced to three - and - half years in prison .
Ms Robertson accused Mr Craik , who is also a sheriff , of treating her more like a criminal than a victim after he instructed her to be held at St Leonard 's police station in Edinburgh overnight .
She said : " The judge turned round and said ' well maybe a night in the cells will calm you down ' .
" It was just totally out of line and then I was escorted from the witness box and then I was arrested by the police . "
She added : " The man 's totally out of line .
Absolutely appalling .
" And if that 's the way that he 's going to treat future victims then his reaction is going to stop people coming forward . "
Ms Robertson 's complaints against Sheriff Craik is being considered by Scotland 's most senior judge .
Figures show that of the 922 allegations of rape in Scotland last year , only 27 resulted in convictions .
Arsenal Cruise Past Cardiff City In FA Cup
A double from the returning Eduardo helped Arsenal dump Cardiff City out of the FA Cup and send the Gunners into the fifth round .
Arsenal 4 - 0 Cardiff City
Having endured a goalless draw 22 days ago , Arsenal and Cardiff City met again at the Emirates Stadium aiming to book themselves a spot in the fifth round of the FA Cup and a date with Burnley .
Yet there was no doubt what the main talking point of the night was always going to be ; the return of Arsenal striker Eduardo , back in the side after a year out with injury .
Certainly the Croatian began the game brightly , as did the home side , and they might have been ahead as early as the fifth minute .
Bacary Sagna found space down the right and crossed for Nicolas Bendtner , who had pulled off the back of Roger Johnson to find space , but could only direct his header wide .
Moments later and Bendtner had another opportunity , Eduardo set up Carlos Vela for the shot which Tom Heaton parried .
However , the Dane collected the loose ball but could only fire straight at the Cardiff stopper .
Even so , Arsenal were rampant in the opening exchanges and mid-way through the first half they finally had their reward , and fittingly it was Eduardo who found the back of the net .
The striker began the move , bearing down on goal on the left flank before slipping a ball to the overlapping Vela .
The Mexican advanced before clipping an inviting return ball back to Eduardo to head past the despairing dive of Heaton and send the home crowd into raptures .
The Gunners continued to press and just after the half hour mark they doubled their lead .
A corner in from the right by Samir Nasri found Bendtner running off the back post , unnoticed , to head home .
Yet Bendtner really ought to have put the game beyond the Bluebirds right on half - time .
Another superb delivery from the right by Sagna found Vela , taking a touch before swiveling and shooting at Heaton .
The Cardiff keeper parried the shot but only into the Dane ’s path yet with the goal gaping he conspired to hit the post before collecting the rebound and shooting straight at Heaton who saved again and the chance went begging .
The second half continued in much the same vein and on the hour mark Arsenal finally put the game out of sight .
A scramble in the Cardiff area saw Alex Rae eventually foul Eduardo and referee Mark Halsey pointed straight to the spot .
There was no doubt over who would take the kick and up stepped the Croatian to send Heaton the wrong way for his second goal of the night .
It was to be his last telling contribution of the match as with a little over 20 minutes to go he was substituted to wild applause , with Robin van Persie the man coming on in his place .
The Dutchman had the best chances of the closing stages and finally got his goal with minutes to go with a clinical finish after good work by Bendtner .
The striker then almost grabbed his second of the night but he headed against the post in stoppage time .
Yet the night belonged to Eduardo and Arsenal as Cardiff departed North London well beaten .
The Gunners , meanwhile , head onwards and upwards and now face Burnley in the fifth round and with it , a chance to gain revenge for their League Cup exit at the hands of Owen Coyle ’s men .
Arsenal : Fabianski , Sagna , Toure , Gallas , Gibbs , Nasri ( Ramsey , 68 ) , Song , Denilson , Vela ( Bischoff , 74 ) , Eduardo ( van Persie , 67 ) , Bendtner .
Cardiff City : Heaton , McNaughton , Rae ( Scimeca , 74 ) , Purse ( Blake , 68 , Johnson , Parry ( Whittingham , 68 ) , Ledley , Kennedy , Burke , Bothroyd , McCormack .
GOALS
4 -0 Arsenal ( van Persie , 89 )
3 -0 Arsenal ( Eduardo , 60 pen )
2-0 Arsenal ( Bendtner , 33 )
1 -0 Arsenal ( Eduardo , 20 )

Extreme Piercing at Festival Phuket
Probably the most fascinating and also somewhat gruesome festivals in the world , the Phuket Vegetarian Festival is best known for its aesthetic displays of unusual body piercings .
You may see devotees with tire irons through their cheeks , or large spikes driven through their tongues .
The festival is held for just over a week annually during the ninth lunar month of the Chinese calendar , falling somewhere in October .
The Phuket Vegetarian Festival and its rituals are thought by many to bring good fortune to religious followers .
Phuket residents of Chinese ancestry , called Hokkien Chinese , follow a strict vegan or vegetarian diet for 10 days for the purposes of merit - making and spiritual cleansing .
This is accompanied by sacred rituals at Chinese temples and shrines around the island .
Stalls of vegan food are set up throughout Phuket City , and even non-vegans will be suitably impressed by the delicious selection .
The festival started in 1825 the paricipants are not allowed to eat meat or have sex at the time of the festival .
For obvious reasons participants are asked to use only sterile blades , spears and guns .
According to physicians there is a risk of HIV and hepatitis .
Perhaps the most visual of these rituals are the displays of extreme body piercings with large objects that can range from knives to umbrellas .
Devotees , called ma song , may even partake in walking over hot coals barefoot or climbing up ladders that have rungs made of knife blades .
Visitors can see the ma song walking in their trances during long parades through the streets on every day of the festival .
10 RULES FOR THE VEGETARIAN FESTIVAL
1. Cleanliness of bodies during the festival
2. Clean kitchen utensils and to use them seperately from other who do not join the festival
3 . Wear white during the festival
4. Behave physically and mentally
5 . No meat eating
6. No sex
7 . No alcoholic drinks
8 . People at mourning period should not attend the festival
9 . Pragnant ladies should not watch any ritual
10 . Ladies with period should not attend the ritual
( CNN ) -- Continental shelves beneath the retreating polar ice caps of the Arctic may hold almost double the amount of oil previously found in the region , scientists say .
A new survey finds the Arctic could hold almost double the amount of oil previously found in the region .
In new findings , the U.S. Geological Survey estimates the Arctic may be home to 30 percent of the planet 's undiscovered natural gas reserves and 13 percent of its undiscovered oil .
A team of scientists at the USGS collaborated with international researchers to conduct the first - ever comprehensive assessment of undiscovered oil and gas reserves within the Arctic Circle .
" We tried to put some boundaries on the range of possibilities and resources available in the Arctic , " said geologist Donald Gautier , lead author of the survey , which is published this week in the journal Science .
Using geological analysis and probability modeling , researchers mapped out sedimentary rock deposits to estimate the amount of undiscovered oil and gas beneath undersea continental shelves .
This survey , the first of its kind , could help oil and gas companies locate new troves of fossil fuels .
Researchers say that deep ocean basins have relatively low petroleum potential , but the Arctic is one of the world 's largest remaining areas where oil and gas are accessible .
Most of the reserves are projected to be in less than 500 meters of water -- roughly a third of a mile deep .
Do n't Miss Carter pushes energy reform plan to Congress
Undiscovered oil in the Arctic may account for almost 4 percent of the world 's remaining conventionally recoverable oil resources , USGS scientists say .
" It would not mean that there would be any kind of a significant shift in global oil balance , " Gautier said .
" But this is especially significant for the Arctic nations . "
Nations whose borders lie within the Arctic Circle are Canada , Greenland / Denmark , Norway , Russia and the United States .
Although it 's closer to North America , Greenland is considered part of the Kingdom of Denmark .
If significant quantities of oil were found off the coast of northeast Greenland , for example , that could mean the difference between Greenland becoming independent from Denmark or not , Gautier said .
" Based on our study , there are 40 [ billion ] to 160 billion barrels of oil north of the Arctic Circle , " said Gautier .
The USGS had previously estimated the Arctic is home to 90 billion barrels of oil .
The Energy Information Administration , a division of the Department of Energy , estimates that the world currently uses 30 billion barrels of oil a year .
Offshore oil exploration in the Arctic is still in its infancy , but ExxonMobil and other oil companies already have staked their claim and started drilling in the Mackenzie Delta , the Barents Sea , the Sverdrup Basin , and offshore Alaska .
" It makes sense to diversify sources of oil and gas , given that the U.S. is one of the biggest consumers of oil and gas , " said Alan Jeffers , a spokesperson for ExxonMobil .
" We support public policy efforts that provide greater access to these resources .
We think that the energy is needed for the country 's needs , and would help improve energy security and supplies , " he added .
But conservationists say more oil and gas extraction could have dire effects on the Arctic 's fragile ecosystems , especially since many of the resources are controlled by countries and exempt from international environmental laws .
Drilling for oil in some areas of the Arctic could cause toxins such as arsenic , mercury and lead to be released into ocean waters , said Lisa Speer , Director of the International Oceans Program at the Natural Resources Defense Council .
" We need uniform , mandatory standards governing offshore oil and gas activity in the Arctic because activity in one country has the potential to affect the environment of the Arctic far beyond the country of origin , " Speer said .
The assessment also projects that the Arctic 's vast natural gas reserves will strengthen Russia 's status as the world 's largest producer of natural gas , Gautier said .
The USGS survey does not address the economic risks or technological challenges of extracting the Arctic 's oil and gas .
" As new data become apparent , our understanding of the resources in the Arctic can change , " said Gautier .

The soap opera that is Gov. Sarah Palin ’s political career took another turn late today as Palin has been forced to tell her supporters not to donate to an unofficial legal defense fund , because she is legally not allowed to accept the donations .
You would have thought that her supporters might have checked the law , before they set up the website and the fund , but apparently they are as smart as she is .
The unofficial legal defense fund was set up by Clayton Paslay , who runs the Free American Citizens PAC .
The organizers had contended that the fund is legal .
The Sarah Palin Blog posted that , “ It is legal .
It ’s just not the official one .
Please tell people that the official one is soon to come .
Again , we do not know that donors will comply with our terms and guidelines which are very strict – we may end up needing to contact every single donor to ask the questions that we will be asking .
However , we appreciate any and all assistance !
Thank you . ”
Apparently it was n’t quite legal enough because Meghan Stapleton , a Palin family spokesperson , sent out a statement through SarahPAC that told her supporters not to donate to the unofficial fund , “ The continuing generosity of Alaskans and Americans is overwhelming as many reach out to assist Governor Sarah Palin and her family with their legal bills .
However , the official legal defense fund for Governor Sarah Palin has not been formed and the Governor cannot accept monies for those obligations from any other entity than the one in formation .
Numerous federal and state laws need to be abided by and the official legal defense fund will have very strict donation guidelines .
We thank everyone interested in helping the Governor .
The best way to assist her will be through this official fund which will launch later this month . ”

I guess somebody did n’t fully examine the law before they set up this fund .
It is nice to see that Palin ’s supporters are just as clueless as she is .
How these morons could set up a fund , and tell Palin ’s supporters that it is legal , when obviously they did n’t do their full diligence is beyond me .
Of course , the idea for this legal defense came from Bill O’Reilly which should have been a big red flag to all involved , as the next good idea that O’Reilly has will be his first .
If I was Palin , I would flattered by the gesture , but also breathing a sigh of relief , because I just avoided another ethical landmine .
However , since Palin and ethical problems go together like peanut butter and jelly , it is a pretty safe bet that there will be more problems in her future .

Oil and Energy Trends - China looks for more oil
The growing share of imports in China 's oil balance is a source of increasing concern to policy - makers in Peking .
The government 's response has been to try and secure as much crude oil as possible from foreign suppliers under long - term contract arrangements .
To this end , it has concluded several deals : often on a government - to - government basis ... Two of the latest deals have involved loans totalling $ 37 bn to Venezuela and Russia .
The Venezuelan loan–amounting to $ 12 bn–is in return for a long term supply contract for up to 200,000 bpd of Venezuelan crude oil .
Venezuela exported 129,000 bpd of crude to China in 2008 .
The Russian deal involves loans worth $ 25 bn made to an oil producer – Rosneft– and the national pipeline company – Transneft– in return for a 20 - year deal to supply China with 300,000 bpd of oil from 2011 .
The oil is expected to come from eastern Sibe-ria .
The arrangements involve the construction of a 40 - mile spur line from the planned main export pipe - line from Eastern Siberia to the Pacific Ocean .
The spur line will connect with a pipeline within China supplying the refining centre of Daqing , in the north - east of the country .
The Chinese are reported to be discussing further large oil - related loan arrangements .
The China Development Bank is thought to be willing to provide loans of up to $ 10 bn to the Brazilian state oil company , Petrobras , as part of a deal that could see the supply of 160,000 bpd of Brazilian crude to China .
James D. Hamilton - Understanding Crude Oil Prices - The Energy Journal volume 30 number 2 .
This paper examines the factors responsible for changes in crude oil prices .
The paper reviews the statistical behavior of oil prices , relates this to the predictions of theory , and looks in detail at key features of petroleum demand and supply ...
Our overall conclusion is that the low price - elasticity of short - run demand and supply , the vulnerability of supplies to disruptions , and the peak in U.S. oil production account for the broad behavior of oil prices over 1970 - 1997 .
Although the traditional economic theory of exhaustible resources does not fit in an obvious way into this historical account , the profound change in demand coming from the newly industrialized countries and recognition of the finiteness of this resource offers a plausible explanation for more recent developments .
In other words , the scarcity rent may have been negligible for previous generations but may now be becoming relevant ... The $ 140 / barrel price in the summer of 2008 and the $ 60 / barrel in November of 2008 could not both be consistent with the same calculation of a scarcity rent warranted by long - term fundamentals .
Notwithstanding , the algebra of compound growth suggests that if demand growth resumes in China and other countries at its previous rate , the date at which the scarcity rent will start to make an important contribution to the price , if not here already , can not be far away .
Justine Barden , William Pepper , Vineet Aggarwal - The Impact of High Oil Prices on Global and Regional Natural Gas and LNG Markets - The Energy Journal Volume 30 Special issue on natural gas markets .
Oil prices are notoriously hard to predict , but they are an important input in many energy and economic models .
This paper explores the effects of different oil price assumptions on natural gas markets ( production , consumption , prices in different regions ) in the International Natural Gas Model ( INGM ) .
Three cases from the INGM are presented : a reference case , a high oil price case and a second high oil price case , where gas - to - liquids ( GTL ) capacity additions are constrained .
The results show that regardless of constraints on GTL capacity additions , higher oil prices lead to higher production and consumption of natural gas .
However , when GTL capacity is allowed to expand , higher oil prices generally lead to higher natural gas prices and to less gas consumption in the electric power and industrial sectors as they switch to cheaper fuels and more natural gas is diverted to the production of GTLs .
Kevin F. Forbes and Ernest M. Zampelli - Modeling the Growth in Gas Reserves From Known Fields - The Energy Journal Volume 30 Special issue on natural gas markets .
The extent to which future United States demand for natural gas is satisfied by imports of LNG is contingent on the adequacy and cost competitiveness of North American supplies .
One of the cheaper and more important sources of natural gas supply is accounted for by reserve appreciation , i.e. , reserve growth , in known fields .
Based on an extensively applied methodology developed by Arrington ( 1960 ) , the increase in proved ultimate recovery is presumed to increase at a diminishing rate with the age of the field .
In this paper , a single equation model of natural gas reserve growth in the Gulf of Mexico is developed and estimated .
The results strongly suggest that the annual growth rate in the reserves of a field is significantly affected by initial discovery size , price , water depth , and unobserved field - specific effects .
Hence , estimating oil and gas reserve growth using an Arrington based approach may underestimate the response of reserve growth to changes in economic fundamentals .
Tayebeh Ameri , Gilles Dennler , Christoph Lungenschmied and Christoph J. Brabec - Organic Tandem Solar Cells : A review - Energy and Environmental Science , 2009 , volume 2 .
The same analysis performed above for traditional PV can be carried out for organic solar cells .
It reveals that although organic solar cell research was marginal before 1999 , it is currently experiencing an exponential growth .
Over the last eight years , the number of papers directly addressing organic solar cells has increased by about 65 % per annum that is almost twice the breathtaking evolutionary pace of the world photovoltaic market .
Consequently , in 2006 10 % of the scientific publications dealing with photovoltaics focused on organic solar cells .
These impressive figures suggest that the science surrounding the topic of organic solar cells has been evolving greatly during the last years .
While the best efficiency reported eight years ago barely reached values higher than 1 % , several teams have recently realized devices showing efficiency beyond 5 %. 11 –13
Though impressive , this value is not high enough to allow direct competition against mature PV technologies .
Thus , the development of more efficient devices is required to ensure a bright industrial future for organic semiconductors .
In this regard , the recent realization of tandem solar cells may pave the way toward high performance OSC .
In this article we aim to review the most important and recent developments that have been reported on organic tandem solar cells .
Ioannis Vallios , Theocharis Tsoutsos , George Papadakis - Design of Biomass District Heating Systems - Biomass and Bioenergy 33:4
The biomass exploitation takes advantage of the agricultural , forest , and manure residues and in extent , urban and industrial wastes , which under controlled burning conditions , can generate heat and electricity , with limited environmental impacts .
Biomass can – significantly – contribute in the energy supplying system , if the engineers will adopt the necessary design changes to the traditional systems and become more familiar with the design details of the biomass heating systems .
The aim of this paper is to present a methodology of the design of biomass district heating systems taking into consideration the optimum design of building structure and urban settlement around the plant .
The essential energy parameters are presented for the size calculations of a biomass burning - district heating system , as well as for the environmental ( i.e. Greenhouse Gas Emissions ) and economic evaluation ( i.e. selectivity and viability of the relevant investment ) .
Emphasis has been placed upon the technical parameters of the biomass system , the economic details of the boiler , the heating distribution network , the heat exchanger and the Greenhouse Gas Emissions .
Christian Kerschner and Klaus Hubacek - Assessing the suitability of input–output analysis for enhancing our understanding of potential economic effects of Peak Oil - Energy 34:3
Given recent developments on energy markets and skyrocketing oil prices , we argue for an urgent need to study the potential effects of world oil production reaching a maximum ( Peak Oil ) in order to facilitate the development of adaptation policies .
We consider input–output ( IO ) modelling as a powerful tool for this purpose .
However , the standard Leontief type model implicitly assumes that all necessary inputs to satisfy a given demand can and will be supplied .
This is problematic if the availability of certain key inputs becomes restricted and it is therefore only of limited usefulness for the study of the phenomenon of Peak Oil .
Hence this paper firstly reviews two alternative modelling tools within the IO framework : supply - driven and mixed models .
The former has been severely criticised for its problematic assumption of perfect factor substitution and perfect elasticity of demand as revealed by Oosterhaven [ Oosterhaven J .
On the plausibility of the supply - driven IO model .
J Reg Sci 1988 ; 28:203–17} .
The supply - constrained model on the other hand proved well suited to analyse the quantity dimension of Peak Oil and is therefore applied empirically in the second part of the paper , using data for the UK , Japanese and Chilean economy .
Results show how differences in net - oil exporting and net - oil importing countries are clearly visible in terms of final demand .
Industries , most affected in all countries , include transportation , electricity production and financial and trade services .
Ugo Bardi - Peak oil :
The four stages of a new idea - Energy 34:3
The present paper reviews the reactions and the path of acceptance of the theory known as “ peak oil ” .
The theory was proposed for the first time by M.K. Hubbert in the 1950s as a way to describe the production pattern of crude oil .
According to Hubbert , the production curve is “ bell shaped ” and approximately symmetric .
Hubbert 's theory was verified with good approximation for the case of oil production in the United States that peaked in 1971 , and is now being applied to the worldwide oil production .
It is generally believed that the global peak of oil production ( “ peak oil ” ) will take place during the first decade of the 21st century , and some analysts believe that it has already occurred in 2005 or 2006 .
The theory and its consequences have unpleasant social and economical implications .
The present paper is not aimed at assessing the peak date but offers a discussion on the factors that affect the acceptance and the diffusion of the concept of “ peak oil ” with experts and with the general public .
The discussion is based on a subdivision of “ four stages of acceptance ” , loosely patterned after a sentence by Thomas Huxley .
Carlos de Castro , Luis Javier Miguel and Margarita Mediavilla -
The role of non conventional oil in the attenuation of peak oil - Energy Policy 37:5
In this paper , the possible substitution of conventional with non conventional oil is studied using system dynamics models .
The model proposed in this paper is based on geological , economic and technological aspects , and it fits approximately the behaviour observed by Hubbert .
A first validation of the model has been made with the USA oil production data .
These USA data show that there is a good coincidence between our model and the reality .
This model has been expanded in order to include the substitution of the conventional oil with the non conventional one for the World .
Two models with different ways to treat the contribution of non conventional oil have been developed and tested : a base model ( business as usual ) , which extrapolates the last two decades ’ growth of this type of oil into the future , and a model that explores how much non conventional oil would be needed in order to avoid a peak and decrease in the global non renewable fuel production .
The results show that , even under some hypotheses that we consider optimistic , the attenuation of the peak oil decline requires more than 10 % of sustained growth of non conventional oil production over at least the next two decades .

An 18 - year - old football player from Harbor City ’s Narbonne High School was shot dead Sunday night at a Compton restaurant .
His friends were planning a vigil for him at 7 tonight near the restaurant , on Rosecrans Avenue near Central Avenue .
Dannie Farber Jr. , an All - City receiver who helped Narbonne earn a co-City Section championship this fall , was eating at a Louisiana Fried Chicken in the 1900 block of Rosecrans Avenue when he was killed .
He was set to graduate June 19 .
" He was sitting there eating dinner with some girl , " said Coach Manuel Douglas .
" They walked in and shot him four times . "
Farber died of multiple wounds to his torso .
Sgt. David Infante of the Los Angeles County Sheriff ’s Department said today that homicide detectives were investigating the shooting , which occurred at 9:39 p.m .
Douglas said Farber had made " a lot of big plays . "
He caught a 4 - yard touchdown pass in the fourth quarter in a city semifinal playoff game that rallied the Gauchos to a 25 - 24 victory over Crenshaw High School and enabled the team to reach the championship game at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum .
" He was a real good kid , " said assistant coach Byron Moore Sr. , who had known Farber since coaching him in youth football .
" He was n’t involved in any gang .
It ’s a tragic loss .
He was always full of energy . "

Microsoft has moved closer to European sanctions for monopolising the internet browser market by withdrawing from oral hearings scheduled to take place in Brussels next month .
Microsoft said it had pulled out of the hearings set for 3 - 5 June because important European anti-trust officials would have been unable to attend , according to the Financial Times .
The US software company claimed it had asked the European Commission ( EC ) for alternative dates , but none had been offered .
The hearings stem from a December 2007 complaint by Norwegian browser company Opera Software that Microsoft is abusing its monopoly in operating systems to gain advantage for its browser , Internet Explorer .
Lawyers for Opera disputed Microsoft 's claims , accusing it of trying to avoid facing its critics , which include Google , Mozilla and Symantec .
The EC is reported to be just weeks away from making a decision on whether or not to impose a fine and other sanctions against Microsoft in the browser case .
European regulators sent the company a statement of objections earlier this year after carrying out investigations in response to Opera 's complaint .
Microsoft filed a defence late last month and requested an oral hearing , but if it fails to appear , the EC is free to move ahead to making a ruling in the case in the coming weeks .
In 2004 , the EC was successful in its monopoly abuse case against Microsoft for linking its media player to Windows , fining the software maker £ 497m .
The Home Office has rejected European Court of Human Rights demands that innocent people should not have their DNA stored on the national database .
Instead samples from people arrested for , but not convicted of serious violent or sexual crimes , will be removed after 12 years .
The DNA profiles of those arrested but not convicted for minor offences will be kept for six years .
The law will be changed to retrospectively add all prisoners serving time for serious violent or sexual offences to the database .
Police will also get the right to take samples from people convicted of serious crimes while abroad .
The changes have been made in response to a ruling from the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg .
The judges said they were struck by " the blanket and indiscriminate nature of the power of retention in England and Wales " .
In Scotland different rules are followed - only those convicted of serious offences get put on the database .
The Home Office agreed in December to remove profiles taken from children under the age of ten .
The police will additionally be asked to trawl through innocent DNA profiles , 850,000 of them , to try and link them to existing records on the Police National Computer , The Guardian reports .
Jacqui Smith said : " These new proposals will ensure that the right people are on it , as well as considering where people should come off .
We will ensure that the most serious offenders are added to the database no matter when or where they were convicted . "
The case was brought by two men from Sheffield who wanted their profiles removed .
Actual DNA samples will now be destroyed as soon as they are converted into profiles .
Children arrested but not convicted for minor offences will have their profiles destroyed when they turn 18 .
All those convicted of an offence recorded on the Police National Computer , from prostitution to taking a pedal cycle without consent , will have their DNA profile and fingerprints stored forever .
The big question is if Jacqui 's tweaks to the database will be enough to satisfy the European courts . ®
“ Let ’s not panic , ” Sir Philip Green , the proprietor of Topshop , the fashion behemoth that dominates Main Street retailing in England said Thursday morning .
The retailer was pep-talking his staff moments before the doors were flung open to the hordes lined up on Broadway for the long - delayed opening of Topshop ’s first American store , a 25,000 - square - foot emporium in SoHo .
“ Let ’s try to keep a nice even flow , ” Mr. Green added , words that could easily serve as a mantra for the many American retailers struggling to lure warm bodies into stores during a recession , which the British merchant claimed has left his business untouched .
“ All journalists want to talk about is the recession , but somebody must be shopping , because we ’re doing a couple of billion dollars of volume , ” said Mr. Green , whose privately held Arcadia Group reported operating profits of $ 502 million for the year that ended in August , a decline of 6.1 percent from the previous year .
Part of that owed to the volume of customers drawn into Topshop ’s London flagship ( as many as 250,000 pass through the doors of the Oxford Circus store every week , Mr. Green said ) .
Replicating those numbers here would be a feat in any economy , let alone in a time of unrelenting doldrums .
“ Every day , families come back for more information , ” Captain Mallak said .
“ The No. 1 question they want to know is , ‘ Did my loved one suffer ? ’
If we can say , ‘ No , it was instantaneous , he or she never knew what happened , ’ they do get a great sense of relief out of that .
But we do n’t lie . ”
Indeed , the reports are sent with cover letters urging the families not to read them alone .
The possibility that a relative burned to death is a particular source of anguish for families , and one area in which CT can outperform an autopsy .
In a body damaged by flames , CT can help pathologists figure out whether the burns occurred before or after death .
The scans can also tell whether a person found in water died from drowning .
Families who request the autopsy reports often put off reading them , said Ami Neiberger - Miller , a spokeswoman for the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors , a nonprofit group for people who have lost relatives in war .
“ I think people feel , ‘ We should request it ; we may not want to read it today , but we may want to read it 10 years from now , ’ ” Ms. Neiberger - Miller said .
Her brother was killed in Baghdad in 2007 , she said , and her family has never opened his autopsy report .
Liz Sweet , whose 23 - year - old son , T. J. , committed suicide in Iraq in 2003 , requested his autopsy report and read it .
“ For our family , we needed it , ” Mrs . Sweet said .
“ I just felt better knowing I had that report . ” T. J. Sweet ’s coffin was closed , so Mrs. Sweet asked Captain Mallak for a photograph taken before the autopsy , to prove to herself that it really was her son who had died .
“ He was one of the most compassionate people throughout this whole process that I dealt with from the Department of Defense , ” Mrs. Sweet said of Captain Mallak .
The scans and autopsies are done in a 70,000 - square - foot facility at the Dover base that is both a pathology laboratory and a mortuary .
Journalists are not allowed inside .
The CT scanning began in 2004 , when it was suggested and paid for by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency , or Darpa , part of the Defense Department .
Darpa got the idea of using CT scanners to perform virtual autopsies from Switzerland , where it started about 10 years ago .
People outside of the UK might have missed the huge scandal over MPs ' expenses — basically , it turns out that Members of Parliament have been billing the public for all kinds of crazy things , including mortgages that they 'd already paid off , maintenance on their moats ( I shit you not ) and pools , tampons ( for male MPs ) , private security details , and so on .
Most MPs have fallen over themselves to apologize for their unethical behavior .
Not Tory MP Anthony Steen .
Steen billed the taxpayer for maintenance of his 500 - tree forest , upkeep of which was apparently necessary to the conducting of his duties at Parliament .
Steen says that constituents who resent their tax money going to pay for his forest are " just jealous . "
After pondering the question of exactly why people were so angry over his claim for the treatment of 500 trees in the grounds of his house , he offered a succinct explanation today : " Jealousy " .
Expenses row : MP who claimed for 500 trees accuses constituents of ' jealousy '
Four largest TARP recipients spent billions on ' questionable transactions ' : memo Rachel Oswald
Published : Monday March 9 , 2009
Print This Email This Rather than using federal bailout money to reinvigorate lending to consumers , some banks that received funds from TARP have spent it on questionable items that have done little to improve the health of the countrys financial sector but have certainly helped out foreign economies such as Dubai and China .
For instance , Citigroup Inc , which received $ 50 billion in Troubled Asset Relief Program funds , made an $ 8 billion December loan , not to an American entity , but to a Dubai public sector company , according to a newly released Monday memo by Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) , chairman of the House Domestic Policy Subcommittee .
The Goldman Sachs Group , which received $ 10 billion in TARP funds at the end of October , saw fit to spend $ 2 billion earlier in the year on the repurchase of company stock , which resulted in an increase in company share price .
The memo notes of that stock repurchase ,  That increase would have constituted a significant benefit to top executives at Goldman Sachs , who typically own large amounts of company stock . 
As of January 3 , Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blanldein owned 1,995 , 835 shares of the company , according to the memo .
In mid- November , Bank of America spent $ 7 billion investing in the China Construction Bank Corporation .
Bank of America received $ 25 billion in TARP funds .
J.P. Morgan Treasury Services spent $ 1 billion investing in cash management and trade finacie solutions in India also in November .
J.P Morgan Chase & Co. received $ 25 billion in TARP funds .
Rep .
Kucinichs office released the memo from the Subcomittees Democratic staff ahead of Wednesdays hearing that will investigate Treasury Department attempts to prevent waste and abuse in the TARP program .
According to a press release , the hearing will be specifically looking into the Capital Purchase Program  the largest of the five TARP programs .
The House report notes that while none of these transactions were illegal , they do not stand up well to statements made before Congress by TARP recipients on their understanding Congressional and taxpayer expectations that the TARP funding will be used to reinvigorate domestic lending .
" [ A]ll of us at Bank of America understand the responsibilities that come with access to public funds , " said Ken Lewis , CEO of Bank of America , in February comments to the House Financial Services Committee .
" Taxpayers want to see how we are using this money to restart the economy and - want us to manage our expenses carefully .
These expectations are appropriate . "
According to the memo , " The transactions are not illegal : EESA was mostly silent on prohibited transactions , and the funds provided through CPP were made without conditions .
Treasury implementing regulations and tenn agreements with CPP recipients were similarly silent .
However , members of Congress might not consider them the kind of transactions they believed TARP would subsidize when they enacted EESA . "
This article has been updated because of an error in the House memo which misattributed the Goldman Sachs stock repurchase to December 16 after they had already received TARP funds .
The bank made the stock repurchases on or before March 18 , 2008 and on or before June 17 , 2008 .

North Carolina lawmakers are pushing to give Apple Inc. a multi-million dollar tax break should the company bring an East Coast computer server farm to the state – an estimated $ 1 billion investment , according to a state official with knowledge of the recruitment efforts …
While it has been known that North Carolina lawmakers were working on changing tax rules to benefit one company , the name of the outfit has been kept secret .
The state official said Catawba and Cleveland counties are potential sites …
The House Finance Committee on Thursday altered the proposed tax change so companies could qualify only if they locate in one of North Carolina ’s poorest counties , provide health insurance , meet a wage standard , and forego other state grants or tax breaks .
“ The bill ensures it ’s going to go to an area of high unemployment .
This reflects concerns many of us have had about economic development policy , that priority should be given to the neediest counties , ” said committee chairman Rep. Paul Luebke , D - Durham .
The tax breaks could be worth about $ 46 million in the next decade , assuming the company reaches its $ 1 billion investment target within nine years of starting , according to a memo by legislative fiscal staffers that does not identify the company .
The memo said no current company meets the criteria to receive the tax break and the Commerce Department knows of just one with the potential to qualify .
“ It ’s very specific to this project , ” Luebke said of the tax breaks .
The conditions adopted Thursday , if approved by both legislative chambers and the governor , would push the project from the state ’s urbanized corridor connecting Raleigh to Greensboro and Charlotte .
In 2007 , Google Inc. committed to spending $ 600 million for a server farm near Lenoir in the western North Carolina foothills .
It opened last year …
“ Given our economic situation in this state , with the rising unemployment , this really is critical , ” said Rep. Jennifer Weiss , D - Wake , before the committee approved the bill and its changes .
My , oh my .
Apple ’s existing server facilities do a truly crappy and underpowered job at handling the traffic they already have .
But , this sounds like a Google - level facility .
Whatever do they have in mind ?
UPDATE : NC state legislature debated less than a minute – and approved the package .

PLANCK SPACE TELESCOPE
Planck will need three correction manoeuvres in total Planck will survey the famous Cosmic Microwave Background
This ancient light 's origins date to 380,000 years after the Big Bang
It informs scientists about the age , shape and evolution of the cosmos Planck 's measurements will be finer than any previous satellite
Planck prepares to go super - cold
It must feel a little like the attendant outside a hotel who is given the keys to a supercar and is asked to go and park it .
The excitement is almost overwhelming but so too is the fear of scratching the gleaming mega-motor .
The mission controllers who will oversee the delivery of Europe 's Herschel and Planck telescopes to their science observation positions in space are very conscious of the responsibility that rests with them .
The combined value of these two European Space Agency ( Esa ) programmes is 1.9bn euros ( £ 1.7bn ; $ 2.5 bn ) .
More than that , the effort put into the missions by some scientists and engineers stretches back over 20 years .
Satellites do not have wing mirrors , but if they did well , you get the picture .
" It 's not a bad analogy ; these are very complex and very expensive pieces of equipment , " says Chris Watson , the spacecraft operations manager ( SOM ) whose team is responsible for Planck .
" You 're very aware that there are a lot of scientists out there who are waiting on what we do , " concurs Micha Schmidt , the Herschel SOM .
The telescopes will be hurled into space atop an Ariane 5 launcher from the Kourou spaceport in French Guiana on Thursday .
The powered portion of the flight lasts about 26 minutes , before the observatories are ejected from the upper - stage of the rocket .
Herschel is first out ;
Planck follows shortly after .
It will be about 10 minutes before they are picked up by the ground station and contact is established .
It is at that moment that the " keys " are passed to the European Space Operations Centre ( ESOC ) in Darmstadt , Germany , and the big parking job begins .
Herschel and Planck take many weeks to get to their observation stations Gravity conditions at L2 allow for cheap ( in fuel terms ) orbital corrections Environmental conditions ( heat & radiation ) are more stable than at Earth L2 takes its name from its discoverer , Joseph - Louis Lagrange ( 1736 - 1813 )
" The spacecraft become active at separation and it's a pre-programmed list of commands that is run through , " explains Mr Schmidt , who says Herschel should already have begun to orientate itself and started to activate sub-systems by the time the ground link is made .
" The first thing we send to the spacecraft is a test command .
It 's a connection test ; it does n't do anything apart from verify that we can command it . "
The early days of the mission , known as LEOP ( Launch and Early Operations Phase ) , are spent in a dedicated room at ESOC .
It is there that controllers will tick off a long list of health - checks as the satellites cruise away from Earth .
The destination for both telescopes is a remarkable position in space known as the second Lagrangian point ( L2 ) .
It is one of five gravitational " sweet - spots " around the Sun- Earth system where satellites can maintain station by making relatively few orbital corrections .
HERSCHEL SPACE TELESCOPE
The Herschel concept has been in development for over 20 years
The observatory is tuned to see the Universe in the far - infrared Its 3.5 m diameter mirror will be the largest ever flown in space Herschel can probe clouds of gas and dust to see stars being born
It will investigate how galaxies have evolved through time
Telescope seeks cold cosmos L2 is some 1.5 million km from Earth on its " night side " .
The observatories will circle this point , keeping the Earth and our star in a near - straight line .
Currently , only one spacecraft inhabits L2 : the US space agency 's WMAP probe ( which is making observations on which Planck hopes to build ) .
In the years ahead , however , many more astronomical spacecraft will choose to sit at this location because of the very stable conditions it enjoys .
It does not experience , for example , the big swings in temperature and light endured by space telescopes positioned much closer to Earth .
That is very important for Herschel and Planck which will both be investigating aspects of the " cold Universe " .
" You can maintain a good geometry - the Earth and Sun are always in the same direction , " says Martin Hechler who has helped to design the mission path out to L2 .
" This is a very nice way of shielding .
In previous missions in Earth orbit , you lost a lot of the mission time because you could not observe when the Earth itself was shining in the telescope .
" At L2 , you look out [ into space ] , and as you move around the Sun , you see 360 degrees in the galactic frame ; so you can look in all directions in one year . "
Dr Hechler and his mission analysis group are breaking new ground for Esa .
The agency has never sent a spacecraft to L2 before and the knowledge gained will be invaluable for future missions .
But it is not simply a case of pointing a rocket and sitting back .
As good as Ariane is , a series of orbital corrections will be required to nudge Herschel and Planck into precisely the right paths to take up their parking positions .
Both spacecraft will fire their thrusters on Day 2 of the mission .
Herschel will have another correction , probably around day four .
Planck will need three manoeuvres in total to put it in a much tighter " hover " about L2 .
" The first correction for our transfer is a very important milestone in our mission , " says Chris Watson .
" The longer it takes you to make it , the more fuel it costs .
So if you can correct any errors very early , it is relatively cheap in terms of fuel . "
Herschel sits on top of Planck for the ride into orbit , and is first out Planck needs to spin for its mission ; Ariane will start up that motion
The telescopes need to make path corrections to get out to L2 The graphic shows their pattern on the sky at L2 as viewed from Earth Planck 's design requires an Earth aspect of less than 15 degrees
Good economy will pay dividends later in the mission when fuel is needed to make the regular small tweaks in the telescopes ' parking slots .
" L2 is unstable and we 'll need to use our thrusters once a month , " says Mr Watson .
" It 's like trying to balance a pen or a stick on your hand - if you can do it precisely enough , you spend very little fuel because you are making tiny corrections . "
Schmidt ( near ) and Watson ( far ) work through yet another simulation Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Of course , this all assumes a trouble - free passage .
Problems could arise at any moment ; and the teams have had to practise for all kinds of eventualities .
In one simulation exercise last month , the Herschel team had to cope with a spacecraft that had a computer failure immediately after being released from the Ariane .
The controllers worked through the issue and recovered the situation only to discover that Herschel was then being bombarded by meteoroids .
Again , Micha Schmidt and his team had to move swiftly to regain full command of the satellite .
" You said it was like someone saying : ' Here 're the keys to a Ferrari , do n't scratch it ' .
Well in the simulation , that is precisely what we do .
In real life , we hope these things wo n't happen ; but if they do , we are very well prepared for them . "
It will take a little over six weeks to get both telescopes into their final science orbits .
The super - satellites can then be handed over to the world 's researchers with the wing mirrors still attached .

A recent article in MedScape Medical News says that “ Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) patients with adult respiratory - distress syndrome ( ARDS ) and other forms of acute lung injury ( ALI ) may need sedation to endure the stress of mechanical ventilation , but the benzodiazepine doses often used in this situation may be setting patients up for clinical depression after discharge .
In a study published in the May issue of Critical Care Medicine , David W. Dowdy , MD , PhD , and colleagues , from the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , in Baltimore , Maryland , identified several factors associated with symptoms of depression 6 months after ICU admission for ALI .
These included … high benzodiazepine doses … ”
Benzodiazepines are a class of psychiatric anti-anxiety drugs also called minor tranquilizers or sedative hypnotics .
Some of the various brand names are Valium , Xanax , Klonopin , Librium , and Rohypnol .
Daily use of therapeutic doses of benzodiazepines is associated with physical dependence .
Addiction can occur after 14 days of regular use .
The withdrawal syndrome is similar to that of alcohol withdrawal , but can be more prolonged and more difficult than withdrawal from heroin .
Typical consequences of withdrawal are depression , anxiety , sweating , cramps , nausea , psychotic reactions and seizures .
Some of the side effects of taking these drugs include depression , aggressive behavior , anxiety , psychosis , and suicide .
Drug experts say that the benzodiazepine Xanax , for example , is more addictive than most illegal drugs , including cocaine or heroin .
More information about the side effects of psychiatric drugs can be found by clicking here .
[ Editorial Comment :
One wonders why a psychiatric drug with such already known severe side effects and withdrawal symptoms is used at all in an intensive care unit after a severe illness . ]

Hardware was surprisingly thin .
There 's what appears to be a solitary hard button below the screen .
Interface was basically the same Zune UI with touch navigation , but very colorful and pretty snappy .
The OLED screen looked great .
We 'll obviously be badgering Microsoft in the coming months for a longer , closer look at the device , but at least it 's not just a render anymore .
That 's right kids -- Ballmer himself whipped out the newly minted Zune HD for us during D7 and showed off a few of its finer features ... including its ability to play a Pixar movie on its gorgeous OLED screen .

He used the new tool carefully , never failing to pay off his balance when he bought a TV or a dinner out .
“ I have never paid any interest , ” said the 78 - year - old retired teacher and salesman .
“ I clear the account every month , and I do n’t run up a big bill . ”
If the industry -- and its customers -- maintained the prudence of Hockett ’s Depression - era upbringing , the new credit card law signed Friday by President Obama might never have been necessary .

Instead , most people probably have more in common with Barbara and Albert Sanchez , who got their cards decades later , on the other side of Fresno from Hockett and a world away from mid-century attitudes about debt .
The Sanchezes entered a far less regulated credit card system in which Americans faced constant entreaties to take advantage of easy credit .
They say the tantalizing opportunities almost led to their financial ruin .
The middle - aged Fresno couple racked up $ 20,000 on their cards , which helped them maintain their lifestyle after Albert ’s overtime at the lumber yard dwindled and Barbara ’s housekeeping clients scaled back .
They finally sought help from a credit counselor .
“ I figured I could deal with it myself , but then I could n’t do it , ” said Barbara Sanchez , 52 .
“ I do n’t want to lose my house . ”

In 1958 , the Sanchezes might not have qualified for the BankAmericard -- and certainly would n’t have been able to rack up tens of thousands in debt .
Back then , average customers had a credit limit of $ 300 ; “ preferred ” BofA clients were entitled to carry $ 500 .
Although the new measures set to go into effect early next year wo n’t roll back Americans ’ attitudes toward plastic payment , the latest credit card reform bill seeks to address what consumer advocates have called the most egregious practices .
But even those , some credit card watchers say , are n’t enough .
Among other provisions , the new rules will require credit card companies to give more notice before changing clients ’ terms such as interest rates , and the issuers wo n’t be allowed to apply those rates retroactively to existing balances unless the cardholder ’s minimum payment is 60 days overdue .
Issuers wo n’t be allowed to charge interest on bills consumers pay on time , extract extra fees for paying by phone or bank transfer , or issue cards to people under 21 without proof of income or a parent ’s signature .
And issuers must apply any payment over the minimum to the balance with the highest interest rate .

Banks also wo n’t be allowed to accept charges that put consumers over their limits .
The American Bankers ’ Assn. says that the new regulations fundamentally will change what credit cards are and who will be able to use them .
“ It means that there will be less credit available , ” said Edward L. Yingling , the trade group ’s president .
“ That means some people will not be able to get a credit card who got it in the past , and those who get the credit card , in some instances , will have a smaller line of credit . ”
“ We ’re turning back the clock to the credit card of the 1960s , ” he added .
“ Everybody paid $ 25 a year and was charged 18 % and it was a very straightforward card , but a lot of people could n’t qualify , the lines of credit were smaller and those who handled credit well subsidized those with credit issues . ”

Consumer groups , however , say the rules will temper some of the practices that trapped people such as Charles Clark , a 26 - year - old medical student from a poor neighborhood on the South Side of Chicago .
Clark did n’t have any experience with credit cards when he got his first piece of plastic , lured by a promotion that gave him an expensive anatomy book for free .
He figured that he was building up his credit as he juggled his finances by charging gas , lab equipment and books while attending Nashville ’s Meharry Medical College .
Bank of America , which issued his MasterCard , raised his limit about every three months -- proof , he thought , that his strategy was working .
“ I thought that as long as I made my payment and never was late , I ’d be OK , ” Clark said .
Advertisement
But although he was always on time with at least a minimum payment and made sure to stay under his credit limit , Clark soon found himself crossways with the credit card issuer .
“ In the old industrial economy , the best client was one who could pay off debts , ” said Robert D. Manning , director of a consumer financial center at the Rochester Institute of Technology .
“ In the post - industrial economy , the best customer is the person who ca n’t pay it off . ”
Clark was a gem .
His credit limit was $ 8,000 , and his debt nearly as high .
Then one day , he found that Bank of America had jacked up his interest rate to 15.99 % from 7.99 % .
Advertisement
With a phone call to the bank , he learned that the higher rate was triggered when his balance hit about $ 7,700 .
Clark protested ; he was still under his limit and always paid on time .
No matter .
The bank said it had sent him a letter warning of the rate change , Clark said .
He says he never received it .
Clark ’s minimum payment was about $ 90 before the rate hike .
Afterward , it shot up to about $ 200 .
Late fees and over - the - credit - limit fees -- at $ 39 a pop -- added to his burden .
Within a few months , his minimum payment was $ 688 and his rate kicked up again , to 24.99 % .
He missed the next month ’s payment while waiting for his next student loan check .
His minimum payment for the month after that , including late - payment and other fees , soared to $ 990 .
Clark got out of his mess by getting a friend to co-sign a personal loan .
He used that to pay off the credit card , which he now reserves for emergencies .
Advertisement
“ I would have been OK if they had n’t changed my rate , ” Clark said .
“ But they put extra weight on and say : Now lift this .
It becomes unbearable . ”
Bank of America declined to comment on Clark ’s case , saying customer privacy concerns prohibit discussion of individual accounts .
But a spokeswoman added that in 2007 , when Clark first got into trouble , nearly 94 % of its customers had the same or lower rate at the end of the year compared with their rate at the beginning .
The industry , meanwhile , says that tighter rules mean tighter credit -- less charging power for those with blemished records and higher interest rates for almost everyone else .
Advertisement
“ The one thing we all agree on is disclosures and making sure the customer understands what the pricing is and making it simpler , ” said Richard Struthers , the head of BofA ’s global card services .
But to judge from today ’s promotional materials , the last thing credit card companies want is for consumers to understand what they ’re getting into , said Patricia McCoy , who teaches consumer finance law at the University of Connecticut Law School .
“ The lending industry has accomplished disclosures that satisfy the law and totally obfuscate what people need to know , ” she said .
“ The disclosures are an utter failure -- at least in the consumer ’s eye and this law professor ’s eye . ”
The new rules also hope to offer some additional clarity , although consumer advocates say this effort , as well , does n’t go far enough .

For many people , credit card catastrophes have become the more democratic cousin of the mortgage meltdown ; with no house needed , people like Clark got in over their heads .
“ The problem is n’t individual practices .
It ’s a structural problem with credit cards , ” said Adam J. Levitin , an associate professor at the Georgetown University Law Center and an expert in bankruptcy and the credit card industry .
“ It ’s impossible to know in advance what it will cost to carry a balance on a credit card . ”
And , Levitin added , the new legislation does little to change that .
Indeed , banks still will be allowed a host of practices that are anti-consumer and just plain unfair , Manning said .
These practices include :
Advertisement
* No caps on interest rates or on fees for transfers , late payments or going over a spending limit .
* No way to ensure on - time payment .
New rules mandate that payments be due at least 21 days after a statement is mailed , but Manning said it would be more fair to adopt a postmark standard , whereby payments are deemed on time if mailed by the date specified .
* No curb on credit line reductions or capricious closing of accounts .
* No mandate against what consumer advocates call “ behavioral profiling , ” Manning said .
Start shopping at Wal - Mart after years of buying at department stores ?
Charge a large quantity of alcohol -- just for a friend ’s party ?
Take out a subprime mortgage ?
To some banks , those have been signs that a customer ’s finances are hitting the rocks , Manning said -- and reason enough to reduce the customer ’s line of credit .
Advertisement
And those are just some of the shortcomings of the new measures , reform advocates said .
“ This legislation deals with today ’s problems , not tomorrow ’s , and it does n’t set up a framework for dealing with tomorrow ’s problems , ” Levitin said .
Research conducted by a team including Elizabeth Warren , a Harvard Law School professor and consumer debt expert , suggests that people who fall into serious debt tend to do so because of a harsh roll of the dice -- job loss , illness , divorce -- and not profligate spending .
“ This is not that people go out each month and buy too many iPods or other crazy things , ” said Warren , whose 2001 study was based on an analysis of bankruptcy filings .
“ It ’s that they spent so much of their salary on the basics -- mortgage , child care , college tuition , health insurance , whatever -- that month after month they end up short on day - to - day living .
They ca n’t do it anymore . ”

In Fresno , the Sanchezes say they first ran up their credit card debt making repairs and necessary improvements on their 1,200 - square - foot home .
Paying off that debt seemed reasonable given the couple ’s good jobs and capacity for hard work .
But once the economy soured , the Sanchezes both faced a reduction in their hours .
They ’ve entered a credit counseling program with ByDesign Financial Solutions , which set up a payment plan with their creditors and negotiated a lower interest rate until their bills are settled .
When that day comes , Albert Sanchez expects to start charging things again .
Advertisement
“ You have to have one card or you ca n’t get anything , ” he said .
“ The counselor told us that once we pay it all off , the companies will send us another card automatically . ”

MOSCOW 
As energy markets shrink , the same tactics that the Kremlin used to build Gazprom , the giant energy company , into a fearsome economic and political power that could restore Russian influence in the world are now backfiring , slashing both its profits and its influence .
Throughout his eight years as president of Russia , Vladimir V. Putin pursued the strategic goal of dominating natural gas supplies to Europe and the pipelines that deliver them .
His success was underscored in January , when for the second time in three years a pricing dispute with Ukraine disrupted the flow of natural gas , leaving hundreds of thousands in Eastern Europe shivering in the deep winter cold .
But in his zeal to monopolize gas supplies , Mr. Putin , who is now Russia ’s prime minister , committed Gazprom to long - term contracts with Central Asian countries for gas at a cost far in excess of current world prices .
Now that the world economic crisis has sharply curtailed demand for gas , Gazprom is saddled with a glut of expensive Central Asian supplies that it is forced to sell at a loss .
In a painful twist , the company also finds itself forced to close its own wells in Russia , which produce gas for a fraction of the cost of that from Central Asia , in order to balance its supplies with declining world demand .
In effect , a strategy that made business and political sense in a time of high and seemingly ever rising prices is threatening to create years of losses and declining influence , if energy prices fail to rebound .

NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- Bernard Madoff , who pleaded guilty to operating a multibillion - dollar Ponzi scheme , is worth up to $ 826 million , according to a document filed with a federal court on Friday .
Bernard Madoff arrives at a federal courthouse Thursday .
He pleaded guilty to conducting a Ponzi scheme .
Madoff values his business -- Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities , which is currently being liquidated -- at $ 700 million , said the document , which estimated his wealth totals at least $ 823 million .
Real estate from around the world worth $ 22 million is listed , including a New York City apartment valued at $ 7 million and a home in Palm Beach , Florida , worth $ 11 million , another in Montauk , New York , worth $ 3 million and one in Cap d'Antibe , France , worth $ 1 million .
All of the residences except for the Montauk home are listed as being bought by his wife , Ruth Madoff .
Listings of other nonbusiness assets paint a luxurious picture of Madoff 's life : a 50 percent stake in a charter aircraft worth $ 12 million , a $ 7 million yacht in France , and more than $ 2 million in jewelry .
The latter two , along with approximately $ 17 million in cash and three cars -- a 1999 and 2001 Mercedes and 2004 Volkswagen -- are listed under Ruth Madoff 's name .
The document was posted Saturday on the Web site of the Wall Street Journal .
Madoff was ordered to jail Thursday after pleading guilty to all 11 criminal counts in one of Wall Street 's biggest swindles ever .
The Ponzi scheme is estimated to have bilked thousands of investors out of billions of dollars .
The document was included in a filing Friday in connection with an appeal to have Madoff freed from jail until his sentencing , which is set for June 16 .
Madoff faces up to 150 years in prison .
All About Bernard Madoff • Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC
" The SEC was never capable of catching Mr. Madoff .
He could have gone to $ 100 billion " without being discovered , Markopolos testified .
" It took me about five minutes to figure out he was a fraud . "
Madoff , who was at one point chairman of the Nasdaq Stock Market and sat on SEC advisory committees , was " one of the most powerful men on Wall Street and in a position to easily end our careers or worse , " Markopolos said .
If you 're like most Americans , you probably think that organizations like the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) are there to protect the common man from white collar criminals on Wall Street .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
The reality is that the SEC is an agency dedicated to protecting the criminals from the gimpy arm of justice .
The Madoff scandal is a perfect example .
His Ponzi scheme was operating right out in the open and anybody with enough financial sophistication to work on Wall Street would 've been able to figure out the fraud if they had bothered to add up the numbers .
Markopolos had been warning about Madoff 's scam since 2000 .
Nobody listened .
He sent his detailed warnings with his reasonings attached and written in such a way I , a financial neophyte , could understand the brazenness of the fraud .
It should have been obvious to any SEC fraud investigator within a matter of minutes .
Here 's why they did n't pursue the matter :
The SEC would have been investigating one of their own , and that 's just not gonna happen ; then or now .
That would be like Cheney investigating Bush or vice versa .
Ain't gonna happen .
You see , Washington D.C. is kind of like OppositeLand : Everything is the opposite of the way it should be .
Our biggest criminals are not just coddled , they are given the keys to the kingdom .
When our banks screw up they are given billions for free , but when you are deep in debt you can bet on the credit card industry bribing Congress into passing tougher bankruptcy laws
If you 're able to wrap your head around the absurdity of the situation you might not be that surprised to find that the CIA is funding terrorism , the FBI is protecting criminals and the DEA is protecting drug smugglers .
That 's the way things work in OppositeLand .
Bill Clinton gets impeached for a blowjob and Bush did n't even get censured for pissing all over the Constitution and starting two illegal wars in which over a million people died .
Welcome to OppositeLand , where if you fuck up , you move up .
If you have ethics and morals , you can expect to be a social leper or maybe even have your ass killed for your troubles .

The Unsung Successes of the Market
Tweet
It 's become an article of faith among lots of people that recent events prove ( or at least suggest ) that markets do n't work very well .
Let 's assume — contrary to what my assessment of the evidence tells me — that the housing bubble and its crash , along with the current ills suffered by Detroit and other sectors , are exclusively the fault of the market .
How much skepticism of markets would this fact generate relative to the amount of skepticism that is justified ?
I think way too much .
The reason is that market successes go unnoticed and , hence , unappreciated .
The vast majority of market exchanges and relationships work smoothly and to the advantage of all participants .
Indeed , the market works so well and so consistently that it creates ever - higher expectations among the broad populace .
When these expectations are dashed , if only for a handful of persons and if only rarely , the market is deemed to have failed .
But despite the current downturn , the market continues to work well in its typical silence .
Do you have trouble today finding gasoline to buy ?
Are your local supermarket 's shelves not stocked with food , wine , and ( watch for it soon ! )
Easter candy ?
If your cat eats your socks , will you have trouble buying several new pair ?
If your car 's battery dies this afternoon , must you resort to bicycling or public transportation because you can't replace your dead battery ?
If you 're bored this evening with nothing to do , is there no movie you can go to or no DVD you can rent ?
If you miss your mom in Minneapolis or your boyfriend in Boston , can you not call them on your cell - phone — or even buy a plane ticket and go visit them ?
Two items arrived in my e-mailbox this morning to drive home the remarkable success of markets .
The first is this excellent short essay by Bob Higgs .
The second is this hilarious , short dialog between the comedian Louis C.K. and Conan O'Brien .
( Note that O'Brien mistakenly believes that our modern standard of living is caused principally by technology . )

Jewish Canadians Concerned About Suppression of Criticism of Israel
Related Topics in the Sources Directory
of Experts and Spokespersons :
Related Resources :
More than 170 Jewish Canadians have signed a statement expressing their concerns about the campaign to suppress criticism of Israel that is being carried on within Canada .
The signatories include many prominent Canadians , including Ursula Franklin O.C. , Anton Kuerti O.C. , Naomi Klein , Dr. Gabor Mate , and professors Meyer Brownstone ( recipient of Pearson Peace Medal ) , Natalie Zemon Davis ( former president of the American Historical Association ) , and Judy Rebick .
The signatories are particularly concerned that unfounded accusations of anti-Semitism deflect attention from Israel 's accountability for what many have called war crimes in Gaza .
They state that B'nai Brith and the Canadian Jewish Congress have led campaigns to silence criticism of Israel on university campuses , in labour unions and in other groups .
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney and Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff unquestioningly echo the views of these particular Jewish organizations .
The signatories strongly state that they are against all expressions of racism .
While firmly committed to resisting any form of prejudice against Jewish people , their statement explicitly states that these spurious allegations of anti-Semitism bring the anti-Communist terror of the 1950s vividly to mind .
The statement underlines the immeasurable suffering and injustice to the Palestinian people due to the severe poverty , daily humiliations , and military invasions inflicted by the State of Israel .
We are Jewish Canadians concerned about all expressions of racism , anti-Semitism , and social injustice .
We believe that the Holocaust legacy " Never again " means never again for all peoples .
It is a tragic turn of history that the State of Israel , with its ideals of democracy and its dream of being a safe haven for Jewish people , causes immeasurable suffering and injustice to the Palestinian people .
We are appalled by recent attempts of prominent Jewish organizations and leading Canadian politicians to silence protest against the State of Israel .
We are alarmed by the escalation of fear tactics .
Charges that those organizing Israel Apartheid Week or supporting an academic boycott of Israel are anti-Semites promoting hatred bring the anti-Communist terror of the 1950s vividly to mind .
We believe this serves to deflect attention from Israel 's flagrant violations of international humanitarian law .
B'nai Brith and the Canadian Jewish Congress have pressured university presidents and administrations to silence debate and discussion specifically regarding Palestine / Israel .
In a full - page ad in a national newspaper , B'nai Brith urged donors to withhold funds from universities because " anti-Semitic hate fests " were being allowed on campuses .
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney and Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff have echoed these arguments .
While university administrators have resisted demands to shut down Israel Apartheid week , some Ontario university presidents have bowed to this disinformation campaign by suspending and fining students , confiscating posters , and infringing on free speech .
We do not believe that Israel acts in self - defense .
Israel is the largest recipient of US foreign aid , receiving $ 3 million / day .
It has the fourth strongest army in the world .
Before the invasion of Gaza on 27 December 2008 , Israel 's siege had already created a humanitarian catastrophe there , with severe impoverishment , malnutrition , and destroyed infrastructure .
It is crucial that forums for discussion of Israel 's accountability to the international community for what many have called war crimes be allowed to proceed unrestricted by specious claims of anti-Semitism .
We recognize that anti-Semitism is a reality in Canada as elsewhere , and we are fully committed to resisting any act of hatred against Jews .
At the same time , we condemn false charges of anti-Semitism against student organizations , unions , and other groups and people exercising their democratic right to freedom of speech and association regarding legitimate criticism of the State of Israel .

SAN JOSE , Calif . --
After two sleepless nights , Ryane Clowe is thinking about how to fill several weeks of free time he neither wants nor needs .
It 's a problem facing most of the San Jose Sharks , whose embarrassing first - round exit from the playoffs has cleared their schedules -- and sent general manager Doug Wilson into a fury that might last all summer .
" We figured we 'd make a run into June and then see what happens , " said Clowe , who scored one goal in six playoff games .
" And then all of a sudden , you 've got a month here when you do n't know what to do . "
Wilson has plenty to do , but he 's trying to wait until he calms down before he decides where to start .
The Sharks ' six - game loss to eighth - seeded Anaheim flattened every good feeling from San Jose 's franchise - record 117 - point regular season , which included 53 wins and the first Presidents '
Trophy in team history .
" The frustration is overwhelming , " Wilson said .
" We owe an apology to our fans and our ownership .
...
Everything will be evaluated .
There 's nothing that 's off the table .
This is going to be a tough , painful summer , and it should be . "
Wilson realizes he must consider demolishing a team he thought was built to win the Stanley Cup .
Instead , it fell apart in the early rounds , just as it's done in four straight seasons -- and the problems appear to be too big to solve with minor tweaks or the additions of several championship - winning veterans .
" I would have bet everything I had that this would n't happen to us , " said Jeremy Roenick , who will wait a few weeks before deciding whether to end his 20 - season NHL career .
Wilson thought hiring Detroit assistant Todd McLellan as his new head coach and adding veterans Dan Boyle , Rob Blake , Brad Lukowich and Claude Lemieux would change the Sharks ' postseason attitude .
Instead , San Jose lost its first two playoff games at home , turned in a miserable effort in the pivotal Game 4 , and got emphatically closed out by the veteran , postseason - tested Ducks on Monday night .
In his upstairs office Wednesday at the Sharks ' training complex , Wilson could barely contain his anger while his players cleared out their lockers .
He made few specific predictions about the Sharks ' future , saying he needed time to evaluate what went wrong -- " to conduct the autopsy , " he said grimly -- before deciding who will be traded , released or simply browbeaten into improvement .
" Every one of us should be uncomfortable , " Wilson said .
" There comes a time when this group needs to grow up and deal with what 's in front of them . "
He did make one immediate decision , saying McLellan 's job is completely safe after his promising rookie campaign imploded in six games .

Tortured Logic , Tortured Results Editor ’s Note : Much of the U.S. mainstream media continues to insist that there must be a debate about the efficacy of torture , whether – as distasteful as it is – torture saved American lives .
The evidence , however , is to the contrary , now clear that torture did what it has always done , extracted false confessions , in this case the “ proof ” that George W. Bush wanted to justify invading Iraq , as historian William Loren Katz notes in this guest essay :
Each day the evidence piles up - highlighted by the unconvincing ( and self - incriminating ) rants of Dick Cheney .
Email
Printer friendly Lawrence Wilkerson , former chief of staff to Secretary of State Colin Powell , said , " the administration authorized harsh interrogation in April and May of 2002 -- well before the Justice Department had rendered any legal opinion -- its principal priority for intelligence was not aimed at pre-empting another terrorist attack on the U.S. but discovering a smoking gun linking Iraq and al - Qa'ida . "
[ Washington Note , May 13 , 2009 ] Journalist Paul Krugman said of the mounting evidence : " Let 's say this slowly : the Bush administration wanted to use 9/11 as a pretext to invade Iraq , even though Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11 .
So it tortured people to make them confess to the nonexistent link .
" There 's a word for this : it 's evil . "
[ Paul Krugman Blog , April 22 , 2009 ]
Is there something more painful for Americans than hearing that illegal CIA methods caused the deaths of dozens upon dozens of detainees , inflicted pain on hundreds of others , and that this brutality that had nothing to do with national security ?
Yes -- learning it was done to validate one of the leading lies that sent us to war .
First British Intelligence 's “ Downing Street Memo ” to Prime Minister Tony Blair revealed , “ the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the [ Bush ] policy . ”
Now Sen. Carl Levin 's 263 - page Armed Services Committee report ( approved by pro-Iraq War Sens. John McCain , Lindsey Graham and Joe Lieberman ) fills in more blanks .
Levin says our top political officials were “ driven ” to install this torture program .
“ They 'd say it was to get more information .
But they were desperate to find a link between Al Qaeda and Iraq , ” Levin told columnist Frank Rich .
[ New York Times , April 26 , 2009 ]
Sure , al - Qaeda glorifies martyrdom and plays by no known rules .
But our authorizing torture and accepting its lies is about us .
It is about Americans who went along with “ kick some ass , ” “ bring 'em on , ” and “ enhanced interrogation techniques . ”
Under orders from top officials our CIA water boarded one man 183 times and another 83 [ hardly proof that it works ! ] .
It sent mentally ill Ibn al - Sheikh al - Libi to a foreign prison where he was tortured and locked in a small box for 17 hours until he expanded on his earlier coerced claims of a link between Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden .
By 2004 , al - Libi had recanted his statement and the CIA had acknowledged that it was false .
But not before Secretary of State Colin Powell in February 2003 used his words -- “ a senior terrorist operative ” divulged “ how Iraq provided training in these [ chemical and biological ] weapons to al - Qaeda ” -- to justify the Iraq invasion to the UN Security Council and the world .
The recently released “ torture memos ” providing legal cover for " harsh interrogations " were written during al - Libi ’s his ordeal .
[ This month , Libi died suddenly in his Libyan prison " an apparent suicide . ” ]
First , we have to admit that torture worked ( albeit not in the way that Dick Cheney asserts ) .
It produced a narrative used to frighten Americans and justify a war of aggression that President Bush wanted to wage .
It also worked in other ways .
It recruited untold numbers into the ranks of al - Qaeda , made a mockery of U.S. claims to moral leadership , and now places U.S. soldiers and civilians in danger .
The program's “ bad apples ” were not the few U.S. jailers who have served prison time for the Abu Ghraib abuses , but our top leaders .
They ’re the ones who discussed , issued or signed off on illegal orders and ignored dissenting lawyers .
Waterboarding is torture , a crime that violates international and U.S. laws .
Crimes are more than mistakes .
Americans who violate traffic laws face the wheels of justice .
What about those who violate human rights ?

If you 've read my past several articles , the name King Banaian probably sounds vaguely familiar ; if you have n't , prepare to be enlightened .
I 'll try and let the court documents do the talking , but I 'll have to fill in some of the blanks .
Before any analysis occurs , I better provide some background on Professor King Banaian .
Prof. Banaian is an economics professor at St. Cloud State University in Minnesota .
He is also a contributor to the very conservative SCSU Scholars and co-hosted a radio show with Michael Brodkorb of MinnesotaDemocratsExposed.com .
King Banaian is not an unbiased observer , he is a Republican .
The saga all began on January 20th , as described within King Banaian 's deposition ; the document is dated January 27th , but was filed with the court on January 29th :
EXAMINATION
BY MR .
BURMAN : Q. Professor Banaian , my name is Dave Burman .
I 'm one of the lawyers for Al Franken , the contestee in the election contest that 's going on .
... Q. You are a social scientist , are n't you ?
A . That 's correct .
... Q. Who was it that gave you your assignment on the 20th , or whenever in advance of the 20th you got it ?
A . The attorneys from the Coleman campaign had contacted me , in particular , Mr. Trimble .
Q. And when did Mr. Trimble first contact you ?
A. I would say noon on the 20th .
... Q. And it came with an e-mail from Mr. Trimble ?
A . Yes , that 's correct .

The Coleman campaign sent Prof. Banaian a series of spreadsheets containing county level data pertaining to rejected absentee ballots on January 20th ; he later stated that he verified some of the data using a spreadsheet posted on the Minnesota Secretary of State 's website .
The exact contents of the SOS provided spreadsheet remain unclear , but there does not appear to be a publicly available rejected absentee ballots table .
I have however placed an inquiry with the Secretary of State 's office regarding the context of Prof. Banaian 's testimony .
Despite Prof.
Banaian's own classification as a social scientist , he also testified to his qualifications as a statistical analyst :
Q . Do you consider yourself an expert in statistical analysis ?
A. I consider myself a practitioner of statistical analysis .
Expert , I believe -- I have difficulty with that word .
Q. Why is that ?
A. I have - I have taken several courses in statistics .
There are , obviously , people who have degrees in statistics , Ph.D.s even in statistics .
It 's fair to say that they will call themselves experts .
I -- I call myself a long - time practitioner of -- of statistical analysis .
I provide data analysis for the St. Cloud community , and I teach data analysis to my students .
Q. As I understand it , as long as I picked the right test of those offered by Excel , even somebody as unschooled as myself could have , basically , replicated what you 've done in Exhibit 2 ?
A . If you picked the right test .
Q. And the binomial approach is about the most basic of statistical tests , is it not ?
A . Am I being asked my opinion ?
Q. Yes .
A . In my opinion , most people by default go to the normal distribution .
The bell curve is the most well - known distribution in statistics .
Source : Affidavit of Richard D Snyder Regarding Motion in Limine via MNCourts.gov [ PDF ]
Prof .
Banaian stated that he used a binomial distribution to determine potential anomalies in rejection rates ; he also experimented with a Poisson distribution and a Chi-Square test .
Prof. Banaian also asserted that each of these regression techniques " require homogeneity of variance ; " he did not consider the " socioeconomic qualitative characteristics of people who fill out absentee ballots . "
In turn , his analysis is based entirely upon the deviations present within the given distribution .
Q . Then there 's a column that says -- and I can't tell whether the heading reject too many is just for one column or two .
Do you know offhand ?
A . It is for two .
Q . So the yes , yes for Aitkin County means that Aitkin rejected too many compared to what you expected in a random distribution ?
A . Yes , that 's correct .
Q. And is the first column based on the 5 percent calculation and the second on the 1 percent ?
A. Yes , that 's correct .
Source : Affidavit of Richard D Snyder Regarding Motion in Limine via MNCourts.gov [ PDF ]
Based upon my own calculations , Aitkin 's rejection rate places 4th among the 132 regions responsible for collecting , categorizing and counting absentee ballots ; Hennepin County passes this responsibility onto each municipality .
My table uses rejected absentee ballot data provided by each campaign within a multitude of Court filings .
The Coleman campaign has identified 4,458 absentee ballots and their associated voters by name , while Franken has listed 792 .
The exact data available to Prof.
Banaian remains unknown ; some of it was provided by the Coleman campaign , and some of it was obtained through the MN Secretary of State 's website .
The rejection pattern of Aitkin County seem to be irregular , but this irregularity may or may not be relevant .
If you take any set of data and apply any distribution model , you will get outliers ; the purpose of a distribution function is to identify a certain number of mathematically significant outliers , not logically significant .
The existence of outliers , in and of itself , is completely meaningless without an analysis of their context .
Prof. Banaian would later offer a potential explanation for the outliers he identified :
Q . So at least using this data there were between 15 and 23 counties where there seemed to be differences that could n't be explained by random variation ?
A . That 's correct .
Q. But we do n't know what caused those ?
A . Yes , that 's correct .
Q. Might be that they had a disproportionate number of people who were blind or did n't see very well and did n't sign in the right place ?
MR .
RALPH : Objection , form .
BY MR .
BURMAN : Q . That 's a possible explanation for those counties ?
A . It 's possible , yes .
Q. And nothing that you 've done tells us whether or not the excess rejections were contrary to law or incorrect in any way ?
A. No. Source : Affidavit of Richard D Snyder Regarding Motion in Limine via MNCourts.gov [ PDF ]
Prof .
Banaian essentially stated that he was unable to explain any correlation between the random variations he identified and any procedural or demographic information inherent to any of the counties he analyzed .
It is very difficult to find context for comparison because applicable historic data is scarce .
There is however some county level data available from the 2004 Washington State Gubernatorial statewide recount ; King County , containing Seattle appears to have an improper re-rejection rate of about 66 % , but King County is not representative of all counties in Washington , and certainly not Minnesota .
The Franken campaign took issue with Prof. Banaian 's analysis by filing a motion on January 29th to suppress any potential testimony :
MOTION In Contestants ' opening statement , they announced that they would not be calling a social scientist to testify to alleged statistical differences between counties .
Now they have changed their mind and wish to call Prof.
King Banaian , an economics professor and political commentator .
They were right before , and wrong now .
Contestee moves to exclude the testimony of Prof. Banaian .
... Prof Banaian should be excluded for a number of reasons .
First is timeliness .
The proposed witness was first contacted by Contestants on January 20 ( Banaian Dep. at 29 , line 6 ) ( attached to Snyder Affidavit ) .
He did not reach " any type of conclusion " until January 22 ( id. at 26 , line 19 ) , a day after the expert disclosure deadline imposed by the Court , and he was not made available for deposition until after trial had already started , despite his earlier availability .
Jd. at 79 , line 11 , to 80 , line 4 .
The court is within its discretion to exclude the witness for this reason alone .
Banaian has not qualified himself as an expert on the issue he presents .
He admits that he is not necessarily an " expert " in statistics , [ The second excerpt contained within this article is then referenced as proof of the previous assertion . ]
...
Similarly , his opinions are not on a subject matter requiring expert testimony .
He opines on the rejection rates of absentee ballots in 87 counties .
The rejection rates are known facts , ascertainable by a simple calculation .
Expert testimony is not required on that factual issue , and the only reason Contestants want to have Prof .
Banaian testify is to suggest that there is something behind the variations even though he does not have the expertise and has not even attempted to do the analysis to suggest that .
Source : Motion - Contestees Opposition to Contestants Motion in Limine to Exclude Testimony of King Banaian via MNCourts.gov [ PDF ]
The Coleman campaign then responded to Franken 's above motion on February 10th , by addressing each point of opposition :
INTRODUCTION
Contestants plan to call Professor King Banaian as an expert to testify that , based on the application of well - established statistical methods , many counties rejected more absentee ballots than expected from the statewide rate .
This conclusion is not obvious on the face of the data , and expert testimony is appropriate to support it .
Professor Banaian 's proposed testimony will rule out , as a matter of statistical analysis , the possibility that the variation in rejection rates across counties was the result of pure chance .
As such , his testimony will assist the Court as it considers the equal protection and fairness issue underlying its determination of which ballots are in fact legally cast votes .
...
Contestee disparages Professor Banaian 's selection of the binomial distribution and chi-square tests , Mot. at 4 , but " both the chi-square and binomial tests of statistical significance are recognized by courts as being valid means of assessing the representativeness of a sample . "
Reynolds v. Giuliani , 118 F. Supp.2d 352,374 ( S.D.N.Y. 2000 ) ( citing cases ) .
The binomial and chi-square tests are routinely admitted in employment discrimination cases to show disparities in treatment of protected groups .
See , e.g. , id. ; Barnes v. GenCorp Inc. , 896 F.2d 1457 , 1463 , 1466 ( 6th Cir. 1990 ) ; Coates v. Johnson & Johnson , 756 F.2d 524 , 536 n.11 ( 7th Cir. 1985 ) ; Lilly v. Harris - Teeter Supermarket , 720 F.2d 326,336 n.18 ( 4th Cir. 1983 ) .
The binomial and chi-square tests would be helpful here for the same reasons they are helpful in employment discrimination cases :
When a plaintiff demonstrates a significant statistical disparity in the discharge rate , he or she has provided strong evidence that chance alone is not the cause of the discharge pattern .
The statistics do not and cannot determine whether the more likely cause is the defendant 's bias or a legitimate selection criterion .
Barnes , 896 F.2d at 1468 .
Employment statistics may thus establish a prima facie case , subject to rebuttal or proof by additional evidence .
Id. at 1466 ; Lilly , 720 F.2d at 336 n.20 .
Here , Professor Banaian 's proposed testimony would rule out chance as a possible explanation of the different rejection rates and lay a foundation for the Court to consider inconsistent application of the statutory standard as the cause .
...
Contestee argues that Professor Banaian should be disqualified for hesitating to proclaim himself an " expert in statistical analysis , " Snyder Aff. at 37:2 - 3 , but an expert 's modesty is not a basis for excluding him .
Although Professor Banaian does not have a degree in statistics , he testified that he has a Ph.D. in economics , teaches economics and data analysis to college students , frequently uses statistical analysis in his work , and considers himself a " long - time practitioner of statistical analysis . "
Id. at 37:4 -17 .
Professor Banaian has been a professor of economics at St. Cloud State University for nearly 25 years , and he has numerous data - intensive publications .
Affidavit of F. Matthew Ralph ( " Ralph Aff . " )
Ex. 5 . ... ( quoting Dennie v. Metropolitan Medical Ctr. , 387 N.W.2d 401 , 405 ( Minn. 1986 ) ( " The general rule in Minnesota is expert testimony should be suppressed for failure to make a timely disclosure of the expert 's identity only where ' counsel 's dereliction ... is inexcusable and results in disadvantage to his opponent . " ) .
Contestee suffered no prejudice whatsoever .
Contestee does not claim that Professor Banaian 's deposition testimony differed prejudicially from his disclosed opinion , because it did not .
Compare Ralph Aff. Ex. 5 , with Snyder Aff. at 12:20 - 13:5 .
Contestee complains that he was obliged to depose Professor Banaian after trial commenced , but he does not explain how the timing of the deposition harmed him , especially when it occurred several days before Professor Banaian 's trial testimony .
In sum , Contestants ' disclosure of Professor Banaian was timely , and Contestee has suffered no prejudice whatsoever to justify exclusion of Professor Banaian 's trial testimony .

It 's interesting to note that absentee voting in Minnesota is considered a privilege and not a right .
Franken then responded to Coleman 's response on February 11th ; the memorandum presents two main ideas .
First , the Franken campaign asserts that rejection rates are irrelevant to the Election Contest Court 's duty and secondly , they stated that the techniques used by Prof.
Banaian are uneffective :
I. INTRODUCTION Contestee Al Franken respectfully submits that the Motion in Limine to Exclude Testimony of King Banaian ( " Motion in Limine " ) should be granted .
As his deposition transcript makes plain , Professor Banaian 's proposed testimony is irrelevant to the only proper question before the Court : which candidate received the greatest number of votes that were " legally cast " in the 2008 U.S. Senate election .
Evidence of alleged statistical differences in rejection rates between Minnesota counties is especially irrelevant in light of Professor Banaian 's own admitted inability to offer any evidence , testimony or opinion on the underlying cause for the observed differences between the counties .
As a result , this evidence is irrelevant under Minn .
R. Evid 402 and 702 .
It would add nothing to this already over - burdened litigation except additional cost , delay , and confusion , and should also be excluded under Rule 403 .
...
For starters , the task before the Court is to determine which of the two candidates received the highest number of votes legally cast in this election .
The relative rejection rates between counties sheds no light on this subject .
A rejected absentee ballot either was , or was not , properly rejected and the fact that it was or was not rejected by a county with a higher or lower rate of rejection that its neighboring county ( or even as compared to all of the other counties ) hardly makes that rejection any more or less wrongful or the vote more or less " legally cast . "
Rejection rates by county are , in short , simply irrelevant to the task before this Court .
Moreover , the use of relatively unsophisticated binomial distribution analysis and chi square tests are hardly the preferred means of statistical proof in discrimination cases .
Instead , such rudimentary statistical tests are frequently rejected in favor of a regression analysis that can eliminate other causal explanations for observed differences - precisely the analysis that Professor Banaian admits that he cannot offer .

The King Banaian issue is next in the Election Contest Court 's queue , but they may have already addressed it 's resolution .
We know the Election Contest Court canceled twelve of their nineteen categories last Friday , but they also asserted the accuracy of Minnesota 's vote counting system ; from the introduction of the memorandum attached to the Order Establishing Hearing on Motions :
The facts presented thus far do not show a wholesale disenfranchisement of absentee voters in the 2008 general election .
Of the approximately 286,000 absentee ballots cast by voters , roughly 4,800 are at issue in this contest and remain unopened and uncounted .
This is less than 2 % of the absentee ballots cast in the general election .
Further , the Court notes that , many of the voters whose absentee ballots remain unopened may have cast ballots that have already been counted either because they voted in person on Election Day or they submitted a subsequent absentee ballot that was opened and counted .
These voters were not disenfranchised by the rejection of their absentee ballots .
...
All rejected absentee ballots were reviewed both on Election Day and through the Supreme Court review process .
The Court is confident that although it may discover certain additional ballots that were legally cast under relevant law , there is no systemic problem of disenfranchisement in the state 's election system , including in its absentee - balloting procedures .

Based upon the above expression of the Election Contest County , it will be interesting to see if the Coleman campaign continues to push for the testimony of Professor King Banaian .

Baby - faced Alfie Patten may not be a father at 13 after all amid allegations that the mother has had several other sexual partners , it was reported today .
The case of Alfie - who was just 12 when the baby was conceived - has already provoked a fierce political debate over the high rate of teenage pregnancies in the UK and the sexualisation of children .
But two other teenagers believe they may have fathered six - day old Maisie , whose mother Chantelle Steadman is herself just 15 .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Richard Goodsell , 16 , told the News of the World that he also shared a bed with the teenager at her home in Eastbourne , East Sussex , at around the time she became pregnant .
Richard , a trainee chef , said : " I know I could be the father .
Everyone thinks I am .
My friends all tell me that the baby has my eyes - even my mum thinks so .
" Even Chantelle 's mum asked me if I was the father .
If I am the father , I have the right to know . "
Richard , who told the paper he slept with Chantelle with the consent of her parents and without using any contraception , said he plans to demand a DNA test is carried out to find out the truth .
Chantelle lives with her mother , Penny , and father , Steve , in a council house on the Old Town estate .
Tyler Barker , 14 , also told the paper he could have fathered Maisie , born at the Eastbourne District General Hospital last week .
He said he slept with Chantelle around nine months ago , again in her own bed .
Realising the gravity of the situation , he added : " I hope it 's not me . "
Both boys and their parents are reported to have made sworn statements in front of a solicitor detailing their encounters with Chantelle .
The situation has provoked outrage from politicians and charity workers who said it exemplified the " complete collapse " of parts of society .

Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith , who runs the Centre for Social Justice think tank , said the birth highlighted another case of " broken Britain " where " anything goes " .
He said : " It 's not being accusative , it 's about pointing out the complete collapse in some parts of society of any sense of what 's right and wrong .
" There is no opprobrium any more about behaviour and quite often children witness behaviour that 's aggressive , violent , rude and sexual .
It 's as if no - one is saying this is wrong . "
Tory leader David Cameron said children having children was " worrying " and that parenthood should not be something they should even be contemplating .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown did not comment directly on the case but said " all of us would want to avoid teenage pregnancies " .
Meanwhile , Tony Kerridge , of the sexual health specialist Marie Stopes International , said children needed better education to develop aspirations and avoid a life of poverty .
Society should be encouraging young people to have bigger aspirations than simply to slip into a benefits culture lifestyle , he added .
Both Chantelle and Alfie have been kept hidden from the media glare since bringing Maisie home from hospital last week .
Alfie , who stands just 4ft tall and looks young for his 13 years , has said he plans to stand by and support Chantelle with the baby .
However the schoolboy , who lives with his mother , Nicola , in nearby Hailsham , admitted that he did not know how he would be able to support them financially .
Sussex Police has said no action will be taken , with it " not in anyone 's interests " to prosecute .
East Sussex County Council said the teenage parents would be supported with intensive monitoring and health visitor support .

The Obama administration is leaning toward keeping secret some graphic details of tactics allowed in Central Intelligence Agency interrogations , despite a push by some top officials to make the information public , according to people familiar with the discussions .
These people cautioned that President Barack Obama is still reviewing internal arguments over the release of Justice Department memorandums related to CIA interrogations , and how much information will be made public is in flux .

Have you heard ?
Fox News is promoting Tea Party protests and will cover it extensively .
The Internet was abuzz pointing out that Fox has not provided equal coverage for similar events that are not in line with the right wing agenda and that neither MSNBC , nor CNN , have promoted anything like this .
Neil Cavuto went on the defensive and got caught in a lie .
Cavuto , like an annoying parrot , mimicked the Fox News “ fair and balanced ” slogan and stated that they covered the Million Man March , which took place in 1995 .
The problem is that Fox News was n’t around then .
FNC could n’t be seen on TV until the following year .

THE LIGHTNING FIELD By Richard McCord Other Articles by Richard McCord
On a barren , isolated plain in west - central New Mexico , one of the most remarkable artistic creations of all time has quietly taken shape .
Called the Lightning Field , it is a precise geometric collection of 400 gleaming metal poles rising from the earth over an area one mile long and one kilometer wide .
Built in secrecy , at a cost of hundreds of thousands of dollars , the Lightning Field has stood in place since 1977 .
It is a mystifying some would say a pointless work .
It is hidden , and except for a trickle of visitors will remain so .
It serves no practical purpose .
It can not be viewed in its entirety , and can hardly be spotted from the air .
The Lightning Field is cerebral and cold , or fiery and emotional , or both , or neither , depending on each viewer 's perception .
It has stirred major artistic debate throughout the world .
But whatever else might be said about the Lightning Field , one thing about it is beyond dispute :
There is nothing else like it on Earth .
One of the largest , costliest , most sweeping and ambitious artistic projects of all time stands in virtual secrecy on an obscure plain some 33 tortuous miles from the village of Quemado in western New Mexico , about 240 miles from Santa Fe .
The Lightning Field , as the work is called , is the creation of internationally known artist Walter de Maria .
It took de Maria nearly 10 years to complete , cost close to half a million dollars , and has been lavishly described by noted art authorities as " a major monument in the world today " and " as important as the pyramids . "
Yet the Lightning Field , completed in 1977 , has been viewed by only a handful of people , each of whom made a special appointment to see it .
You might be the next one .
The Lightning Field is an installation of 400 stainless steel poles , each two inches in diameter and approximately 20 feet tall , imbedded permanently at intervals of 220 feet , over a rectangular area measuring one mile on one side and one kilometer on the other .
Its creator , de Maria , is a 65 - year - old , California - born " conceptual artist , " whose other notable works include a metal shaft sunk one kilometer into the Earth in Germany , a four - mile - long , six - foot - wide walkway cutting across an isolated stretch of Nevada desert , and a knee - high pile of dirt that filled the floor of a New York City gallery .
For more than 40 years de Maria has committed himself to such " Earthworks " ( or " Land Art , " as he calls them ) , and in that time has won unstinting acclaim from many leading figures in the art world - and hostile skepticism , if not dismissal , from others .
Understandably , few of the latter number have been among those who have viewed the Lightning Field .
But from the critics who have seen it , this creation emerges from any debate as an artistic triumph of historic proportions .
" Walter de Maria is not only an artist of great capacity but also one with the very special ability to create grand symbolism of which the Lightning Field is his major achievement , " said Thomas Messer , former director of the Guggenheim Museum of Modern Art in New York City .
" The Lightning Field is an expanse beyond what the eye can see , provoking the tension between heaven and earth .
It symbolizes what men can achieve on this earth by reaching up to heaven . "
A less reverential but no less enthusiastic appraisal was given by Santa Fe resident Rosalind Constable , who for 20 years before her retirement served as avant - garde artistic adviser to Time - Life Inc .
After visiting the Lightning Field , she said : " It was a fantastic experience more an experience than a work of art , because of my own reactions to it .
I thought it was absolutely beautiful and crazy to go to all that trouble to plant this bed of metal asparagus in the middle of nowhere . "
Summing up , she added : " It will be appreciated as a terrific contribution to the modern art scene .
I think it is as important as the Pyramids . "
Completely unreserved in his remarks was William Agee , director of the Fine Arts Museum in Houston , who also has visited the site .
" An extraordinary experience - almost mind - boggling .
The Lightning Field is one of the major pieces anywhere in the world .
No doubt about it - a major monument in the world today .
And in terms of the technology , the sheer work that went into it , it is a tour - de - force . "
The " sheer work " that culminated in the Lightning Field stretched over 10 years , according to Helen Winkler , vice president of the Manhattan - based Dia Art Foundation , which sponsored de Maria and paid the costs of his monumental New Mexico work .
The concept of the Lightning Field came to de Maria in 1969 , Winkler said , and was followed by a five - year search for the right plot of Southwestern land upon which to build it .
Production of the poles in New York took another year , followed by months of surveying the site .
In June 1977 everything was ready for construction .
A small crew moved in to build the Lightning Field .
Robert Fosdick , who lived at the site and directed the construction , recalled that many problems beset the project .
After shipment from New York several poles were bent and mashed , and had to be retooled in a machine shop in Quemado .
Predictably high afternoon winds confined installation of the poles to the early hours , and considerable experimentation preceded the final method of setting each pole in a concrete foundation one foot in diameter and four feet deep .
Although engineering the project had been assigned to a professional firm , a visual check during the installation revealed a pole clearly out of line .
A subsequent recalculation of the entire project discovered no fewer than 18 similar mistakes .
Another technical challenge was posed by de Maria 's requirement that all the poles must rise to a perfectly level height , despite gentle variations in the essentially flat site .
To meet that specification , the 400 poles of the Lightning Field range in length from 16 to 27 feet , rising an average of 20 feet from the ground .
But once the necessary construction procedures were worked out , Fosdick said , the installation process reached an ongoing pace of 16 poles per day .
( A pole went up every 22 minutes ! " )
And by Oct. 31 , 1977 , the sprawling work of art , stretching 25 poles long down its mile - length side and 16 poles long down the kilometer side , was completed .
Completed , Winkler said , at a cost of about $ 500,000 and completed , Fosdick predicted , once and for all time .
" We 've taken 120 - mile - per - hour winds into consideration , as well as the soil of this area , the storms , everything we can think of .
The only change we can expect to happen would be caused if the earth itself moved . "
And , according to both Fosdick and Winkler , the effect of lightning storms on the Field is only an incidental consideration , despite the work 's provocative name .
Each pole is grounded , they point out , and there is no reason to expect bolts of electricity to jump across the 220 - foot distance that separates the metal shafts .
Fosdick said he had only once seen lightning strike a pole in the Field , and the only visible effect he noted was a slight halo at the top of the pole .
After de Maria decided to present his work to the public , the problem facing the lightning Field staff was how to deal with the people who want to see it .
The chosen solution was to limit visits to the almost - impossible - to - find site to small overnight groups with advance reservations .
Absolutely abhorrent to de Maria and the Lightning Field staff is the thought that the work might be thrown open to hordes of quick - stop curiosity seekers , buzzing in and out , not willing to take the time needed to contemplate the piece , and cluttering up the experience of appreciative visitors .
That intense desire for continued isolation for the Lightning Field has been staunchly defended by the art authorities commenting on it .
" It 's valid , yes , " said the Guggenheim 's Messer .
" Conceptual art deliberately keeps its distance from the marketplace .
Part of its message is to stay aloof from the mundane things . "
Since the Lightning Field was completed in 1977 , fewer than 1,000 visitors have come to the site .
But for the lucky few who do make the considerable arrangements to take their turn at the Lightning Field , Winkler said , " It 's such an opportunity such an opportunity ! "
If You Want to Go According to the Dia Art Foundation , which administers the Lightning Field , visits will be offered each year from June to November , to pre-scheduled groups of from one to three people , for a one - or two - day overnight visit .
Visitors will be met in Quemado and escorted to the Field , will be fed and lodged at the site , and will be asked to donate $ 30 to cover expenses .
Anyone interested in scheduling a visit to the Lightning Field should write for details to : Dia Art Foundation , P. O. Box 207 , Quemado , NM 87829 .

The officials were acting on a tip from another student and were looking for prescription - strength ibuprofen , a painkiller .
They made Ms. Redding strip to her underwear , shake her bra and pull aside her panties .
The officials , both female , found no pills .
“ What this school official did , ” Mr. Wolf said , referring to the male assistant principal who ordered the search , “ was act on nothing more than a hunch  if that  that Savana was currently concealing ibuprofen pills underneath her underpants for others ’ oral consumption . ”
“ I mean , there ’s a certain ick factor to this , ” Mr. Wolf said .
Without intimating a view on the ickiness of what Mr. Wolf had described , Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. suggested that the law might treat different undergarments differently .
“ The issue here covers the brassiere as well , ” he said , “ which does n’t seem as outlandish as the underpants . ”
Justice Breyer elaborated on what children put in their underwear .
“ In my experience when I was 8 or 10 or 12 years old , you know , we did take our clothes off once a day , ” he said .
“ We changed for gym , O.K . ?
And in my experience , too , people did sometimes stick things in my underwear . ”
The courtroom rocked with laughter , and the justice grew a little flustered at having apparently misspoken .
Summers said Obama plans to join a push organized by congressional Democrats .
Obama plans credit - card push
White House economic adviser Larry Summers told NBC ’s “ Meet the Press ” that President Obama plans to join a push planned by congressional Democrats on “ credit card abuses ” as part of looking out for the little guy while rebuilding the nation ’s financial system .
" We need to do things to stop the marketing of credit in ways that addicts people to it , " Summers said .

Summers told moderator David Gregory that Obama is concerned about “ the way people have been deceived into paying extraordinarily high rates that they would n't have paid if they knew what they were getting themselves into . ”
On other matters , Summers said he was “ surprised ” by the outpouring of conservative rage on Tax Day that took the form of mock “ tea parties ” around the country .
“ You know , I do n't know that much about politics , but I ’ve been surprised by these tea parties a bit , ” Summer said .
“ The President is the one proposing cutting taxes on virtually all Americans , so I 'm not sure who these tea parties see as being King George . "
After a series of notably upbeat statements on the economy from the administration , Summers was repeatedly cautious .
“ It 's gonna be a long road , ” Summers said .
“ We ’ve seen some more mixed statistics after a period when there were no positive statistics to be found .
But it 's a , it ’s a long road , and it 's going to take time .
Other highlights of the interview :
SUMMERS , answering Gregory ’s question on whether he is worried that all of these recovery efforts on the part of administration are helping Wall Street and not Main Street : “ What ’s most important to the President is what ’s most important , I think , for all your viewers , is that we get this economy going again .
It 's gonna be a long road .
We ’ve seen some more mixed statistics after a period when there were no positive statistics to be found .
But it 's a , it ’s a long road , and it 's going to take time .
It 's going to take creating jobs again .
That 's why the recovery bill was so important .
It 's going to take supporting the financial system because without flow of credit , you really can't even begin to get the economy going again .
That 's where our main focus is .
“ As for the financial markets , I could tell you that the President is pushing very hard for a very strong program of regulation that is gonna correct many of the mistakes that were made last time around .
He 's going to be very focused , in a very near term , on a whole set of issues having to do with credit card abuses , having to do with the way people have been deceived into paying extraordinarily high rates that they would n't have paid if they knew what they were getting themselves into , he ’s going to be pushing on issues relating to what 's known as systemic risk , the concern that an institution gets itself into a situation where it becomes itself a source of risk to the whole , to the whole financial system . ”
SUMMERS , ON PAUL KRUGMAN WARNING NOT TO COUNT THE RECOVERY BEFORE IT ’S HATCHED : “ You know , I disagree with Paul about a lot of things , but he is right to be raising cautions .
That 's why , when I just spoke about the economy , I said that after a period when , when everything was negative , there was now some mixture in the indicators .
We do n't know what , we do n’t know , we can't know with certainty what 's going to happen next , and there certainly are real risks ahead . ”
GREGORY TRIES FOR A TAX PLEDGE : " Is the President pledging that he will not raise taxes on anybody … earning less than $ 250,000 ? "
SUMMERS : " The President made clear what his policy is , and the budget is an articulation of the President 's policy , and what actually does is reduce tax burdens for those making $ 250,000 .
And it has contained , the stimulus bill contains a tax cut for 95 percent of all Americans . "
GREGORY : " And he wo n't reverse that at any point to fund these priorities ? '
SUMMERS : " I think I ’ve made it very clear where the President is and where the President is going .
I mean , he ’s made it completely evident during the presidential campaign , since he took office , that the focus is going to be right there on raising the incomes of middle - income families . ”
Gregory concluded by asking Summers his “ goals for the capitalist system that emerges out of this financial crisis . ”
SUMMERS : “ We ’re gonna need a less leveraged economy .
That means three things : it means a much better regulated financial system , and that 's what the President is already hard at work on , with Chairman Frank in the House and Chairman Dodd in the Senate .
It means that individuals are going to have to save more , that ’s why savings incentives are so important .
That 's why we need to do things to stop the marketing of credit in ways that addicts people to it , so that our households are again saving , and families are again preparing to send kids to college , for their retirement , and so forth .
And third , we are going to need a government , that ultimately gets back to the kind of place we had it in the 1990s , where it ’s a contributor of savings to the economy rather than a drain .
Those are all objectives we ’re working towards in the long run .
But , David , if we do n't firmly establish recovery , we ’re gonna be able to get to any of those things .
And that 's why the first focus has to be on making sure that we get an expansion going , and that 's what all of us in the administration are working so hard to implement that recovery and reinvestment act , to put in place the financial stability program , to contain the damage in the housing market . ”
In 1964 , historian Richard Hofstadter described " the paranoid style " as a periodic recurrence in American national life , characterized by " the use of paranoid modes of expressions by more or less normal people . . . heated exaggeration , suspiciousness , and conspiratorial fantasy . "
Teagate , the overhyped , underattended events of last week , closely tracks this taxonomy .
What were the protests supposedly about ?
Taxes and government spending .
But in fact , the president 's economic program has already cut taxes for 95 percent of Americans — and state and local tax increases would be far steeper without the protestors ' other target , the Obama stimulus package , which provides recession - fighting funds to state and local governments .
Incoherent as a program , Teagate was relatively insubstantial as a protest .
The usual suspects — from Fox News to Karl Rove — dutifully , at times desperately , hyped it as an outpouring of public dissatisfaction .
A writer for the right - wing Manhattan Institute managed to see " the tidal wave of the future " in the tea leaves .
But truth confounds belief .
Nate Silver , the master of political statistics who predicted the 2008 election results almost precisely , compiled a crowd count from " reasonably nonpartisan and credible sources . "
He calculated a total of just over 300,000 protestors at hundreds of sites .
This is n't de minimis , but it 's no tidal wave .
It was hardly even national .
As Silver noted , turnout was " much larger in the South than in other regions . "
In most major cities , around 2,000 people showed up — a turnout that would get an advance man for a major candidate fired .
Even in Atlanta , where the rally featured an all - star right - wing line - up of Sean Hannity , Mike Huckabee , and Dick Armey , the 15,000 who came to hear and jeer were a pale shadow of the massive demonstrations of earlier eras — and fewer than showed up for the Atlanta Braves game the same night .
With the paranoid style , the more things change , the more they look the same .
Once , in the face of the first waves of Irish Catholic immigration , it was " the pope of Rome " who was " plotting America 's destruction . "
In the fevered minds of the rabid Right , the New Deal aimed " to pave the way for socialism or communism . "
Other examples can be drawn from every period of stress and change in our national experience .
Sen .
Joseph McCarthy deserves his own chapter — from his absurd charge early in the Cold War that Democrats were guilty of " 20 years of treason " to his later assaults on Dwight Eisenhower and the State Department .
But McCarthy had not only followers but heirs .
Leaflets distributed in Dallas on Nov. 22 , 1963 , indicted John Kennedy for giving " support and encouragement to the Communist - inspired racial riots . "
The tea- gaters ' often hate - filled excoriation of President Obama announced the latest manifestation of the paranoid style .
Just look at the signs they proudly waved .
It was paranoia on parade :
" If I Wanted to Be a Commie , I 'd Stay in China . "
" Obamunism " ( with Obama pictured as Che Guevera )
" Mr. Obama Where 's Your Birth Certificate ? "
" Wake up America Your Muslim President Bowed to His Muslim King "
This last one was repeated , shorn of its overt religious bigotry , by Newt Gingrich , who never misses an opportunity to stoke paranoid politics .
But he 's not the only one .
Across the terrain of Teagate , we witnessed the pathetic spectacle of Republican politicians grasping for political leverage .
Tennessee Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn spoke at a Nashville tea gaggle where a sign equated Obama and his campaign logo with Hitler and the swastika .
To paraphrase a reproof from a previous manifestation of the paranoid style , have Republicans " no sense of decency ? "
Or for that matter no common sense — as illustrated by Texas Gov. Rick Perry 's wacky acquiescence to the fanciful notion that Texas can secede from the Union ?
Teagate is not the only sign of paranoid reaction .
Gun sales have reached record levels , fueled by the improbability that the president is plotting new gun-control laws .
Republican Sen. Jim DeMint arraigns Obama as " the world 's best salesman of socialism . "
The comically malaprop Congresswoman Michele Bachmann has proclaimed her fears about Obama 's creating " re-education camps for young people " through the new National Service Bill named for Edward Kennedy , which is scheduled to be signed into law at a White House ceremony Tuesday .
( You can bet she wo n't be there . )
This is a time of great change and , for many Americans , Obama is " the other " — the first African - American president .
It 's no accident that in all the images of Teagate , it was hard to find minority faces .
But there is a real and diverse majority of Americans that seems increasingly confident as Barack Obama nears the end of his first 100 days .
From economic policy to health care , from the G - 20 Summit to the Summit of the Americas , he offers hope for a transformative national renewal .
Most Americans are n't drinking the right - wing tea .
It 's just a shame that instead of seeking common ground or offering genuine alternatives , the GOP is pandering to the paranoid style in American politics .
( CNN ) --
If the world of entertainment is any indication , the geeks shall inherit the Earth .
Programs like CBS ' " The Big Bang Theory " are indicative of the coolness of geeks and nerds in pop culture .
The nerd herd is everywhere these days it seems : in books , on television and at the movies .
Geeks rallied to keep Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak in the game on " Dancing with the Stars . "
They have also been burning up online message boards in anticipation of the new " Star Trek " movie , out Friday , and working feverishly to keep the NBC series " Chuck , " an ode to geekdom , on the small screen .
In the 25 years since " Revenge of the Nerds " debuted at movie theaters , geek chic has grabbed hold and catapulted the brilliant , yet often socially inept , into the realm of -- dare it be said -- the hip and the cool .
" It is definitely hot right now in pop culture , " said Benjamin Nugent , author of the " American Nerd : The Story of My People . "
The popularity of shows like " Ugly Betty , " " The Big Bang Theory " and " Myth Busters " are just a few examples that -- along with the box office success of Judd Apatow films like " Superbad " and " Knocked Up " -- have made Hollywood stand up and take notice of the lure of geekdom .
Although there have long been shows and movies that have attracted the geek nation , the new breed of entertainment goes a step further by featuring geeky characters and personalities front and center .

Nugent traces the concept of " the nerd " to 19th - century literature , with the socially awkward Mary Bennet in Jane Austen 's " Pride and Prejudice " and Victor Frankenstein in Mary Shelley 's " Frankenstein . "
The latter can perform the scientific task of creating a monster but can't find the emotional reserve to be its father .
Nugent said he believes that the watershed moment for modern - day nerds came with a surprising romantic lead on Fox 's " The O.C. , " which he says sent waves through network television .
" The show had a guy who they thought was going to be their heartthrob , a character named Ryan Atwood , played by Benjamin McKenzie , " Nugent explained .
" The comedic foil that they gave that character was Seth Cohen , played by Adam Brody , and an unexpected thing happened in that audiences embraced Adam as the heartthrob on the show .
" I think that created an opening for other TV and screenwriters to say ' Oh , there 's a way to create a character that does n't have to be the James Dean type but can be the overeducated , overanalyzing , almost nebbish character that can also be an attractive , engaging character , ' " Nugent added .
Lori Kendall , an associate professor in the Graduate School of Library and Information Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign , studies popular cultural representations of nerds -- which she said is not quite the same as a geek .
" My take on it is that geek is a more positive term , and nerd is still negative , " she said .
" Geek does n't stick as much . "
( The coinage of " nerd , " incidentally , is attributed to Dr. Seuss , who used the word in his 1950 book " If I Ran the Zoo . " )
Kendall pointed out that people can " geek out " about something and not necessarily be thought of as a nerd .
In the 1980s , Kendall said , nerds became synonymous with computers and technology .
Even as the public at large has grown more familiar and comfortable with technology , the old stereotypes of the smart , pocket - protector - wearing white male who can't get a girlfriend has continued , she said .
" It 's been surprising to me how much you see geeks and nerds in popular culture now , but it is also surprising to me that there is still that negative stigma to it , " Kendall said .
Rob Malda , creator - director for the site SlashDot , which bills itself as providing " news for nerds , " said society could n't help but take notice after " the nerds of the '70s and ' 80s became the driving influencers of technology in the ' 90s . "
" Some of those nerds got rich , others gained tremendous influence , and some became household names , " said Malda , who embraces being a nerd .
" So I do n't know if it ' fascinates ' people , but the mainstream became aware of them because in many ways , a small number of them hijacked the means of communication and business .
It 's hard to ignore that . "
Bill Prady is well aware of the nerd 's power .
Before he became a successful writer and producer of shows like " Dharma & Greg , " " Gilmore Girls , " and " Two and a Half Men , " he was a computer programmer .
He drew on that knowledge to co-create , along with Chuck Lorre , the CBS hit " The Big Bang Theory , " which chronicles the comic adventures of a pair of brilliant physicists , their equally geeky friends and their attractive female neighbor .
Prady said his television show takes a " beautiful mind " approach to the characters that he and the other writers so obviously have a deep affection for .
" We do n't make fun of them , because very much we are our characters , " Prady said .
" While we 're not as smart as our characters ... we share many of their passions in terms of pop culture . "
Prady said the audience is very protective of the characters and relates to them .
He believes that attitude is a reflection of the fact that many have felt like outsiders at some point .
The show 's fan base is similar to those of sci - fi shows , and they follow the sitcom with much the same devotion , he said .
And although the " The Big Bang Theory " relies on a UCLA professor of astrophysics as a consultant to get the science right , Prady said it 's the writers who infuse the show with its geeky pop culture references .
" The deep , deep knowledge of ' Star Trek , ' that 's just us , " Prady said , laughing .
All About Ugly Betty • Technology • Television • Internet
It is sometimes claimed that the historical Buddha was unconcerned about the nature of reality .
For example , the Buddhist author Stephen Batchelor has said , " I honestly do n't think the Buddha was interested in the nature of reality .
The Buddha was interested in understanding suffering , in opening one 's heart and one 's mind to the suffering of the world . "
Some of the Buddha 's teachings appear to be about the nature of reality , however .
He taught that everything is interrelated .
He taught that the phenomenal world follows natural laws .
He taught that the ordinary appearance of things is an illusion .
For someone who was n't " interested " in the nature of reality , he certainly spoke about the nature of reality quite a bit .
It is also said that Buddhism is not about " metaphysics , " a word that can mean a lot of things .
In its broadest sense , it refers to a philosophical inquiry into existence itself .
In some contexts , it can refer to the supernatural , but it is n't necessarily about supernatural things .
However , again , the argument is that the Buddha was always practical and just wanted to help people be free from suffering so he would n't have been interested in metaphysics .
Yet many schools of Buddhism are built upon metaphysical foundations .
So who is right ?
The Anti-Metaphysics Argument
Most people who argue that the Buddha was n't interested in the nature of reality provide two examples from the Pali Canon .
In the Cula - Malunkyovada Sutta ( Majjhima Nikaya 63 ) , a monk named Malunkyaputta declared that if the Buddha did not answer some questions --
Is the cosmos eternal ?
Does a Tathagata exist after death ? -- he would give up being a monk .
The Buddha replied that Malunkyaputta was like a man struck by a poisoned arrow , who would not have the arrow removed until someone told him the name of the man who had shot him , and whether he was tall or short , and where he lived , and what sort of feathers were used for the fletchings .
Being given answers to those questions would not be helpful , the Buddha said .
" Because they are not connected with the goal , are not fundamental to the holy life .
They do not lead to disenchantment , dispassion , cessation , calming , direct knowledge , self - awakening , Unbinding . "
In several other places in the Pali texts , the Buddha discusses skillful and unskillful questions .
For example , in the Sabbasava Sutta ( Majjhima Nikaya 2 ) , he said that speculating about the future or the past , or wondering " Am I ?
Am I not ?
What am I ?
How am I ?
Where has this being come from ?
Where is it bound ? " gives rise to a " wilderness of views " that do not help liberate one from dukkha .
The Path of Wisdom
The Buddha taught that ignorance is the cause of hate and greed .
Hate , greed , and ignorance are the three poisons from which all suffering comes .
So while it is true that the Buddha taught how to be liberated from suffering , he also taught that insight into the nature of existence was part of the path to liberation .
In his teaching of the Four Noble Truths , the Buddha taught that the means to be released from suffering is practice of the Eightfold Path .
The first section of the Eightfold Path deals with wisdom -- Right View and Right Intention .
" Wisdom " in this case means seeing things as they are .
Most of the time , the Buddha taught , our perceptions are clouded by our opinions and biases and the way we 're conditioned to understand reality by our cultures .
Theravada scholar Wapola Rahula said in What the Buddha Taught that wisdom is " seeing a thing in its true nature , without name and label . "
Breaking through our delusional perceptions , seeing things as they are , is enlightenment , and this is the means of liberation from suffering .
So to say that the Buddha was only interested in releasing us from suffering , and not interested in the nature of reality , is a bit like saying a doctor is only interested in curing our disease and is not interested in medicine .
Or , it 's a bit like saying a mathematician is only interested in the answer and does n't care about numbers .
In the Atthinukhopariyaayo Sutta ( Samyutta Nikaya 35 ) , the Buddha said that the criterion for wisdom is not faith , rational speculation , views , or theories .
The criterion is insight , free of delusion .
In many other places , the Buddha also spoke about the nature of existence , and of reality , and how people could free themselves from delusion through practice of the Eightfold Path .
Rather than say the Buddha was " not interested " in the nature of reality , it seems more accurate to conclude that he discouraged people from speculating , forming opinions , or accepting doctrines based on blind faith .
Rather , through practice of the Path , through concentration and ethical conduct , one directly perceives the nature of reality .
What about the poison arrow story ?
The monk demanded that the Buddha give him answers to his question , but receiving " the answer " is n't the same as perceiving the answer oneself .
And believing in a doctrine explaining enlightenment is not the same thing as enlightenment .
Instead , the Buddha said , we should practice " disenchantment , dispassion , cessation , calming , direct knowledge , self - awakening , Unbinding . "
Merely believing in a doctrine is not the same thing as direct knowledge and self - awakening .
What the Buddha discouraged in the Sabbasava Sutta and Cula - Malunkyovada Sutta was intellectual speculation and attachment to views , which get in the way of direct knowledge and self - awakening .

Days fly by and as the Steve Miller band once famously crooned time keeps on slipping slippin ’ slippin ’ into the future and I ’ll be flying not quite like an eagle but indeed to the sea or rather from sea to shining sea as I jet from the Pacific to the Atlantic for an odd whirlwind of adventure .
My life is like chocolate flavored cottoncandy .
In theory it SHOULD be awesome but in practice it is weird .
And sticky .
I returned from Beyond Leather and for better or for worse , a great deal of the amazing time I had there was ( temporarily ? ) eclipsed by a quicklimeslickpit of personalities and dramas and unknown histories that unfolded with all of the magnificence of an Amorphophallus titanum and still draws my brain like s jigsaw carwreck .
What was my role in this ?
What could I have done differently ?
How can I avoid it in the future ?
And even below that which YOU , dear reader , knows , there is more .
And even as I look back , and I continued to gather information , I felt better and better about my comportment .
Patterns emerged and I was able to put myself into a right - sized place in the drama .
Which was a way smaller place than I initially thought .
PROFOUND THANKS to my friends Bailey , Andra , my new friend Melissa ( who took me to dinner and made me feel so awesome ) to Sarah Sloane and to the other women online and offline who listened , and were angels and spiritual warriors when I was floundering .
Sisterhood IS powerful
Even as I look ahead to the surety that I am indeed , a Hard - To - Place - Pound - Puppy , I reach some kind of peace with that .
For today , at least .
The other day I found myself watching the State of the Union / First 100 Days press conference .
And , OK , so I am a weirdo , but the sight of a brilliant intelligent savvy capable man fielding questions and representing this country after the drought of the past 8 years made me…hot .
Like “ OMG fuck me now .
No , NOW . ” hot .
But alas , we ’ve no one to play with .
Or do we ?
A few text messages later , pretty much to the effect of “ Hi , Long time no see sweetie , how are you doing , sorry about [ Insert Personal Family Thing Here ] SO…um … wanna fuck ? ” I got back a rather surprised but positive response .
Which was awesome , since my last overture fell rather … flat .
Interestingly , I found myself in the bemusing position of having to throw up my hand when it came time to “ talk things over ”
I really did n’t want to talk .
I wanted to be slapped around and fucked .
I think most guys expect that women do n’t know how to fuck without attachment , or that inevitably , the attachment will entrap them .
But , the secret is this …at this point , the reality is , despite my loneliness , I do n’t know that I have room for a partner .
The past 6 months have been a whirlwind of travel , and the next 9 months are slampacked with rehearsals for 2 different shows .
Someone who wanted in to my life right now would have to have a supertanker of superlatives backing them up .
And …well … I stacked the deck by propositioning a former lover .
I feel good about that .
It is pretty great to have someone I care about with whom to romp .
And I also feel pretty good about handling the rather wonky and dicey rapprochement of a partner with ease and a deft hand .
Of course , blind estrus - crazed weasel lust helped glaze over the awkwardness .
Oh and you can find my friend lurking on Twitter as @LuckyLovewrench .
Thanks to @saynine and My Webmaster for christening him in his new and Exalted position .
And , now …I ’m off !
Hey , see ya on the East Coast , my friends .
Are you going to Sex 2.0 ?
I will be there !
And stay tuned .
I am in the process of negotiating my very first anal fisting .
Really .
So in the comments of this wonderful piece , was like " dude you should draw Samus and / or Snake , " so I said to myself HEY WHY NOTSo here they are , yup .
Samus is really reaching for that high five , hahaAnd my god , Brawl is SO GOOD , but you all already knew that This was a welcome respite from working on Double K , but now I 've gotta get back on that biznass , especially since I 've got an announcement to make about it within a couple days OOOOOHHHH

- Colin Powell today on " Face The Nation , " responding to Dick Cheney 's comment that he would choose Rush Limbaugh over Colin Powell .
Former Secretary of State Colin Powell calmly rebutted the GOP Gospel According to Dick on today 's " Face the Nation . "
Cheney said in that interview he thought Colin Powell had " left the Republican party . "
" By almost every demographic indicate , the Republican party is losing .
The number of people who have identified themselves as Republicans have dropped significantly into the low 20s , and not all of them identify themselves as Republicans , " Powell said .
" I think the Republican party needs to take a good look at itself and decide what kind of party are we . "
Host Bob Schieffer asked his reaction to Rush Limbaugh 's statement that " the only reason he 's [ Powell ] is voting for him [ Obama ] is because Barack Obama is black .
Is he calling you a racist ? "
Powell called the remarks " unfortunate . "
" Mr. Limbaugh saw fit to dismiss all those reasons [ I gave ] and put it in a racial context and ignored all the reasons I listed for it , " Powell said .
He said in 50 years , he voted for the person he thought was the best qualified at that time to lead the nation , and that he also voted for Lyndon Johnson , John Kennedy and Jimmy Carter .
" He should n't have a veto over what someone thinks .
He 's an entertainer , he is a radio figure and he is a significant one , but he 's more than that .
" When the chairman of the RNC , Michael Steele , issues even the mildest of criticisms concerning Mr. Limbaugh , and then 24 hours later , the chairman of the RNC has to lay prostrate on the floor , apologizing for it ; and when two congressmen offer the mildest criticism of Mr. Limbaugh , they too then 24 hours later have such pressure brought to bear on them that they too , had to change their view and apologize for criticizing him - well , if he's out there , he should be subject to criticism , just as I am subject to criticism , " he said .

Barack Obama will today ease travel and remittance restrictions to Cuba , in a long - awaited move to thaw relations with the island nation .
The action signals a change in direction after decades of strict sanctions imposed the communist country , which lies just 90 miles off the coast of Florida , and fulfils a promise Obama made during the campaign .
Under the new rules , Americans will be allowed unlimited visits and money transfers to family in Cuba .
A formal announcement is expected this afternoon at the daily press briefing .
White House officials said the policy change is intended to make Cubans less dependent on the Castro regime , and to foster democracy on the island by giving Cubans more contact with Americans .
About 1.5 million Americans have relatives in Cuba .
Currently , family visits to Cuba are limited to once every three years .
The US also limits the amount of money Americans may spend in Cuba to $ 50 per day , and caps the amount Americans may bring to relatives at $ 300 .
According to the US state department , remittances form a significant role in the country 's economy , totalling between $ 600 m to $ 1bn per year , with most coming from families in the US .
Also today , Obama directed his administration to expand the list of items allowed in gift parcels sent to Cuba .
It will include clothes , personal hygiene items , seeds , fishing gear and other necessities , according to the Associated Press .
The policy shift comes days before Obama heads to Trinidad and Tobago for talks at the Summit of the Americas .
It is expected to bring howls of protest from hardline congressmen and senators who say the infusions of hard currency will only strengthen the Castro regime .
But the influence of the anti-Castro Cuban expatriate community in Florida has waned in recent years as a younger generation of Cuban - Americans with less animosity toward Fidel Castro and his brother and successor Raúl comes of age .
Last week , a delegation of African - American congressmen visited Cuba and met with the Castros , an indication of congressional resolve to loosening sanctions .
In addition , politicians from farm states are keen to open greater trade with Cuba .
The US economic embargo on Cuba dates back to October 1960 .
President Dwight Eisenhower broke diplomatic relations with Fidel Castro in January 1961 .
Renowned bear Marc Faber , author of " The Gloom , Boom & Doom Report , " told CNBC that capitalism risks failing like communism unless the free market is allowed to clean up troubled companies .
Is Faber right ?

Police have used CS spray and arrested a man after a fight between guests at a reception in the Houses of Parliament .
The scuffle involved two guests at a spring drinks reception for the media in the shadow cabinet room , hosted by Conservative chairman Eric Pickles .
The guests left the event but continued arguing and were stopped in the corridor by a police officer .
The man was arrested and taken to a nearby police station for questioning and later released on bail .
CORRESPONDENT'S VIEW BBC Political correspondent Iain Watson was at the drinks event Conservative Party chairman Eric Pickles had light - heartedly lectured his 40 or so guests crammed into the shadow cabinet room in the Commons on the dangers of binge drinking .
The guests came from across the political spectrum - a Morning Star journalist here , a socially conservative broadsheet columnist there .
It seemed a well behaved , enjoyable if fairly low key , event .
Most of us were taking the opportunity to talk to the Conservative chairman about the big issue of the day - MPs ' expenses .
The shadow cabinet room is at the very periphery of the Palace of Westminster and is linked , though a series of doors , to the rest of the complex by a long corridor which emerges close to the back of the Commons chamber , near the Speaker 's chair .
It was here that the incident happened .
But none of us at the event - wary of the binge - drinking warning of course - had any indication of something being wrong .
The first I heard was when a BBC colleague was prevented by police from leaving the Commons because " CS gas had been let off " .
Parliament 's past security lapses
Some of the guests at the event told the BBC they thought it was an over - reaction but Commons sources said a police officer received minor injuries in the incident .
A Metropolitan Police spokesman said : " We understand two ' non- passholder ' guests began arguing at a reception .
Both men left the reception and subsequently entered a corridor in a private area of the House where they were stopped by a male police officer .
" One of the men became aggressive and allegedly punched the officer in the face - he sustained a split / cut lip .
" CS Spray was used by the officer to restrain the 40 - year - old man who was arrested on suspicion of assault . "
The man , who has not been named , was released on bail until 7 July pending further inquiries .
Commons authorities confirmed the incident had not been terrorist related or linked to the G20 meeting of world leaders in London later this week .
It is understood that the incident happened in the corridor behind the Speaker 's chair , at the same time as MPs were debating Africa .
Labour MP Kerry McCarthy wrote on Twitter that she had heard the scuffle from within the chamber , adding : " We thought it was a protest , not a punch - up . "
Her message said : " Was in chamber ...
Much excitement , banging and shouting . "
Sources said parliamentary sittings had not been disrupted .
The incident , involving two people who did not have House of Commons passes , will raise fresh questions about security at Westminster .
Parliamentary security has been breached on several occasions in recent years , notably when pro-hunting supporters invaded the Commons chamber in 2004 .
Last year protesters from the Plane Stupid campaign group scaled the roof of Parliament to demonstrate against new airport runways .
Mr Pickles was appointed party chairman in January , having previously been shadow communities secretary .
He was hosting a reception for journalists .

Tales from a Bankrupt Economy
“ Pssst …hey kid …
You , in the red robe …
“ You ’re just graduating from college , right ?
“ You wanna make some real money ?
“ Then , rush to Detroit .
Set up a law firm specializing in bankruptcy . ”
( More of our advice to college graduates can be found here . )
Two auto - parts suppliers have already filed under Chapter 11 .
GM is expected to do so momentarily .
Too bad about GM .
It was set up in 1916 .
If it had been able to hold together for another 7 years , it would have gone 100 years without having to declare bankruptcy .
All people die .
All companies die , too .
That ’s why ‘ buy and hold ’ is wishful thinking .
Buy and hold long enough and you are sure to go broke .
And die .
Eventually the undertakers and bankruptcy lawyers get you .
And today … business is good in Detroit .
What cleared the way for the GM bankruptcy was a deal with the bondholders … in which they take equity in exchange for their debt and agree not to contest the bankruptcy filing .
Still , the deal – and other deals relating to it …including the presence of one very big and very odd shareholder , the government of the United States of America – is so complicated , it ’s bound to give bankruptcy lawyers plenty of work for many years .
But business seems to be picking up everywhere …at least , that ’s the impression you get from reading the paper .
The war against capitalism seems to be going pretty well , in other words .
Yesterday , the rally continued on Wall Street , with the Dow up 103 points .
Oil rose too .
It is trading at $ 65 a barrel this morning .
And look at gold – the old yellow metal is at $ 963 and still going up .
Does this mean the feds are winning the war ?
“ Signs of life return to California market , ” says the Financial Times .
Houses in many areas are selling for 60 % less than they did two years ago .
Two years ago , the average family could n’t come close to buying the average house .
In did n’t take a genius to figure out that that could n’t last .
Who were they going to sell the average house to if not to the average family ?
Well , now the $ 600,000 dump from ’07 has been foreclosed and is now on sale for $ 200,000 .
That means that the average family that still has a job can buy it .
And it does n’t hurt that the feds make it easier – distorting the market with an $ 8,000 tax credit and EZ financing from the FHA .
Wait a minute !
Was n’t it easy financing that got us into this mess ?
Of course it was .
But that little insight does n’t stop the feds .
They ’re convinced that if they can just put out enough new credit , it will somehow make the problems caused by having too much credit before go away .
So here ’s the deal .
You can get the FHA to finance a house , long - term , at just 4.9 % .
That ’s just 0.3 % higher than the long - term Treasury yield .
Even without opening the closet door , we smell a rat .
How can lenders expect to make any money – after delinquencies , defaults , foreclosures , resales …to say nothing of legal and administrative work – on a 0.3 % margin ?
And that ’s assuming their cost of money is the same as the feds ’ cost – the long term T - bond rate .
Maybe they should read the paper .
John Authers , writing in the Financial Times :
“ The latest US mortgage delinquency figures are horrendous , with more than 6 % of prime mortgages in arrears – more than double the long - term norm .
A quarter of sub - prime loans are delinquent . ”
And although one in 6 homeowners is underwater …
“ The peak of foreclosures has yet to come , ’ Harvard historian Niall Ferguson adds .
‘ They will go from 40 percent of all home sales to literally 100 percent by the end of the year . ’ ”
Well , the bankers – as everyone knows – are a lot smarter than we are .
They ’re probably up to the old trick : borrowing short , lending long .
The spread between the long rate and the short rate has never been great .
We explained why yesterday .
The Chinese do n’t trust Tim Geithner to keep his word .
For that matter , neither do we .
They ’ve switched from buying long bonds to buying short bills .
So , the bankers – including those working for the FHA – can borrow very cheaply in the short - term market .
And they can make cheap mortgage loans , long - term .
And then , when the short rates go up … and they need to roll over their short - term loans … they can get in line at the courthouse , behind GM and the parts manufacturers …
… and pick out a gaudy casket too .
Jobless claims eased for the second week in a row .
Hallelujah .
The economy is still unloading jobs , but at least its not dumping them like it was earlier in the year .
Which leads a number of economists to the old refrain : ‘ the worst is behind us . ’
Meanwhile , from Japan comes encouraging news .
The Nippon economy is increasing its industrial output at the fastest pace in 56 years .
And oil is signaling a global rebound , is n’t it ?
“ I do n’t think so , ” says MoneyWeek ’s editor in Paris .
“ There is no increase in oil consumption .
Instead , consumption is still going down .
What we ’re seeing is speculation .
The central banks are adding to the funds available for speculation .
So far , that money is n’t reaching the consumer economy …it ’s mostly in the natural resources market betting on inflation . ”
Everywhere you look , dear reader , is a war zone .
Nothing is safe .
The feds ’ war against deflation does collateral damage to almost everyone and everything .
But you have to give the feds credit .
Raw materials … gold … oil…emerging markets – all have seen big increases .
Major stock markets too are showing big gains .
But the feds ’ plan is not to reflate the asset bubble , but to reflate the economy .
For that , they need rising consumer prices .
Consumers need to borrow …and spend .
They ’ll do so , say economists , when prices rise and their dollars lose value .
So far , milk and potatoes are n’t cooperating .
The price of milk fell so low that farmers slaughtered their herds .
As for potatoes …we do n’t know .
In Europe , inflation has disappeared .
This is the first time the euro zone has ever had flat and falling prices .
In America , too , consumer price inflation is ebbing away .
In other words , the feds may be winning a battle but losing the war !
As usual , there ’s a lot of smoke and fog on this battlefield .
Consumer confidence is rising … but so is unemployment .
The New York Times says US joblessness may soon pass Europe ’s habitually - high rates .
The Chinese are still buying America ’s debt – but only the short - term stuff .
America ’s biggest industrial company goes broke … the government takes a key role in key industries … but investors buy more stocks !
If you look through your binoculars you will have a hard time figuring out who ’s really winning .
In the confusion of the battlefield , even a hardened veteran often fails to tell which way the fight is going .
In fact , you might see rising stock prices and get the wrong idea … like watching the Yankees get chased back to Washington after the first battle of Bull Run ; you might have thought that that was all there was to it .
The war was over and the South had won .
Not quite .
Mike Huckabee is n't happy about the talk that the GOP should be more open to the American people to expand their party by diminishing the views of social conservatives :
In an interview with the California newspaper The Visalia Times - Delta , Huckabee said the GOP would only further decline in influence should it alienate social conservatives — largely considered the most energetic and loyal faction of the party .
" Throw the social conservatives the pro-life , pro-family people overboard and the Republican party will be as irrelevant as the Whigs , " he said in reference to the American political party that largely disbanded in the mid 1800s .
" They 'll basically be a party of gray - haired old men sitting around the country club puffing cigars , sipping brandy and wondering whatever happened to the country .
That will be the end of the party , " he said in the interview published Thursday
What he 's saying is a big problem for Republicans .
To be a more inclusive party they would have to try and entice Latino voters over , but since the extremists want to round up Latinos and are so opposed to anything that will handle our immigration problems , that 's a " no go . "
If they want to appear more moderate in the gay rights arena , then they will alienate the religious - right bloc that has been a significant part of their base for year now , and has enjoyed enormous influence within the GOP ever since Bush took office ( and Rove used them to win in 2004 ) , so that 's a " no go . " .
The Washington Monthly has more :
But Huckabee 's point is n't wrong .
If the religious - right crowd no longer feels welcome or valued in the Republican Party , and the GOP is left with a country - club base , it 's not likely to do well in national elections .
It might as well be " the end of the party . "
On the other hand , if the Republican Party takes the culture warriors seriously , and signals to the rest of the country that the GOP is dominated by far - right activists who are principally concerned with gays , abortion , Terri Schiavo , and state - sponsored religion , the party will remain stuck where it is now .
And that 's not a good place to be .
It 's quite a conundrum .
Good luck to the whole gang .
I would n't write off the Republican Party , folks , because that 's a very dangerous proposition .
They play word games and handle the media better than most , so if they are given an inch they will take a mile .
Here 's the Luntz memo on health care :
GOP wordsmith Frank Luntz has authored a new messaging memo defining the Republican rhetoric on health care reform ( READ FULL MEMO HERE ) .
The memo is titled “ The Language of Health Care 2009 ″ and it lays out the argument for “ stopping the Washington takeover ” of health care . ”
But if fully implemented it may very well stop health care reform :
This document is based on polling results and Instant Response dial sessions conducted in April 2009 .
It captures not just what Americans want to see but exactly what they want to hear .
The Words That Work boxes that follow are already being used by a few Congressional and Senatorial Republicans .
From today forward , they should be used by everyone .
Luntz warns that “ if the dynamic becomes ‘ President Obama is on the side of reform and Republicans are against it , ’ then the battle is lost and every word in this document is useless . ’”
The trouble is , it already is useless .
Because rather than challenging the tenets of American reform proposals , Luntz establishes a straw man argument against a non-existent health plan .
Buried amongst the usual rhetoric about government - run health care is Luntz ’s predictable contradiction : he instructs Republicans to “ be vocally and passionately on the side of REFORM ” but then urges GOP lawmakers to misrepresent and obstruct any real chance of passing comprehensive legislation .
“ Humanize your approach , ” but argue that health care reform “ will result in delayed and potentially even denied treatment , procedures and / or medications . ”
“ Acknowledge the crisis ” but ask your constituents “ would you rather … ‘ pay the costs you pay today for the quality of care you currently receive , ’ OR ‘ Pay less for your care , but potentially have to wait weeks for tests and months for treatments you need . ”
The games have begun and the Democratic Party needs to get with it fast or they will turn Americans against good and effective health - care reform forever .
Since Rush Limbaugh constantly rips any " moderate Republican " and even whips conservatives that he likes if he perceives them straying even slightly , even for a minute -- I 'd say a new party is brewing .
And to me it looks like Newt Gingrich wants to lead the new revolt for Republicans .
I so dub them " The Twigs . "
It 'll be made up of social conservatives , dittoheads and teabaggers .
Kill an Afternoon with the 2009 Nebula Award Winning Shorts
Substituting reference for content in a speculative market is like buying your own products to inflate your sales data !
They gave out this year 's Nebula Awards in Los Angeles this week .
Science fiction can be great , but it is often just so damn flat , predictable , and derivative these days .
The slow convergence between fan fiction and original literature has taken place within this genre much faster than anywhere else , and unless these writers turn off their TVs fast , they are soon going to find themselves out of jobs , or doing nothing but writing merchandising tie - in novels to whatever hour - long drama has spaceships this week .
And then who will the TV writers rip off ?
The story market will crash !
At its worst , bad science fiction reifies troublesome cultural mores and prejudices by showing how these assumptions will persist unaltered and unchallenged into the future , and by not giving the future the breathing space it needs to be goddamn weird , goddamn impossible , and goddamn open to change .
At its best , science fiction can be my favorite thing to read .
Anyway , here are this year 's winners and links to where you can read them for free , if available . #
Best Novella : " The Spacetime Pool , " by Catherine AsaroYou can read it here , at Analog .

This is a story about a mathematician who passes through a time portal into a world where women have no power and where ancient kingdoms are dueling over a prophecy and love and shit .
" A white beach stretched around her , dazzling in the bright day .
Waves crashed a few yards away , and their swells glinted in the slanting rays from the Sun , which was low in the sky .
The ocean stretched to the horizon , wide , blue , and endless .
" What the blazes ? "
Janelle spun around -- in time to see the man appear out of thin air .
He came out of nothing , taking a long , slow step .
His progress was slowed to a surreal speed , and his body flickered as if he were a projection of light .
It could n't be real .
He had to be doing this with mirrors .
Either that , or she had overworked herself in school more than she realized , and her mind was lodging a protest by wigging out .

Credit wands , perberries , technomalls .
This is your traditional science - fiction pastiche : a story about old problems with new words -- in this case harem culture and bond slavery .
This story is a huge , horrible mess -- but parts of it are enjoyable .
A pair of bonded slaves rescue other slaves or convince their benevolent master to buy them out from bad contracts .
The best part is how these alien toads keep their wives in bubbles and give them their favorite foods until they grow immensely fat and horrible to see .
As soon as the slaves " wrinkle , " they are given a parting gift and set free ! #
Best Novel : " Powers , " by Ursula K. Le GuinThis is the third novel in Le Guin 's " Western Shore " series .
Each novel is about a person with terrible gifts who must come to terms with their abilities in order to benefit their communities or escape them .
This one is about Gavir , a slave boy who has the ability to " remember " the future and who wants to be a writer when he grows up .
Reading a book by Le Guin is like climbing a moss - covered hill and then stretching out your hand to curl your fingers around swirling mist and to charge it with a mystical crackle .
The land opens up in a jagged rift at your feet and you kick off your sandals and burrow down inside the ground .
For a day and a night , you wear the soft , spongy earth ( raw life ) like a healing , soothing blanket .
You sleep , and you dream , and the land rises and falls with your long , slow breaths .
At this point , it seems like there is no prize good enough to match her wit , cunning , skill , craft , and artistry at this damned old incubus , fiction .
" Lifetime Achievement " awards are cold and condescending : what can the world give her to show its unrepayable debt ?
This is Le Guin 's sixth Nebula award .
Instead of a statue and some cash , she deserves her own planet teeming with emotional protoplasm where she may shape a new soul for a world that needs healing .
After the apocalypse , I nominate her Collected Works as our new Holy Book .
You can't read " Powers " for free .
I recommend you buy " Powers " along with the rest of her " Western Shore " books , read them , and then pass them along to your local junior high .
This is the third article investigating the possibility of a spike in natural gas prices during early 2010 .
In this article we look at the scenarios Chesapeake has created based on the how low the drilling rig count goes ( shown in Figure 1 ) .
And we dig a bit into the other factors that could increase or decrease demand for natural gas .
" The fix is underway " says Chesapeake Energy in their April Investor Presentation .
What they mean is that natural gas prices are going back up this winter .
The number of rigs drilling for natural gas is going down .
Fewer rigs means fewer new wells and eventually less natural gas and higher prices for consumers .
Quick Summary
As a kindness to those who are busy planting tomatoes and just want to know if they should order wood pellets for next winter , here is the quick version :
The number of rigs has already fallen enough to cause natural gas prices to rise next winter :
" CHK sees U.S. natural gas prices at Henry Hub averaging $ 4 - 6 / mmcf in 2009 and $ 7 - 9 in 2010 and beyond "
We do n't yet know if drilling will be cut back enough to cause a spike into a higher $ 12 - $ 13 mmcf range ( like prices did in 2005 after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita ) .
The Spike - Dip - Spike Pattern
The last 10 years have shown a repeating pattern of natural gas price spikes and dips ( covered in more detail in Anatomy of a Natural Gas Price Spike ) .
The reason for this repeating cycle is that price dips cause reductions in the number of wells drilled .
Those reductions cut the flow of natural gas until a shortage develops .
Prices then spike as consumers compete for too little natural gas .
High prices cause users to cut back on natural gas purchases and encourage more wells to be drilled .
Eventually these cause an excess of natural gas and prices fall into another dip , setting up the next spike and repeating the pattern .
We are currently experiencing a dip after the 2008 price spike .
( Just past arrow 5 in Figure 2 ) .
The current well head price for natural gas is far below the average producing cost , meaning that most natural gas producers cannot make a profit at these natural gas prices , and for this reason they are drastically cutting back the number of drilling rigs .
Balancing the Market
The question is how many rigs must be cut back to balance the market ?
And what further cut in rig numbers would cause a price spike ?
Chesapeake put together some scenarios and published them in their March and April 2009 Investor Presentations .
They lay out their logic for calculating the balance point :
2008 U.S. gas production YOY increase of ~ 7 % , or ~ 4 bcf / day
2008 natural gas rig count averaged ~ 1,500 rigs - this overcame first year depletion of ~ 25 % and generated growth of ~ 7 % , for a combined ~ 32 % addition rate
If natural gas rig count went to zero , then all would agree this ~ 32 % number would also become zero
So , if natural gas rig count goes down by 50 % in 2009 , CHK believes industry will lose nearly 40 % of this ~ 32 % production capacity increase , through which ~ 7 % growth disappears and ~ 7 % production declines appear by 2010 .
So , YOY growth of ~ 4 bcf / day in 2008 will soon give way to a decrease of ~ 4 bcf / day , setting up a big price rebound in 2010 and 2011 if U.S. economy does not materially weaken from here
A 50 % decline in rigs only causes a 40 % decline in new adds .
So they are factoring in that the most productive wells survive the price dip and the least economic wells do not .
Figure 4 shows that if the rig count drops to 750 ( CHK 's most likely case ) that Chesapeake estimates that production will fall to 53 bcf /d .
Here I have added a red bar that allows easy comparison of when supply has fallen to or below 53 bcf /d in the last 8 years .
Current US Rig Count
A chart of price spikes has been provided as Figure 2 .
The dip below the red bar in 2002 caused the price spike in 2003 .
But the dip in 2004 did not cause a spike , but the deep fall in 2005 did ( that was Hurricanes Katrina and Rita ) .
Baker Hughes reported the gas directed rig count was 760 on April 17 , down 30 from the prior week .
Johnson and Rice
Co pointed out that the most productive rigs are shale gas rigs ( discussed in Natural Gas Supply and Demand Balance ) .
Those are mostly horizontal rigs , and Baker Hughes reports that the number of horizontals dropped by 11 .
Where will the rig count end up ?
The last week showed a drop of 30 gas intent rigs .
Does this mean that we are no where near bottom yet ?
Smith Bits also keeps rig counts and they track how many rigs are setting up or tearing down .
The totals for this week were 38 gas rigs setting up and 56 tearing down .
We can expect the rig count to continue falling .
If those rigs do come down next week then we will have passed the 750 rig balancing point for the market and prices should recover early 2010 , assuming Chesapeake 's assumptions are correct .
There are contributing factors , and we look at several of them next .
Contributing Factors
Johnson and Rice Co provided a list of additional factors that will adjust the supply / demand balance :
We are going to take a look at the steepened decline curve , the industrial demand drop , and add to this list : curtailments of current production .
US Decline Rate
Chesapeake provided Figure 6 on US Natural Gas Decline Rates using data from IHS Energy .
It shows that the current underlying decline rate in 2008 was ~ 24.5 % and the first year decline rate was 44.1 % .
What is fascinating about this chart is that while both base decline and first year decline tend to bounce around , they both trend slightly down in value .
Is this the data that CERA is using as the basis of their claim that unconventional gas lowers decline rates ?
From the CERA Press Release : " Technology Drives North American Gas Renaissance : "
" Given the increased productivity of unconventional wells , the study concludes that it is not necessary to increase drilling activity to maintain - or increase - production .
After years of developing unconventional gas with its long - lived production , in the aggregate , the average decline rate will fall .
This means , the study says , that a smaller quantity of new production is required to offset natural production declines . "
This is in direct contradiction of JRCO which has said " We believe that the aggregate U.S. decline rate has increased from 28 % in 2006 to 31 % in 2009 . "
I must admit it is very hard to understand how unconventional wells with a first year decline rate of 60 % or greater can push the national decline rate lower .
Figure 7 shows an earlier analysis by EOG Energy using IHS data .
That analysis agrees with JRCO and projected a slowly increasing US decline rate .
Thank you to Seeking Alpha for Figure 7
One possible explanation is that the sheer number of new wells drilled has created a low decline rate cushion .
You can see from Figure 8 that wells begin with a high decline level and slowly fall to a lower and lower rate over time ( producing less and less gas however ) .
The national decline rate should end up somewhere between the first and last decline rate values .
Unfortunately , I do n't have the IHS database and we cannot investigate the basis of CERA 's claim further .
In any case , if these more pessimistic estimates of the base decline rate are correct , then a drop to 750 drilling rigs will over correct the market into a supply shortage .
Industrial Demand
With GM declaring bankruptcy and many other manufacturers shutting down , it is critical to include some estimate of the falling demand for natural gas in the industrial sector .
JRCO found that industrial utilization and natural gas usage were tightly correlated and that historically a 1 % drop in industrial utilization caused a 1 % drop in industrial natural gas demand .
JRCO provided Figure 9 showing GDP and Industrial Utilization .
I updated the chart with the April 15th Federal Reserve Statistical Release on Industrial Production and Capacity .
Industrial Capacity has fallen to 69.3 % , which is a new historical low since data collection began in 1948 and 11.7 percent since first quarter 2008 .
JRCO provided 18.2 bdf/d as the Industrial natural gas demand at the start of the recession .
They project a total 15 % drop in industrial utilization during this recession for a total natural gas demand reduction of 18.2 * 0.15 = 2.7 bcf /d
JRCO also offered the very interesting Figure 10 on the history of Industrial Utilization .
JRCO makes the point that some lost industrial capacity ( and thus natural gas demand ) will be gone forever .
What I find interesting is how long it takes for industrial capacity to climb back after a recession .
It took the whole decade of the 80's to recover from the Iranian Revolution and Iran - Iraq war .
James Hamilton made the argument that the 2008 oil price spike was enough to cause the current recession .
Counter arguments have been stated that if the oil prices caused the recession , why did n't demand spring back after prices fell ?
I think it is clear from this Industrial Capacity History chart that it takes a long time for demand to recover .
Curtailed Production
Another factor which could cut short a price spike is that gas companies may have wells they have shut in and are not producing .
They will turns these wells on as prices rise allowing a rapid flood of natural gas to enter the market much faster than an increase in drilling could respond .
Here is a statement from a Chesapeake Energy press release :
OKLAHOMA CITY --( BUSINESS WIRE ) -- Apr. 16 , 2009 -- Chesapeake Energy Corporation ( NYSE : CHK ) today announced it has elected to curtail approximately 400 million cubic feet ( mmcf ) per day of its gross natural gas production due to continued low wellhead prices .
The reduction includes the 200 mmcf per day curtailment of natural gas production previously announced on March 2 , 2009 .
Oil Drum posters have been skeptical about how much production has really been shut in , given the cash flow needs of these companies .
However , assuming the production has been shut in and other natural gas companies have followed suite , then there could be a bcf / d or more of natural gas production waiting to turn back on for high oil prices .
It is also likely that if storage reaches capacity there will be no choice but to shut in some production .
Such a development would be welcomed by consumers , as it would moderate any chance of a price spike even if the fall in rig count over corrects the market .
EIA Short Term Outlook
The EIA short term outlook predicts a modest price recovery in 2010 .
They do not see a large shortfall developing due to a drop in drilling .
Total consumption of natural gas is projected to fall by nearly 2 percent in 2009 , leading to lower natural gas prices .
Industrial natural gas consumption is expected to decline by more than 7 percent , as industrial production declines during the current economic downturn .
However , natural gas consumption in the electric power sector is projected to increase by almost 1 percent , since the lower natural gas prices will back out some coal consumption in this sector .
The Henry Hub natural gas spot price is projected to decline from an average of $ 9.13 per thousand cubic feet ( Mcf ) in 2008 to $ 4.24 per Mcf in 2009 , then increase in 2010 to an average of more than $ 5.80 per Mcf .
The 1 % increase in electrical generation demand for gas is about 0.17 bcf/d , which is not tiny but should be small compared to the other larger factors .
More importantly , the EIA expects the U.S. to enter the winter will storage at maximum capacity .
This will help smooth out any production shortfalls .
Conclusion
The drilling rig count has fallen to the point where the market should balance in early 2010 , if Chesapeake 's assumptions are correct .
If a further drop in the rig count happens or if the decline rate is faster than assumed , then production will fall well below demand .
Shortfalls in supply will be moderated because of a continuing decline in the industrial sector that will be slow to recover and because storage is currently high ( and possible shut in production coming back into production as prices rise ) .
North Korea 's military celebrated the controversial nuclear and missile tests North Korea says it has abandoned the truce that ended the Korean war , amid rising tension in the region .
It blamed its decision on South Korea joining a US - led initiative to search ships for nuclear weapons .
It said the South 's actions were a " declaration of war " , and pledged to attack if its ships were stopped .
The move is part of an increasingly hard line being taken by North Korea , and comes two days after it conducted an underground nuclear test .
Meanwhile , South Korean news reports say that steam has been seen coming from a plant at the North 's main nuclear facility , a sign that it has made good on its threat to restart efforts to make weapons - grade plutonium .
The United Nations Security Council is working on a strong resolution condemning North Korea 's actions , including possible punitive measures .
Anti-proliferation
In a statement to the North 's official news agency , KCNA , the military warned that it no longer considered itself bound by the terms of a truce which ended the war between the two Koreas .
That agreement has preserved a tense peace for more than five decades .

Reaction from around the region Media condemn nuclear test The Korean war N Korea 's missile programme
The immediate cause of North Korea 's actions , it said , was South Korea 's announcement on Tuesday that it would definitely join the Proliferation Security Initiative ( PSI ) - a US - led campaign to search ships carrying suspicious cargoes to prevent trafficking of weapons of mass destruction .
Joining the PSI " is a natural obligation " , South Korean Foreign Minister Yu Myung - hwan told reporters .
" It will help control North Korea 's development of dangerous material . "
But North Korea 's response has been unequivocal .
" Any hostile act against our peaceful vessels , including search and seizure , will be considered an unpardonable infringement on our sovereignty , " a spokesman for the North 's army told KCNA .
" We will immediately respond with a powerful military strike . "
Tensions have already risen significantly across the Korean peninsula in recent weeks .
Provocation Last month North Korea launched a long - range rocket over Japanese airspace , angering the international community .
Pyongyang said the rocket carried a satellite , but several nations viewed it as cover for a missile test .

The UN Security Council condemned the rocket launch , and in retaliation North Korea announced it was quitting long - running six-nation negotiations on its nuclear disarmament .
It also said it would reopen its main nuclear plant at Yongbyon , which was closed in July 2007 as part of a disarmament deal .
According to South Korean media reports , the plant may now be reactivated , as spy satellites have seen steam coming out of it .
On Monday North Korea increased tensions still further , by conducting a powerful underground nuclear test .
It has also fired six short - range missiles in recent days .

Q&A : North Korea nuclear test
What is N Korea 's game plan ?
Diplomats from the five permanent Security Council member countries - plus Japan and South Korea - have been meeting behind closed doors to discuss a new resolution against North Korea .
Washington is calling for a quick and unified response that will make it clear to Pyongyang that there are consequences for its actions .
But US State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said the door was still open to resume long - running six - party talks and that the US was looking at a " whole range of options " .
" We are thinking through complicated issues that require very careful consideration , " said the US ambassador to the UN , Susan Rice .
While the US and Japan are likely to favour a hard line against North Korea , Russia and China are more wary about pushing Pyongyang too far , analysts say .
A few years ago there was real hope of reaching a settlement , when North Korea agreed in February 2007 to abandon its nuclear ambitions in return for aid and diplomatic concessions .
But the negotiations stalled as it accused its negotiating partners - the US , South Korea , Japan , China and Russia - of failing to meet agreed obligations .

Tests were ordered to determine if the animal was rabid .
It was n't clear how seriously the victims had been wounded .
Cottonwood police say the animal attacked Monday when it scratched a woman who thought she had hit it with her car .
Then police got a report of a bobcat acting aggressively toward a woman outside a Pizza Hut .
Later came the call from the bar that a bobcat was inside as patrons climbed atop bar stools to get away .

These are the first reported cases in the Middle East Israel has confirmed its second case of swine flu , in a 47 - year - old man who recently returned from Mexico .
The man is in Meir hospital in the town of Kfar Saba , where he presented complaining of a sore throat .
Tests earlier also showed a young man recently returned from Mexico had contracted the virus .
He is in Laniado hospital in Netanya .
In Mexico , 152 people are thought to have died from the disease , but so far there have been no deaths elsewhere .
Both the infected men in Israel are in quarantine and are expected to make a full recovery - as most sufferers around the world have , except in the case of Mexico .
SWINE FLU
Swine flu is a respiratory disease thought to spread through coughing and sneezing Symptoms mimic those of normal flu Good hygiene like using a tissue and washing hands thoroughly can help reduce transmission
Q&A : What is swine flu ?
These two diagnoses are believed to mark the first confirmed cases of swine flu in the Middle East .
The World Health Organization has warned it has " pandemic " potential .
The second man has not yet been named but the first is 26 - year - old Tomer Vagim , who complained of flu symptoms after returning from Mexico on Friday .
A relative of his is also under observation , hospital officials said .
One Monday , Israel 's deputy Health Minister Yakov Litzman , who belongs to an ultra-Orthodox Jewish sect , said the outbreak should be renamed " Mexican flu " in deference to Jewish and Muslim sensitivities over pork .
Swine flu is a respiratory disease , caused by influenza type A which infects pigs .
There are many types , and the infection is constantly changing .
Until now it has not normally infected humans , but the latest form clearly does , and can be spread from person to person - probably through coughing and sneezing .

So your skates fit your feet just fine , but your heels or your ankles slip , and you 're tired of feeling like you 're slopping around in your boots ?
Here 's a wildly ingenious and wonderfully cheap solution from Dr. Hell , of Canberra Roller Derby League , using beer koozies .
Seriously .
Dr. Hell says " Aside from the fact that it is far superior in tastiness and flavour than wine , if it were n't for beer and my large collection of stubbie holders , I would still have slippy ankles in my 125s .
I 'd tried extra thick socks , heel cups , ankle braces , I 'd sewn a pair of neoprene booties but to no avail .
I was seriously considering a pair of Bonts for the mouldable - ness , but found a $ 4 solution .
I got two 4 mm neoprene bottle holders at the bargain store , cut along the side seam , and then undid the seam around half of the bottom so I had a base circle of neoprene , with two flaps of neoprene coming off it .
A perfect heel cup and protection from diggy counters and sharp boot edges . "
I know what you 're thinking .
How can I too , harness the goodness of my favorite beverage to make my skates fit better ?
Enter Hot Lips Cruelihan , of Sydney Roller Derby League , with an awesome pictorial tutorial of Dr. Hell 's beer koozie method .
So easy even a ref could do it .
Peep the deets .
Ingredients : Humorous beer koozies ( assorted ) ; scissors .
Step 1 : Cut down side seam ( or for bottle holders , along each side of the zipper ) .
Step 2 : Unpick or cut around base of stubby holder .
Mine were glued under the stitching , so I wound up just cutting them .
Step 3 : Voila - one heel cup .
The vertical neoprene is attached around half the circumference of the base .
The flaps just fly free .
Step 4 : Insert into back of skate .
I 've put this one in inside out , cos the colour makes it easier to see , but it makes a little lump at the base of the heel .
This may or may not matter to you - I 'm putting an insole over the top which covers that edge .
Action shot !
Not pictured : Step 5 : Trim to not look stupid .
There you have it .
Custom made heel cups on the cheap .
The bad news is that they might inspire a hankerin ' for a cold one every time you put your skates on , but the good news is that they do n't break WFTDA rule 9.4.2 .
Could it be the beer that 's making these Aussies so smart ?
Maybe I should start drinking Foster 's ...

CAMBRIDGE , Mass. , March 20 - In a move aimed at broadening access to MIT 's research and scholarship , faculty at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have voted to make their scholarly articles available to the public for free and open access on the Web .
The new policy , which was approved unanimously at an MIT faculty meeting on Wednesday , March 18 and took immediate effect , emphasizes MIT 's commitment to disseminating the fruits of its research and scholarship as widely as possible .
" The vote is a signal to the world that we speak in a unified voice ; that what we value is the free flow of ideas , " said Bish Sinyal , chair of the MIT Faculty and the Ford International Professor of Urban Development and Planning .
Under the new policy , faculty authors give MIT nonexclusive permission to disseminate their journal articles for open access through DSpace , an open - source software platform developed by the MIT Libraries and Hewlett Packard and launched in 2002 .
The policy gives MIT and its faculty the right to use and share the articles for any purpose other than to make a profit .
Authors may opt out on a paper - by - paper basis .
MIT 's policy is the first faculty - driven , university - wide initiative of its kind in the United States .
While Harvard and Stanford universities have implemented open access mandates at some of their schools , MIT is the first to fully implement the policy university - wide as a result of a faculty vote .
MIT 's resolution is built on similar language adopted by the Harvard Faculty of Arts & Sciences in 2008 .
" Scholarly publishing has so far been based purely on contracts between publishers and individual faculty authors , " said Hal Abelson , the Class of 1922 Prof. of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science and chair of the Ad- Hoc Faculty Committee on Open Access Publishing .
" In that system , faculty members and their institutions are powerless .
This resolution changes that by creating a role in the publishing process for the faculty as a whole , not just as isolated individuals . "
In the current scholarly publishing system , individual authors are required to transfer all or most of their rights to the publisher .
Typically publishers will strictly limit access to the work through licensing and charge increasingly high subscription rates back to universities to access the articles .
University libraries have faced subscription rates rising at a rate far outpacing inflation .
The MIT Libraries , for example , spend more than three times as much on journal subscriptions today than they did in 1986 .
" Through this action , MIT faculty have shown great leadership in the promotion of free and open scholarly communication , " said MIT Director of Libraries Ann Wolpert , who worked closely with Abelson and others to move the resolution forward .
Â
" In the quest for higher profits , publishers have lost sight of the values of the academy .
This will allow authors to advance research and education by making their research available to the world . "
MIT has long focused on projects and initiatives that encourage the open sharing of knowledge , with the goal of advancing learning and education worldwide .
MIT's DSpace repository contains the digital research materials of MIT faculty and researchers and allows them to be saved , searched and shared worldwide .
MIT OpenCourseWare ( OCW ) was launched in 2001 with the goal of making all MIT course materials available , free of charge , to anyone over the World Wide Web .
Since then , OCW has shared MIT course materials with more than 50 million visitors worldwide and inspired hundreds of other universities to do the same .
The new open access resolution will now remove barriers to making all of MIT 's research openly available to the world .
A faculty committee will work with the MIT Libraries to oversee implementation and determine a workflow for adding articles to DSpace .
Under the new open access model , potentially thousands of papers published by MIT faculty each year will be added to DSpace and made freely available on the web and accessible through search engines such as Google .
Barack Obama today released four top secret memos that allowed the CIA under the Bush administration to torture al - Qaida and other suspects held at Guantánamo and secret detention centres round the world .
But , in an accompanying statement , Obama ruled out prosecutions against those who had been involved .
It is a " time for reflection , not retribution , " he said .
The memos provide an insight into the techniques used by the CIA and the legal basis on which the Bush administration gave the go - ahead .
In the first of the memos , dated 1 August 2002 , the justice department gave the go - ahead to John Rizzo , then acting general counsel to the CIA , for operatives to move to the " increased pressure phase " in interrogating an al - Qaida suspect .
Ten techniques are approved , listed as : attention grasp , walling ( in which the suspect could be pushed into a wall ) , a facial hold , a facial slap , cramped confinement , wall standing , sleep deprivation , insects placed in a confinement box ( the suspect had a fear of insects ) and the waterboard .
In the latter , " the individual is bound securely to an inclined bench , which is approximately four feet by seven feet .
The individual 's feet are generally elevated .
A cloth is placed over the forehead and eyes .
Water is then applied to the cloth in a controlled manner ........ produces the perception of ' suffocation and incipient panic ' . "
' Walling ' involved use of a plastic neck collar to slam suspects into a specially - built wall that the CIA said made the impact sound worse than it actually was .
Other methods include food deprivation .
The techniques were applied to at least 14 suspects .
The Bush administration , in particular former vice - president Dick Cheney , claimed that waterboarding did not amount to torture but the Obama adminstration has ruled that it is .
Obama ordered the closure of Guantánamo and the CIA secret detention sites abroad .
In spite of that , civil rights organisations have been disappointed by a series of rulings by the Obama administration that have protected a lot of material relating to Guantánamo and the sites abroad .
The release of the memos today reversed that trend , though there will be unhappiness over the immunity from prosecution .
Obama , in a statement from the White House , said : " In releasing these memos , it is our intention to assure those who carrying out their duties relying in good faith upon the legal advice from the department of justice that they will not be subject to prosecution . "
Anthony Romero , the ACLU executive director , said : " President Obama 's assertion that there should not be prosecutions of government officials who may have committed crimes before a thorough investigation has been carried out is simply untenable . "
The ACLU described the legal basis for torture as spurious .
Echoing the president , the attorney - general , Eric Holder , reiterated that there would be no prosecution of CIA operatives working within the guidelines set by the Bush administration .
"
It would be unfair to prosecute dedicated men and women working to protect America for conduct that was sanctioned in advance by the justice department , " Holder said .
The director of the CIA , Leon Panetta , told CIA employees that " this is not the end of the road on these issues " , apparently in expectation of Congressional inquiries and court actions abroad .
He promised legal and financial help for any CIA employees who faced such action .
In Spain , the chances of court action against six senior Bush administration members over the torture receded today after a ruling by the attorney - general , Candido Conde - Pumpido .
He said that any such action should be heard in a US court rather than a Spanish one , and that he would not allow Spain 's legal system to be used as a plaything for political ends .
" If there is a reason to file a complaint against these people , it should be done before local courts with jurisdiction , in other words in the United States , " he told reporters .
Spanish human rights lawyers last month asked Judge Baltasar Garzón , who indicted the former Chilean president Augusto Pinochet in 1998 , to consider filing charges against the former US attorney - general , Alberto Gonzales , and five others .
The Non Farm Payroll report released this morning announced the US Economy has lost another 663,000 jobs in the past month .
The data was in line with analystÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s expectations .
The Jobless rate is now 8.5 % , the highest in 25 years as more employers laid off workers due to worsening economic conditions .
Economic Indicators
JanuaryÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s figures were revised with an earlier reported 655,000 but now standing at 741,000 lost jobs ( a revision of 86,000 jobs ) .
FebruaryÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s numbers remained unchanged .
The number of employers considering layoffs has not decreased and as more companies announce further restructuring the harder it will be for the US economy to bounce back .
Ã‚Â Ã‚Â
The expectation for President ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Stimulus Plan is high as he has specifically targeted American jobs as a priority .

Ramallah is tired .
The feeling you get walking around the streets here is that the Palestinians are weary of the struggle against the incremental destruction of their homeland , happening right now while the world looks the other way .
You hear things like , " Our struggle has been long and it has got us nowhere " .
And people ask how the world can stand by while the Israelis annex more land .
It 's a good question .
In one village the flame of non-violent resistance still burns .
Last week , we went to the weekly demonstration against the annexation wall in Bil'in , where it cuts deep into the farmland of this old Palestinian village and the Green Line ( the internationally recognised border of Israel - Palestine ) .
Since Israel started building the wall here in 2005 ( stealing about 60 % of the village 's land ) the people of Bil 'in have been inventively and non-violently resisting .
While helplessness pervades in occupied Palestine , the successful tactics of the people of Bil 'in provide some hope and inspiration .
Abdullah al - Rahman , head of the Popular Resistance Committee in Bil'in , described the various tactics the villagers have used to stall the erection of a new settlement ( called " West Mattiyahu " in Israeli legalese , which tries to say it is merely a " neighbourhood " of an existing settlement ) .
First , to oppose the wall , Bil 'in 's residents tied themselves to their olive trees to stop the bulldozers razing their land .
Then , in sight of the settlements , they constructed a one - room house overnight on the other side of the wall , a building that became the basis for a legal challenge .
The high court slapped down their petition twice before they and their Israeli lawyer , Michael Sfard , realised Israel had made a mistake under its own unfair rules .
Generally the Israelis use two excuses for land grabs : one , the land is uncultivated , and two , that there is a security threat .
With Bil 'in they 've tried both .
To maintain the interest of the media , essential to their demonstrations ' success , the Popular Committee brings out new initiatives every Friday in its non-violent struggle .
Last month at the height of the swine flu hysteria , the Bil 'in residents went down for the demonstration wearing flu masks to say that they had all had occupation influenza for decades .
When we went on Friday they had a slightly less subtle but equally creative tactic of filling balloons with chicken faeces to chuck at the soldiers .
While the Bil 'in residents maintain their adherence to nonviolence , the same can't be said for the IDF .
Last month a beloved activist from the village , Bassem Ibrahim Abu Rammah , was killed by a high - velocity tear - gas canister , and one 16 - year - old child we spoke to survived a live round to the head .
These are definitely not " mistakes " , when you shoot a high - velocity tear - gas canister horizontally and not up in the air you only have one goal .
They managed to murder Bassem with a shot to the heart .
This is where the chicken faeces idea came from .
" They shoot bullets at us , so we will respond with our animals faeces , " said al - Rahman .
At the demonstration hundreds of tear gas canisters were shot at us , and rubber bullets aimed at the children throwing stones .
This Israeli tactic of harsh and violent repression has one goal : to stop Palestinian resistance through instilling fear .
This is what happened during the second intifada , and it is happening again now as pockets of resistance are starting to form against the annexation of their land .
And it works .
We asked our Palestinian friend if she wanted to come with us on Friday .
" No , " she replied , " I do n't want to die for nothing . "
In recent months , since the Gaza War , the IDF have started using a new cocktail of weapons against the Bil 'in demonstrators , which include stronger military - grade tear gas with nerve toxins , high - velocity machinegun - style tear gas , and aluminium bullets that have crippled protesters .
The IDF has also made it a tactic to come into the village in the middle of the night and arrest the members of the Popular Committee , and children as young as 13 , as well as throwing sound bombs and tear gas around .
According to a farmer from Bil'in , Farhan Burnat , 30 , who spent eight months in prison after Israeli soldiers arrested him at a Friday demonstration , the Israelis take the kids to prison in Israel and will keep them for four to six months as punishment for participating in the demonstration .
" In Ofer prison about 25 % of the prisoners are children , " he said .
" These lengthy periods of imprisonment severely stunt the educational development of our children . "
We went down to the wall the day before the protest and talked to Wahid Salaman , a 44 - year - old farmer from Bil 'in who was walking home after work .
" The ability of us to get to our land depends on the mood of the soldier , " he said .
" Sometimes we have to wait for five or six hours to get to our fields . "
Salaman 's land is on the wrong side of the wall so he has to go through a checkpoint every day to go to work .
He pointed out a huge pole with a CCTV camera on top of it .
" They watch us at all times as well , " he said .
The Israelis assign each farmer a number corresponding to points on the wall where he is allowed to go about his work .
Afterwards we spotted a young boy going through the checkpoint with his herd of goats .
" I look after the goats after school for my parents , " he said .
" The wall took 60 % of our land , and as punishment for the demonstration we 're not allowed to work on Fridays . "
He says that his goats have been injured by the barbed wire around the wall .
Like everyone in Bil'in , he says he misses his friend Bassem .
" I feel very sad , " he said , " but it will not stop me from doing the demonstration .
We 're strong enough to continue to do it , they shot Bassem because we are achieving something here . "
The brutal behavior of the IDF at the demonstration has motivated a broad contingent of activists from around the world and Israel to descend on Bil 'in every Friday – as they know the IDF will be less inclined to murder at will if they have passports belonging to countries that sell them the guns .
When we were there on Friday there was a 15 - strong contingent of trade unionists , artists and charity workers from Canada , alongside a group of young Israelis .
The IDF 's explicit policy is not to fire live ammunition when Israelis or internationals are in the area , which gives you an indication of their attitude to the expendability of Palestinian life .
It also makes it clear how vital it is that the brigade of internationals and Israelis continue to show up and protest peacefully alongside Palestinians .
At a bleak time for Palestinians , when they are watching the live destruction of any hopes of a viable future state , the heroic and successful resistance of the people of Bil'in ( and their analogues along the line of the annexation wall ) provide a glimmer of hope , and a template of how to fight this epic injustice with a mixture of consistency , courage and creativity .
Still the defining figure of the Republican Party
minds
Though Tedisco led by more than 20 points in an initial survey and was running in a district with a 70,000 - person Republican registration advantage , Murphy strategists were able to label Tedisco as a career politician .
Meanwhile , Tedisco 's chosen line of attack -- that Murphy supported the economic stimulus package along with a provision that allowed executives at AIG to receive millions of dollars in bonuses -- fell flat .
Republicans point proudly to their ability to close ranks , noting that only three Senate Republicans backed the $ 787 billion economic stimulus measure ( though they provided the crucial margin of victory ) while not a single Republican voted for budgets approved by the House and Senate .
They rightfully note that they have so far held the line against a measure that would ease union organizing in the workplace .
They say they are reconnecting with their core voters by emphasizing what they see as profligate Democratic spending .
And they say they are laying the groundwork for a comeback by putting themselves solidly on the right side of multiple issues in preparation for the public souring on the Democratic agenda on spending , health care , energy , etc .
Reid Wilson , at yesterday's , put forth the proposition that the GOP has learned a lesson and sees a silver lining in their latest electoral catastrophe ( NY - 20 ) .
No doubt everyone Inside - the - Beltway who saw the headline must have thought it was an announcement of Michael Steele 's impending resignation as chair of the RNC .
But , instead , Republican sources tried feeding Wilson a hilarious dose of Republican Party spin : " This race tended to be more of businessman versus politician , " said one GOP strategist close to Tedisco 's campaign when asked to offer a postmortem .
" Fresh face [ versus ] guy who 's been around for a while . "
Yes , they think it was that voters want more inexperienced businessmen instead of well - known and experienced politicians -- that and the fact that they forgot to put together an effective absentee voting outreach strategy .
Is n't that a convenient way of looking at the fact that voters hate obstructionists and hate Republicans ?
Do you think it ever crossed theirmind that voters are concerned about theof the political experience , not just if someone has been in politics forever or not ?
Wilson did n't let that go by without a response .
The Repugs also claim that to even cometo a tie outside the old slave - holding states that seceded from the Union is a mindboggling accomplishment considering what they 're offering voters .
Right - wing activists in the district claim Tedisco was n't extremist enough and should have tried to capitalize on the teabagger mentality ; that would have probably have resulted in a 60 % win for Murphy instead of the 50/50 split .
Steele and the equally clueless head of the NRCC , Pete Sessions , claim they see this defeat as " real progress " ( for Republicans ) .
" The Republican Party must be competitive in districts like NY - 20 if we are going to regain our Congressional majorities , " Steele said in a statement released Friday .
" While we were unsuccessful in this race , the combined efforts of our candidate , the national and state parties and NRCC show that the GOP is going to invest the resources necessary to regain our majority in the U.S. House of Representatives . "
Carl Hulse in yesterday ' slooked at the Republicans ' dilemma from another perspective , the problem they 've begun encountering as the public comes to see them as the Party of No .
They have no effective strategy , no message , no messenger ( unless you want to count messengers that normal Americans say they absolutely hate , like Limbaugh , Coulter , Cheney , Newt Gingrich , Palin . )
They 're actually driven towards trying to figure out how to incorporate a ditzy and appropriately ignorant Miss California into their messaging initiative !
And what do they brag about ?
Unifying to stop change and holding onto the Bush policies that the country overwhelmingly rejects :
But not everyone in the country -- in fact , outside of Congress , almost no one in the country -- gets a piece of the $ 312,657,650 in bribes insurance companies have doled out since 1990 ( 63 % to Republicans ) and the $ 823,948,241 in bribes from the so - called " health " industry ( 57 % for Republicans since 1990 ) .
Yes , something tells me that a revolt against universal health care , similar to what corrupt and hypocritical members of Congress get , is probably not something the GOP should be counting on to sweep them back into power .
Some observers claim that the reason the Republicans are so frantic to stop the passage of effective universal health care -- and the reason they will stop at nothing to sabotage it -- is because if Obama succeeds in implementing it , it will relegate the Republican Party to the peanut gallery , at least nationally , for at least three decades .
Hulse points out that " while Republicans were effective in banding together against the stimulus and the budget , they have splintered elsewhere , most embarrassingly on a now - defunct Democratic House plan to levy a huge tax on executive bonuses .
After Mr. Boehner , the Ohio Republican and House leader , heaped scorn on the plan , Republicans still split down the middle as dozens backed it out of fear of the political consequences of opposing a tax on executives cashing in on an economic crisis that they caused . "
He adds that the GOP defeat in NY - 20 was " the ultimate reality check " and that " Republicans had the more experienced candidate and went at the contest hard , only to come up short .
It is likely to haunt the party and potentially depress candidate recruitment and fundraising . "

Around midnight on November 5 , 1999 , Erik Ramsey was in the passenger seat of a friend ’s Camaro as they returned home from a movie on a dark , two - lane Georgia highway .
They did n’t see the minivan making a U - turn until it was too late .
The Camaro slammed into the minivan ’s right front fender , flipped , and landed on an embankment .
Firefighters needed the Jaws of Life to cut Ramsey free of the wreck .
He was screaming and writhing in pain when his father , Eddie , got to the emergency room .
It took fifteen hours of surgery to repair a collapsed lung , a lacerated spleen , a ruptured diaphragm , ripped tendons in his hand , and a femur that was broken in two places .
Erik woke up in intensive care , but he did n’t speak , ask for pain medication , or respond to the doctors , his father , or his mother , Sandra .
Tests later revealed that a blood clot had caused a brain - stem stroke that cut the connection between his mind and his body .
After a few weeks , the Ramseys took their son home , and with the help of a home health aide , began the daily routine of feeding him through a tube , bathing him , moving his limbs through range - of - motion exercises , keeping his eyes moist with drops , and clearing his lungs with a nebulizer .
Soon , he learned to use his eyes to select from a letter board that his father designed , spelling out requests for movies ( anything with vampires or other bloodthirsty creatures ) and music ( Ozzy Osbourne is a favorite ) .
He ’d occasionally play small pranks by spelling titles that did n’t exist .
And when these tricks were discovered , Erik ’s father recalls , “ he would just die laughing , ” an involuntary , spasm - like response that he still has when something amuses or excites him .
But then two bouts of pneumonia robbed him of the stamina and reaction time needed to spell out words with the letter board .
He was back to the limited and laborious yes or no of his eyes .
Ramsey would be the first person to have an electrode implanted in a brain region known to be involved in speech .
In December 2004 , surgeons put a hollow glass electrode with three wires , measuring about a millimeter and a half , six millimeters deep into the left side of Ramsey ’s brain .
It was a nurse in the local school district who put the Ramseys in touch with Phil Kennedy , a pioneer in brain - computer interface research , who had been implanting electrodes — first in rats , then in monkeys , and eventually in humans — since 1986 , and who had National Institutes of Health backing for a start - up company called Neural Signals , based in nearby Duluth , Georgia .
Kennedy ’s first implants in humans had allowed paralyzed individuals to move a computer cursor with their thoughts and to work with basic text and drawing applications .
Ramsey would be the first person to have an electrode implanted in a brain region known to be involved in speech .
In December 2004 , surgeons put a hollow glass electrode with three wires , measuring about a millimeter and a half , six millimeters deep into the left side of Ramsey ’s brain .
In the months that followed , Kennedy ran tests in which he asked Ramsey to imagine trying to say various words or to think about moving his lips , tongue , or jaw .
Kennedy could see that the neurons were firing during these exercises , but he could n’t interpret exactly what speech sound , such as “ pa ” or “ ooh ” or “ dee , ” corresponded to which tangle of neural data .
In 2006 , he sought out Guenther , who along with Brumberg readily agreed to review the data that Kennedy had made available online .
The challenge , Guenther says , was that there were no distinct neuron spikes when Ramsey was trying to say one thing or another .
“ It ’s not like there are neurons that start firing when he says ‘ ah ’ but no other sound , ” he says .
“ All the neurons are firing a little bit all the time , but they change their firing rates .
It ’s the details in the patterns of those changes that are important . ”
By zeroing in on the part of the brain where the electrode was , says Brumberg , “ the model gave us the guide to decode that part of the signal .
It said , ‘ Here ’s what that part of the brain is trying to represent . ’ ”
Over the next year , they used that guide to build the neural decoder software at the heart of the system they would bring down to Georgia to read Ramsey ’s mind .
Dr Michael Nobel , chairman of the Appeal of the Peace Prize Laureats Foundation , had said , " I have never seen anything like this on earth .
It is a wonderful feeling , far removed from the national healthcare in the West , which does not seem to work very well .
The impressive thing about the hospital created by Bhagwan Sai Baba is the combination of the three aspects : state - of - the - art technology , free medical treatment and the healing powers of his presence instilling in the patient the firm belief that he or she will get well . "
The Sri Sathya Sai Institute of Higher Medical Sciences ' super - specialty hospital in Whitefield , near Bangalore , offers free heart surgeries to people from all walks of life .
Till date this hospital has conducted nearly four lakh surgeries , according to hospital staffers , who point out that there is no billing counter here .
The hospital 's mission is to ' provide high quality medical care absolutely on a no cost basis to all irrespective of caste , creed , religion , and financial status in an overall spiritual environment which recognises the patient as a human being and not as a diseased entity ' .

An Iranian American journalist accused of spying for the U.S. was sentenced Saturday by an Iranian court to eight years in prison , a move likely to put a chill on the Obama administration ’s efforts to improve relations with Tehran .
Roxana Saberi , 31 , who had reported for the BBC and National Public Radio , faced espionage charges during a trial Monday before Iran ’s Revolutionary Court .
“ The eight - year sentence is true .
I will appeal the verdict , ” said Saberi ’s lawyer , Abdul - Samad Khorramshahi .
It was not known whether she was convicted Saturday or after her court appearance .
Saberi , who was arrested in January and is being held in Tehran ’s Evin Prison , could have been sentenced to 10 years in prison or even the death penalty .
She was accused of spying on Iran , in the guise of a journalist , and passing information and documents to U.S. intelligence services .

The U.S. had condemned the accusations against Saberi as “ baseless and without foundation . ”
On Saturday , President Obama said he was “ deeply disappointed ” by the conviction , a White House spokesman said .
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said Washington would “ continue to vigorously raise our concerns to the Iranian government .
Our thoughts are with her parents and family during this difficult time . ”
The sentencing news came after indications Thursday by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad that the Islamic Republic wanted to improve relations with the West and would offer proposals to resolve the standoff over his country ’s nuclear program .
It is uncertain what effect Saberi ’s case will have on Washington ’s diplomatic strategy , but it puts pressure on Obama at a time when Iran ’s influence is growing in the Middle East .
“ This is a shocking miscarriage of justice , ” said Democratic Sen. Byron Dorgan of North Dakota , where Saberi grew up and was named Miss North Dakota in 1997 .
Dorgan said in a statement that the “ Iranian government has held a secret trial , will not make public any evidence , and sentenced an American citizen to eight years in prison for a crime she did n’t commit .
I call on the Iranian government to show compassion . ”

The deputy prosecutor for the Revolutionary Court had told Iranian news media that Saberi , who holds dual U.S. and Iranian citizenship , confessed to the charges .
Saberi ’s father , Reza , who traveled to Iran to visit his daughter and follow the trial , told the Agence France - Presse news agency :
“ Roxana said in court that her earlier confessions were not true and she told me she had been tricked into believing that she would be released if she cooperated .
. . .
Her denial is documented in her case , but apparently they did not pay attention to it . ”
In an interview with NPR , Reza Saberi said his daughter wanted to go on a hunger strike “ to draw the attention of the Iranian authorities who have sentenced her without justifiable cause . ”

The timing of the sentencing indicated that Iranian politics might be at play , including a move by conservatives to scuttle chances for rapprochement with Washington or to use the journalist as a bargaining chip for the release of Iranian officials held in Iraq on suspicion of spying .
The verdict is an attempt by Iran to “ intimidate the intellectuals and dissidents in the less than two months before the country ’s elections so that they dare not stick their heads out , ” said Reza Kaviani , an analyst based in Tehran .
“ The heavy sentence against Roxana is a message to all intellectuals .
. . .
I do hope her case will be on the negotiating table ” between Washington and Tehran .
But Mojtaba Bigdeli , a former spokesman for the Hezbollah Islamic movement in Iran , said , “ It ’s normal for somebody who has violated our law to be sentenced .
It has nothing to do with bargaining chips or with President Obama . ”
Saberi has been living in Tehran for six years .
Iranian authorities rescinded her press credentials in 2006 , but she continued working on a book and reporting for news outlets .

Her case was taken up by human - rights groups as another sign of shrinking civil liberties and press freedoms under the country ’s hard - line Islamic government .
Iran has accused the U.S. of using journalists to instigate opposition to Ahmadinejad and the nation ’s supreme religious leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
“ We are deeply distressed by this harsh and unwarranted sentence , ” said Vivian Schiller , chief executive of NPR .
“ Through her work for NPR over several years , we know her as an established and respected professional journalist .
We appeal to all of those who share our concerns to ask that the Iranian authorities show compassion and allow her to return home to the United States immediately with her parents . ”

Mostaghim is a special correspondent .
The Guardian obtained this footage of Ian Tomlinson at a G20 protest in London , shortly before he died .
It shows Tomlinson , who was not part of the demonstration , being assaulted from behind and pushed to the ground guardian .
co.uk
An inquest opened today into the death of Ian Tomlinson , the 47 - year - old newspaper seller who collapsed and died shortly after being assaulted by a police officer at the G20 protests .
Tomlinson 's family called for the inquiry , which has been adjourned pending further investigations , to be " thorough and far - reaching " .
An official at the City of London coroner 's office said coroner Paul Matthews had decided to open the inquest " because of a combination of evidence , including that released by the media " .
Tomlinson 's family lawyer said in a statement : " The family are pleased that the coroner has today announced that there will be an inquest into Ian 's death .
They hope that it will be a thorough and far - reaching inquiry into all the circumstances leading up to his death .
" They are also waiting for the results of the second postmortem examination – which took place today – in which Dr Nathaniel Cary was jointly instructed by the family and the IPCC . "
Earlier , a former senior police officer said that the policeman filmed assaulting Tomlinson should be suspended from duty and arrested .
Brian Paddick , a former Metropolitan police deputy assistant commissioner , said public confidence in the force could be damaged if it did not take " decisive action " .
He warned that the Met could be open to accusations of double standards when dealing with officers suspected of wrongdoing .
The officer , who has not been named , was expected to be questioned today under criminal caution by the Independent Police Complaints Commission .
He identified himself to his manager and the IPCC yesterday as fresh pictures suggested he had removed his shoulder number and covered his face with a balaclava before hitting Tomlinson with a baton and then pushing him to the ground on Cornhill , in the City of London , last Wednesday .
" There is already ... concern among some people in the community that the police are not being held to account for their actions , " Paddick told the Guardian .
" If that had been a member of the public caught on video doing that , they would have immediately been arrested .
" The police are in danger of being accused of double standards by not suspending and arresting the officer .
" There is a danger of undermining public confidence in the police by not taking decisive action . "
The officer in the video has not been arrested on suspicion of assault or suspended from duty by the Met , and the IPCC has not ordered the force to do so .
The Guardian handed the video showing the officer striking Tomlinson to the IPCC on Tuesday .
After intense publicity , the officer came forward , along with several other police officers shown in the video .
Other developments saw :
• The IPCC reverse its decision to allow City of London police officers to investigate the death .
• A second postmortem examination ordered as the IPCC confirmed that it would conduct a criminal investigation .
• Several top - level crisis meetings inside Scotland Yard .
• The Crown Prosecution Service liaising with the IPCC over possible charges .
• The emergence of Channel 4 footage , taken from another angle , which clearly shows the officer hitting Tomlinson with his baton before pushing him to the ground .
The officer involved could face a manslaughter charge if a link between the assault and Tomlinson 's fatal heart attack minutes later is proved .
" There is no excuse for what he did , " a senior police source told the Guardian , adding that , at the very least , the officer had committed a serious disciplinary offence and a criminal assault .
Yesterday , Scotland Yard said four Met officers had come forward , including one who had told his team leader that he was potentially involved in the assault .
Tomlinson was on his way home at about 7.20 pm when he was hit with a baton and pushed to the ground near the Bank of England .
Witnesses suggested the attack was the second time police had assaulted him .
At first , the City police investigating the death said Tomlinson had died of natural causes , but the video footage forced the IPCC to review its role in the inquiry yesterday .
Deborah Glass , a senior commissioner at the IPCC , said the watchdog was removing the investigation from City police and launching an independent inquiry .
" People are rightly concerned about this tragic death and this footage is clearly disturbing , " she said .
The first postmortem on Tomlinson found he had died of a heart attack , but neither the police nor the IPCC would reveal whether any marks indicating an assault had been found on his body .
There had been intense pressure on the IPCC to use its powers to conduct an independent investigation after the Guardian footage was released .
Sir Paul Stephenson , the Met commissioner , said the images " raise obvious concerns " and his force fully supported an inquiry .
A source close to the IPCC said the issues for the investigation were : " Was an offence committed ?
Secondly , did it contribute to his later death ?
Would that incident have caused the heart attack ? "
The home secretary , Jacqui Smith , said it was important that the IPCC inquiry was completed as soon as possible , adding : " If it identifies the need for a criminal investigation , then that also needs to be pursued . "
AKRON — An aquarium owner said a customer who was angry because his fish died caused $ 50,000 of damage and killed hundreds of fish in his store .
Stephen Mills said he was not surprised when Michael Davis was arrested Monday for the March 11 break - in at the Aquatic Interiors Sea Cave on West Exchange Street .
Police said Davis , 49 , of Beck Avenue , was caught because he cut himself when he entered the pet shop through a window .
Police turned the blood over to the state Bureau of Criminal Investigation and it matched Davis ' blood sample , which was on file from a previous arrest .
Davis surrendered to police on Monday and was charged with vandalism , cruelty to animals and breaking and entering .
Mills said he is still trying to pick up the pieces .
" It was just awful , " he said .
" I sold him an exotic saltwater fish for $ 150 last year .
The fish died three or four days after he bought it .
I told him he should have started out with a less expensive fish -- these are sensitive and difficult to raise . "
Mills said Davis wanted a replacement , which he refused .
" He did n't call me until days after the fish was dead , " Mills said .
" I went to his house and asked him what he thought I could do at that point , with a decomposing fish .
I asked why he did n't call me when the fish was sick , I might have helped .
He was pretty angry with me . "
Mills said a burglar broke into his shop and used a golf putter that he keeps in his office to smash every tank in the store .
" He put the putter through the bottom of 80 tanks , causing hundreds of fish to die , " he said .
" Of course , first , he stole the most expensive fish I had , including a lionfish .
He piled up other items at the back door to come back for them .
He did n't . "
Also stolen were telephones and a computer , police said .
But the shop was not without defenders .
Mills said he thinks Patrick the Parrot took a bite out of crime .
" It looks like the burglar reached into the parrot 's cage and tried to grab it , " Mills said .
" That 's an invitation to get bitten .
He picked up the cage and tossed it into a pond , injuring the parrot 's eye . "
Mills said he 's glad that Davis is in the Summit County Jail .
" He 's unstable , his reaction was really disproportionate to what happened , " he said .
" I 've been doing this for 30 years and never had this kind of problem before . "

American women are wealthier , healthier and better educated than they were 30 years ago .
They ’re more likely to work outside the home , and more likely to earn salaries comparable to men’s when they do .
They can leave abusive marriages and sue sexist employers .
They enjoy unprecedented control over their own fertility .
On some fronts  graduation rates , life expectancy and even job security  men look increasingly like the second sex .
But all the achievements of the feminist era may have delivered women to greater unhappiness .
In the 1960s , when Betty Friedan diagnosed her fellow wives and daughters as the victims of “ the problem with no name , ” American women reported themselves happier , on average , than did men .
Today , that gender gap has reversed .
Male happiness has inched up , and female happiness has dropped .
In postfeminist America , men are happier than women .
This is “ The Paradox of Declining Female Happiness , ” the subject of a provocative paper from the economists Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers .
The paper is fascinating not only because of what it shows , but because the authors deliberately avoid floating an easy explanation for their data .
The decline of the two - parent family , for instance , is almost certainly depressing life satisfaction for the women stuck raising kids alone .
But this ca n’t be the only explanation , since the trend toward greater female discontent cuts across lines of class and race .
A working - class Hispanic woman is far more likely to be a single mother than her white and wealthy counterpart , yet the male - female happiness gap holds in East Hampton and East L.A. alike .
( CNN ) --
For years , Candace Eloph searched for her half - brother , who was given up for adoption in 1977 .
She found him -- living across the street .
" I never thought it would happen like this .
Never . Ever , " Eloph of Shreveport , Louisiana , told CNN television affiliate KTBS .
Three decades ago , Eloph 's mother gave birth to a boy at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana .
She was 16 and gave him up for adoption .
" They took him from me , " said Eloph 's mother , Joellen Cottrell .
" I only got to hold him for a split second . "
Cottrell searched for her son over the years , without success .
She eventually left Louisiana and had other children .
But she did not keep her son a secret .
" My girls always knew they had a brother , " she told KTBS .
" I always told them .
They knew it from the very beginning .
And I 've always looked for him . "
Fast forward three decades .
Eloph moved into a house in Shreveport .
Across the street lived a 32 - year - old man named Jamie Wheat .
" We were sitting one day , talking , and she said , ' You know what ?
I had a brother born January 27 , 1977 , that was adopted , ' " Wheat said .
" I was like , I 'm adopted . "
Surprised , Eloph mentioned that her mother was 16 at the time .
His mother was 16 , too , Wheat replied .
All the details fit , and Cottrell and Wheat decided to take a DNA test .
The results :
There 's a 99.995 percent probability that the two are related .
Watch family open DNA results for first time »
Wheat 's adoptive parents are excited about this new stage in their son's life .
" It just almost knocked me out for the joy , " Wheat 's adoptive mother , Ann , told KTBS .
Added his adoptive father , Ted Wheat : " It was just surprising that they lived across the street from us for two - and - a - half years .
When they told us , we said , ' This is the greatest news it could be . ' "
Reunited with his birth mother , Jamie Wheat plans to make up for lost time .
" I feel like a weight has been lifted off of me , " he said .
" I can move forward .
Like a new beginning . "

In another disheartening development on the banking front , the Senate defeated legislation giving judges the authority to modify residential mortgages in bankruptcy .
Note that the popular description is often misconstrued in short form descriptions .
Judges would not have had open - ended authority to make changes .
The construct is that mortgages are collateralized loans .
The mortgage balance is written down in bankruptcy to the value of the collateral , and the excess is added to the unsecured creditor claims .
This is also not an arcane process .
It ’s used in commercial bankruptcies and lending against boats , for instance .
Ever hear any complaints about this practice in Chapter 11 ?
It was the best hope for cutting the Gordian knot of mortgage securitizations .
First , it would allow for decisions on a case - by - case basis .
Second , the servicer would get paid ( fees are well established for court action in foreclosure ) .
Third , the fact that a judge could force a principal writedown would give servicers air cover to do deep principal reductions , which Walter Ross , who owns the biggest third party servicer , has found do much better ( in terms of borrowers paying on time ) than the shallower mods coming out of government sticks and carrots .
This is not good news at all .
It bodes ill for the housing recovery ( the sooner prices bottom , the better ; all these phony programs and fighting to find ways to suck more income out of hopelessly underwater borrowers is anti-recovery .
The history of past bank crises shows that bankruptcies and debt restructurings are a necessary step to recovery .
Trying to impede that puts the interest of the banksters ahead of the collective good .
But why should we be surprised ?
This has been the modus operandi since the crisis began .
From Bloomberg :
The U.S. Senate rejected a measure that would let bankruptcy judges cut mortgage terms to help borrowers avoid foreclosure , a victory for banks and credit unions that said the legislation would increase loan costs .
The proposed “ cram - down ” amendment to a housing bill was defeated today in a 51 - 45 vote , with 12 Democrats among the 51 opponents .
The measure needed 60 votes to pass over Republican objections .
The House passed its version 234-191 on March 5 .
“ These bankers who brought us into this crisis are literally shunning and stiff - arming the people who are facing foreclosure , ” said Senator Richard Durbin of Illinois , sponsor of the legislation and the chamber ’s second - ranking Democrat .
The defeat is a setback for President Barack Obama ’s administration , which included cram - down in the anti-foreclosure plan aiming to help 9 million homeowners .
The mortgage industry has twice succeeded in helping to kill the proposal since Durbin first introduced it in 2007 .
The senator said today “ this is not the last time ” he will raise the issue .
Democrats led by Durbin had sought a compromise on the measure with JPMorgan Chase & Co. , Wells Fargo & Co. , Bank of America Corp. , the American Bankers Association and Financial Services Roundtable .
The lenders that scuttled the negotiations are “ surviving today because of taxpayers ’ dollars , ” Durbin said .
The three banks he named received $ 95 billion in U.S. aid .
“ It ’s clear that part of the mortgage industry was never interested in meeting us halfway , as negotiations went forward , they moved the goalpost back and back , ” said Senator Charles Schumer , a New York Democrat .
An older trader ’s saying is “ little pigs get fed , big pigs go to slaughter . ”
In this case , the parasite is successfully sucking the life of of the host .

Just like Barack Obama was for same - sex marriage was against it , Bill O’Reilly was never against same - sex marriage … until he was .
Even though he was caught this week pointing out all the crazy things gays getting married would lead to , he was n’t always such a hater .
Back in 2002 he said : “ Look , I could n’t care less , to tell you the truth … .
You want to get married ?
Knock yourself out .
Go to Vegas .
Have a good time .
If you can get that changed , I ’m not going to jump up and down and say I think it ’s wrong , because I do n’t . ”
He even called anti-gay zealots “ fanatics ” and “ holy rollers . ”
Nice to see O’Reilly can flip - flop — or “ evolve ” — his stance .
It used to be easy to guess how many Americans would have problems paying their credit card bills .
Banks just looked at unemployment : Fewer jobs meant more trouble ahead .
The unemployment rate has long mirrored banks ’ loss rates on card balances .
But Eddie Ward , 32 and jobless , may be one reason that rule of thumb no longer holds .
For many lenders , losses are now starting to outpace layoffs .
Mr. Ward , of Arkansas , lost his job at a retail warehouse in April and so far has managed to make minimum payments on his credit card debt , which he estimates at $ 15,000 to $ 20,000 .
Asked whether he thinks he will be able to pay off his balance , he said , “ Not unless I win the lottery . ”
In the meantime , he said , “ I ’m just doing what I can . ”
Experts predict that millions of Americans will not be able to pay off their debts , leaving a gaping hole at ailing banks still trying to recover from the housing bust .

Where do you start ?
Hello , I 'd like to share some links , gathered with much help from other mailing list subscribers .
There seem to be plenty of ways to get the job done for a Haskell web developer , aside from using more common languages . :)
First , the do - it - yourself way .
There are CGI / FCGI [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] bindings , so you can use your binaries with almost any webserver .
A very nice templating engine [ 3 ] is also available .
If you wish to embed ( X) HTML in Haskell , you can use either the combinator libraries [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] or [ 6 ] ( which is highly experimental ) .
Low - level libraries like [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] can be used for database connectivity , while [ 9 ] is for those who would like to construct their queries using combinators .
You can also take a look at lightweight frameworks like [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] .
Finally , in the near future we 'll hopefully have a very robust and high - performance HTTP web - server [ 12 ] which is going to be very simple to start with .
And about the frameworks out there .
There are a few all - in - one frameworks ( [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] ) available for those who can dive into the code , because their documentation is quite lacking .
( Of course , you can help out the authors by proposing some ! )
If you 're interested in HAppS , there is a tutorial to help you [ 15 ] , and you can take [ 16 ] as a reference .
I 'm very grateful to all the people who responded to my inquiry !

Four General Motors dealers in Ottawa will not get their sales and service licences renewed in 2010 as a result of the company 's decision to limit the number of dealerships across the country .
The Belanger family confirmed that Marcel Belanger Pontiac Buick GMC Ltd. in Orleans is among those affected by the cuts .
" You think you have 8,000 customers that are active here .
We 're profitable , we 've been in Orleans for 12 years , and they send you an email saying you 're no longer part of our future plans --
It is a shock , " Luc Belanger told CTV Ottawa .
The dealership notified customers of the situation with a posting on the company 's blog on Thursday .
" It is with great regret that I have to inform you all that General Motors has decided to shut us down , " reads the posting .
" The Belanger Family is devastated by this decision and the fact that we have to share this sad news with our exceptional employees , our great customers , our friends and families .
We have all dedicated our working lives to General Motors , and we could never have imagined a day like this could happen . "
The family said the decision is the result of " a numbers game " and " is a tough pill to swallow . "
But the dealership is not alone .
In Ottawa 's west end , Turpin Pontiac Buick GMC Ltd. in Kanata has also confirmed that it's on GM 's chopping block .
Two other dealerships in the nation 's capital will also lose their affiliation , but dealers would not confirm which ones .
Letters were sent to 245 dealers affected by the cuts on Wednesday , informing them that their sales and service relationships with GM will be ending .
GM said the move was being done in an effort to create a " more competitive dealer network . "
The company said the cutbacks were part of its " more aggressive operating plan " brought on by heavy pressure from the federal and Ontario governments .
GM said it hopes the result will be " a more competitive dealer network with higher volumes , while continuing to maintain the strongest and broadest dealer network in the country . "
Still , Belanger says his family wo n't walk away from their business .
" If it 's not General Motors , it 's going to be something else . "
Roughly 33,000 Canadians are employed at GM dealerships .
Each of the Ottawa dealerships affected by the cuts employ about 50 people .

OTHER than her son , the thing my ex-mother - in - law and I bonded over the most was our love of artichokes .
Come spring , Camille bought them by the dozen on Arthur Avenue in the Bronx .
If they were on sale , she ’d buy them by the crate .
It was she who showed me how to peel the stems and cook them along with the flower ( “ They taste just as good as the heart ! ” she ’d gush ) , and how to steam them in a pressure cooker .
( “ They only take 20 minutes ! ” )
Of all her recipes , my favorite was her garlicky Italian - style stuffed artichokes , filled with bread crumbs and herbs .
She ’d make these for Sunday family suppers , which started at 2 p.m. and lingered well into the evening .
Japanese Mushroom Recipes
Shiitake , Maitake , Brown Beech , and more : mushrooms are an important part of Japanese cuisine .
There so many ways to enjoy these delicious mushrooms !
Read on for some awesome Japanese Mushroom recipes and how to identify the different kinds in the supermarket .
I ’ve been playing around with Japanese mushrooms lately .
Look at these babies !
From left to right , these are White Beech Mushrooms ( Bunapi Shimeji ) , Brown Beech Mushrooms ( Buna Shimeji ) , Maitake Mushrooms and King Trumpet Mushrooms ( Eryngii )
These are organic and grown in the United States ( the ones sold in US are grown in California ) and even cultivated on recyclable material with no chemicals or additives .
Japanese mushroom farm at Hokto Kinoko :
About Japanese Mushrooms
I took some time to give each mushroom variety a glamor shot – these were really fun to photograph .
I hope you enjoy them !
Japanese Brown Beech Mushroom
Shimeji Mushroom is the third most popular mushroom in Japan , after shitake and enoki .
They are called “ beech mushrooms ” because they often grow on fallen beech trees .
These have a white base and cracked , speckled brown caps white are so very pretty .
Surprisingly , they have no aroma !
But their texture once cooked is smooth , crunchy .
Shimeji mushrooms are buttery and nutty .
You must cook Shimeji mushrooms , do not eat raw .
Perfect to pair with noodles !
The first recipe below is my Japanese Noodles with Shimeji Mushrooms Recipe .
Japanese Mushroom Recipes – Shimeji Mushroom
A simple vegetarian omelet that ’s savory , cheesy and healthy .
The original recipe came from a health spa in Mexico , Rancho La Puerta .
It ’s the quickest gourmet -y appetizer ever and I love using naan flatbreads as the base .
It ’s pre-baked , which is a fantastic shortcut for when I do n’t have time to roll out my own pizza dough .
Fast food Japanese style !
Start to finish , this healthy and light Japanese Udon Noodle Soup with Miso takes less than 15 minutes .
A 20 - minute easy Japanese mushroom noodle dish that ’s as delicious as it is simple
For this recipe , a small spoonful of truffle cream is stirred through the finished dish where the heat does it job to release and infuse the ingredients with white truffle goodness .
This tasty miso soup is packed with great flavors and textures !
This great recipe is serves up perfect steak every time , and the mushroom sauce served on top is exceptionally delicious !
Japanese Bunapi Shimeji Mushroom
These are called “ white beech mushrooms ” and “ Bunapi ” is actually a Hokuto trademark – they bred this particular mushroom from the Buna Shimeji ( above ) for its smooth , ivory color .
It tastes very similar to the Buna Shimeji , and any recipe above will work for Bunapi .
Japanese Maitake Mushroom
According to Kimiko Barber , in Japanese , these mushrooms are called “ dancing mushrooms . ”
When these mushrooms move in a gentle breeze , they resemble coral dancing in the current .
It ’s scientific name is Grifola frondosa and also known as Hen of the Woods .
It ’s a sturdy mushroom and holds its shape in a quick stir - fry and very pretty in soups with its swirls and curls floating .
The taste is rich , earthy , woodsy and its texture is crisp / firm .
Japanese Mushroom Recipes – Maitake Mushrooms
A super simple pasta recipe with a zesty citrus soy dressing .
It ’s rich , decadent and the best part is that the recipe is flexible .
At Vedge in Philadelphia , chef Richard Landau entices carnivores at his vegan spot by making a statement with these dramatic , crispy mushrooms .
You need thick , firm - fleshed fish fillets to take the heat of pan-roasting ; sea bass is ideal because the skin crisps up so nicely in the hot pan .
Tilefish makes a good alternative .
An easy and delicious stir fry which pairs mushrooms with asparagus – the perfect combo .
Perfectly cooked mushrooms on deliciously seasoned rice .
Nearly a full meal and absolutely satisfying –a knife - and - fork dish that highlights the vegetables .
Maitake mushrooms , aka hen - of - the - woods , have a robust , nutty flavor that particularly complements the dish .
If you ca n’t find them , sub in a handful of another favorite mushroom .
Japanese King Trumpet ( Eryngii ) Mushroom
These are my favorite Japanese mushrooms , I love their hearty , meaty texture and sometimes I even use these mushrooms as a meat substitute .
I like to slice these mushrooms into 1/4 - inch slices and then pan fry them with a little butter , mirin and soy .
( I ’ll post a recipe up later this week )
King Trumpet mushrooms are sweet , mild and buttery .
Its stem is thick , robust and the Eryngii is related to the common Oyster Mushroom .
In fact , sometimes , they are known as King Oyster Mushrooms .
The ones shown here are about 3 to 4 - inches tall and its base is 3/4 - inch in diameter .
Big boys !
Ian Garrone shows you in a short video clip what to look for when buying King Trumpet mushrooms .
He also says their taste is similar to abalone – and I totally agree !
Japanese Mushroom Recipes – King Trumpet Mushrooms
Saute the mushrooms – once they are softened , pour in the teriyaki sauce .
Simmer for another minute , and it ’s ready to pour over your grilled salmon , grilled steak or just poured over steamed rice .
So good !
Thai curry is my “ break in case of emergency ” meal – as I always have a can of coconut milk , a can of curry paste , shrimp in the freezer and miscellaneous vegetables in the refrigerator .
Rice is only a one - finger trigger button away or already cooked , stored in the freezer .
A delicious fish dish with a divine lemon butter sauce , with glorious king trumpet mushrooms !
This recipe is an easy one , no food processor or blender required , but it requires some preparation .
These bowls have sautéed king oyster mushrooms , spicy peanut tofu , steamed baby bok choy and soba noodles flavored with a drizzle of sesame oil and chives .

Former UN Ambassador John Bolton believes the security of the United States is at dire risk under the Obama administration .
And before a gathering of conservatives in Washington on Thursday morning , he suggested , as something of a joke , that President Barack Obama might learn a needed lesson if Chicago were destroyed by a nuclear bomb .
Appearing at the Conservative Political Action Conference ( CPAC ) , the nation ’s largest annual conference of conservative activists , Bolton , one of the hardest hardliners of the George W. Bush administration , spoke at length about Obama ’s naiveté and how various nations – Russia , North Korea , Iran – will be exploiting the new president .
The most dramatic moment of his speech may have been when he cracked a joke about the nuking of Obama ’s hometown .
“ The fact is on foreign policy I do n’t think President Obama thinks it ’s a priority , ” said Bolton .
“ He said during the campaign he thought Iran was a tiny threat .
Tiny , tiny depending on how many nuclear weapons they are ultimately able to deliver on target .
Its , uh , its tiny compared to the Soviet Union , but is the loss of one American city ” – here Bolton changes his tone subtly to prepare for the joke – “ pick one at random – Chicago – is that a tiny threat ? ”
Bolton was n’t the only one who thought this was funny .
The room erupted in laughter and applause .
Was this conservative catharsis , with rightwingers delightfully imagining the destruction of a city that represents Obama ?
Or perhaps they were venting vengeance with their laughter .
( Bolton is no stranger to inflammatory remarks .
He once infamously quipped , “ There are 38 floors to the UN building in New York .
If you lost 10 of them , it would n’t make a bit of difference . ” )
At CPAC , the Right ’s most fevered beliefs about Obama live on , with speakers portraying him as a radical liberal who wants to compromise American values , hand hard - earned taxpayer dollars to the shifty poor , and , as Bolton repeatedly pointed out , weaken America ’s defense .
Bolton was introduced by Thomas Kilgannon , the head of Freedom Alliance , an organization founded by Oliver North .
Kilgannon described the United Nations , an organization that Bolton despises , as a place “ where anti-Americanism is outdone only by anti-Semitism ” and “ where American tax dollars are wasted [ and ] dictators are exalted . ”
Bolton received a standing ovation and got off to a fast start , declaring that “ President Obama is the most radical president we have ever elected in this country . ”
In Bolton ’s world , Obama ’s radicalism is matched only by his lack of backbone .
The new president , he warned , simply does n’t have what it takes to go head to head with the world ’s baddest bad actors .
And Obama ’s pusillanimous posture , Bolton predicted , will result in American becomes a “ weaker and less safe nation . ”
One man that Bolton feels has plenty of backbone is the Russian prime minister , Vladimir Putin , who Bolton believes can sense Obama ’s weakness and is already finding ways to test it .
In Bolton ’s view , the problem is n’t merely that Obama is n’t man enough to take on Putin ; it ’s that Obama desires the United States to become a second - class nation .
“ The administration wants to return to an arms control relation with Russia that will put us in a greatly weakened position , ” Bolton maintained .
Russia is n’t the only threat that Obama will fail to confront , Bolton said .
North Korea , he claimed , is testing a missile that can hit Alaska and “ possibly ” Hawaii .
With “ further development , ” he added , that missile could someday be used to attack the continental United States .
And North Korea is small potatoes compared to Iran .
“ We have lost the race with Iran on the nuclear front , ” said Bolton .
“ They now have complete mastery over the nuclear fuel cycle .
And while in the long - term , the preferred outcome would be to change the regime in Tehran and get rid of the Islamic revolution of 1979 , we do n’t have time to do that before they get nuclear weapons capability . ”
Bolton expressed disappointment that the Bush administration did not use force against Iran .
Judging from the enthusiastic crowd reaction , there are plenty of conservatives who think that Bush ’s foreign policy failing was not preemptively attacking enough Middle Eastern countries .
Bolton concluded by saying , “ I think it ’s clear that our national security is at risk in this administration . ”
He received a standing ovation .
In a brief Q&A session , he was asked if the American people will “ revolt ” because of Obama ’s policies .
This question about armed revolution was curious , given President Obama ’s popularity rating is above 60 percent .
The speaker who proceeded Bolton , Republican Congressman Paul Ryan , highlighted the conflict that runs throughout CPAC .
Ryan ’s proposals for domestic policy were exactly what one would expect .
Supply side theories , good !
Government spending , bad !
Tax cuts , good !
European - style economics , bad !
He ended by saying , “ With CPAC ’s leadership , we can revitalize this movement . ”
And that ’s the problem .
This year ’s CPAC is supposed to begin conservatism ’s comeback .
But can rebirth be achieved when the ideas being spouted by Bolton , Ryan , and others are the same as the ones pushed for the last eight years ?
But at least this much can be said about Bolton : even as he fades into obscurity , he ’s not going soft .
Technology.am ( Apr. 6 , 2009 ) —
The scientists of Singapore ’s Institute of Bioengineering and Nanotechnology ( IBN ) have developed the first tri-continuous mesoporous material using a unique surfactant template , N , N - dimethyl - L- phenylalanine .
This new porous structure previously been predicted only mathematically .
The IBN scientists said that this novel material , named IBN - 9 after the research institute , is the first hexagonal nanoscale construct with 3 unconnected interwoven channels and it represents a new class of mesoporous materials , which consist of pores of 2 - 50 nanometers in size .
“ IBN - 9 demonstrates that it is possible to create three interwoven but independent pore channel systems along with a unique nano - fiber morphology .
Such a mesostructure makes distinct diffusion rates in different directions possible .
This property would be very attractive for gas separation and drug delivery systems , ” said Jackie Y. Ying , Executive Director of IBN .
Mesoporous silica has well - defined nanochannel structures that are formed over templates via self - assembly processes .
Mesoporous silica materials have huge surface areas , making them ideal for use as catalysts to facilitate chemical reactions .
Their uniform nanometersized pores allow them to separate molecules by size difference .
Their pores may also be used to trap drug molecules for controlled drug release .
Therefore , the ability to tailor the pore structure of mesoporous material is of fundamental importance for various chemical and biological applications .
It 's good to see that Google , currently somewhat on the ropes regarding Street View privacy , is walking it like it talks it when it comes to protecting innocent individuals from international cyberexposure :
Hmmmm .
We suppose it could be argued that Street View is actually protecting impressionable kiddies from the delights of finger - lickin ' plumped chicken product in a bargain bucket with fries .
In which case , it 's to be applauded .
Now it just needs to get its strumpet - arse - blurring algorithm working properly . ®

Most chemical elements become superconducting at low temperatures or high pressures , but until now , copper , silver , gold , and the semiconductor germanium , for example , have all refused superconductivity .
Scientists at the Forschungszentrum Dresden - Rossendorf ( FZD ) research center were now able to produce superconducting germanium for the first time .
Furthermore , they could unravel a few of the mysteries which come along with superconducting semiconductors .
Superconductors are substances that conduct electricity without losses when cooled down to very low temperatures .
Pure semiconductors , like silicon or germanium , are almost non-conducting at low temperatures , but transform into conducting materials after doping with foreign atoms .
An established method of doping is ion implantation ( ions = charged atoms ) by which foreign ions are embedded into the crystal lattice of a semiconductor .
To produce a superconducting semiconductor , an extreme amount of foreign atoms are necessary , even more than the substance would usually be able to absorb .
At the FZD , germanium samples were doped with about six gallium atoms per 100 germanium atoms .
With these experiments , the scientists could prove indeed that the doped germanium layer of only sixty nanometers thickness became superconducting , and not just the clusters of foreign atoms which could easily form during extreme doping .
As the germanium lattice is heavily damaged by ion implantation , it has to be repaired afterwards .
For such purposes , a flash - lamp annealing facility has been developed at the FZD .
Its application allows for a repair of the destroyed crystal lattice by rapidly heating the sample surface ( within few milliseconds ) while the distribution of the dopant atoms is kept almost the same .
From a scientific point of view , the new material is very promising .
It exhibits a surprisingly high critical magnetic field with respect to the temperature where the substance becomes superconducting .
For many materials , superconductivity occurs only at very low temperatures , slightly above the absolute zero point of - 273 degrees Celsius or 0 Kelvin .
The gallium doped germanium samples become superconducting at about 0.5 Kelvin ; however , the FZD researchers expect the temperature to increase further by changing various parameters during ion implantation or annealing .
Physicists have been dreaming about superconducting semiconductors for a long time , but saw only few chances for the semiconductor germanium to become superconducting at all .
Germanium used to be the material for the first generation of transistors ; however , it was soon replaced by silicon , the current material for microelectronics .
Recently , the “ old ” semiconductor material germanium has aroused more and more interest , as it allows , compared to silicon , for more rapid circuits .
Experts even believe germanium to be rediscovered for micro- and nanoelectronics .
The reason for such a renaissance lies in the fact that miniaturization in microelectronics industry using silicon is coming to an end .
Today , extremely thin oxide layers are needed for transistors , down to a level where silicon oxide does not work well any more .
Germanium as a new material for chips would come along with two big advantages : it would enable both faster processes and further miniaturization in micro- and nanoelectronics .
Superconducting germanium could thus help to realize circuits for novel computers .
The scientists at the Forschungszentrum Dresden - Rossendorf followed a targeted approach when searching for a new superconducting semiconductor .
Instead of doping with boron , which had resulted in superconducting silicon two years ago in France , the scientists choose gallium because of its higher solubility in germanium .
In many systematic experiments they proved that the superconductivity of germanium can be reproduced .
Furthermore , they were able to show that the transition temperature marking the start of superconductivity can be raised within certain limits .
In the future , the scientists at the two FZD institutes “ Ion Beam Physics and Materials Research ” and “ Dresden High Magnetic Field Laboratory ” will combine their know - how in order to fine - tune different rather complex parameters for further experiments , thus hopefully discovering further mysteries of superconducting semiconductors .
Health officials working near the front line in Sri Lanka say heavy shelling in the newly - designated safety zone has killed hundreds of civilians in the past 24 hours .
One official has told the BBC the hospital where he is working had received the bodies of 378 people killed in just under 24 hours by artillery fire .
He said a further 1,122 people were being treated for injuries , and added that there were further bodies in other places , including by roads and on the beach .
Two health officials had earlier spoken of constant shelling of densely populated civilian areas .
They said the firing came from areas held by the Sri Lankan army but the Sri Lankan defence spokesman , Keheliya Rambukwella , said the accounts were propaganda from the Tamil tiger rebels .
The United Nations spokesman in Colombo , Gordon Weiss , says there has been no let up for civilians caught up in the conflict .
" Our assessment is that people stuck up there at the moment are in very very poor condition .
They 've had very little food delivered to them for months now , " he said .
" We can see from the position of the people who are coming out of that area and winding up in camps that they 're in a terrible condition .
So we can only imagine that the people still stuck up there life has become ... is even worse . "
Meanwhile , the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) , claims up to 2,000 civilians may have been killed in the last 24 hours .
Mr Weiss says there have always been competing claims about casualty figures .
" The UN has said for some time now that thousands of civilians have been killed and wounded over the past few months , " he said .
" We have no reason to believe that the toll on civilians has let up in any significant way since this last phase of the conflict . "
The reported attack is the latest in a series of accusations and counter - accusations about who is harming civilians , tens of thousands of whom are trapped inside less than five square kilometres of battlefield .
The disparate accounts illustrate the difficulty of getting a clear picture from inside a war zone that is rarely opened to outsiders by either side , and where those present are not fully independent from pressure often delivered at gunpoint .
Both sides have repeatedly exaggerated battlefield accounts for propaganda purposes , and both deny accusations they are harming civilians .
Health officials said the places attacked were within what the Sri Lankan Government calls its ' new safety zone ' , a small area into which the army has asked civilians to move .
They said two hospitals were struggling to cope with the casualties and that people were hiding in bunkers and many makeshift tents had been burnt .
The officials say shells fell near medical facilities in very congested areas .
Sri Lanka 's leaders believe their military offensive is close to defeating the Tamil rebels , who are holed up on the north - east coast , after 37 years of ethnic conflict .
At the height of their power in 2006 , the Tigers - who want an independent Tamil homeland in the Sinhalese - majority island - controlled roughly a third of the island .
The Sri Lankan Government has refused all international calls for a ceasefire despite United Nations ' reports last month saying up to 6,500 civilians may have been killed and 14,000 wounded in fighting since January .
It has also turned down requests to send humanitarian aid into the rebel territory , where the UN estimates about 50,000 civilians are trapped .
The Government says the number of civilians being held by the Tigers as a ' human shield ' is less than 20,000 .
Independent reporting from the conflict zone is impossible , as journalists are banned from travelling freely .

How to Dispute Unreasonable Charges on Your Bills
After some frustration , several phone calls and a long time listening to more commercials while being on hold , I managed to get the erroneous $ 175 termination fee on my AT&T phone bill waived .
Here ’s how I did it .
What Happened to My Bill
Many cell phone companies ask for a commitment in exchange for free phones ( or cash rebates ) .
Some are 1 year contracts , while others are multi-year ones .
I signed up for a 2 year contract a few years ago , which I do regularly as I switch from carrier to carrier to take advantage of all the cash rebates that many companies offer .
For a long time , everything was fine and dandy .
Several weeks ago , I switched my cell phone provider to take advantage of a $ 350 cash rebate .
To make sure that my contract was up , I called AT&T and was told that my contract was up .
I then went ahead to cancel my service and switched over .
While I was away on my trip a few days later , my wife receives an AT&T bill and to her surprise , there was a $ 175 of termination fee .
She tried to call AT&T but they just would n’t listen .
Over and over , all she heard was :
We ’re sorry .
Since your contract is n’t up until July , 2009 , there is nothing we can do
What I Did to Get My Money Back
I fully understand that contracts needs to be honored , but when I called beforehand and was told that my contract is up , I expect the information to be correct .
I called again , and after talking to first representative , she echoed the same thing , and also told me that I signed my contract last year ( which was n’t true ) .
When I asked to speak to the manager , she got upset and tried to say no but when I asked again , she put me on hold for a while , then picked up the phone again and just hung up .
I called again of course .
This time , someone more reasonable came on .
I explained my situation , and mentioned that if someone told me the contract was up in July , it would n’t make sense for me to even cancel two months beforehand because the monthly charges would n’t even be $ 175 .
The representative agreed , but said he could n’t do anything .
He suggested to be transferred to the manager , and then I explained everything all over again .
She checked into the system for call records and notes other representatives made , and told me that yes , it was their error and they will credit me .
What I Learned and How You Can Dispute Errors on Your Bills
Of course , if you made a mistake and was charged a fee , there is nothing you can do .
However , when there are legitimate reasons why there ’s something on the bill that should n’t be on there , here are some tips that might help save you money .
Persistence Pays Off – Before you even call , you need to figure out whether your request is reasonable .
If it is , then do n’t take no for an answer .
If we just gave up after my wife called , we would be $ 175 short .
If I gave up after I called the first time , we would still have to pay $ 175 .
When reason is on your side , do n’t be afraid to explain it again and again .

When reason is on your side , do n’t be afraid to explain it again and again .
Always Log Your Calls –
One thing we have n’t done is write down when we called , as well as the person ’s name on the other end .
If AT&T did n’t have logs of when I first called to ask about my contract several weeks ago , I doubt they will believe me when I told them that I was given erroneous information that led to the charge .

Be Calm but Assertive – Most of the time when we are calling customer support , we are upset about the service .
However , remember that the people on the other side of the line is here to help you .
Without him / her , you will get no where .

Do n’t be Discouraged by Bad Reps –
When the first representative hung up on me , I was ready to write the whole company off .
I could n’t believe that AT&T representatives would tell me my contract was up when it was n’t .
Then charge me a termination fee , then get upset when I ask to speak to a manager and hang up on me .
After I calmed down , I realized that just like every other company , there are good and bad employees .
Just because one representative is unreasonable does n’t mean everyone will be .
I then called again and luckily , the person I spoke with next was much more reasonable and logical .

Be Reasonable – I ’ve said this a few times and I will say it again .
The reason why you are calling must be logical .
If you screwed up , then do n’t call trying to get your money back .
However , if your request is reasonable , then you have every right to not be charged .
It can be done as I ’ve shown .
Good luck .

Teenage boys who eat fish regularly score higher on intelligence tests than those who eat fish less often , according to a study conducted by researchers from Goteborg University in Sweden and published in the journal " A number of studies have already shown that fish can help neurodevelopment in infants , reduce the risk of impaired cognitive function from middle age onwards and benefit babies born to women who ate fish during pregnancy " researcher Kjell Toren said .
" However , we believe that this is the first large - scale study to explore the effect on adolescents .
" Researchers collected detailed dietary questionnaires from 4,792 15 - year old boys , then compared this information with intelligence scores from tests that all the participants took three years later , upon registering with the Swedish military .
On average , those who ate fish once per week had combined intelligence scores 7 percent higher than those who ate fish less than once a week , while those who ate fish twice or more a week scored 12 percent higher .
Those in the once - a - week group also scored 7 percent higher on visuospatial intelligence and 4 percent higher on verbal intelligence , while those who ate fish more than once a week scored 11 percent and 9 percent higher , respectively .
The average increase in all scores was 6 percent for those who ate fish once a week and 11 percent for those who ate it more frequently .
According to lead researcher Maria Aberg , the current study is particularly important because it focuses on the effect of fish consumption during adolescence , when the brain is developing much of its plasticity , or its ability to adapt to everything from new experiences to injuries .
While it may be too early to make specific dietary recommendations , she said , " for the time being it appears that including fish in a diet can make a valuable contribution to cognitive performance in male teenagers .

On CNBC tonight , former vice president Dick Cheney backed off of his claim that Colin Powell is no longer in the Republican Party .
Even more shocking is the fact that Cheney apologized to Powell and said that he was n’t trying to , ” rearrange his political identity . ”
Here is the video from Media Matters :

Cheney said , “ Well , we ’re happy to have Gen. Powell in the Republican Party .
I was asked a question about a dispute he was having I think with Rush Limbaugh .
I was expressing the consent , the notion I had that he already left since he endorsed Barack Obama for president , but I meant no offense to my former colleague .
I was n’t seeking to rearrange his political identity . ”
Cheney also said that the GOP should not abandon their core principles .
Oh that zany Dick Cheney , of course he was trying to push Colin Powell out of the Republican Party .
This was the point of his agreement with Rush Limbaugh , who makes no bones about his desire to get Powell out of the GOP .
I do believe that this might be the first time that Dick Cheney has ever apologized to anyone in public , at least since he became vice president .
It took a man of Colin Powell ’s stature to get an apology out of Cheney .
I do n’t think Cheney apologized publicly to his friend that he shot in the face .
The moderates who are fighting for their political lives in the GOP have found their leader .
I think Colin Powell might be the only moderate with enough clout to successfully tangle with Limbaugh and Cheney .
NEW DELHI , Feb. 3 ( UPI ) -- A New Delhi high court judge has dismissed an obscenity charge against a married couple in India who kissed in public , observers say .
Wondering how police could have brought charges against an " expression of love by a young married couple , " Judge S. Muralidhar quashed the criminal proceedings against the 28 - year - old man and his 23 - year - old wife , the BBC reported Tuesday .

New Delhi city officials had begun criminal proceedings against the couple for " sitting in an objectionable position near a metro ( railway station ) pillar and kissing , due to which passersby were feeling bad , " the broadcaster said .
Muralidhar , however , said that even if police reports were accurate " it is inconceivable how … an expression of love by a young married couple would attract an offense of obscenity and trigger the coercive process of law . "
The couple 's lawyer told a local newspaper that obscenity charges should only be applied when an act is so obscene that it encourages depravity or annoys the public , the BBC reported .
SAN FRANCISCO  Turning itself into a kind of electronic vanity publisher , Scribd , an Internet start - up here , will introduce on Monday a way for anyone to upload a document to the Web and charge for it .
The Scribd Web site is the most popular of several document - sharing sites that take a YouTube - like approach to text , letting people upload sample chapters of books , research reports , homework , recipes and the like .
Users can read documents on the site , embed them in other sites and share links over social networks and e-mail .
In the new Scribd store , authors or publishers will be able to set their own price for their work and keep 80 percent of the revenue .
They can also decide whether to encode their documents with security software that will prevent their texts from being downloaded or freely copied .
Authors can choose to publish their documents in unprotected PDFs , which would make them readable on the Amazon Kindle and most other mobile devices .
Scribd also says it is readying an application for the iPhone from Apple and will introduce it next month .
Tony Cenicola / The New York Times
As I reported in Sunday ’s Times , the iPhone has been a golden ticket for some developers who have cashed in on the platform with popular applications .
But the chances of hitting the iLotto have grown increasingly slim .
As more developers seek their fortune in the glossy curves of the device , the App Store is becoming crowded .
Competition is spiking , driving down application prices — and the chances of becoming the next iMillionaire .
Could the iPhone 3.0 change that ?
Some developers think so .
Apple ’s new version of phone software , expected to be released publicly this summer , will allow developers to employ several new ways to monetize content and build new business models beyond mobile advertisements and charging a flat fee per download .
In particular , developers will be able to sell subscriptions and allow users to make individual purchases from within the application itself .
Those changes might only benefit professional developers and larger gaming companies like Sega and Electronic Arts with the resources to deliver extras worth paying for , like secret gaming levels and expansion packs , warns Erica Sadun who has authored several books about coding for the iPhone , including one on the newest software changes .
“ These are advances that will better benefit the larger developers than the smaller developers , ” she said .
But Nicole Lazzaro , a game design consultant , described the upgrades as “ a big win for developers . ”
“ Right now , it ’s pretty hard to make back your development cost at a $ 1 per application , ” she said .
“ You have to sell quite a few applications to do that . ”
With the changes , she said , developers can still entice iPhone owners with a lower upfront price and introduce upgrades and offers within the application that will generate additional revenue over time .
Some independent developers — such as Kostas Eleftheriou , one of the creators behind iSteam , a nifty digital parlor trick that fogs up the face of an iPhone like a bathroom mirror — think the upgrade will spur a new wave of creativity .
“ There will be a sudden storm of apps that were not possible before , ” he said , referring to the addition of peer - to - peer networking , multimedia messaging and cut- and - paste functionality .
“ The new features will be available for everyone , not just big companies . ”
“ It was the personal initiative of Mr Trudeau , ” says Marc Lalonde of the bill that decriminalized gay sex in Canada 40 years ago this summer .
Lalonde worked with Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau for years , first as his principal secretary then in key cabinet positions .
He remembers Bill C - 150 well .
“ If not for the initiative of Mr Trudeau , ” gay sex would not have been decriminalized in 1969 , Lalonde says .
Tim Porteous , Trudeau ’s executive assistant , says the Criminal Code amendments both fit with his boss ’ conception of a “ just society ” and suited his “ sense of mischief . ”
“ He liked to provoke people , ” Porteous says .
Trudeau ’s bill was nothing if not provocative .
“ It ’s certainly the most extensive revision of the Criminal Code since the 1950s and , in terms of the subject matter it deals with , I feel that it has knocked down a lot of totems and over - ridden a lot of taboos , ” then - justice minister Trudeau told a media scrum outside the House of Commons on Dec 21 , 1967 , after introducing his sweeping 72 - page , 104 - clause omnibus bill .
In its quest to modernize Canada ’s Criminal Code and bring it in line with society ’s evolving views of which acts should and should not be illegal , Bill C- 195 ( and its successor the now - famous Bill C - 150 ) touched on a variety of matters , from homosexuality to abortion to gambling to gun control .
“ It ’s bringing the laws of the land up to contemporary society I think , ” Trudeau told reporters .
“ Take this thing on homosexuality .
I think the view we take here is that there ’s no place for the state in the bedrooms of the nation .
“ I think that what ’s done in private between adults does n’t concern the Criminal Code , ” he said .
“ When it becomes public , this is a different matter , or when it relates to minors this is a different matter , ” he added .
Though the bill dared to tread into many areas widely considered to be moral issues , none proved more contentious than its proposal to decriminalize gay sex .
If passed , the bill promised to amend the buggery and gross indecency sections of the Criminal Code to ensure that anal and oral sex between two consenting , adult gay men would no longer be a crime — as long as it took place in private and between participants aged 21 years or older .
The amendment ’s limited scope did little to lessen the fierce debate and fear mongering in and around the House of Commons .
Trudeau would become prime minister mere months after introducing his omnibus bill , leaving the Liberals ’ new justice minister , John Turner , to somewhat reluctantly reintroduce the bill in December 1968 .
Turner , who declined numerous requests to be interviewed for this story , described Bill C- 150 to the House as bearing Trudeau ’s “ indelible imprint . ”
It was Trudeau “ who had the courage to assemble it , to introduce it into parliament and to defend it across the land under the sharp scrutiny of a general election , ” Turner told the House of Commons on Jan 23 , 1969 .
Turner argued that the Liberals ’ sweeping electoral victory in 1968 meant the proposed omnibus bill had already “ been tested by public opinion and received a popular mandate . ”
He also maintained that “ there is nothing in the bill which would condone homosexuality , promote it , endorse it , advertise it , popularize it in any way whatsoever . ”
“ All it does is recognize what those of us who support the bill recognize : that there are areas of private behaviour which , however repugnant , however immoral — if they do not directly involve public order should not properly be within the criminal law of Canada , ” Turner told CBC Radio on Apr 20 , 1969 as the bill continued to make its way through debates in the House .
“ There are acts and situations in life which most of us would consider to be immoral that are not crimes , ” he said .
“ Adultery is one , yet it is not a crime .
Fornication is immoral , I suppose to most of us , yet it is not a crime .
These are matters for private judgment , private behaviour , private morals , and the criminal law says these are not our concern .
“ In the same way , acts between people who suffer under a sexual deviation — as long as it does n’t involve the corruption of a minor , as long as it does n’t involve force , as long as it is not done in public — if in fact it consists of adult , mature , private behaviour , however repugnant as I ’ve said to most of us , these are matters for personal conscience and should not be in the public criminal domain , ” Turner said .
“ We are not for a moment conceding that homosexual acts are in any way to be equated to ordinary , normal acts of intercourse , ” he reminded the House of Commons .
Despite a lengthy , heated debate , Bill C- 150 passed in the House of Commons by a vote of 149 to 55 on May 14 , 1969 — six weeks before the Stonewall riots launched the gay liberation movement in New York .
One hundred and nineteen Liberals , 18 New Democrats and 12 Conservatives , including leader Robert Stanfield , voted in favour of Bill C-150 .
One Liberal broke ranks and voted against it , joining 11 of Réal Caouette ’s conservative Créditistes from Quebec and 43 Conservatives .
It was n’t enough to defeat the bill .
Bill C -150 went on to pass in the Senate and received Royal Assent on Aug 26 , 1969 .
Trudeau ’s “ indelible imprint ” had become the new law of the land .
***
As bold as Trudeau ’s initiative was , it did not spring forth from thin air .
The bill ’s introduction followed several key developments in Canadian and British society , chief among them the Wolfenden Report .
Published in England in 1957 , the Wolfenden Report “ became the Bible for liberal regulatory sex reform ” in Canada , says Gary Kinsman , author of The Regulation of Desire : Homo and Hetero Sexualities .
In fact , Kinsman says , many Members of Parliament ( MPs ) in Canada arguing in favour of Bill C - 150 “ were basically using the Wolfenden Report for their crib notes . ”
The Wolfenden committee had been charged in 1954 with investigating the “ nauseating subject ” ( as one member of the British House of Lords put it ) of male homosexuality and prostitution in the post - war reassertion of heterosexual family values .
The committee was asked to find a more effective way to regulate “ sexual deviance . ”
Its solution : to separate the public and private realms and use criminal law to preserve public order and decency , while allowing people to do whatever they want — however immoral — in private .
“ There must be a realm of private morality and immorality that is in brief and crude terms not the law ’s business , ” the report said .
That said , the report did not condone homosexual behaviour and in fact expressed concern about the possible “ menace to boys ” that homosexual men allegedly posed .
Hence the prohibition against any homosexual act involving anyone under the age of 21 .
As for homosexuality in the public realm , that was to be dealt with severely , the committee said , urging police to vigilantly patrol “ public ” spaces such as bathrooms .
Armed with the Wolfenden Report , early homophile organizations like Vancouver ’s Association for Social Knowledge ( ASK ) began suggesting that similar reforms might be possible in Canada .
In 1964 , ASK tried to support a private member ’s bill by maverick NDP MP Arnold Peters calling for the decriminalization of homosexual acts between two consenting adults in private .
Peters ’ bill — egged on , according to Kinsman , by a gay civil servant in Ottawa named Gary Nichols — would have made homosexuality a crime only if it involved an adult “ assaulting a young person . ”
ASK wrote to Peters to request a copy of the bill but never got any response .
“ The bill never reached the floor of the House of Commons but it did give ASK its first real encounter with law - reform activity and generated publicity for homosexual law reform , ” Kinsman writes in The Regulation of Desire .
To some extent Peters ’ bill “ foreshadowed the ’ 69 Criminal Code reform , ” Kinsman says .
Peters ( who also sought to introduce a bill to legalize abortion ) would go on to become involved in Nichols ’ homophile Canadian Council on Religion and the Homosexual , a group of about three dozen people , including some mostly closeted gay civil servants , some mostly straight Anglican and Catholic clergy and a few doctors and psychiatrists .
“ We believed that homosexuality was abnormal and that it was something in respect of which they could use help .
I was joined by many people of the religious community who were aware that many people in the community faced this problem , ” Peters later told the House of Commons as it debated Trudeau ’s bill in 1969 .
According to Kinsman , the short - lived Council held discussion groups and submitted a brief supporting Wolfenden - type law reform to the Ontario Select Committee on Youth before disbanding in 1967 .
“ These changing attitudes toward homosexuality and support for law reform within some of the churches — in interaction with homophile organizing — paralleled developments in the United States and England , ” writes Kinsman .
“ Limited as they were , these shifts represented a general change in social institutions and helped lay the basis for law reform . ”
Three years after Peters ’ private member ’s bill went nowhere , the Supreme Court of Canada ruled 3 - 2 that Everett George Klippert should remain incarcerated indefinitely as a “ dangerous sexual offender ” for having sex with other men .
Though the climate could hardly be described as gay - friendly , many Canadians disagreed with the Klippert ruling and the possibility of life imprisonment for consensual sex among adults .
Klippert , a mechanic ’s assistant in the Northwest Territories , had pleaded guilty to four counts of “ gross indecency ” and was sentenced to three years in jail .
While in jail , he was visited by two psychiatrists on behalf of the Crown who successfully sought to have him declared a “ dangerous sexual offender . ”
Ten years after Wolfenden , the Supreme Court ’s decision essentially made every practicing homosexual liable to imprisonment for life .
There was a limited , but real , public outcry .
As Kinsman writes , “ The controversial Everett George Klippert case played a central role in speeding up the process of reform , especially in getting the Wolfenden reform strategy taken up by government . ”
The Supreme Court handed down its Klippert ruling on Nov 7 , 1967 .
Six weeks later , Trudeau introduced his omnibus bill .
***
When Trudeau stepped into the role of justice minister in 1967 , he did so with the full awareness that a succession of minority governments ( including the one of which he was then a member ) had neglected several “ thorny ” issues .
“ Proposed amendments had been gathering dust in the department ’s files , ” Trudeau wrote in his Memoirs .
“ I needed first of all to persuade my Cabinet colleagues that it was appropriate to put these controversial subjects on the order paper in the Commons .
Several of them objected strenuously , some for political reasons , some for moral ones .
But I held my ground until finally , tired of arguing , even the opponents ended up saying , ‘ If you want to risk destroying yourself , it ’s up to you . ’
And I had carte blanche . ”
Trudeau ’s commitment to modernizing Canada ’s Criminal Code stemmed from his belief that there is a clear distinction between sin and crime .
“ What is considered sinful in one of the great religions to which citizens belong is n’t necessarily sinful in the others , ” he wrote .
“ Criminal law therefore cannot be based on the notion of sin ; it is crimes that it must define . ”
For Trudeau , it was a matter of personal liberty — a basic principle .
Others did not share his perspective .
The bill touched off fierce debates in parliament , as MPs on both sides of the House expressed strong personal convictions on the issue of homosexuality — even when it only concerned consenting adults , which Trudeau pointed out “ was the sole focus of the amendment . ”
Trudeau was convinced , however , that the time had come to adapt the laws of the land to the circumstances of our time , and that the public would support him and his bill based on the argument that “ the state has no place in the bedrooms of the nation . ”
Porteous became executive assistant to and speechwriter for Trudeau after “ most of the legislative manoeuvring [ on Bill C - 150 ] had already been done . ”
Asked what he thinks motivated Trudeau to risk his career on such a contentious bill , Porteous points out that Trudeau drafted the bill as justice minister — before he had given any consideration to running for the Liberal leadership .
He made the decision “ without having to consider the impact on the possibility of his becoming prime minister . ”
Trudeau may also have calculated that the support he would gain could offset any support he would lose , Porteous suggests .
“ The consensus was there were a fair number of votes out there from people who felt that homosexuals were being badly dealt with .
But there was also a large number of people against the whole thing .
Trudeau ignored the possibility that these people would vote against him .
But he also recognized that he had actually gained an important group of supporters by passing that legislation . ”
In particular , Porteous mentions Trudeau ’s awareness of homosexuals “ working in professions that might be helpful to him — for example , in the broadcast business — who would be much more likely to support him because he ’d been the author of that bill . ”
Although “ anybody who had political aspirations would have run in the opposite direction , ” Porteous says , the amendments fit with Trudeau ’s conception of the “ just society . ”
He “ had the only reasonable contemporary attitude to homosexuality , ” he says .
Trudeau also had “ a sense of mischief , ” Porteous notes .
“ He liked to walk into the Commons and everybody gasped because he was wearing sandals . ”
Given Trudeau ’s penchant for wearing fur coats and even for taking ballet classes , he was often assumed to be gay .
“ People talked about that all the time , ” Porteous says .
“ That was part of his provoking people .
He did things which would encourage the people to believe that , and got enjoyment out of the fact that he was misleading them . ”
Lalonde , who served as principal secretary to Trudeau before joining his cabinet , thinks the bill came about because the age of “ flower power ” was more permissive than prior eras .
Plus the amendments suited Trudeau ’s personal convictions , he says .
Homosexuality was “ not particularly high on the priorities of the government of the day , ” Lalonde notes .
But as justice minister Trudeau “ was concerned with the fundamental rights of individuals ” and Prime Minister Lester B Pearson supported him , Lalonde says .
Together , they managed to avoid radical opposition within the Liberal party , even though there was no great enthusiasm for the bill ’s homosexuality and abortion measures in caucus .
But nobody resigned and eventually cabinet endorsed the matter , Lalonde says .
“ The government fully endorses this bill , ” Turner told the House of Commons in January 1969 .
“ It is a government bill , bears the government stamp and will be supported by the government .
“ We feel bound to the bill as the principal item of social reform in this session of parliament .
It is identified with our Prime Minister and party .
“ We believe therefore that , on the one hand , we have the right and , on the other hand , the duty to stand behind the bill in all stages of debate that will follow , ” Turner said .
There is no doubt , Lalonde says , that the omnibus bill “ was a step toward personal liberty , for recognizing that the state does not need to legislate on private ethical issues . ”
He credits Trudeau entirely for its introduction and passage .
“ If not for the initiative of Mr Trudeau , it would have been years later ” before such amendments were implemented , Lalonde says .
Kinsman is n’t so sure .
“ It seems to me [ that the situation was ] much more complex , ” he says .
Trudeau does n’t deserve all the credit ; his way was paved by the variables and broader social trends that preceded the introduction of his omnibus bill .
Without the Klippert case , without the Wolfenden Report , without the grassroots discussions fostered by homophile organizations like ASK and the Council on Religion and the Homosexual , Trudeau could not have done what he did , Kinsman contends .
“ Without all of these things , it would have been much more difficult for Trudeau to move at that time . ”
Don McLeod agrees .
“ Trudeau was instrumental in getting it through but all of these things came into play too , ” says the author of Lesbian and Gay Liberation in Canada .
Though some might argue that the homophile organizations had little direct connection to Bill C - 150 ’s formulation , Kinsman maintains these groups helped shape the emerging discussion of homosexuality in legal , professional and religious circles that led to the bill ’s introduction and passage .
“ Without them organizing , it would have taken longer . ”
If anyone deserves credit for bravery , says Kinsman , it ’s Peters , the maverick NDP MP who tried to decriminalize homosexuality three years before Trudeau brought his own bill forward .
“ In 1964 , for somebody to be raising that in parliament was pretty significant , ” says Kinsman .
Peters introduced his private member ’s bill three years before the discussions had begun to ripple through at least certain sectors of society , three years earlier in the social change movements of the 1960s , three years before the Klippert verdict angered at least some Canadians .
Peters “ actually helped produce some of the discussions ” that led to Trudeau ’s bill , says Kinsman .
Yet he ’s often left out of gay history .
***
As Bill C - 150 made its contentious way through the House of Commons , some suggested it be split so MPs could vote on each Criminal Code amendment separately .
Trudeau would n’t hear of it .
He explained his inflexibility on this point on CBC Radio on Aug 14 , 1968 : “ I can see nothing to be gained from having the same speeches — and they would be the same speeches — on 10 or 20 bills whether the Criminal Code should sanction opposition to sin or to public disorder . ”
MPs will have “ ample room ” in the debates to dissociate themselves from those sections of the bill they find particularly “ obnoxious , ” Trudeau added .
McLeod believes that if the amendment decriminalizing gay sex had stood alone , it would not have passed .
“ We would have had to wait until the 1970s or so .
But since it was lumped in with lotteries , it passed , ” he says .
Trudeau ’s omnibus strategy , combined with party discipline and a majority government , ensured that the more controversial aspects of Bill C - 150 would ultimately be adopted , although opposition members and the Edmonton Journal described the government ’s process as “ arrogant , authoritarian , undemocratic , brutal and downright immoral . ”
The bill ’s opponents in the House were outspoken and plentiful .
“ If homosexuality were practiced on a widespread scale society would break down , ” argued Walter C Carter ( St John ’s West ) .
“ If it were universally practiced , the human race in a matter of time would become extinct .
Obviously , therefore , it can not be said to be conducive to social progress … .
“ The bill gives legal recognition to a practice that is basically anti-social .
If I voted for the bill , it would mean that I am condoning that which I feel if carried out on an unrestricted basis would destroy the way of life we have painfully built up over the centuries . ”
Similarly , Roland Godin of Portneuf suggested that because “ the adoption of the clause regarding homosexuality will help to reduce the number of births , ” the government could speed up the process “ of annihilating the Canadian nation … by moving an amendment promoting cannibalism . ”
Godin and Gilbert Rondeau ( Shefford ) agreed that the ridiculous conclusion of proceeding down the decriminalization path would be to pass legislation legalizing marriage between homosexuals .
For Georges Valade ( Sainte - Marie ) , carrying the amendment to its ultimate , ridiculous conclusion required asking how to reconcile “ the fact that two persons can commit homosexual acts in private without being considered criminals , while three homosexuals performing the same acts in similar privacy would in point of fact become criminals . ”
Steven E Paproski ( Edmonton Centre ) spoke about the dangers of “ compulsive coercion . ”
“ Homosexuals proselytize , ” Paproski claimed , “ and in so doing endanger young people before they are at an age to realize what is involved .
That is why in flashing a green light at this time the government is embarking on a course fraught with dangerous consequences . ”
The Hon WG Dinsdale ( Brandon - Souris ) agreed with that particular worst - case scenario : “ It is abnormal social behaviour , because homosexuals are predators … .
Homosexuals prey on juveniles .
It is something that spreads like a plague , for there is no more destructive drive than the sexual impulse running wild . ”
Gérard Laprise ( Abitibi ) went even further : “ A few years ago , one such sexual pervert assaulted boys who objected to such perversions and he killed them .
He murdered them to satisfy his lust …
Such sexual perverts are not satisfied with meeting other perverts ; too often they try by every astute means available to pervert boys and sometimes , they kill or pervert .
By legalizing homosexuality , such sexual perverts are given full liberty . ”
Laprise also indicated that those under the legal age of 21 “ who are sexually ill or perverted would resort to all sorts of tricks to take advantage of the provisions of the act . ”
In a similar vein , Léonel Beaudoin ( Richmond ) said the passing of the amendment “ would mean that young people would be continually threatened by the unbridled instincts of those sexual perverts . ”
Other MPs were less concrete in their slippery slope arguments , asserting simply that the amendment was the first step toward decay , decadence and socialism .
The debate contained two other overriding themes : religion and illness .
On the former , Trudeau ’s distinction between “ sin ” and “ crime ” failed to persuade all MPs .
“ The only effect the proposed amend ment on homosexuality will have , if it is passed , will be to indicate that the government approves what God himself condemned so emphatically , ” Laprise argued .
Former Prime Minister Diefenbaker , despite his reputation as a civil rights leader , indicated he was “ sorry ” to see this legislation : “ We live in an age that is becoming more and more permissive .
Some say there is no God , that each man should be able to live his own life as he wills as long as he does so in private .
I do not find any support for that philosophy in the scriptures . ”
In response , Stanley Knowles ( Winnipeg North Centre ) objected to “ the constant appeal to religion as though some of the interpretations of religion which we have been given are the final answer … .
“ If true religion means anything it means compassion , ” he said .
“ It means understanding , it means concern for people , especially people who are ill .
That is the object of [ this amendment ] . ”
With respect to this “ illness ” theme , many MPs on both sides of the House referred to homosexuality as a disease and compared it at times to leprosy or tuberculosis in suggesting that a more appropriate legislative response was treatment .
Another common example was alcoholism .
“ Just as we worked for the alcoholics ’ rehabilitation , ” said André Fortin ( Lotbinière ) , “ we must try to rehabilitate the homosexuals since they have a disease , a sexual deviation . ”
This compassion only extended so far , however .
As the Globe and Mail pointed out on Apr 18 , 1969 , “ a number of MPs who have called homosexuality an illness , nevertheless have advocated its continuing to be treated as a crime . ”
Even those voting in favour of the amendments often offered only qualified support , referring to homosexual acts as odious or as “ a sexual perversion which arouses a sense of horror in most normal people . ”
Despite the backlash , Trudeau ’s procedural tactics worked .
Bill C - 150 was adopted , although Trudeau himself was called a “ dictator ” in the process .
While the last 10 - 15 years have been a race to fill up your cable box 's TV guide with hundreds of channels -- most of which you 've never watched -- the next 10 - 15 years will be a race to the bottom .
At least that 's one of the visions we keep hearing from people at the intersection of television and the Web , who think that Internet distribution is going to shake up your TV experience the way it 's already changed the way you get music and read news .
The idea :
You 'll get about 20 linear channels from cable -- a legacy broadcast network , a few big - brand cable networks like ESPN , maybe another live sports channel , some major lifestyle channels , and that 's about it .
The rest will be handled via video - on - demand or streamed over the Internet .
If that 's what happens , the effects on the TV industry would be colossal .
Because this shift would be caused , to a great extent , by TV advertisers moving their money online , there would be a pretty big , new pool of money to pay for companies to be scrappier , online - focused production houses .
But there 's little chance that Internet advertising will ever be able to support the bloated production costs of most of today 's cable shows -- at least on the scale they 're happening today .
So most channels and cable - riches - spoiled production companies would simply go out of business , replaced by more nimble upstarts .
( That 's what companies like Revision3 and Next New Networks are betting on . )
Meanwhile , cable providers like Comcast ( CMCSA ) would probably have fewer subscribers spending the same amount ( or less ) per month on cable TV , but they'd have much lower content costs .
Right now , cable companies spend about 40 % of your monthly bill on content .
In a more on - demand world , where people only have to pay for what they watch -- not a bunch of channels they do n't want -- that could be a little lower .
Broadband usage would go up as people watch more Internet video , suggesting that ISPs could charge more for Internet access .
( Maybe even on a consumption - based billing model , but that 'll be hard . )
But probably at lower margins , as they have to keep adding capacity to their networks .
And a new winner : Someone will be the one that connects your TV to the Internet : Either the cable companies -- who have the advantage of a set - top box already in your living room , but the disadvantage of being slow pokes with terrible software and user interfaces -- or someone like Apple , Microsoft , Roku , or your TV manufacturer .
To be sure , this is just one hypothetical glimpse at the future .
Maybe 400 - channel digital cable will ride it out to infinity .
But anyone in TV who 's seen the music industry get gutted over the last 10 years can't be so sure about that .
We 're curious what you think .
It 's obviously hard to predict the future , and all ideas are welcome .

A new development in anthropology online has taken form today , and that is the creation of the Open Anthropology Cooperative .
Since roughly 22 May a discussion emerged on Twitter concerning the possibility of taking anthropological collaboration online to a new level .
I first learned of this discussion from Lorenz Khazaleh at antropologi.info , even though I myself pretend to be in Twitter .
The Twitter discussion went from #icaa to #oaa and finally to #oac .
Keith Hart ( The Memory Bank ) , moved this forward by setting up the network on NING , which was a suggestion I made , but without enough thought as to the limitations of the software for what we might want to do .
Allow me to copy from Lorenz what one can distill from the early discussions as the foundational premises for the OAC :
A place to share ideas
A place to find like - minded anthropologists
A place to collaborate
A place to hold virtual conferences
A place to host podcasts
A place to ask questions
A place to learn about new tools for anthropology ( online tools , field tools , etc . )
A place to find resources ( e.g. databases , good grad programs , upcoming colloquia , software , field opportunities )
A place to publish
The idea of an engaged anthropology for the 21st century in relation to the digital revolution
Group blog with posts from both Keith and others
Forum for discussion
Online press to publish longer pieces
The incorporation of Twitter , social bookmarking , wiki , etc
Again following Lorenz , I will quote from Fran , a social anthropologist whose blog discusses the idea for an Open Anthropology Cooperative in the following terms :
In my opinion , there is no reason for an invented divide that reduces web - based academic content to a second - rate substitute for formal ( read : expensive , elaborate , bureaucratic ) channels .
Why not overlap “ open ” and “ official ” academia until they are one and the same ?
… How about an online / offline seminar series , bridging the gap with web - based multimedia , in - person meet - ups , etc ?
Crossing over from the lecture hall to the web , sharing teaching and learning materials , creating new bodies for peer revision and publication are all possible and positive outcomes .
Breaking down the publishing barrier and enabling actual feedback with established anthropologists can only help to aid in the development of better research and analysis .
In the discussion on The Memory Bank , which traveled there from Twitter , and then from The Memory Bank to the current incarnation of the OAC , more ideas were put forth on the meaning of this new phenomenon .
Paul
Wren wrote , “ I can see that we should view ‘ open ’ as having many faces — open access , open membership , open to new ideas , open to whatever the organization might do or become . ”
Keith Hart added , “ open to everyone , as in ‘ open source ’ . ”
I very much appreciate these ideas , and in some respects they resemble some the principles I espoused here .
The NING platform for the OAC will provide an early trial platform for doing most of what people wanted above , except the open journal and open conferencing systems .
The idea was to start implementing some of the idea , putting them in practice , gaining a critical mass of participation and interest , before moving on to more ambitious ventures .
Update ( 10 June 2009 ) :
Early enthusiasm sometimes gives way to early disappointment .
Among the many problems with the OAC , aside from its generally not living up to a name that it borrowed ( a remix it seems ) , is that rather than serve as a test to where “ we ” could go with collaborative and open access anthropology , it has become largely an online replication of traditional and familiar forms of introverted anthropological self - organization .
It is not open anthropology as much as it is merely anthropology out in the open .
Given the authoritarian and elitist tendencies that set in extremely quickly with the ownership and administration of the network , it is not likely that there will be anything substantively and qualitatively new to emerge from this premature and ill conceived , poorly executed experiment .
I suggested previously , based on an accumulation of statements that I gathered from those who founded and administer the network , that my principles of Open Anthropology — the only set in existence are those named as such , here on this blog — inspired some of the thinking behind the initiative .
By some it turns out that this largely means none in practice , and that the principles have been emptied and used as a glossy cover for something quite ordinary and conventional .
Now we are left with two sites , with strikingly similar titles , that have little in common , and much to set the two in opposition .
What matters most about Open Anthropology is challenging professionalization , institutionalization , and disciplinary self - defense and self - promotion .
Yet , the OAC appears hell bent on reinforcing those very processes and phenomena .
What also matters most about Open Anthropology is that it is a project of decolonization and anti-imperialism .
Yet , the OAC administration , with its heavy policing and intervention designed to tamp down any “ nasty ” or “ captious ” disagreements with those who present some of the most antiquated imperial thinking to be found anywhere , prevents the emergence of a true Open Anthropology .
Indeed , groups have even formed that are ideal for “ strategic studies ” and “ counterinsurgency ” types , with their analyses of “ tribes ” and “ radical ” versus “ moderate ” actors in the Middle East and Asia .
The policing of the site has been terribly condescending and inappropriate , bordering on misconduct .
Discussions have been tampered with , edited after the fact , and comments deleted , so that a false impression is created of what was said , by whom , when and why .
When I needed to substantiate something that I said , by referring to a comment I had made earlier in a discussion , I found it was gone .
When challenging a senior colleague who was putting words in my mouth , I could not find my own words .
To disable a colleague in that manner , without apology , is inexcusable and decidedly unethical .
The infernal quest for hierarchy is very much in evidence , with policy makers , steering committee , administrators , and an “ inner circle , ” that makes me wonder if George Orwell scripted this network as an online theatrical production of 1984 .
The OAC may go somewhere someday , but not like this .
The Open Anthropology Cooperative is largely a social networking site , with little to offer except perhaps a wider range of contacts among professionals .
For now , this is the best possible face that I personally can put on the OAC .
If drowning yourself in an anthropology conference that never ends , and being neck deep in old line anthropology is what you like , then the OAC is the place for you .
As Trinidadians like to say when exiting : “ I gone ! ”
Te mentí , te fui infiel , me fallaste , estuviste con otra y me lastimaste , me equivoqué , vos también te equivocaste pero somos nosotros los problemas van aparte .
At the end of March The Pirate Bay added new functionality to reach out to millions of Facebook users .
Just over a week later and the world 's largest social networking site has blocked all links to torrents on the world 's largest and most infamous BitTorrent tracker .
It was less than two weeks ago when The Pirate Bay implemented a new feature making it easier for site users to post links to torrents on their Facebook profile , so their friends can download those torrents with just a single click .
The entertainment industries were not happy with the new feature , but since The Pirate Bay is not exclusively used to spread copyrighted material , there was n’t much they could do about it .
Facebook users responded positively and many began posting torrent links in their profile .
This integration of the world ’s largest tracker and the world ’s largest social networking site generated hundreds of news articles and excitement .
But it was n’t to last .
This morning Facebook decided to put an end to the sharing and blocked not only the feature , but all links to Pirate Bay ’s torrents .
The ‘ Share on Facebook ’ button on the TPB torrent download pages does n’t work anymore , and neither does the Facebook bookmarklet .
Manually adding a link to your Facebook messages is n’t allowed either , regardless of the “ legality ” of the content it ’s linking to .
Facebook has basically launched a site - wide ban of Pirate Bay torrent URLs .
Any message containing a torrent URL , like this one , is blocked .
According to the message you ’ll see on Facebook it is because it “ has been reported as abusive by Facebook users ” but this is inaccurate .
Facebook is actively blocking the links , also for new torrents and ‘ legal ’ torrents that are uploaded by artist who want to share their work .
Facebook spokesman Barry Schnitt told TorrentFreak , “ Facebook respects copyrights and our Terms of Service prohibits placement of ‘ Share on Facebook ’ links on sites that contain “ any content that is infringing .
Given the controversy surrounding
The Pirate Bay and the pending lawsuit against them , we ’ve reached out to The Pirate Bay and asked them to remove the ‘ Share on Facebook ’ links from their site .
The Pirate Bay has not responded and so we have blocked their torrents from being shared on Facebook . ”
Facebook users are not allowed to link to Pirate Bay torrents
Interestingly , links from thepiratebay.se are still accepted .
The Pirate Bay ’s Peter Sunde told TorrentFreak that this is plain censorship and said he will try to come up with a workaround so people can continue to share .
“ I ’ll fix it later today so it will have a link to a redirect site or something , ” he said .
Since Facebook ’s Terms of Service forbid any acts of copyright infringement , the company would n’t generally be responsible for infringements committed by their users .
However , just as a torrent site is expected to respond to DMCA takedown notices , so is Facebook .
If , after being notified of an infringement Facebook fails to take action , it could itself become liable .
Add this to the prospect of a growing administrative headache linked to a rising tide of DMCA takedown notices generated by TPB torrents , and Facebook probably decided it had enough grounds to justify a ban .
Facebook ’s censorship policies are not very consistent though .
Mininova and isoHunt , two other large BitTorrent sites remain unaffected , even though is oHunt offers the exact same ‘ Share on Facebook ’ feature as The Pirate Bay previously did .

ISLAMABAD , Pakistan ( CNN ) -- Taliban militants made their deepest incursion into Pakistan this week , seizing control of areas that are a short drive from the capital city .
Pakistan has deployed paramilitary troops to a district taken over by the Taliban .
A Pakistani government official said the militants fully withdrew from the Buner district on Friday , although other officials cast doubt on the extent of the pullout and how long it would last .
Buner is only 60 miles outside Islamabad .
The situation is particularly concerning because Pakistan is a nuclear - armed state .
The Islamic republic is believed to have between 30 and 40 nuclear warheads , according to the U.N. nuclear watchdog , the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) .
Those warheads , however , are unassembled and scattered about Pakistan in areas that are not under the control of the Taliban , several analysts said .
iReport : Should the U.S. intercede in Pakistan ?
Earlier this week , U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton warned that Pakistan was in danger of falling into terrorist hands .
But Pakistan 's ambassador to the United States , Husain Haqqani , said that the situation is not as dire as Clinton described .
" Yes , we have a challenge , " Haqqani told CNN .
" But , no , we do not have a situation in which the government or the country of Pakistan is about to fall to the Taliban . "
Analyst Michael Krepon said while the news out of Pakistan is " disturbing , " the real concern is what happens if Pakistan decides to move the weapons components , which are closely guarded by its army .
" The nuclear weapons are the most well - guarded inanimate objects in the country , " said Krepon , co-founder of the Stimson Center , a Washington , D.C. - based think tank .
" When they 're not in motion , they 're not going to be subject to hijacking or being overrun by the Taliban . "
Krepon , who studies Pakistan 's and India 's nuclear programs , said tensions between those two countries could prompt Pakistan to move its weapons components .
" If there 's a crisis with India ... odds increase greatly that weapons could move around , and when weapons move around , it is very worrisome , " he said .
Watch a former CIA official view »
However , Pakistani political consultant Hasan - Askari Rizvi downplayed the threat of the Taliban insurgency to Pakistan 's nuclear weapons program .
" The threat to nuclear weapons is not so imminent because they are far away from those places and secondly , they are under control of the army , " Rizvi said .
" Only a few people in the army know about it , " he said , noting that the Pakistani army would defend their control of the nuclear weapons until the end .
" It 's a source of power , " Rizvi said .
" Whoever controls the weapons will dictate to the Pakistani government . "
Commentators and politicians in the West have long harbored concerns that Pakistan 's nuclear weapons could be stolen by Islamic militants .
A month after suspected Islamist extremists assassinated former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in December 2007 , top Pakistani security officials held a special briefing with Western journalists , insisting that the country 's nuclear arsenal is secure from Islamic extremists .
The January 26 , 2008 news conference took place a few weeks after IAEA chief Mohamed ElBaradei warned that Pakistan 's " many internal problems " put the country 's nuclear arms at much greater risk .
At the briefing , Lt. Gen. Khalid Kidwai -- head of the army division that controls Pakistan 's nuclear sites and weapons -- said the country 's weapons were protected by a " fool - proof " security system .
Kidwai said there are 10,000 troops assigned to guard the country 's nuclear facilities , including special agents who report directly to the country 's intelligence services .
He stressed that Pakistani military sites were equipped with security cameras ; biometrics and access control ; bullet - proof vehicles , high security walls ; and quick reaction forces .
Around 2,000 scientists working with sensitive materials and information at the sites had to undergo extensive background checks before being given security clearances , he added .
" In Pakistan we have been extremely conscious of our responsibilities and obligations in this regard and we have instituted command and control structures and security measures in a manner so as to make these fool proof , " Kidwai said .
CNN 's Tricia Escobedo in Atlanta , Georgia , contributed to this report .
You would say " Je suis l'ananas . "

Here is a tale that sounds like it comes right from the pages of “ Little Dorrit , ” Charles Dickens ’s scathing indictment of Victorian England ’s debtors ’ prisons .
Unfortunately , it is happening in 21st - century America .
Edwina Nowlin , a poor Michigan resident , was ordered to reimburse a juvenile detention center $ 104 a month for holding her 16 - year - old son .
When she explained to the court that she could not afford to pay , Ms. Nowlin was sent to prison .
The American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan , which helped get her out last week after she spent 28 days behind bars , says it is seeing more people being sent to jail because they cannot make various court - ordered payments .
That is both barbaric and unconstitutional .
In 1970 , the Supreme Court ruled that it violates equal protection to keep inmates in prison extra time because they are too poor to pay a fine or court costs .
More recently , the court ruled that a state generally cannot revoke a defendant ’s probation and imprison him for failing to pay a fine if he is unable to do so .
That has not stopped the practice .
In Georgia , poor people who cannot pay off fines  plus a monthly fee to the private company that collects the payments  are often sent to jail for nonpayment , according to Stephen Bright , president of the Southern Center for Human Rights .
In 2006 , the center sued on behalf of a woman who was locked up in Atlanta for eight months past her original sentence because she could not pay a $ 705 fine .
Swine influenza is a respiratory disease of pigs .
It was isolated in 1930 .
It is caused by Influenza type A which brings about the disease in pigs .
This happens on a pretty regular basis and doesnâ€™t cause many deaths in pigs .
The pigs certainly get ill and it happens with a large number of pigs usually in the fall and winter months of the year .
That is when most of the human population gets their versions of influenza injections as well , better known as â€ œthe flu shotâ€ .
Every year the flu vaccines that are received by humans are just a bit different .
The virus used to make our flu injection is grown in a lab dish to make a vaccine that most likely matches the strain of the influenza that is expected that season .
The strains of flu morph every season and although the symptoms of the flu are the same or mostly similar to the last yearâ€™s strain , the vaccinations can be targeted to the specific strain or species of the virus that will affect people that year .
If a person get the vaccination and still gets ill with the flu it is said that it is possible the person got a strain of the flu that was more severe or not covered in the vaccination the person received .
It is impossible to cover every variation of a virus that is continually changing .
Viruses can change constantly and that is the same of the swine flu .
Pigs can become infected with other viruses that have reassorted or " swapped genes " and a new strain of the virus is born .
Pigs can get infected with avian ( bird ) flu , human and other strains of swine flu from other pigs too and then the reassorting / gene swapping Â begins again creating a new subtype of that virus .
There is a vaccine to protect pigs from the virus but currently no vaccine to protect humans from catching swine flu .
A seasonal influenza vaccination grown and manufactured for humans will only partially protect a person .
Since there are 4 substrains of swine influenza type A , the seasonal flu shot will give a person only partial protection from only one of the variations of the swine flu but not against the main species of the swine flu that we are seeing in the world news in the past week or so .
The symptoms of swine flu closely mimic the symptoms of human influenza .
Coughing , fever , runny nose , fatigue , headache and a loss of appetite are consistent with both human and swine influenzas .
Additional symptoms which may require being seen by a physician include chills , nausea , congestion , sore throat , lethargy , a fever over 101 degrees , vomiting and diarrhea which can bring about dehydration and put the sick person at additional risk .
This will usually land the person a night or two in the hospital with IV fluids and meds .
Swine flu doesnâ€™t usually infect humans but this does occur when a person has close proximity with pigs that are infected and then is around other people .
The person can catch the swine flu virus from the pigs that are infected and it is then passed on from an infected person to others through coughing , sneezing and casual contact .
Just as in human influenza , if a person touches something which has the flu virus on it and then touches their eyes , nose or mouth they can then contract that virus .
With most viruses there is a window period called â€œsheddingâ€ .
That would be the ideal time where sputum ( a respiratory sample coughed up ) is obtained and sent to the CDC for examination .
During this shedding period , there has not been sufficient time for the body to send out any protection and the virus can be more readily identified .
Shedding a virus is much like shedding old dead skin cells and can easily spread a virus during that time frame .
For adults shedding a virus occurs most likely 4 - 5 days after the infection is received .
The antigen can be identified most easily during that window period of shedding .
When an antigen , the invader disease state that infects the person , enters the body , there is an antibody response to that antigen or invader .
That is when our little soldier cells ( white cells ) respond to the invading infection and build more and more little soldier cells to fight the infection .
Children may shed longer due to decreased antibody loads due to age or vaccinations received thus far in their little lives .
This antigen / antibody response usually takes care of the invader and we get better but those persons who are compromised health wise have a much harder time of it .
Persons with compromised pulmonary functions , diseases that do not allow for full recovery such as HIV and cystic fibrosis are also at increased risk and should take all precautions to avoid catching swine flu .
So how do we as a community protect ourselves against the swine flu ?
Education .
Education .
Education .
Every year Health Departments around the country preach the gospel of Good Community Health through hand washing , cough control and sneeze protection for those around us .
These are the 3 main things a person can do to protect themselves from almost any invader disease state .
Just like condoms add barrier protection for those who use them , we , as a community , are asked to make a barrier of our own sniffles and sneezes to avoid passing our germs to the next person .
Make it a practice to wash hands often , especially with children who donâ€™t think to wash their hands and often share toys , food and germs .
As adults it is necessary for us to make good examples of ourselves and teach our children good hand washing practices to avoid spreading diseases .
This applies to avoiding passing a cold to avoiding passing on swine flu .
Carry hand sanitizing gels or wipes if you feel you will be where there may not be adequate facilities for hand washing .
Kleenexes now come in varieties where they capture germs on the tissues and the germs are disposed with the tissues .
Zinc is always a good option for staying healthy .
Sleep and a proper diet can also help , but barrier methods and cleanliness work the best for not passing on germs and infections .
If you or a loved one comes down with an illness that you suspect could be the swine flu it may be best to see a physician if the symptoms begin to mimic a worse illness than just a regular flu .
If there is fever , persistent coughing that sounds like a barking , fever , vomiting or diarrhea , go to a healthcare professional and get checked out .
An ounce of prevention is worth a lot in this situation , but when that fails , is there a pound of cure to be had ?
Testing has shown that the human swine influenza H1N1 ( the main strain of swine influenza ) can be treated with the antivirals oseltamavir ( Tamiflu ) and zanamivir ( Relenza ) .
If you suspect you may have had contact with someone who has any symptoms of the swine flu it may be necessary to be on antiviral therapy to avoid spreading the disease and to recover .
If there are any further questions or concerns about the state of your health and swine flu , please contact your healthcare professional for early treatment .
BANGKOK , Thailand ( CNN ) --
A pregnant British woman facing possible execution in Laos will go on trial this week , the country 's foreign affairs ministry said Monday .
Samantha Orobator became pregnant in prison , according to a spokeswoman for rights group Reprieve .
Samantha Orobator " is facing death by firing squad for drug trafficking , " said Clare Algar , executive director of Reprieve , a London - based human rights group .
Orobator , 20 , was arrested on August 5 , said Khenthong Nuanthasing , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman .
She was alleged to have been carrying just over half a kilogram ( 1.1 pounds ) of heroin , Reprieve lawyer Anna Morris told CNN by phone from Vientiane , the Laotian capital .
" For that amount of heroin the sentence is normally the death penalty , " she said .
Orobator 's mother Jane found out in January her daughter was pregnant -- more than four months after she was arrested , her mother said .
Jane Orobator heard the news from the British Foreign Office , which has been monitoring the case , the mother told CNN by phone from Dublin , where she lives .
She cannot believe her daughter was involved in drug trafficking and was surprised to learn she was in Laos , she said .
" I do n't know " what she was doing there , she said .
" The last time she spoke with me , she said she was on holiday in London and she would come to see us in Dublin before returning to the U.K. in July .
" She is not the type of person who would be involved in drugs , " she added .
Reprieve is worried about her health , especially given her pregnancy , Anna Morris said .
" She became pregnant in prison .
We are concerned that it may not have been consensual , and we are concerned that someone who finds herself in prison at 20 is subject to exploitation , " she said .
She is due to give birth in September , the lawyer added .
Reprieve sent Morris from London to Laos to try to help Orobator , Algar said .
The lawyer arrived there on Sunday and is hoping to visit Orobator on Tuesday , her boss at Reprieve said .
A British consul has also arrived in the country .
" Reprieve heard about her case two weeks ago .
We had thought yesterday the trial was going to start today , " Algar said Monday .
" We have now heard from Anna that it is not going to . "
" I am the first British lawyer who has asked for access to her , " Morris said .
" She needs to have a local lawyer appointed to her .
We are pressing very hard for the local authorities to appoint one . "
She said it was normal in the Laotian justice system for a defendant to get a lawyer only days before a trial .
The last execution in Laos was in 1990 , the foreign affairs spokesman said .
British Foreign Office Minister Bill Rammell issued a statement about Orobator on Saturday .
" The British Government is opposed to the use of the death penalty in all circumstances .
We have made the Laos authorities aware of this at the highest levels in Samantha 's case , " he said .
" We are paying close attention to her welfare and are in regular contact with the Laotian authorities about her case .
British Embassy officials , including the Ambassador , have visited her six times since her arrest , " he said .
" In addition , Britain 's consular representatives in Laos , the Australian Embassy , including the Australian Embassy doctor , have visited Samantha 10 times on our behalf , " he said .
There is no British Embassy in Laos .
A British vice - consul arrived in the country this weekend , the Foreign Office said Monday .
Rammell plans to raise the Orobator case with the Laotian deputy prime minister this week , he said .
Samantha Orobator was born in Nigeria and moved to London with her family when she was 8 , her mother said .
CNN 's Kocha Olarn contributed to this report .
All About Laos
Of all the countries lining up to get under the United States protective shield in the NATO alliance , the Ukraine is the most important for the United States and Russia .
During Soviet times , the Ukraine was the breadbasket of the nation and also housed important industries within its borders .
In addition , the Ukraine has strong cultural ties to Russia .
Right on Russias border , Ukraines admission to a hostile alliance could permanently cripple U.S. relations with Russia .
Although the Bush administration aggressively pushed its reluctant NATO allies to induct the Ukraine and Georgia into the alliance , France , Germany , and others worried about an extremely hostile Russian reaction put their entry on hold .
During his campaign , Barack Obama regrettably endorsed bringing these two countries under the United States NATO umbrella .
But the admission of Ukraine is not in the interests of Russia , the United States , or , surprisingly , even the Ukraine .
Along with the U.S. grab for influence over Caspian Sea oil and gas pipelines and the proposed installation of missile defense facilities in Poland and the Czech Republic , the admission of the Ukraine would naturally make Russia feel encircled .
Even for the United States , however , pledging to defend Ukraine under Article V of the NATO Treaty is a really bad idea .
First , Ukraines bid for NATO membership should be put in the wider context of whether it improves or undermines U.S. security .
( Alliances are not ends in themselves . )
Just continuing to push the informal U.S. Empire east while the Russian bear is weak doesnt address this important issue .
Of all U.S. bilateral relations with nations of the world , in terms of U.S. security , U.S. - Russian relations remain the most important .
In U.S. history , the only threat to the existence of the United States has been the thousands of nuclear weapons of the Soviet Union / Russia .
Other countries , such as China or North Korea , have too few warheads to incinerate the entire United States .
Thus , President Obamas laudable initiative to negotiate with Russia to further reduce U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals should be an extremely high priority in U.S. national security policy .
Abandoning the U.S. push for Ukraines NATO admission and an unneeded , and perhaps ineffective , missile defense system might allow the U.S. to get better results in the much more important bilateral U.S. - Russian talks on the reduction of nuclear weapons .
In any honest assessment of U.S. security goals , the faraway Ukraine is not strategic to the United States .
To Russia , given its history of being invaded by foreign powers , the Ukraine , a large neighboring country , is much more strategic than even its small Baltic neighbors .
For the United States , any showdown with Russia over the NATO - inducted Ukraine ultimately could go nuclear , thus endangering the American homeland .
Furthermore , as the Russian - Georgian war in August of 2008 showed , the faraway United States likely would be largely impotent against Russia , even when it uses only conventional forces in its backyard .
For the United States , Ukraines admission would mean a nearly impossible obligation to defend a country far forward in return for adding only scant military capabilities to the alliance .
For the Ukraine , induction into NATO would mean only a dangerous false sense of security under a paper security guarantee .
The Ukraine would only find out that NATO was a paper guarantee when a crisis broke out and Russia was brandishing conventional or nuclear weapons .
Furthermore , despite the severe strain on the U.S. military induced by two small wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and an economic meltdown that has exacerbated the overextension of an already stretched American Empire , the U.S. policy elite hasnt gotten those messages and is still pushing to expand the empire further .
The push for continued NATO expansion comes from U.S. defense companies , European - American ethnic interest groups , and ideological support from muscular liberals and neo-conservatives .
Even before the economic meltdown , the U.S. accounted for 43 percent of the worlds military spending but only 20 percent of its GDP illustrating the vast overextension of the U.S. Empire .
The United States spends on defense what the next 14 highest nations combined spend on security .
These nations for example , China , India , Russia , Japan , South Korea , and members of the European Union ( EU ) are the United States prime economic competitors .
Most of these countries spending less on defense as a percentage of GDP than the United States experience less drag on their economies and can plough that money into generating economic growth .
Small differentials among nations in economic growth rates can , over time , reorder the standing of great powers .
In the case of the European Union , the United States is actually subsidizing economic competitors by providing for their ultimate security .
Already , the EU has a greater population and GDP than the United States , but spends only half of what the U.S. does on defense .
Also , the EU has 12 times the GDP and 8 times the defense spending of Russia , the only potential threat in the area .
The United States should withdraw from NATO and let its rich allies defend themselves .
Although for the time being , the alliance has refused to allow the Ukraine to have a Membership Action Plan , it says that the Ukraine can still eventually join the alliance .
The Ukraine ought to think twice about such a move .
Relying on the paper security guarantee of NATO membership , it would be human nature for the Ukraine to be feistier in its relations with Russia over issues such as Crimea , natural gas , etc .
But if a reckless leader took power in the Ukraine , such as Georgias President Mikheil Saakashvili , he or she might take advantage of the NATO shield to push the Ukraine into a war with a much stronger Russia .
This leader would discover only too late that the Ukraine is much more strategic to nearby Russia than it is to the distant U.S. and that the U.S. is unwilling to risk nuclear war to defend the Ukraine .
Instead of opting for this false sense of security , the Ukraine should try to join the EU for the economic benefits and be more realistic by simply trying to get along better with Russia .
Good relations will be much easier if the Ukraine is not in an alliance hostile to Russia .
In addition , as a member of NATO , the Ukraines foreign policy would be tied to that of the United States .
At the U.S. behest , NATO has not only expanded its territory in the post - Cold War era , but has violated its defensive charter by expanding its mission to one of offensive warfare outside the treaty area .
It has been involved in places as far flung as Bosnia , Kosovo , and Afghanistan .
The Ukraine , which is working on economic development , might not want to see its resources drained away in military quagmires that dont affect its vital interests .
Polls indicate that the vast majority of Ukrainians are already well aware of the many pitfalls of joining NATO .
Only 20 to 30 percent of them approve of doing so .
The Ukrainian government would be smart to heed public sentiment and reconsider its bid to join the alliance .
INDIA CHEERS WHILE MONSANTO BURNS
by Paul Kingsnorth
" We send today , a very clear message to all those who have invested in Monsanto in India and abroad ; take your money out now , before we reduce it to ashes " .
Karnataka State Farmers Association , India
One of the most morally dubious Claims made in Monsanto 's recent _ newspaper advertising blitz was the assertion that the widespread use of food biotechnology is the only way to feed the world 's poor .
The corporation 's argument went like this : millions of people currently go hungry in developing countries .
In the future , as global population increases , this problem is set to worsen .
Only high yield agriculture can possibly produce enough food to meet this increased demand .
There fore , quite obviously , only " biotechnology can feed the world . "
Monsanto's strategy was to try to por tray its genetically modified ( GM ) crops as the solution to the hunger and poverty problems of the Third World .
The company even tried to round up a group of ' respect ed voices ' from developing countries to endorse an advert entitled ' Let The Harvest Begin ' , which praised biotechnology as the seed of the future " , which will " feed the world in the next century . "
Monsanto was playing a clever game : it was trying to portray opponents of food biotechnology as selfish and insular .
What right , asked the corporation , do well fed Western environ mentalists have to deny the poor farmers of the Third World access to this wonderful new technology , which could teed their families and improve their living standards dramatically in years to come ?
But this tactic is beginning to backfire spectacularly .
In trying to use developing countries as pawns in its game , as it plays for dominance of the world 's food markets , it is alienating the very people it claimed to be supporting : the poor .
In India , where millions of peasant farmers still live a life of small scale , subsistence agriculture , the corporation is facing nothing less than a crisis .
Its trademark evasion , deception and subterfuge has enraged farmers all over the country .
And if it wo n't go voluntarily , they are prepared to chase it out , by any means necessary .
At 1.30 in the afternoon on 28th November 1998 , in Sindhanoor , in the Indi an state of Karnataka , the leader of the Kar nataka State Farmers Association ( KRRS ) , a movement which claims a membership of ten million , arrived at one of India 's first Monsanto test sites .
The owner of the field , Basanna Hunsole , came out to greet him .
With the help of Basanna 's neighbours , a number of KRRS members , other local grassroots organizations representing ' untouchables ' and landless farmers , they proceeded to tear up every one of the genet ically modified cotton plants growing there .
They stacked them in a heap in the middle of the field , and set them on fire .
In minutes , Monsanto 's test crop was reduced to ashes .
This was the first strike in a grassroots campaign that is spreading rapidly across India : ' Operation Cremate Monsanto ' .
Pro fessor Nanjundaswamy , a committed Gandhian and leader of the KRRS , issued a statement to the press as the field burned .
" We denounce the ignorance , incompe tence and irresponsibility of the Union gov ernment to gamble with the future of Indian agriculture , " said the Professor .
He went on to demand that all tests of genetically mod ified crops in India be stopped , that the country 's Patent Act be amended to stop the patenting of basic crop varieties , and that Monsanto be banned from the country .
Otherwise , he said , Indian farmers would continue to take the situation into their own hands .
Since that first action , at least three more Monsanto test sites have been burned , in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh , and more cremations are promised .
The tactic has spread from the KRRS to other grass roots organizations .
In December 1998 , following actions by local farmers and con cern about illegal growing of GM crops , the government of Andhra Pradesh ordered Monsanto to stop the seven trials it was operating in the state .
The first shots have been fired by Indian farmers in what is increasingly looking like a war against the giant corporation .
Monsanto has been operating in India since 1949 , and is a market leader in agri cultural chemicals .
In recent years it has spent much time and money trying to win over Indian politicians and officials to the cause of GM crops , on which it has staked its future .
It operates three Indian sub sidiaries : Monsanto India , Monsanto Enter prises and Monsanto Chemicals , and early in 1998 , Monsanto quietly acquired a 26 per cent stake in the Indian seed company Mahyco .
Mahyco Monsanto is the organization through which Monsanto is attempting to push its GM crops onto the Indian people .
The company is already claiming patent rights over thirty ' new ' crop varieties including corn , rice , tomatoes and potatoes which it has genetically altered to be resistant to its own herbicides .
But Mahy co Monsanto's biggest effort in India at present is going into the testing of GM cot ton .
Cotton is grown widely in India , and Monsanto hopes that its GM variety known as ' bollgard ' cotton can corner this market .
The cotton is modified to be resistant to the boll weevil , a major cotton pest .
Of course , Monsanto would n't be Mon santo without a bit of subterfuge , and this is where the tale gets murkier .
Monsanto apparently does n't trust Indian farmers to swallow its propaganda as easily as it would like .
So , in order to avoid having to persuade farmers of the case for GM crops , it has tried a different tack : growing CM crops on the farmer 's land without telling him .
This is what happened to Basanna Hun sole , on whose land the first cremation took place .
According to the farmer , he was approached in July 1998 by officials from Mahyco Monsanto , who offered him the chance to grow free of charge a new variety of cotton , which they claimed would give him wonderful results .
They omitted to tell him that the cotton was genetically modified , or that it had not been approved for testing by the government .
In effect , Monsanto tricked Basanna Hunsole into unknowingly growing illegal crops on his land .
Moreover , Basanna was unim pressed with what he saw .
Despite Mon santo's claims , he said that the GM ' bollgard ' cotton grew " miserably " , and reached less than half the height of the tra ditional strains he was growing in nearby fields .
Worst of al} , they were heavily infested with boll weevils .
These illegal tests on Basanna
Hun sole 's land were carried out with no safe guards in place .
There was no ' buffer zone ' around the field , and none of the farmer s neighbours was notified of the potentially hazardous crops that were growing near their fields .
Basanna only discovered the truth about what was growing on his land when Karnataka 's Minister of Agriculture publicly announced , in November , the locations of Monsanto 's test sites in the state .
Monsanto had obviously calculated that Indian farmers were easily fooled and too ignorant to bother informing about what was really happening on their own land .
It is this corporate arrogance that has enraged farmers ' groups all over India , and seen support for ' Operation Cremate Monsanto ' spread rapidly since its inception .
After the truth about Basanna Hunsole 's field was discovered , Monsanto belatedly signed a statement in which they admitted their deception , and promised to behave them selves in the future .
But when , a few weeks later , the government of Andhra Pradesh announced it was stopping all Monsanto trials in the state , it cited similar deceptions as the reasons for its decision .
So , what future for Monsanto in India ?
None at all , if another group of campaign ers the ' Monsanto Quit India ' campaign has its way .
' Monsanto Quit India ' is a coalition of NFOs opposed to GM crops , and to Monsanto 's attempts to monopolize Indian agriculture .
It was launched on 9th August 1998 the anniversary of the day when Gandhi famously told the British to ' Quit India ' .
Now , say the coalition , the same message is being sent to Monsanto 's headquarters in Illinois .
The Monsanto Quit India campaign has already distrib uted thousands of ' Quit India ' postcards to NGOs , community groups and farmers across the country .
So far , just four months after the campaign began , over 10,000 peo ple have signed these postcards and sent them to Monsanto 's headquarters .
Resistance to Monsanto , and to their vision of a future where farmers every where will be dependent on global corporations for their livelihood , and where consumers have no choice about the food they eat , is growing fast in India .
The recent decision by the Indian government to allow the mass import of American soya beans is beginning to alert the Indian pub lic to the potential hazards of GM foods .
Campaigners say that , due to the lack of labeling , there is no way of telling whether or not the beans from America are geneti cally modified .
The Monsanto Quit India campaign already claims tens of thousands of sup porters , as do the various organizations and local efforts concentrating on burning Monsanto 's crops until the corporation begins to listen to those who have worked the land for generations .
Perhaps in future , before Monsanto claims that its super crops are the only way to save the people in developing countries from a future of penury and hunger , they might care to ask those people themselves .
In India , at least , they will find themselves increasingly unwelcome .
I ’m not the world ’s greatest Linux fan these days .
I object to the license ( the GPL ) used for the Linux kernel and for the GNU package of core utilities used in the vast majority of Linux - based operating systems ; I dislike the way the GNU project is trying to reinvent Unix in its own bizarre “ not invented here ” image and the larger Linux community is tacitly going along with it ; and I dislike the way the various Linux distributions ’ developer communities tend to be all too willing to take shortcuts toward their various ends , resulting in systems that often either resist customization or lack reliability when one attempts to do anything not explicitly expected by the core developers .
My favorite Linux distribution — for reasons of a balance between easy system management , reliability , and customizability — is Debian , and has been for a while .
I find FreeBSD significantly more reliable , somewhat easier to manage , and no less customizable , but among Linux distributions Debian is still my favorite .
Other distributions I have used , to varying degrees of familiarity , include ( but are not limited to ) :
Damn Small Linux Fedora Core Linux GNUstep Live CD KNOPPIX Mandrake Linux SimplyMEPIS
Linux Slackware Linux SuSE Linux SystemRescue Linux Ubuntu Linux XandrOS Zen Linux
. . . and a few others .
Despite my preference for FreeBSD , my experience with various Linux distributions leads me to believe that yes , Linux is ready for “ the desktop ” .
It ’s also ready for the datacenter , the small office or home office , and “ the enterprise ” .
IBM certainly seemed to think Linux was ready for the enterprise when it produced a Linux television commercial a few years ago :
If there ’s any lack of “ readiness ” for the desktop , it is in the fact that the Linux distributions that are best suited to easy hardware support are also the distributions most likely to make life difficult in ways reminiscent of MS Windows .
There ’s nothing on the order of MS Windows architectural security failures and system resource consumption , of course — but the oppressive “ we know better than you ” interface rigidity of the most “ desktop ” oriented distros is limiting , to put it mildly .
Meanwhile , the systems best suited to customization without breaking things ( a major benefit of using something like Linux rather than MS Windows ) seem to lag significantly more on the hardware support front .
It seems the options in the world of Linux - based OSes are :
only marginally better than MS Windows for customizability , but great at hardware support “ out of the box ”
much , much better than MS Windows — so much better that it ’s not even in the same ballpark — for customizability , but slightly less great at hardware support “ out of the box ” , at least where relatively new hardware is concerned
To compare the two options , I ’ll summarize the recent escapades of my SigO as she tried to get a fully working Linux - based OS running on her new ThinkPad T500 laptop .
Among her requirements for “ fully working ” were solid wireless support , a working CD - RW / DVD drive , and hardware accelerated 3D graphics for World of Warcraft .
The process went something like this :
Try installing the latest Debian Stable release , code named Lenny : fail , because it does n’t even recognize the optical drive , and wo n’t finish installing .
Try installing the latest Ubuntu release , code named Intrepid Ibex : succeed .
Try getting 3D graphics working : succeed .
Try getting wireless working : succeed .
Try getting used to the UI : fail , because it ’s GNOME , about which she says something like “ Damn .
If I wanted the GUI to tell me what to do , I ’d be using Windows ! ”
Try getting IceWM working without a bunch of GNOME crap getting in the way : fail , because the Ubuntu core maintainers have some very bizarre ideas about how package dependencies should be specified .
Try installing the latest Debian Testing release , code named Squeeze : succeed .
Try getting 3D graphics working with World of Warcraft : succeed .
Try getting wireless working : fail , because the Intel 5100 / 5300 drivers are n’t in the Debian Testing kernels .
Try upgrading to a kernel from Unstable / Sid that should support the laptop ’s wireless chipset : succeed .
No , wait : fail , because now the 3D graphics driver is broken .
Try upgrading the driver : fail , because this really sucks and needs to be shot full of holes and left for dead in a ditch somewhere .
Try installing the new latest Ubuntu release , code named Jaunty Jackalope , as a minimal install : succeed .
Try getting wireless working — well , let ’s come back to that after we get the 3D graphics working .
Try getting hardware accelerated 3D graphics working without installing a metric rapload of GNOME and other unnecessary poppycock installed as dependencies for user obsequious tools that for some reason appear to be necessary for getting ATI / AMD drivers installed properly : fail .
Try installing Debian Unstable , code named Sid : succeed .
Try getting 3D graphics working : succeed .
Try getting wireless working : succeed .
Try getting IceWM working : fail , because it ’s Unstable / Sid , and shit just breaks all the damned time .
Change the sources .
list file to use
Testing sources , so that more stable versions of any additional packages she needs will be installed in the future , and she ’ll basically have a Debian Testing / Squeeze system with an Unstable / Sid kernel so she can have 3D graphics for WoW and wireless support on the same computer at the same time : succeed .
Try installing IceWM again : fail .
Try installing Fluxbox instead ( at least it is n’t GNOME ) : succeed .
Try getting used to Fluxbox : in progress .
In short , Linux - based systems are every bit as ready for “ the desktop ” as MS Windows — even more so , in some respects .
You just do n’t get nearly as many of the much - vaunted benefits of Linux - based systems as you might expect , if you want that desktop readiness .
C’est la vie .
This SOB entry was composed on a ThinkPad R52 running FreeBSD , because I care more about my sanity than I do about having WoW running on my laptop .
Of course , if the SigO did n’t have WoW running on her laptop , there ’d only be one computer capable of running the game between the two of us at present , thus preventing us from playing it at the same time .
As a result , I ’m willing to share the insanity of getting things working on her laptop ( and I ’m the guy that came up with the idea of the last hybrid Squeeze / Sid install , in fact ) .
I ’m just glad it does n’t have to be on my laptop .
Still . . .
I ’m eager for the day ATI / AMD hardware accelerated 3D graphics works with open source drivers , so I can have it with FreeBSD and do n’t have to settle for the software accelerated 3D graphics that currently works — and only supports games like Neverwinter Nights , excluding something like World of Warcraft .
While I ’m at it , I ’m waiting for the Chromium browser ( the open source Web browser behind Google Chrome ) to be ported to FreeBSD as well , and for open source Flash player plugins on FreeBSD to catch up with Adobe ’s official , closed source Flash player plugin on MS Windows ( or even for Adobe to get its head out of its fourth point of contact and start offering a FreeBSD compatible version of its Flash player plugin , even if it ’s still closed source at the time ) .
FreeBSD is definitely ready for my “ desktop ” ( technically , my laptop , I guess ) .
If it is n’t , it ’s just the closest thing to being ready for it that exists right now , as far as I ’m aware .
No Linux distribution I ’ve encountered measures up .
As far as how most people mean “ desktop ready ” , though , FreeBSD is n’t up to the standards of the “ desktop ” oriented Linux distributions , MS Windows , and MacOS X .
That ’s pretty sad , considering how easy it would be to get it there , with a little help from hardware vendors that already support Linux - based OSes .
May 19 , 2009 - Zoid
It 's been an interesting week for us here on the Left 4 Dead team .
This Monday , for instance , somebody accidentally told Robin Walker he had the power to fire people .
In other interesting news , the Left 4 Dead team has all been fired .
Lucky for me , Robin 's fired everyone at alphabetical order , and does n't seem to realize there 's a letter after " Y " .
( Do n't tell him . ) .
Since then it 's been pretty quiet .
Every hour or so Robin gets on a horse and chases some Greek kid around .
So for now I 'm safe , and trying to reassemble the team .
Without anyone else to help , I just have this crossword puzzle created by the fine folks at tf2 maps .
net .
So this will have to work as a job application .
If you can get this done , that probably means you can spell , which is a good start .
Surely 2009 is the most sensitive year for peer - to - peer and the industry crusade against free on - line contents sharing .
In Italy we have the previously discussed issues with the incompetence and obscene servility of our representatives , and moving the attention toward Europe things get even worse if possible .
Two in particular are the noticeable questions of these weeks in Europe , the conviction of The Pirate Bay crew and the approval in France of the Sarkozy doctrine also known as three strike law or HADOPI law .
An assault on the heart of P2P
The trial against the people involved in TPB marked a point of no-return in the confrontation between the copyright owners and the P2P users , a community scattered through tens of different platforms that can realistically see in the Swedish Bay one of the main focuses of sharing on its whole .
The Pirate Bay feeds data exchange among more than 20 million BitTorrent peers in any given moment , therefore it ’s understandable that reactions to the conviction of its admins were so many , immediate and sometimes surprising .
After a waiting of a few weeks from the end of the Spectrial , the spectacle - trial promised by the admins of the Bay , the court issued a guilt judgement against the four defendants , all accountable of having facilitated sharing of copyrighted material through TPB .
For Peter “ Brokep ” Sunde , Fredrik “ TiAMO ” Neij , Gottfrid “ Anakata ” Svartholm and Carl Lundström the sentence is the same and comprises a fine of 905,000 dollars ( for a total amount of 3 million dollars or 30 million kronor ) and 1 year in prison .
According to the court the four men acted like a team , were well - aware of the fact that their tracker was used to share “ pirated ” files and very little count Brokep ’s observations on him being a simple spokesman for the crew or the vague connection of businessman Carl Lundström with the three young men and the activities of the site .
The Pirate Bay is illegal as much as the BitTorrent protocol used through it , the court says , and the verdict motivations also mention the fact that the site hosts advertising banners hence it must be considered as a “ commercial ” initiative .
At first the four defendants reacted with astonishment : Brokep defined the verdict “ unreal ” and the jail conviction unexpected , saying he had n’t the money requested by the majors and strengthening with his typical style that “ we would n’t pay if we could .
If I would have money I would rather burn everything I owned “ .
The guilt verdict in the first instance is only the initial phase of a trial destined to last for years , Sunde said , and the appeal is already on its way .
Meanwhile the verdict excited the minds of TPB and P2P supporters mostly in Sweden , where the day after the Pirate Party arranged a protest in Stockholm crowding a thousand people .
“ Politicians have declared war on our entire generation “ , the party leader Rick Falkvinge said to the crowd , blaming the deputies for their digital illiteracy and repeating that “ The Pirate Bay is a completely legitimate service that transmits information between people ” and after a verdict like this “ no one can feel secure when linking to a YouTube clip on its website “ .
That this simply is n’t one of the many cases of legal fight against file sharing is demonstrated by the huge growth in popularity for the aforementioned Pirate Party , that in just three weeks after the verdict saw its members triplicate until it became the third largest party in Sweden .
The strife has been catalyzed in a political movement that seems to be ready to go to Bruxelles after the upcoming elections for the European Parliament , Falkvinge states he is “ extremely optimistic ” and is willing to reform copyright in Europe turning it into an obligation exclusively suitable for commercial activities .
On the TPB blog Brokep has invited everybody to calm down , has assured that the site will continue to work as usual and has urged anyone to share more than ever crying aloud “ We ’re All the Pirate Bay “ .
The technological wing of the protest has thought up the so - called Operation Baylout , inviting the users to overwhelm the industry and its lawyers with the result of inducing traditional and not that much traditional DDoS attacks .
What contrariwise reacted pretty badly to the verdict were the Swedish BitTorrent trackers , sites like NordicBits that closed en masse fearing for the possible implications of the Bay surrender .
The verdict against The Pirate Bay is “ way over the top ” , frontman of Snow Patrol band Gary Lightbody has stated criticizing the jail punishment and acknowledging the file sharing as a fundamental technology that is here to stay .
The majors and their representatives obviously do n’t agree , urged by the clamorous success in Sweden to oblige the providers to block the access to TPB , to prosecute Sunde & fellows in other countries too and to push harder on the conviction requiring new fines and preparing new charges , including the one initially removed from the trial to treat The Pirate Bay as a service of direct copyright infringement .
The Spectrial goes on with the appeal requests individually submitted by the four defendants , and promises to be even more spectacular than it has been until now starting with the criticism about lacking of objectivity toward the court that leaded the trial .
It has been recently discovered that Tomas Norström , the judge that issued the verdict , is a well - known friend of the majors involved in several pro-copyright organizations .
The best part is that to verify the good will of Norström they called Ulrika Ihrfelt , another assured supporter of the industry reasons , and lastly a panel of three judges including Anders Eka , previously a colleague of lawyers Monique Wasted and Peter Danowsky ( representing the majors in the trial ) in the Stockholm Center for Commercial law .
Politics enslaved by the lobbies
The conviction of The Pirate Bay crew aroused strong reactions and drove the majors to continue to fight P2P , but the real threat to face within the next months is the “ three strike law ” , the spectre of forced disconnections that started to wander through all Europe after having been ultimately approved by the French Parliament .
The new law establishes the obligation for providers to send out two warnings to the customers that according to the industry associations have infringed copyright , and if the aforementioned customers will not change their habits they will be cut off from the Internet for at least a year even if they will have to continue to pay the connection bills .
The HADOPI law allows the majors to overtake the judiciary power , and what ’s worse it tears apart the principle of Internet access as a fundamental right of European citizens as recently stated by the EU Parliament .
The three strike law has been definitely approved in France but its shadow was spreading way before in any corner of Europe : in Ireland the contents industry threatens the ISPs asking them to set up forced disconnections for users , the same as in the United Kingdom and in Spain where the industry also pretends that providers pay an extra fee for all the copyright infringements occurring on their networks .
Against the adoption of the three strike law in UK is the music veteran Billy Bragg , who on the Guardian complains about the inability of the industry to adapt itself to the technology revolution of P2P and free access to music contents , evoking “ some form of P2P subscription service ” as the only possible solution because it is “ the most convenient way for consumers to access music “ .
According to Bragg the true reason for which the recording labels do not want to follow that way is the fact that it implies the loss of control on contents distribution .
Other than being the wrong solution to a problem that does only exist within the interests of labels executives , the three strike law also threatens to be a disaster from a technical standpoint : BayTSP , one of the companies the labels started to use to issue the infamous infringement warnings to users , does its work with no proper security policy letting Google index the aforementioned warnings and using a web platform vulnerable to Cross - Site Scripting ( XSS ) attacks .
The supposed future of copyright defense is born already dead , apparently .

BBC News , Baghdad
Iraq 's government says that 355 Iraqis were killed in April , making it the bloodiest month so far this year .
The bulk of the deaths came from a number of big explosions , and the death count did not include at least 80 Iranian pilgrims killed in Iraq .
April was also the deadliest month for US troops since September , with 18 soldiers killed .
The casualties are nowhere near the 2006 - 07 levels when the insurgency and sectarian strife were at their peak .
Worrying trend
The figure of 355 Iraqis killed in April is mainly made up of 290 civilians , but it also includes 65 soldiers or policemen , who are often the targets of attacks .
The figures , issued by three Iraqi ministries , showed a 40 % rise over March .
This is mainly because of several very big bomb attacks , including four in the space of just two days , in which at least 150 people were killed .
In both 2006 and 2007 , the average monthly death toll for civilians alone was over 2,000 .
Nonetheless , the trend shown by these and other casualty estimates since January this year has been creeping month by month , and that has to be a worrying development , as American troops start withdrawing .
The same trend seems to be reflected in US military casualties .
Eighteen Americans died in April , the highest number since last September , but also , far below their worst months in 2006 and 2007 , when more than 100 died each month .
Iraqi leaders and US military officials are playing down the upward trend .
They say the bomb devices are cruder than in the past , and they are failing to stir up the kind of sectarian reaction which happened before .
Now that Obama is officially in office , I 'm faced with the sobering thought that , as a black man , I 'm no longer the underdog , struggling to overcome a racist power structure in which someone who looks like me can never hope to become somebody .
Thanks for raising the bar , Barack , you ass ; now I have to , like , achieve something .
Before , when I sat in my cubicle at work with my legs propped up , licking Cheeto stains off my fingers for hours on end ( so stubborn ! ) , I had the safety net of institutionalized racism holding a brotha down .
When my old lady would ask why I did n't get that promotion , I 'd just say , " You know how it is . "
( Nod accordingly . )
Then my son J.J. would say something was " dy - no - mite , " and we'd all have a big laugh as we sat down to a fried Spam dinner .
But that 's all shot to hell now .
There was a lot less pressure when people assumed that all I could do was dance , rap and play basketball .
If I did more , then good for me ; I 'm a credit to my race .
If I did less , then , well , you know how it is .
( Nod accordingly .
Mumble something about cracker - ass crackers . )
Now , people look at me like I 'm a shiftless Negro if I do n't organize a protest against the price hike on jalapeño poppers in the cafeteria .
Also , they 're disappointed to learn that my oratory skills are restricted to morally awkward quotes from New Jack City .
( It seems that " Cancel that bitch ! " is not an appropriate response to " How 's your wife ? " )
Face it , everyone likes to feel a little oppressed now and then .
There 's a coolness about being the embittered , persecuted rebel .
That 's why they make t- shirts of Malcolm X and Che Guevara and not Al Roker or Charo .
Now , though , the prevailing opinion is that I 'm no longer oppressed , that I 'm part of some privileged class with expectations of not only upward mobility , but upward supremacy .
Finally I realize how hard white people have had it all these years .
Maybe if I get a perm and change my name , I can pass for Iranian .
Then I 'd reclaim the hatred my forefathers worked so long to cultivate .

Media architecture collective Urban Alliance has recently finished the Moodwall : a 24 meter long interactive light installation in Amsterdam .
The Moodwall is situated in a pedestrian tunnel and interacts with people passing by , improving the atmosphere in the tunnel and making people happy and feel less unsafe .
The interactive urban wallpaper is built out of about 2500 leds behind a ribbed semi-transparent wall .
The curves in the wall make it less suitable for grafitti and improve the visibility of the content for the side .
The resolution is horizontally stretched so the images of the screen are better for the side so people are stimulated to watch the screen from outside the tunnel .
This prevents the tunnel to become a hang - out spot .
The Moodwall is a pilot project for a 70 meter long media wall proposal by Urban Alliance ( in collaboration with Daan Hartoog ) which won a competition for ideas to improve the public space of the social unsafe area of the Amsterdam Bijlmer .
Urban Alliance is a collaboration of :
Studio Klink ( architecture and design ) Illuminate ( interactive lighting and video content ) Cube ( building and development )
The Moodwall was designed by Jasper Klinkhamer ( Studio Klink ) in collaboration with Remco Wilcke ( Cube ) , who was also responsible for the construction .
The content was developed by Hans van Helden and Matthijs ten Berge of Illuminate in collaboration with artist Matthias Oostrik and students of the dutch art academy HKU .

Love Land had been due to open in October
China 's first sex theme park , aimed at improving both the sex education and the sex life of its visitors , has been torn down before it even opened .
The owners were " interested only in profiting from sensationalism , " the China Daily reported one official said .
Due to open in Chongqing in October , Love Land was to have included displays of giant genitalia , naked bodies and an exhibition on the history of sex .
The park was set to offer workshops on sex technique and safe - sex methods .
But the plans left Chongqing officials red-faced , correspondents say .
The officials called the planned park " vulgar , ill - minded and misleading " , said China Daily .
" Sex is a taboo subject in China but people really need to have more access to information about it , " the park 's manager , Lu Xiaoqing told the China Daily state newspaper before the park was demolished .
" We are building the park for the good of the public .
I have found that the majority of people support my idea , but I have to pay attention and not make the park look vulgar and nasty . "
Among the attractions had been a giant rotating statue of the lower part of a nearly naked woman .
Manitoba Parks Now Free for Next Two Years
By Sarah Klein
Beginning today , all Manitoba provincial parks will be admission free for the next two years .
Manitobans can put away their wallets at the gates of such destinations as Asessippi , Bakers Narrows , Grand Beach , Manipogo , Rainbow Beach , Turtle Mountain and Whiteshell provincial parks .
The waived park fees are estimated to save park - goers $ 2.6 million .
The government is hoping eliminating park fees will stimulate the provincial economy during these tough economic times , and encourage Manitobans and visitors to enjoy and explore our provincial parks .
All good things must come to an end eventually — park fees will be reinstated April 30 , 2011 .
If only they ’d do the same for federal parks , or at least discount the admission .
" Indeed , if deflation threats eventually do become more apparent , the Fed may have a solution on its hands .
“ Thank you Washington — along with postage , subway fares etc. — the government is a significant source of inflationary pressures , ” said John Ryding and Conrad DeQuadros at RDQ Economics "
While the overall U.S. CPI stayed unchanged due to zealous use of seasonal adjustment ( unadjusted it rose 0.2 % ) , the so - called core index which some like rose 0.3 % .
No need to worry about inflation though , because fans of the core index at that point always come up with some " core core " index .
What other item should be excluded so as to create a " core core " index varies of course depending on just what sub-item increases particularly much that particular month .
This month it was tobacco prices , which rose sharply , largely due to the federal tax increase implemented by Obama and his fellow Democrats , as well as some additional tax increases in some states ( though actually the price rose even more than the average amount of the tax increases ) .
But since deflation is supposedly the big worry , and since the tax increase was so successful in raising tobacco prices , that means that some economists now see a new solution to deflation : raise taxes !
Quote from the Wall Street Journal Indeed , government has long found ways to raise prices , in addition to the traditional method of printing money .
From taxes to regulation to slaughtering cows to reduce milk production .
That all of this means reduced consumer purchasing power is apparently irrelevant .
Health in the Year 2050
by Bill Sardi by Bill Sardi
DIGG THIS
It ’s the year 2050 .
There are half as many doctors in the U.S. as there were in the year 2010 .
Mortality rates have been slashed by 90 % and over 70 % of the population now lives to the age of 120 years in good health .
Thanks to resveratrol - fortified soft drinks and dietary supplements , senility due to Alzheimer ’s disease is a thing of the past .
By law , all foods must be fortified with Vitamin D in amounts that boost immunity so that winter - time cold and flu epidemics have been eliminated .
Since vaccines are no longer needed , childhood autism no longer is reported .
Since it was found that vitamin D hardens dental enamel , drinking water is no longer fluoridated for that purpose , and childhood dental decay has been drastically reduced .
High - dose vitamin D pills have replaced penicillin to treat bacterial infections , and more stubborn bacterial , viral or fungal infections are now treated with allicin pills , derived from garlic .
By using these natural antibiotics , germ - resistance is no longer reported .
Since the inclusion of rice bran into cereals , bread and other baked goods , diabetes now rarely occurs before the age of 100 .
Cholesterol - lowering drugs are no longer employed since they never were shown to lower mortality rates and it was later revealed that government health authorities created this misdirection long ago in an effort to covertly reduce birth rates and population growth ( cholesterol being a precursor for sex hormones — estrogen and testosterone ) .
Atherosclerosis is now treated as a disease of progressive calcification of arteries and heart valves that begins once childhood growth is completed .
Natural molecules ( vitamin D , vitamin K , magnesium , rice bran , resveratrol and lignans ) , which retain calcium in bones or prevent calcium from crystallizing , are widely employed to cleanse arteries , kidneys , eyes , brain and liver from excessive calcium .
Once diagnosed , cancer is treated at home with intravenous vitamin C , high - dose vitamin D , resveratrol and allicin pills .
Twenty - year survival rates after initial diagnosis are now in the range of 90 % .
The fortification of folic acid in foods has virtually eliminated birth defects , cervical cancer and other malignancies , and has measurably improved brain function in senior adults .
Adults now attend clinics where a non-invasive eye - scan measurement of lipofuscin , a marker of cellular aging , is obtained so that citizens now know their biological as well as chronological age .
Family members can no longer estimate your age by pictures in the family photo album .
Grey hair and wrinkles are a thing of the past .
By inclusion of a molecule called hyaluronan into mayonnaise , beverages , salad dressings and food supplements , most adults maintain youthful - looking skin , thick hair and flexible joints throughout life .
The striking disappointment is that all of this was known over 40 years ago but entrenched financial interests prevented these health practices from being implemented in a timely manner .
Got Hemp ?
Created : April 01 , 2009 13:32 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Well , you might have a bit more if Reps.
Barney Frank ( D - Mass . ) and Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) get their way .
The two lawmakers have plans to reintroduce legislation to legalize the domestic farming of industrial hemp , a genetic but non-psychoactive relative of marijuana .
Hemp advocates ( yes , there are hemp advocates out there ) argue that the change would benefit the economy at a time when it could certainly use the boost .
“ Hemp is a versatile , environmentally - friendly crop that has not been grown here for over 50 years because of a politicized interpretation of the nation ’s drug laws by the Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) , ” Eric Steenstra , president of Vermont - based Vote Hemp , said in a statement .
“ Jobs would be created overnight , as there are numerous U.S. companies that now have no choice but to import hemp materials valued at $ 360 million in annual retail sales and growing . ”
Any number of domestic businesses — from soap makers to auto suppliers — use industrial hemp in their products , but the hemp must be farmed overseas and imported .
( Nearly every other industrialized country in the world already produces the crop . )
The Frank - Paul bill , Steenstra said , “ will return us to more rational times when the government regulated marijuana , but allowed farmers to continue raising industrial hemp just as they always had . ”
The Obama administration has already shown some signs that it plans to move the country ’s drug policy away from the “ war on drugs ” mentality that ’s marked the last few decades .
Support for the Frank / Paul bill would be another signal that it ’s serious .

" Your halo is a little two steps to the right . "
Is it really surprising to anyone that a 47 year old woman can have a great voice ?
( Opera , Aretha Franklin , etc ? )
Is it surprising to anyone that an overweight or homely woman can have a great voice ?
( Madonna , Coldplay , etc? ( Zing ! ) )
3 . Could it possibly be surprising to Simon Cowell ?
After seven years of Britain 's Got 10 p Text Messaging , he was suddenly caught off guard ?
" I said , ' my darling , you look wonderful to - night . ' "
And look , he wore a tie !
I can assume everyone has seen the clip of Susan Boyle singing I Dream A Dream onEveryone loves an underdog .
Everyone loves a high horse , too : " take that , you prejudicial prigs , who expect a good voice to only come out of slinky blondes with belly rings .
" Myself , I do n't expect itout of slinky blondes , though I 'll admit Iit better .
But despite my fascination with slinky blondes , I have never bothered to find one that sang on Youtube .
I did , however , against all better judgment , go look for this clip .
And there 's the rub .
Let 's step back and ask some questions :
No .
Which brings me to the 3rd question : That I smell a rat is besides the point .
My first instinct is that Simon had already heard her sing , or maybe even specifically recruited her to come for an audition because of her 1999 single Cry Me A River
This does n't take away from her ability -- she can sing a tune , that 's for damn sure .
But what 's relevant point here is what is being done .
Regardless of whether Simon knew about her beforehand , her performance has now been packaged and marketed in a different way , specifically for you , based on what they know you like .
This further reinforces those preferences on your part .
In other words , they are giving you what you want , andto want the next thing .
Watch the clip , the editing , thethey are writing : how they contrast from shots of cynical audience members , then cut back and forth to the hosts and audience as they look on in amazement .
That 's all done after the fact .
the performance .
The live studio audience is legitimately impressed as it happens ; but the Youtube viewers areto be impressed by the slick Hollywood movie they are watching .
If you had stumbled upon a clip of her singing into a webcam in her kitchen , you might say , " wow , whaddya know " and then gone back to porn or stock quotes .
But when you are told " go see this ( highly produced ) clip " then you believe they hype .
It 's putting a $ 100 price tag on a bottle of wine , and therefore liking it more .
is n't trying to eventually find the next winner so they can give them a record deal ; it 's trying to get viewers , ad revenue , and text messages .
You do n't do that with another slinky blonde -- to sell records yes ; but to get TV viewers no -- you do it with someone who is going to appeal to the show 's demographic .
What you want is a shot of Simon -- the eye candy for the target demographic -- looking dreamy eyed .
It 's not a talent show , it 's a docudrama .
Let 's peek at the meta - script 's next act .
Boyle 's awesome , but where 's the drama ?
Who is going to be her nemesis on the show ?
You might first consider a slinky blonde -- but that would n't work because it 's not polarizing , there 's no tug of war .
You want someone who pulls at the same viewer who likes Boyle , but in a different way , to create inner tension .
In other words , you want a cute kid .
A 20 year old wants to love someone who ultimately wins and hate someone who eventually loses .
A 40 year old wants to love two people , and be sad when it ends for one of them .
Part of this , as one clever reader emailed me , is that Boyle 's story fits the theme of my favorite generation : even at 47 , you could still possibly have your life activated and assume your rightful place in your movie .
Not through hard work or perseverance , of course , but simply by being discovered .
" But hold on -- she did work hard to be able to sing that well !
" Sure -- but notice that 's not part ofstory that they are telling you .
They deliberately emphasize her backwards , never been kissed , works in a diner persona .
" Oh , I 've just sung in my church choir . "
Really ?
Is that all ?
She can be the undiscovered , " ? " neglected talent ; the kid can be the budding prodigy , " Undiscovered is the new porn .
To repeat : none of this detracts from Boyle 's excellent voice , or her chance to make from this what she can .
But do not think the gods smiled on Susan Boyle and , lo , she has been discovered .
Susan Boyle , plant or not , is a character in a well scripted movie , with the only theme that will get people to sit in front of the telly nowadays : Everything you see from now on will have been carefully scripted and choreographed .
Everything , that is , except the unfortunate crash that always seems to come at the end of these dramas .
When everyone has to go back to real life .
And by everyone , I mean you .
Walter
White did a bad , bad thing
It should go without saying , but I ’m going to say it anyway :
If you ’re a “ Breaking Bad ” viewer and have n’t yet seen last Sunday ’s episode , then you may want to just skip to the next post , because there are serious spoilers ahead .
Are they gone ?
Yeah ?
Good .
Chemistry - teacher - turned - drug - kingpin Walter
White has done some sketchy things in his day , but facing imminent death with no financial safety net for his family , it was n’t too difficult to give him a pass .
But over the course of the second season , this has changed .
Walter ’s cancer is in remission , and he ’s scheduled for a surgery that could cure him completely .
But instead of winding down his life of crime , he insists on expanding it .
Part of the problem is that he ’s realized how boring his life is without it .
His marriage is teetering on the edge of disaster , and producing meth is the one thing in his life that he has mastered .
In last week ’s episode , “ Mandala , ” Walter chose to make a huge transaction ( ~ $ 1.2 million ) instead of rushing to the hospital to be with his wife as she gave birth .
But in Walter ’s mind , it was no choice at all .
If he did n’t make the deal , he would miss out on any future opportunities with one of the biggest ( and most careful ) drug runners in the Southwest .
You see , for Walter , it ’s no longer about the money or providing security for his family .
It ’s more about his being a success , despite what his friends and family think .
This week ’s episode — “ Phoenix ” — Walter made a decision that will no doubt come back to haunt him .
After a random meeting at a bar with the father of Jesse ’s girlfriend , Walter went back to Jesse ’s house ( out of guilt and affection for the boy ) to try to keep him from continuing down the road of drug abuse .
High on heroin , Jesse and Jane were laying on their sides , so as to not choke on their own vomit in their sleep .
Walter tried to rouse Jesse , and as he shook him , Jane was pushed over onto her back .
She started to vomit and choke , and after starting to help her , Walter made the decision to let her die .
Jane was pretty nasty to Walter , and he never knew her when she was sober .
So , to him , she was the one leading Jesse to his demise .
He thought that by letting her die , he was helping Jesse .
Maybe this will in fact be the best thing for young Mr. Pinkman , but it does n’t matter —
Walter effectively killed Jane .
Had he never showed up at the house , Jane would n’t have been on her back and she would n’t have died in her sleep .
Sure , we must suspend disbelief when thinking about the randomness of the meeting between Walter and Jane ’s father in the bar .
It was the father ’s words that ultimately led to his daughter ’s death .
He convinced Walter ( however indirectly ) to go back to Jesse ’s house .
If only he knew .
Throughout the entire season , we ’ve been treated with shots of the White home after some sort of explosion .
There are men in chemical suits collecting evidence .
With one episode left , I have no earthly idea how we get from point Y to point Z. Jesse will wake up to find Jane dead and wo n’t know that Walter had anything to do with it .
Walter ’s new business partner is probably happy with his product and should n’t have any reason to destroy his house .
Walter does n’t have any chemicals on site , so my only theory is that the work he did a few weeks ago underneath the house turns out to be faulty and causes the explosion .
It will be a little bit of a letdown if those scary scenes have nothing to do with Walter ’s side business , but since the show has already been renewed for a third season , it ’s doubtful that anyone in his personal life will find out about his hobby anytime soon .
Several leading scientists have sent a letter to the Texas State Board of Education urging board members to reject an amendment that attacks one of evolution 's key principles , that all life on Earth is descended from a common ancestor .
Leading members of the Texas scientific community , in collaboration with the American Association for the Advancement of Science ( AAAS ) , urged the state board " to reject amendments to the state 's draft science standards that would undermine sound science teaching , " according to an AAAS statement released today .
The board is to take a final vote on the standards on Friday .
< script type =" text / javascript " charset = " utf - 8 " language= " javascript " src= "
http://static.polldaddy.com/p/1484486.js "></script><noscript> < a href = " http://answers.polldaddy.com/poll/1484486/ "
> What 's your advice for the Texas school board ?
</a> < br/> < span style = " font - size:9px ; " > ( < a href = " http://www.polldaddy.com " > online polls</a>)</span></noscript>
The letter , sent yesterday , was addressed to Chairman Don McLeroy and the other members of the Texas board .
In it , the scientists said certain amendments , introduced and approved during the January 2009 board meeting , " would mislead students should they make it into the final standards . "
Among other things the pending amendment says students should " analyze and evaluate the sufficiency and insufficiency of common ancestry . "
But scientists say there is no real argument about common ancestry , one of the foundational concepts of evolution .
" The scientific consensus is that evolution is the backbone of modern biology and many other fields of science , underlying advances in areas such as agriculture and medicine , " the scientists write .
The letter acknowledges that the board " did the students of Texas a great service " when it earlier rejected insertion of language in the science standards that spoke of the " weaknesses " of evolutionary theory .
Critics fear that the amendment , using the terms " sufficiency and insufficiency , " is little different from the earlier effort to raise questions about evolution .
Downplaying evolution 's place in science " only serves to confuse students , " the scientists say in their letter to the board .
The letter also notes that pending revisions to the Earth and Space Science standards " introduce unwarranted uncertainty to long - settled scientific issues " such as the processes of planet formation .
" We urge you to vote for removing anti-science changes to the draft standards and protect the future of science education and technology - based industry in Texas , " the scientists write .
The letter was signed by Alan I. Leshner , chief executive officer of AAAS , and David E. Daniel , president of the University of Texas at Dallas and 2009 president of The Academy of Medicine , Engineering and Science of Texas ( TAMEST ) .
They were joined by 23 others , including Francisco G. Cigarroa , chancellor of the University of Texas System , and Robert F. Curl , a Nobel laureate in chemistry at Rice University .
Evolution has another unlikely supporter in former president George W. Bush , who in the waning days of his administration said he does n't think that his belief that God created the world is " incompatible with the scientific proof that there is evolution . "
The movement on Halladay ’s pitches can be seen in numbers compiled by the Inside Edge scouting service .
Batters swung and missed at only 15 percent of his strikes , about the major league average .
But they made solid contact only 7 percent of the time , one of the better rates in the league  the pitches looked good , but they flitted from the bat barrel at the last second .
Halladay ’s 206 strikeouts last year , a career high , were all but unintentional .
“ Really , I try and avoid them , ” he said .
“ My main goal is to get ahead and get balls put in play early .
It was n’t something I tried to do .
But if you get ahead in the count quickly and you have a chance to put guys away , you do it . ”
The hits Halladay does allow do little damage .
The Yankees ’ Johnny Damon has rapped him worse than almost any hitter  a .338 career average  but conceded , “ When I get the hits , it ’s with nobody on base . ”
Sure enough , with 27 hits in 80 at - bats against Halladay , Damon has only two runs batted in , one on a solo home run .
It is almost unfathomable now , but when this decade began , Halladay was a failed major leaguer .
He had been Toronto ’s first - round draft pick out of his Colorado high school and reached the majors in 1998 with a bang  he came within one out of a no-hitter against Detroit in his second start  but he devolved just as fast , sticking with a conventional four - seam fastball with no deception and less success .
It all collapsed in 2000 , when Halladay posted a 10.64 E.R.A. in 67 2/3 ghastly innings .
( Learning that the worst E.R.A. for a pitcher throwing at least 50 innings belongs to the great Roy Halladay is like opening Mozart ’s desk drawer and discovering the worst sonata in history . )
He was sent back to the minor leagues the next spring , all but lost .
“ I saw him in Pawtucket laboring , throwing 88 miles an hour tops , and searching for an out pitch and his command , ” the Astros scout Paul Ricciarini said .
“ Anyone could have had him .
Anyone could have had him for a body , basically . ”
The Jays ’ pitching guru , Mel Queen , rebuilt Halladay in the minors .
Queen outlawed the four - seam fastball and lowered Halladay ’s arm angle to generate more movement on a sinker and cutter .
Halladay pitched well after his July 2001 return to Toronto .
Over the next two seasons , he went 41 - 14 and won the Cy Young Award in 2003 .
He paid for throwing 266 innings that season with some shoulder problems the next year , but has been consistently outstanding ever since .
It is getting easier by the day to release your music and build a music career without the backing of a label .
That 's an exciting thing for musicians , and for a lot of people , it 's the best choice .
On the other hand , there 's a tendency for the DIY route to be romanticized .
In reality , like any other kind release , the choice to self - release your music comes with pros and cons ( just like a ​major label deal and an indie label deal ) .
Before you decide to self - release your album , do n't forget to weigh up these factors .
The Pros of Self - Releasing an Album
You Keep Your Rights : Forget worrying about confusing contracts , expensive lawyers , and accidentally signing over your music , your vision , and perhaps your first born child to some record label for life .
You 're not very well going to trap yourself in a bad deal now , are you ?
You decide how your music is used when it is used , and how much people have to pay to use it , end of story .
You Keep the Cash : Ever marvel at the way that some extremely successful musicians are seemingly flat broke ?
Sure , sometimes they 're in that position because they bought things like , say , gold plated gates , but often they 're in the position because they 're last on the list to be paid .
Every person that comes in to help with your career gets a cut , but when you 're doing it yourself , you get to eat the whole pie .
You Make It ( Or Don't ) On Your Own Terms :
Even the most laid back and artist - friendly independent label is bound to have a few limitations in mind when it comes to projects they 're willing to work on with you , and major labels can be extremely demanding .
Some labels may want to send you back to the studio when you decide to change musical directions , or they may demand you adopt a " look " for marketing purposes .
There are lots of ways you can clash creatively with a label , and depending on what kind of deal you have , sometimes the label will win .
When you 're the one putting out the music , you release the music you want , and only the music you want , when you want to release it .
The marketing , the touring , and all of the decision will be made by you , so there will be none of the typical conflicts .
The Cons of Self - Releasing an Album
This cool Dog Light Design is extremely cute .
It is simple , yet seems fun and practical enough to want and have in your home .
As an actual cat lover , I would still add this fun light design called Wants and Needs as a way to bring a dog into my home besides an Automatic Dog Door .
Without the dirt , smell , or shedding hair , this dog light could be a great alternative for the real pet .
It does function as you could expect from a real dog by turning the light on and off by petting its snout .
I ’m sure dog lovers would n’t agree of replacing their dogs , but they can always stick with their loved pet , and use it as another way to profess their love .
Getting wind of the future 's energy needs
By Sun Xiaohua ( China Daily )
Updated : 2009-05-04 07:49
China has set a target for renewable energy consumption of 40 percent of the market by the year 2050 .
The news comes as it emerges that China will have 100 GW of wind power capacity by 2020 , more than three times the 30 GW the government set as a target 18 months ago .
It 's also been revealed that China will become the biggest growth market for wind power generating capacity this year , ahead of the United States , which has been worse - hit by the economic downturn , according to the Global Wind Energy Council ( GWEC ) .
China is the fourth largest producer of wind power after the United States , Germany and Spain .
The annual growth rate in wind power in China will be about 20 percent , Fang Junshi , head of the coal department of the National Energy Administration , told a Coaltrans conference in Beijing .
China , the world 's second largest energy user , has around 12 GW of wind power capacity and has said it wants to raise that to around 20 GW by next year .
That means wind is set to be a bigger source of power than nuclear , despite a construction boom in nuclear power plants , and far bigger than solar , which is expected to hit 1.8 GW by 2020 , according to a 2007 plan .
More than 27 GW of wind power generating plants worth about $ 53 billion were built around the world last year .
Demand for power in China has been spurred by economic stimulus measures .
" China is powering ahead with no visible signs of slowing down , " said Steve Sawyer of the Brussels - based GWEC .
" If anything it is accelerating .
They intend to become the largest market in the world , very clearly , and they probably will unless things take off in the US again in the relatively near term . "
A wind farm dominates the landscape in Gansu province .
[ Zhang Heping ]
China 's local wind turbine manufacturing industry has " grown dramatically " as power production has expanded , Sawyer said .
Local manufacturers , dominated by Sinovel Wind Co , Xinjiang Goldwind Science & Technology Co and Dongfang Electric Corp , captured more than half the domestic market for the first time in 2007 , rising to between 75 percent and 80 percent last year .
" Although all the big international brands are there and their markets are growing in absolute terms , their market share is diminishing pretty rapidly , " Sawyer said .
The growth in Chinese wind turbine manufacturing means Chinese - made equipment is poised to emerge in the international wind market " in earnest " , Sawyer said .
Until now , Chinese suppliers have only won smaller contracts in the US , Cuba , Peru , Africa and the Middle East , he said .
Danish company Vestas , the world 's largest wind turbine maker , plans to invest $ 9 million in its factory in Inner Mongolia to produce about 800 sets of V60 - turbines every year .
These turbines are specially tailored for Inner Mongolia 's low to medium strength winds , being shorter with bigger blades than standard turbines .
The factory will employ an additional 1,000 Chinese people , about half of its current local employees .
The company , which entered the Chinese market in 1986 , has a market share of about 12 percent .
This pales in comparison with local competitors such as Sinovel , Goldwind and DEC , which took about 65 percent of market share in 2008 , according to Shi Pengfei , vice - president of the China Wind Energy Association .
More wind farms are being constructed all the time as the demand for renewable energy increases .
[ Liu Jian ]
The World Wind Energy Report 2008 predicts that Asia , under China 's lead , will " become the worldwide locomotive for the wind industry " and " Chinese wind turbine manufacturers will be among the top international suppliers " .
Wang Jun , director of the National Energy Administration 's renewable energy department , said : " Renewable energy will become the mainstream power supply in 2050 from a supplementary role in 2010 . "
He envisaged a future with heating dependent on solar and geothermal power , cars driven using biofuels and families owning their own photovoltaic power stations , turning the country from the world 's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases to one of its smallest .
However , some are worried that too much attention and aid is being paid to the renewable energy industry .
They argue China should focus on clean coal technology .
" Renewable energy is our destiny , but it is not the solution to China 's urgent problem of large - scale coal burning , " said Feng Xiaoting , director of Jiangsu Coal Chemical Engineering Institute .
He said he believes that in the next 30 to 40 years , traditional energy , especially coal , will still be the powerhouse for China 's growth .
He said clean coal technology research and development should be prioritized .
Bangkok protesters ' feel they have been robbed of political power ' guardian.co.uk
Thai courts have issued arrest warrants for the former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra and 13 anti-government protesters blamed for one of the worst weeks of violence in the country 's recent history .
Demonstrators have vowed to return to the streets unless the country 's political system is reformed , regardless of the legal threat and the overwhelming military force used against them in recent days .
Faced by armoured personnel carriers and armed troops , 3,000 red-shirted protesters capitulated in Bangkok today , ending a bloody three - week period with a plume of black smoke , a cascade of water and a noisy retreat parade .
The demonstrators , many in tears , retreated from Government House .
Four ringleaders handed themselves in to the police as hundreds of gun-toting troops surrounded their last stronghold .
Their leaders are charged with illegal assembly and creating a public disturbance , which carry prison terms of between three and seven years .
The accusations add to the legal pressure against Thaksin , who called on his supporters via video phone last weekend to launch a revolution against the Thai government .
Thaksin 's ousting as PM has been at the heart of three years of political turmoil .
The former premier , who won two landslide election victories , fled into self - imposed exile last year before he was charged with violating a conflict of interest law .
His supporters backed down peacefully after at least two people were killed and 117 injured in yesterday 's violent clashes .
They set fire to two buses , ignited gas canisters and hosed the streets with water from a stolen fire engine , but there was no direct conflict with soldiers massed behind armoured personnel carriers and armed with M16 rifles and percussion grenades .
" This is not the end .
We 'll come back , " said one protest leader , Nattawut Saikuar , after a farewell address to supporters .
He said the protest leaders would meet after the Songkran new year festival to " discuss our next move " .
The rebels , who identify themselves with red shirts and are mostly from Thailand 's poorest classes , surrounded Government House in the last week of March .
They called for new elections and the resignation of the prime minister , Abhisit Vejjajiva , whom they accuse of being a military puppet .
In a televised address , Abhisit said the soldiers had restored order but more needed to be done to heal the divisions that have emerged in Thai society .
" If it is victory , it is a victory of society that peace and order has returned , " he said .
But he urged continued vigilance .
" The operation under the state of emergency is not completed .
There are still things to do , " he said .
He praised the " soft methods " of the security forces and blamed the two deaths on the protesters .
Thaksin accused the military of covering up the number of killings .
The clashes have highlighted the dangerous division in Thai society between a rich urban elite and poor migrants and farmers .
Several of the demonstrators blamed the elderly king , Bhumibol Adulyadej , for manipulating the government behind the scenes .
Most wanted Thaksin to return to power .
Last week , the red shirts seized key traffic intersections in the Thai capital and forced the cancellation of the Asean summit in the resort of Pattaya .
Their actions prompted the government to declare a state of emergency .
Rival yellow and blue - shirted mobs , which support the government , have launched vigilante attacks , particularly on taxi drivers who are seen as a support base for the reds .
The security forces reported two drive - by shootings early this morning , one of which left a soldier critically injured .
Several protesters claimed to have been beaten up by gangs of vigilantes and said the army had covered up at least 10 killings .
The conflict prompted staff at the embassies of several countries , including the US , the UK , Japan and France , to warn their citizens to either leave the capital or stay indoors .
As smoke billowed from burning buses again today , the American - born president of the Bangkok mission hospital , George Larrson , said disruptions had worsened since he set up the institution three years ago .
" To have this many troops on the streets and to have reds closing down much of the city last week is the worst yet , " he said .
Soldiers regained control of Government House , which was empty of protesters and filled only with the plastic bottles and other rubbish left behind after the sit-in .
Before leaving , the demonstrators held a retreat rally in which they sprayed each other in water in a traditional new year celebration .
But many were crying after failing to achieve their goal of more democracy .
" We are going home .
I 'm glad the violence has stopped this time but , unless there is a change , we will come back again and fight even harder , " said Thanachai , a hotel worker who was waving a Thai flag on top of an open truck .
" There is no justice in Thailand the way things are now . "
The government has declared two extra days for the three - day Thai new year holiday , which began Monday , to ensure public safety and give time to repair damage in the city .
Many armed troops remain on the streets of Bangkok this evening to ensure continued stability .

MEXICO CITY ( Reuters ) - A strain of flu never seen before has killed up to 60 people in Mexico and also appeared in the United States , where eight people were infected but recovered , health officials said on Friday .
Mexico ’s government said at least 20 people have died of the flu and it may also be responsible for 40 other deaths .
It shut down schools and canceled major public events in Mexico City to try to prevent more deaths in the sprawling , overcrowded capital .
Authorities said they had enough antiviral medicine to treat about 1,000 suspected cases reported so far .
The World Health Organization said tests showed the virus from 12 of the Mexican patients was the same genetically as a new strain of swine flu , designated H1N1 , seen in eight people in California and Texas .
“ Our concern has grown as of yesterday , ” Dr. Richard Besser , acting director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told reporters in a telephone briefing .
Global health officials were not ready to declare a pandemic -- a global epidemic of a new and deadly disease such as flu .
“ So far there has not been any change in the pandemic threat level , ” Besser said .
But the human - to - human spread of the new virus raised fears of a major outbreak .
Mexico ’s government suspended classes for millions of children in Mexico City , where scared residents rushed out to buy face masks and kept their kids at home .
“ We ’re frightened because they say it ’s not exactly flu , it ’s another kind of virus and we ’re not vaccinated , ” said Angeles Rivera , 34 , a government worker who fetched her son from a public kindergarten that was closing .
Close analysis showed the disease is a mixture of swine , human and avian viruses , according to the CDC .
Humans can occasionally catch swine flu from pigs but rarely have they been known to pass it on to other people .
Mexico reported 1,004 suspected cases of the new virus , including four possible cases in Mexicali on the border with California .
Most of the dead were aged between 25 and 45 , a health official said .
It was a worrying sign as seasonal flu can be more deadly among the very young and the very old but a hallmark of pandemics is that they affect healthy young adults .
Health Minister Jose Angel Cordova said Mexico has enough antiviral drugs to combat the outbreak for the moment .
“ In the last 20 hours , fewer serious cases of this disease and fewer deaths have been reported , ” he told reporters .

The WHO said the virus appears to be susceptible to Roche AG ’s flu drug Tamiflu , also known as oseltamivir , but not to older flu drugs such as amantadine .
NO CONTAINMENT
Canada has not reported any cases of the flu and is not issuing a travel warning for Mexico , but the country ’s chief public health officer David Butler - Jones said the outbreak was “ very concerning ” and Canada was paying close attention .

The CDC ’s Besser said it was probably too late to contain the outbreak .
“ There are things that we see that suggest that containment is not very likely , ” he said .
Once it has spread beyond a limited geographical area it would be difficult to control .
But there is no reason to avoid Mexico , CDC and the WHO said .
“ CDC is not recommending any additional recommendations for travelers to California , Texas and Mexico , ” Besser said .
Worldwide , seasonal flu kills between 250,000 and 500,000 people in an average year , but the flu season for North America should have been winding down .
The U.S. government said it was closely following the new cases .
“ The White House is taking the situation seriously and monitoring for any new developments .
The president has been fully briefed , ” an administration official said .
In California , where six people have been infected with the flu , Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said authorities were monitoring patients with flu - like symptoms and communicating with Mexican health officials .
Mexico ’s government cautioned people not to shake hands or kiss when greeting or to share food , glasses or cutlery .
Flu virus can be spread on the hands , and handwashing is one of the most important ways to prevent its spread .
The outbreak jolted residents of the Mexican capital , one of the world ’s biggest cities with around 20 million residents .
One pharmacy ran out of surgical face masks after selling 300 in a day .
The virus is an influenza A virus , carrying the designation H1N1 .
It contains DNA from avian , swine and human viruses , including elements from European and Asian swine viruses , said the CDC , which is already working on a vaccine .
Scientists were trying to understand why there are so many deaths in Mexico when the infections in the United States seem mild , Besser said .
The CDC said it will issue daily updateshere .
Surveillance for and scrutiny of influenza has been stepped up since 2003 , when H5N1 bird flu reappeared in Asia .
Experts fear that or another strain could cause a pandemic that could kill millions .
The last flu pandemic was in 1968 when “ Hong Kong ” flu killed about a million people globally .
In the 1950s prizewinning biologist and doctor Jonas Salk was working on a cure for polio in a dark basement laboratory in Pittsburgh .
Progress was slow , so to clear his head , Salk traveled to Assisi , Italy , where he spent time in a 13th - century monastery , ambling amid its columns and cloistered courtyards .
Suddenly , Salk found himself awash in new insights , including the one that would lead to his successful polio vaccine .
Salk was convinced he had drawn his inspiration from the contemplative setting .
He came to believe so strongly in architecture ’s ability to influence the mind that he teamed up with renowned architect Louis Kahn to build the Salk Institute in La Jolla , Calif . , as a scientific facility that would stimulate breakthroughs and encourage creativity .
WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama plans to lift longstanding U.S. restrictions on Cuba , a senior administration official said , allowing Cuban - Americans to visit families there as often as they like and to send them unlimited funds .
The gesture , which could herald more openness with the Castro regime , will fulfill a campaign promise and follows more modest action in Congress this year to loosen travel rules .

By By Chris V. Thangham Apr 6 , 2009 in World A scientist predicted the earthquake in Italy several days ago but was rebuked by the government officials , who called it “ scaremongering ” .
The quake has killed at least 90 people and left 50,000 homeless .
Scientist predicting the earthquake .
( In Italian ) .
Several tremors were felt in the medieval city of L’Aquila , about 60 miles east of Rome , from mid-January onwards .
Vans with loudspeakers were driven soon after spreading Giuliani ’s warnings to leave their homes .
But the local authorities failed to heed his warnings , and instead reported him to the police for “ scaremongering ” .
The police authorities told him to remove his findings from the internet .
Just as he predicted , the earthquake with 6.3 on the Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has declared a state of emergency .
Father Mauro Orru , the local priest in Onna , told the The heavens fell in .
It was like the end of the world .
I ran into the street in my pyjamas ; everything in the house was crashing down - books , crockery , everything was on the floor and the furniture was moving .
Now the residents are angry that Giuliani ’s warnings were ignored by the local authorities .
Italy ’s Civil Protection agency has sent their scientists to calm the townspeople .
They released the following press statement :
The tremors being felt by the population are part of a typical sequence ... ( which is ) absolutely normal in a seismic area like the one around L'Aquila ...
It is useful to underline that it is not in any way possible to predict an earthquake .
Despite the inability to predict , they will continue to monitor the tremors in the region .
Enzo Boschi , the head of Italy 's National Geophysics Institute , dismissed Mr. Giuliani 's predictions as a fluke .
He told Telegraph : Every time there is an earthquake there are people who claim to have predicted it ... As far as I know nobody predicted this earthquake with precision .
It is not possible to predict earthquakes .
Boschi said the real problem was that Italy has never taken proper precautions despite enduring a string of earthquakes in the past .
" We have earthquakes but then we forget and do nothing .
It 's not in our culture to take precautions or build in an appropriate way in areas where there could be strong earthquakes . "
So far , deaths have been reported in L’Aquila and in neighboring villages of Fossa , Castelnuovo , Poggio Picenza and Tormintarte .
The bulk of the damages , however , occurred in L’Aquila , and many homes , churches and university buildings were severely damaged .
This story is reminiscent of the Mokens in Thailand who Giampaolo Giuliani predicted the earthquake and posted a video on YouTube .
He said there was unusual build - up of radon gas near the seismically active areas and he predicted a major earthquake soon .

MOGADISHU , Somalia ( AP )  Mortar shells and machine - gun fire rocked Mogadishu on Sunday , as pro-government Islamist fighters clashed with gunmen who want to topple the Western - backed government , officials said .
Officials said that the renewed violence killed at least 35 people over the weekend in Mogadishu , the Somali capital .
A hospital official said 60 wounded people were admitted to the hospital this weekend .
It was some of the worst fighting in weeks in one of the world ’s most violent cities , with both sides pounding Mogadishu with mortar shells and machine - gun fire .
Residents were streaming out of the city in search of safety .
The nation has been in chaos since the 1991 ouster of the dictator Mohamed Siad Barre .
Rival clans then turned on one another .
Since late 2006 , insurgents have been trying to topple the weak government .
The lawlessness has also allowed piracy to thrive off the coast .

SANTELLI ’S CLASS WAR ….
I ’m behind on this one — the video went viral yesterday — and I assume most of you have already seen CNBC ’s Rick Santelli ’s right - wing temper tantrum .
As Santelli sees it , families facing foreclosure are “ losers , ” and the Obama administration ’s housing plan encourages Americans to stop paying their mortgages .
As David Sirota explained , Santelli was “ literally on the floor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange surrounded by multimillionaire traders railing on the Obama administration for trying to help struggling homeowners , and berating people who are getting foreclosed on as ‘ losers . ' ”
In the midst of Santelli ’s tirade , threats about another “ tea party , ” and genuinely frightening screaming , it did n’t seem to occur to him that he sounded ridiculous .
A $ 700 billion bailout for a financial industry on the verge of collapse ?
No problem .
A $ 75 billion housing policy to stem the foreclosure crisis ?
Grab the pitchforks , show your unbridled rage , and prepare for a class war against those low - income families who ’ve let down the Wall Street traders who ’ve done so much to improve the nation ’s economy .
No wonder some of the less sensible among us fell in love with Santelli ’s faux - populism .
It ’s the precisely the kind of class warfare Republicans have always dreamed of — the wealthy whining incessantly about struggling families getting to keep their homes .
As dday put it , “ The revolution has begun .
These workaday stock traders are going to take back this country for the laissez - faire capitalists who are entitled to it . ”
Not incidentally , now might also be a good time to point out that Santelli ’s fury does n’t stand up well to fact - checking .
He made it sound like “ losers ” who bought homes they could n’t afford are poised to get a bailout from the feds .
That might be the prevailing judgment of furious traders on the floor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange , but it ’s not reality .
The right is going to need a new cult hero .
This guy does n’t seem to know what he ’s talking about .

SATURDAY PM / SUNDAY AM : Hollywood planned a 2nd straight weekend friendly for family filmgoers who have pent - up demand , and it was a wild success with the two top family films placing # 1 and # 2 .
With 20 % of K - through - 12 kids out of school Friday , Pixar / Disney ’s 10th pic and first 3 - D movie , Up , was able to get a jump on the domestic box office with busy matinees from 1,534 3 - D theaters — a record — and a total of 3,766 theatres total .
So the unusual toon starring the voice of Ed Asner and receiving rave revenues opened to around $ 21.4 million Friday and $ 26.5M Saturday for a $ 68.2 M weekend with Sunday estimates of $ 20.3 M .
Hollywood estimates for its Fri-Sat - Sun grosses started at $ 55 M , went up to $ 60 M based on matinees , but did n’t expect it to top 2008 Wall - E’s $ 63 M .
Instead ,
Up finished as Pixar ’s 3rd highest grossing film , close to the $ 70 M opening weekends of the brand ’s top 2 computer animation movies , 2004 The Incredibles and 2003 Finding Nemo .
( Not adjusted for inflation or ticket prices or the 3 - D premium prices . )
Up also bested DreamWorks ’ first 3 - D film Monsters v Aliens which opened at $ 59.3 M over 2009 Spring Break .
Disney has been marketing
Up as a four - quadrant movie that hits all bases — from comedy to adventure .
It was the first film of 2009 to snag an A+ CinemaScore , and Disney considered it Pixar ’s most emotional film thus far .
It worked , although some parents are emailing me it ’s too dark for young children .
Exit polls showed 31 % of the audience were kids aged 2 to 11 , and the other 69 % spread equally to all demos .
The other newcomer should come in 3rd : Universal ’s subtly titled PG - 13 horror pic Drag Me To Hell from Sam Raimi ’s devilish direction debuted at $ 6.4M Friday and $ 5.7M Saturday for a $ 16.6 M weekend from 2,508 venues .
Despite its counter programming , the pic’s box office potential fell short of The Strangers which Uni opened to $ 20 M last year on this date .
But 2nd place went to 20th Century Fox ’s Night Of The Museum : Battle Of The Smithsonian which held well because of Friday ’s big matinees and its still huge release into 4,101 theaters .
It finished down only 53 % from its # 1 opening last weekend .
The sequel starring Ben Stiller made $ 7.4M Friday and $ 10.5 M Saturday plus a $ 7.5M Sunday estimate for a $ 25.5 M weekend and a $ 105.2 M cume .
Warner Bros ’ disappointing Terminator 4 : Salvation keeps sinking : it was # 4 with $ 5.1M ( - 64 % ) and $ 6.5M Saturday from 3,602 dates for a $ 15.2 M weekend ( - 64 % ) when analysts were expecting $ 20 M .
Followed by Paramount ’s Star Trek in No. 5 with $ 3.6 M Friday and $ 5.3M Saturday from 3,507 plays for another $ 12.8 M weekend .
The JJ Abrams ’ franchise reboot Friday night became the first movie of 2009 to pass $ 200 M domestic .
Its cume is now $ 209.5 M .
Imagine / Sony ’s Angels & Demons placed 6th with $ 3.4M Friday and $ 5M Saturday from 3,464 runs for another $ 11.2 M weekend and a new domestic cume of $ 104.7 M .

The Australian government has ordered an investigation after mice repeatedly bit residents of a nursing home .
One man , a bedridden veteran aged 89 , was found covered in blood after his ears , neck and throat were chewed by the mice .
He had to be sedated later .
The incident at the home in Queensland state was " extremely disturbing " , said Minister for Ageing Justine Elliot .
She said if health and safety practices at the 80 - bed institution were found to be inadequate , it would be closed .
The fact that the blood - covered veteran was discovered by nursing staff on Anzac Day , when Australia remembers its fallen heroes , has only heightened the sense of outrage , says the BBC's Nick Bryant in Sydney .
Another man was reportedly bitten , but suffered no injuries .
Ms Elliot has asked accreditation authorities to investigate the staff response to the rodent plague .
Staff numbers have been increased and more mouse traps have been set at the Karingal home , located in Dalby , about 200 km ( 120 miles ) west of the state capital , Brisbane .
Nursing union officials say nursing staff are horrified by the infestation of mice and have called for the home to be shut down if the authorities cannot remove the rodents .
The state health department blamed the infestation on the cooler autumn climate which was forcing mice across the region to look for warm places to infiltrate .
The other boy told police that earlier in the year , he had about five conversations with Zeo that were sexual in nature and that at one point , she told him that she probably would have sexual contact with him when they were in a room alone together .
She told him to come to her classroom but he never did , the affidavit said .

AROUND THE WEB
This is the Democratic Party 's moment , its power now greater than any time since the mid-1960s .
But do not expect smooth sailing .
The party is a fractious group divided by competing interests , factions and constituencies that could explode into a civil war , especially when it comes to energy and the environment .
Broadly speaking , there is a long - standing conflict inside the Democratic Party between gentry liberals and populists .
This division is not the same as in the 1960s , when the major conflicts revolved around culture and race as well as on foreign policy .
Today the emerging fault - lines follow mostly regional , geographical and , most importantly , class differences .
Gentry liberals cluster largely in cities , wealthy suburbs and college towns .
They include disproportionately those with graduate educations and people living on the coasts .
Populists tend to be located more in middle - and working - class suburbs , the Great Plains and industrial Midwest .
They include a wider spectrum of Americans , including many whose political views are somewhat changeable and less subject to ideological rigor .
In the post - World War II era , the gentry 's model candidate was a man such as Adlai Stevenson , the Democratic presidential nominee who lost twice to Dwight D. Eisenhower .
Stevenson was a svelte intellectual who , like Barack Obama , was backed by the brute power of the Chicago machine .
After Stevenson , the gentry supported candidates such as John Kennedy – who did appeal to Catholic working class voters – but also men with limited appeal outside the gentry class , including Eugene McCarthy , George McGovern , Gary Hart , Bill Bradley , Paul Tsongas and John Kerry .
Hubert Humphrey , a populist heir to the lunch - pail liberalism of Harry Truman ( and who was despised by gentry intellectuals ) missed the presidency by a hair in 1968 .
But populists in the party later backed lackluster candidates such as Walter Mondale and Dick Gephardt .
Bill Clinton revived the lunch - pail Democratic tradition ; and the final stages of last year 's presidential primaries represented yet another classic gentry versus populist conflict .
Hillary Clinton could not match Barack Obama 's appeal to the gentry .
Driven to desperation , she ended up running a spirited populist campaign .
Although peace now reigns between the Clintons and the new president , the broader gentry - populist split seems certain to fester at both the congressional and local levels – and President Obama will be hard - pressed to negotiate this divide .
Gentry liberals are very " progressive " when it comes to issues such as affirmative action , gay rights , the environment and energy policy , but are not generally well disposed to protectionism or auto - industry bailouts , which appeal to populists .
Populists , meanwhile , hated the initial bailout of Wall Street – despite its endorsement by Mr. Obama and the congressional leadership .
Geography is clearly a determining factor here .
Standout antifinancial bailout senators included Sens. Byron Dorgan of North Dakota , Tim Johnson of South Dakota , and Jon Tester of Montana .
On the House side , the antibailout faction came largely from places like the Great Plains and Appalachia , as well as from the suburbs and exurbs , including places like Arizona and interior California .
Gentry liberals , despite occasional tut - tutting , fell lockstep for the bailout .
Not one Northeastern or California Democratic senator opposed it .
In the House , " progressives " such as Nancy Pelosi and Barney Frank who supported the financial bailout represent districts with a large concentration of affluent liberals , venture capitalists and other financial interests for whom the bailout was very much a matter of preserving accumulated ( and often inherited ) wealth .
Energy and the environment are potentially even more explosive issues .
Gentry politicians tend to favor developing only alternative fuels and oppose expanding coal , oil or nuclear energy .
Populists represent areas , such as the Great Lakes region , where manufacturing still plays a critical role and remains heavily dependent on coal - based electricity .
They also tend to have ties to economies , such as in the Great Plains , Appalachia and the Intermountain West , where smacking down all new fossil - fuel production threatens lots of jobs – and where a single - minded focus on alternative fuels may drive up total energy costs on the farm , make life miserable again for truckers , and put American industrial firms at even greater disadvantage against foreign competitors .
In the coming years , Mr. Obama 's " green agenda " may be a key fault line .
Unlike his notably mainstream appointments in foreign policy and economics , he 's tilted fairly far afield on the environment with individuals such as John Holdren , a longtime acolyte of the discredited neo-Malthusian Paul Ehrlich , and Carol Browner , who was Bill Clinton 's hard - line EPA administrator .
These appointments could presage an environmental jihad throughout the regulatory apparat .
Early examples could mean such things as strict restrictions on greenhouse gases , including bans on new drilling and higher prices through carbon taxes or a cap - and - trade regime .
Another critical front , not well understood by the public , could develop on land use – with the adoption of policies that favor dense cities over suburbs and small towns .
This trend can be observed most obviously in California , but also in states such as Oregon where suburban growth has long been frowned upon .
Emboldened greens in government could use their new power to drive infrastructure spending away from badly needed projects such as new roads , bridges and port facilities , and toward projects such as light rail lines .
These lines are sometimes useful , but largely impractical outside a few heavily traveled urban corridors .
Essentially it means a transfer of subsidies from those who must drive cars to the relative handful for whom mass transit remains a viable alternative .
Priorities such as these may win plaudits in urban enclaves in New York , Boston and San Francisco – bastions of the gentry class and of under - 35 , childless professionals – but they might not be so widely appreciated in the car - and truck - driving Great Plains and the vast suburban archipelago , where half the nation 's population lives .
If he wishes to enhance his power and keep the Democrats together , Mr. Obama will have to figure out how to placate both his gentry base and those Democrats who still see their party 's mission in terms that Harry Truman would have understood .

Is America becoming more pro-life ?
A new poll by Gallup says so .
The poll , released on the Friday before President Obama addressed Notre Dame University , thrilled the anti-abortion movement — and offered Republicans their first glimmer of hope in months .
But the poll is wrong .
Worse , it ’s misleading — and threatens to send Republicans careening in precisely the worst possible direction in pursuit of votes they will not find .
Charles Franklin of Pollster.com explains the poll ’s big technical error .
Gallup oversampled Republicans .
At a time when only 1 in 5 Americans identifies as Republican , 32 percent of the respondents in Gallup ’s survey group identified themselves as Republican .
Franklin offers some interesting explanations of how this oversampling could have occurred .
But what matters most are the consequences .
As the Republican Party shrinks , it becomes more conservative .
Today ’s shriveled GOP is much more pro-life than the robust GOP of years past .
So if you oversample Republicans , you are oversampling pro-lifers .
Sure enough , when you look at Gallup ’s breakdown of its results , all the rise in anti-abortion feeling is concentrated among self - identified Republicans .
To paraphrase Norma Desmond in “ Sunset Boulevard ” :
The pro-life movement is n’t bigger — it is the Republican Party that has gotten smaller .
Beyond the technicalities , Gallup ’s poll is wrong in a far more important way .
For all their vehement disagreement , pro-lifers and pro-choicers agree that the abortion debate is about rights : the woman ’s right to choose , the unborn child ’s right to life .
Pro-choicers may sternly disapprove of the irresponsible woman who casually discards one pregnancy after another .
Pro-lifers may feel tremendous sympathy for the woman considering abortion because she feels she cannot raise a child on her own .
Both agree that the reason for the abortion is absolutely irrelevant .
Yet almost every survey suggests that the considerations rejected by strong partisans as irrelevant are the considerations that matter most to the voting majority , who reject both the pro-life and the pro-choice cause .
Gallup ’s 2008 annual survey of the issue and its much - criticized 2009 survey agreed on one point :
The proportion of Americans who answer that abortion should either be legal in all circumstances or illegal in all circumstances has held steady at 45 percent .
( The Quinnipiac poll more plausibly assesses the two most certain groups at just 29 percent of voters . )
The majority of Americans think it should be legal under some circumstances , but not under others .
Even these numbers understate the muddiness of the public position .
At the peak of the controversy over partial birth abortion , polls found that more than 60 percent of Americans wanted it banned .
Clear ?
Yes — until you asked about the health of the mother .
Then 60 percent wanted it legal .
For reasons best known to themselves , pollsters rarely pose the question in the way that Americans themselves talk about it .
“ Suppose a woman has two boyfriends at the same time , gets pregnant , and wants an abortion so she wo n’t have to admit to her two - timing .
Is that okay ? ”
“ Now suppose another woman is working her way through college .
Her boyfriend dumps her when she tells him she ’s pregnant .
If she carries the baby , she ’ll have to drop out and take any job she can find in this tough economy .
She has decided abortion is her best choice — should the government stop her ? ”
Logically , legally , philosophically such an approach represents an incoherent mess .
And yet … that ’s probably where most people are on the issue .
Which may also explain why so many people respond so well to those , like President Obama at Notre Dame , who gracefully attempt to reconcile the irreconcilable .
This leads to the special danger the ( mis ) information in the Gallup poll presents to Republicans .
As multiple polls show , Republican appeal has drooped to levels not seen since the aftermath of Watergate , maybe not since the 1930s .
Those Republicans who remain committed to the party are , as the abortion poll suggests , the most conservative — especially the most socially conservative .
Very understandably , they wish to believe that the party can recover by focusing most on people like themselves .
( It takes very little evidence to persuade people to do what they want to do anyway . )
Yet a strategy that emphasizes abortion and other family life issues can only lead Republicans to greater difficulty .
The pro-life segment of American opinion is disproportionately black and Hispanic .
( Hispanics are almost 10 points more pro-life than whites . )
Unfortunately , as repeated disappointment should by now have taught Republicans , abortion is just not a voting issue for these voters .
They vote for their pocketbooks , as poorer people of all races usually do .
The votes available for Republicans to recoup are those of more highly educated and more affluent whites who have been lost since 1998 , and especially since 2006 .
Among these voters , especially the women , abortion is the very opposite of a vote - getter .
Gallup has again dangled in front of Republican decision - makers the false promise of a multi-ethnic , socially conservative voting majority that can be deployed to elect economically conservative Republicans .
Yet in reality , socially conservative , lower - income nonwhites put their economic interests first and vote Democratic — while economically conservative affluent whites put their cultural votes first and also vote Democratic !
It ’s the worst of all possible worlds .
The road to Republican recovery begins by reconstituting the voting base we used to have .
The Republican Party should remain pro-life , yes , but more quietly and inclusively so .
We must emphasize that non-pro-lifers can have a place at our table too .
( One way to demonstrate that would be to combine a non - pro - life running mate with a pro-life presidential candidate in 2012 . )
And one more thing :
When reading polls , read them all the way to the bottom .
See that line about accuracy “ 19 times out of 20 ” ?
Whenever you see anything that seems too good to be true , you need to ask : Could this be that 20th time ?
The McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica are considered one of the least hospitable places on Earth ; NASA has used them to simulate conditions that might prevail on Mars .
The area gets little precipitation , and the water that is present is locked into ancient , thick glaciers that have been in the area for longer than modern humans have existed .
Almost by definition , any living things that manage to scrape out an existence in this environment are going to be pretty unusual .
But scientists are now reporting the discovery of an ecosystem buried under the ice of one of these glaciers that stretches the definition of unusual well past the breaking point .
Nobody would be likely to suspect that there is any life underneath the ice , which is hundreds of meters thick in the area , if it were n't for the striking red ice erupting from the glacier 's terminus , giving the formation the name Blood Falls .
That red color comes from iron concentrated in the ice , which exists primarily in the Fe( II ) state favored when oxygen is absent .
Thanks to a release event that occurred in 2004 , researchers have projected where that iron originates , and suggested its likely source .
They 've also figured out what the environment at that source looks like .
It seems that the red ice has travelled from a pocket that exists four kilometers from the glacier 's end , at a site where the ice is over 400 m thick .
Based on the chemical composition of the material trapped in the ice , scientists think that the pocket encases the remains of an arm of the ocean that extended into the area during the Pilocene , which ended over 1.8 million years ago .
Once encased under the glacier , that pocket became hyper - saline and completely devoid of free oxygen .
Consistent with its total isolation from the surface , the amount of 14C in the sample is extremely low .
Despite the fact that the liquid water is below the freezing point of pure water , there appears to be a microbial community that has called it home .
Consistent with an origin in the oceans , three quarters of the DNA sequences obtained from Blood Falls appear to come from relatives of marine organisms .
Most of the clones come from within the Proteobacteria , and the closest cultured relatives of many of these metabolize sulfur and iron ( there are also high levels of sulfur present in the brine ) .
Unlike sulfur - powered communities present at undersea vents , there 's little indication of a hydrogen sulfide metabolism present in the ice at Blood Falls .
Instead , it appears that energy is obtained when sulfur is cycled through different oxidation states by reacting it with iron , producing the Fe( II ) seen in the brine .
The oxidized sulfur is then used to react with carbon compounds , powering the metabolism .
All of that is pretty low - energy — the authors suggest that the doubling time for a bacterium in this environment would be roughly 300 days — and requires an external source of Fe( III ) to power the system .
The authors posit that the glacier itself might provide the source by extracting new iron as it scrapes across the underlying rocks .
Bizarre environments like this help inform scientists as they consider the prospects for life on other planets and moons .
But this specific example may tell us something about how life managed to persist on Earth during what appear to have been complete global glaciations that occurred in the Neoproterozoic .
These " snowball earth " events may have frozen over the oceans , but the Blood Falls bacteria suggest that life could have eked out a metabolism under these extreme conditions , providing raw material for evolution once the planet warmed again .

The Cuba Democracy PAC has given hundreds of thousands in political contributions to Democrats and Republicans in Congress as part of an effort to maintain stringent trade and travel restrictions with Cuba .
The group in recent years has focused on outreach efforts to the Democratic freshman classes of 2004 , 2006 and 2008 .
[ T ]he region ’s political landscape has changed .
Most obviously , the United States now has in Barack Obama a president who is as widely admired in Latin America as Mr Bush was disliked ...
The most divisive issue concerns the one country that is not invited .
Latin America is now united in wanting to end the diplomatic isolation of Cuba , and many would like the United States to lift its long - standing economic embargo against the island .
That is because a transition of sorts is under way in Cuba , with Raúl Castro replacing his brother Fidel as president , even if there are no signs that this change will be matched by democracy supplanting communism .
It is also because Latin America ’s many left - of - centre governments , to varying degrees , see friendship with Cuba as an issue of symbolic importance .
But for the United States , Cuba is a matter of domestic politics ( as are nearly all the other issues that matter to Latin Americans , such as drugs and immigration ) .
Mr Obama was poised to announce , ahead of the summit , the scrapping of curbs imposed by Mr Bush on visits and remittances to the island by Cuban - Americans .
He may also allow American companies to sell Cuba communications gear , such as an undersea fibre - optic cable , according to an administration official .
Many Americans would like him to go further .
Bills introduced last month in both houses of the United States Congress with strong bipartisan support would allow all Americans to travel to Cuba .
Another would ease food sales to Cuba , already allowed under cumbersome conditions .
But most supporters of these bills stop short of wanting to scrap the embargo altogether while Cuba still lacks political and economic freedoms .
And an influential minority in the Democratic party opposes any change in policy .
“ For 50 years we have been trying to change the Cuban government , the Cuban regime , ” said the foundation ’s president , Francisco J. Hernandez , a veteran of the Bay of Pigs invasion in April 1961 .
“ At the present time , what we have to do is change the emphasis to the Cuban people — because they are going to be the ones who change things in Cuba . ”
Earlier today we looked at some of the ways Obama 's agenda for change is bumping heads with entrenched vested interests that have powerful and lucrative stakes in the -- and congressional shills who will stand with them in return for the immense sums in legalized bribes funneled into their careers .
This week the push towards normalizing relations with Cuba is meeting just this kind of resistance .
One Political Action Committee , the U.S. - Cuba Democracy PAC , a right wing throwback to the days of knee - jerk Republican catering to anti-Castro fanatics in Florida , is on the warpath because members of the Congressional Black Caucus had the temerity to travel to Cuba , meet with Castro and called for a new policy .
Anti-Castro extremists at the US - Cuba Democracy PAC , who would prefer another Bay of Pigs to an unthawing of relations , short - circuited today and attacked the CBC members who visited Cuba .
They blasted Barbara Lee ( D - CA ) , Mel Watt ( D - NC ) , Emanuel Cleaver ( D - MO ) , Marcia Fudge ( D - OH ) , Mike Honda ( D - CA ) , Bobby Rush ( D - IL ) and Laura Richardson ( D - CA ) , calling them " a fringe " and " an embarrassment . , " claiming the trip " gives a bad name to the Congressional Black Caucus .
" Debbie Wasserman Schultz ( D - FL ) has been the PAC 's point person in the House and has helped funnel huge sums of money to newer members of Congress who she has mobilized to vote against any and all attempts to modernize relations with Cuba .
Wasserman - Schultz was one of only eleven
House members in 2008 who received the maximum $ 10,000 contribution the PAC handed out .
They lavished over $ 630,000 on House members in the last election cycle .
The big recipients ( $ 10,000 each + the amount bolded given to them from Wasserman - Schultz directly ) : Melissa Bean ( Blue Dog -IL ) John Boehner ( R - OH ) GK Butterfield ( D - NC ) Jim Clyburn ( D - SC ) Mario Diaz - Balart ( R- FL ) Ron Klein ( D - FL ) Tim Mahoney ( defeated Blue Dog-FL ) Patrick Murphy ( Blue Dog - PA ) Debbie Wasserman Schultz ( D - FL ) Albio Sires ( D - NJ ) Chris Smith ( R - NJ ) Other major recipients of the payoffs from Wasserman - Schultz and the US - Cuba Democracy PAC , totally over $ 10,000 each , included Jason Altmire ( Blue Dog - PA - $ 13,000 ) , John Barrow ( Blue Dog - GA - $ 13,500 ) , Chris Carney ( Blue Dog - PA - $ 14,500 ) , Kirsten Gillibrand ( Blue Dog-NY - $ 12,000 ) , Heath Shuler ( Blue Dog-NC - $ 12,000 ) ... detecting any pattern ?
This is what President Obama will have to face when he tries dragging America 's Cuban policies into the new century -- obstructionist Republicans plus well - paid Democrats who are happy to cross the aisle for bucks whenever they need to .
Most Americans , on the other hand , as you can see from this poll think that the outdated and counterproductive reactionary policies towards Cuba have overstayed their welcome .
The current issue of thesuggests that this issue is far more important to the rest of Latin America than it is to Americans .
Obama will be meeting with the heads of 34 nations of this hemisphere between April 17 - 19 in Port of Spain , Trinidad and Tobago .
Most of the nations , if not all , plan to call on Obama to agree to readmit Cuba to the Organisation of American States .
Meanwhile , Obama is being held hostage to corrupt members of Congress , like Wasserman Schultz and Democratic Senate candidate Kendrick Meek , who love the taste of right - wing Cuban - American money that has been flowing to Democrats as well as to Republicans lately .
Unhappy with greedy special interests determining U.S. policies ?
Do something about it ; join the donor strike .
Even the Cuban American National Foundation , the # 1 Cuban exile organization with an historically anti-Castro posture , is changing course , " breaking from the past " and " charting a new direction , " as they put it themselves today .
Kind of leaves the lunatic fringe and their congressional handmaidens look like a bunch of out of touch kooks .

Bank demolishes new Southern California homes , citing low profit - potential
By Shannon Jones
8 May 2009
The bank - ordered razing of a new housing development in Victorville , California , highlights the bankruptcy of the profit system under conditions of the deepening recession and growing social misery .
Texas - based Guaranty Bank has decided to have 16 homes destroyed in the desert community because the estimated $ 1 million cost to complete them was more than it could make selling them .
Four of the luxury homes , priced in the $ 280,000 - 350,000 range , were already finished , and the others were in various stages of completion .
The estimated cost of the demolition was over $ 100,000 .
According to a report in the Los Angeles Times , the median new home price in San Bernardino County , where Victorville is located , is $ 160,000 , down 43 percent in one year .
Banks foreclosed on 236,000 homes in California in 2008 .
A video of the demolition was broadcast on You Tube .
According to the report , the bank has another 20 California homes slated for demolition in Temecula , about an hour and a half to the south .
Work began on the development in 2007 , before the full impact of the bursting housing bubble hit Southern California .
Construction stopped last summer , and the bank took back the property from the developer in December 2008 through foreclosure .
According to a report in the May 7 Wall Street Journal , thousands of construction projects across the United States lie idle .
It cites New York - based Real Analytics Inc. , “ which estimated that there were 3,929 distressed commercial properties across the US as of March 31 — a 55 percent jump since Dec. 31 , 2008 . ”
According to one research firm , some 250 residential developments have been halted in California , comprising over 9,300 homes .
The Journal points to environmental and health concerns over the growing number of abandoned or idle construction sites .
In the case of the project demolished in California , Guaranty Bank justified the action on the grounds that it wanted to create a “ safe environment ” by preventing squatters from taking over the homes .
A spokesman for Guaranty Bank told the San Jose Mercury News , “ The current economic environment requires difficult decisions be made by the government , by banks and by individuals .
We made the difficult decision to return the site to a safe , clean and undeveloped state keeping in mind the best interests of the community and our shareholders . ”
The bank indicated that once the demolition is completed the property will be put back on the market .
One Victorville city official defended the bank ’s decision , saying , “ It just did n’t pencil out for them .
They ’d have to spend a lot of money to turn around and sell the houses .
They just made a financial decision to demolish them . ”
The demolition of the houses shocked many .
Ron Willemsen , the president of Intravaia Rock and Sand , the company that handled the demolition , told the LA Times , “ It ’s a waste of a lot of resources and perfectly good construction . ”
The federal Office of Thrift Supervision recently cited Guaranty Financial Group , the parent of Guaranty Bank , for “ unsafe and unsound banking practices . ”
It faces a May 21 deadline to improve its capital ratios or face merger or liquidation .
Guaranty has loaned large amounts to home developers and has foreclosed on many projects .
Regulators are putting pressure on the bank to come up with a plan to dispose of foreclosed properties .
The decision of Guaranty Bank to destroy brand new homes based on economic calculation points to the destructive irrationality of an economic system based on private ownership and production for profit .
It calls to mind the events of the 1930s , when , in the midst of the Depression , the Roosevelt administration had farmers plough under cotton crops , leave fields fallow and slaughter hundreds of thousands of hogs , to artificially raise agricultural prices by decreasing supplies .
This under conditions where millions of people were malnourished .
As in the Great Depression , the products of labor are being destroyed as need mounts .
Currently there are some 4 million vacant homes in the US , 3 percent of the total housing stock .
Yet the number of so - called economic homeless is on the rise across the United States .
A report titled “ The New Homeless ” on allgov.com notes , “ Tent cities and shelters from California to Massachusetts report growing demand from the newly homeless . ”
The city of Sacramento , California , recently closed down a tent city after it attracted national media attention .
In January , the National Alliance to End Homelessness predicted the economic crisis would force 1.5 million people into homelessness over the next two years .
In a new Public Strategies Inc. / POLITICO national survey of 1,000 registered voters , Obama outdistances figures on both the left and the right in earning the public ’s trust , with two - thirds of respondents saying they trust the president “ to identify the right solutions to the problems we face as a nation . ”
Poll : Obama earns nation 's trust
Three months into his presidency , Barack Obama stands out as perhaps the most trusted figure in American politics .
In a new Public Strategies Inc. / POLITICO national survey of 1,000 registered voters , Obama outdistances figures on both the left and the right in earning the public ’s trust , with two - thirds of respondents saying they trust the president “ to identify the right solutions to the problems we face as a nation . ”

Of those who said they trust the president , 31 percent said they trust him “ a great deal . ”
An additional 35 percent said they have “ some ” trust that Obama will find the correct solution .
Thirty - one percent said they trust Obama either “ not very much ” or “ not at all . ”
Voters were asked the same question of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) , Republican Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska , former Massachusetts Republican Gov. Mitt Romney , conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh and the two major political parties .
Among those choices , only the Democratic Party was trusted to find the right solutions by a majority of voters , 52 percent to 40 percent .
Forty percent of those surveyed said they trusted the Republican Party , compared with 54 percent who did not trust the GOP .
Only 26 percent said they trust Pelosi , the lowest total in the group .
Palin attracted the highest percentage of those who did not trust her at all to identify the right solutions , topping Pelosi 33 percent to 32 percent .
Romney got a mixed reaction , with 38 percent of voters saying they trust him and 39 percent saying they do n’t .
Obama also ranked as one of the most credible voices on the economy , outdistanced only by Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates .
Four in five voters find Gates credible “ as a source of information on the U.S. economy , ” topping the 71 percent who said the same of the president .
Investor Warren Buffett ranked third , and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke finished fourth .
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner , Obama ’s point man on the economy , is found credible by 56 percent of the public , trailing Buffett , Bernanke , former President Bill Clinton and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg .
Romney , the Republicans ’ top performer in the category , tied with Geithner .
While voters have confidence in Obama , numbers across the board for the federal government and Washington remain close to where they were at the end of George W. Bush ’s presidency .
In the Public Trust Monitor poll , which was conducted March 27 - 31 , 63 percent said they trust the United States government to do what is right , up only 6 percentage points from December 2008 .
The poll showed the same slight uptick in trust that an Obama - led government will manage its finances responsibly .
Forty percent said they trust the government to handle its money , compared with 34 percent in December .
Those polled were optimistic that things will improve .
The number of respondents who said the federal government is headed in the right direction surged to more than half , 54 percent — a big jump from December , when 35 percent said the same .
Nearly the same percentage of respondents , 56 percent , expressed faith that the $ 787 billion stimulus will improve the state of the economy , compared with 26 percent who said the stimulus will have a negative impact and 18 percent who believe the president ’s package will have no impact .
Those polled did not express the same level of confidence that the federal stimulus will improve their personal financial situation .
Nearly half said the package will have no effect on them , while 36 percent said the stimulus will have a positive effect .
Twenty percent said it would negatively affect them .
And voters are split on how the stimulus package has affected their trust in government .
An equal number of respondents , 34 percent , said the stimulus package either increased or decreased their faith in government .
The remaining 32 percent said their opinion had not changed .
At the same time , voters showed trust in the president to do what is best with the approved funds .
When asked who they trust most to ensure that the stimulus is being spent as intended , 54 percent said the Obama administration , while only 21 percent said Congress and 26 percent answered the media .
Overall , voters are giving Obama wide latitude on how to act on the economy , which 87 percent characterized as “ weak . ”
Those polled showed little trust in corporate America and backed up their feelings with a desire for stricter regulation .
Only 37 percent said they trust corporations to do what is right .
One in five said federal regulation of corporations should be decreased while 61 percent said regulation should be increased .
Sentiment favoring regulations was especially strong when applied to the financial sector , with 35 percent expressing fear that the federal government will not go far enough to regulate the industry over the next 12 months .
Meanwhile , 35 percent think the government will regulate the financial industry the right amount , and only 31 percent worry the government will go too far .
The lack of institutional trust in corporations was focused on several sectors in particular .
Nearly three in four said they have a worse opinion of the financial services industry than they did a year ago .
A similar drop in opinion affected mortgage banking , where 75 percent had a worse opinion , and the automotive industry , where the figure was 64 percent .
While voters are giving the president a long leash in dealing with the economy , they also expressed concern that the federal government will go too far in bailing out troubled companies .
More than half said the government is likely to overstep in providing financial assistance , while only 11 percent said direct aid will not go far enough .
The poll ’s margin of error was plus or minus 3.1 percent .

Living in a big city , you get to hear other people ’s conversations all the time .
These are private conversations meant for the benefit of the participants but it ’s no big deal if they ’re overheard on the subway .
And you know what people talk about most of the time ?
In no particular order :
1 . What they had or are going to have for breakfast / lunch / dinner .
2 . Last night ’s TV or sports .
3 . How things are going at work .
4 . The weather .
5. Personal gossip .
6. Celebrity gossip .
Of course you ’d like to think that most of your daily conversation is weighty and witty but instead everyone chats about pedestrian nonsense with their pals .
In fact , that ephemeral chit - chat is the stuff that holds human social groups together .
Ever since the web hit the mainstream sometime in the 90s , people have asked of each new conversational publishing technology — newsgroups , message boards , online journals , weblogs , social networking sites , and now Twitter — the same question : “ but why would anyone want to hear about what some random person is eating for breakfast ? ”
The answer applies equally well for both offline conversation and online “ social media ” : almost no one …except for their family and friends .
So when you run across a Twitter message like “ we had chicken sandwitches & pepsi for breakfast ” from someone who has around 30 followers , what ’s really so odd about it ?
It ’s just someone telling a few friends on Twitter what she might normally tell them on the phone , via email , in person , or in a telegram .
If you are n’t one of the 30 followers , you never see the message … and if you do , you ’re like the guy standing next to a conversing couple on the subway platform .
P.S. And anyway , the whole breakfast question is a huge straw man periodically pushed across the tracks in front of speeding internet technology .
There is much that happens on Twitter or on blogs or on Facebook that has nothing to do with small groups of people communicating about seemingly nothing .
Can we just retire this stupid line of questioning once and for all ?
( Would you like to post this link to Twitter ? )
Update : From Twitter , two pithier reformulations of the above :
@phoutz : If Twitter is banal it is because you and I are banal ( It ’s called social norming )
@thepalephantom :
The “ no one cares what you ’re doing ” proclamation is a solipsists way of saying “ i do n’t care ”
Update :
Three related articles .
How the Other Half Writes : In Defense of Twitter by Geoff Manaugh of BLDGBLOG ( thx , @secretsquirrel ) :
Again , I fail to see any clear distinction between someone ’s boring Twitter feed - considered only semi-literate and very much bad — and someone else ’s equally boring , paper - based diary — considered both pro-humanist and unquestionably good .
Kafka would have had a Twitter feed !
And so would have Hemingway , and so would have Virgil , and so would have Sappho .
It ’s a tool for writing .
Heraclitus would have had a f*** ing Twitter feed .
Twitter : Industries of Banality by Struan McRae Spencer of Vitamin Briefcase :
Living with friends and colleagues would be a cheap alternative to living alone .
People generally do n’t do it because it ’s not a good thing for humans to do .
We are genetically predisposed to need time in solitude occasionally .
So instead of living with your friends and colleagues , try living with their disembodied thoughts floating around on your computer and popping up on your desktop every fifteen , thirty , sixty , ( manual refresh ) , minutes .
Fellowship exists to provide us with relief from solitude and our individual pursuits .
Living in a state of constant fellowship with hundreds , if not thousands of people who have known you ( or not ) across various stages of your life becomes an insurmountable problem the longer you try to do it .
To Tweet or Not To Tweet by Maureen Dowd of the NY Times , the essay that finally set me off in the first place :
In the mid-1990s , he pointed out , the emerging economies of Asia had been major importers of capital , borrowing abroad to finance their development .
But after the Asian financial crisis of 1997 - 98 ( which seemed like a big deal at the time but looks trivial compared with what ’s happening now ) , these countries began protecting themselves by amassing huge war chests of foreign assets , in effect exporting capital to the rest of the world .
The result was a world awash in cheap money , looking for somewhere to go .
Most of that money went to the United States — hence our giant trade deficit , because a trade deficit is the flip side of capital inflows .
But as Mr. Bernanke correctly pointed out , money surged into other nations as well .
In particular , a number of smaller European economies experienced capital inflows that , while much smaller in dollar terms than the flows into the United States , were much larger compared with the size of their economies .

Still , much of the global saving glut did end up in America .
Why ?
Mr. Bernanke cited “ the depth and sophistication of the country ’s financial markets ( which , among other things , have allowed households easy access to housing wealth ) . ”
Depth , yes .
But sophistication ?
Well , you could say that American bankers , empowered by a quarter - century of deregulatory zeal , led the world in finding sophisticated ways to enrich themselves by hiding risk and fooling investors .
And wide - open , loosely regulated financial systems characterized many of the other recipients of large capital inflows .
This may explain the almost eerie correlation between conservative praise two or three years ago and economic disaster today .
“ Reforms have made Iceland a Nordic tiger , ” declared a paper from the Cato Institute .
“ How Ireland Became the Celtic Tiger ” was the title of one Heritage Foundation article ; “ The Estonian Economic Miracle ” was the title of another .
All three nations are in deep crisis now .
Microsoft is hoping “ Bing ” will put some zing into its languishing search engine .
The software giant is set to unveil a broad revamp of its Live Search engine at an industry gathering that starts today in San Diego , and the name that Microsoft is expected go with for the new service is Bing .
The company will conduct a demonstration at the D : All Things Digital conference , intending to build buzz ahead of the official launch in June , when the company will kick off a major advertising campaign .
But although Microsoft is focused on building a better search engine to rival Google , the real challenge is overcoming its competitor ’s powerful brand .
Bing is presumably a reference to the proverbial light bulb that goes off in your head when a good idea hits , but company insiders would n’t rule out a last - minute name change .
Microsoft has trademarked a number of possible monikers , including Hook and Sift , to throw people off the scent .
Bing is the kind of cute , quirky name that helped endear users to Google , but search experts said it will take a lot more to break users of their Google habit .
An entire generation of Web users grew up on Google , and they automatically turn to it every time they search .
“ It ’s a marketing problem , really , ” said Kevin Lee , chairman of search marketing firm Did- It .
“ Google is synonymous with search . ”
Microsoft tapped ad agency JWT to handle the campaign for the new search engine , eschewing long - time ad partner McCann Erickson .
There is speculation that JWT is crafting a comparative campaign — along the lines of Apple ’s popular Mac vs. PC ads — to tackle the problem .
North Korea says it has resumed reprocessing fuel rods at Yongbyon
North Korea has threatened to carry out nuclear missile tests unless the UN Security Council apologises for its condemnation of a recent rocket launch .
Pyongyang said it would be compelled to take self - defence measures " including nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests " if no apology was made .
When North Korea launched its rocket on 5 April , the launch was seen by the US and others as a disguised missile test .
The UN denounced North Korea 's actions and called for tighter sanctions .
Pyongyang has insisted it put a communications satellite in orbit , and said it would ignore the sanctions , describing them as " a wanton violation of the UN charter " .
North Korea conducted its first and only nuclear test in October 2006 .
The BBC's John Sudworth in Seoul says preparations for a second atomic test would cause serious international concern .
He says it would also confirm that North Korea is no longer taking part in the long - running international nuclear disarmament negotiations known as the six - party talks .
Backward step
North Korea 's foreign ministry said the UN should apologise for " infringing " the country 's sovereignty and retract " all its resolutions and decisions " against Pyongyang .
It also announced plans to build a light - water nuclear reactor , according to the statement carried by the official Korean Central News Agency .
Following the UN criticism , the North pulled out of international negotiations on its denuclearisation and ejected all monitors from the country .
Pyongyang has since announced that it has started reprocessing spent fuel rods at its Yongbyon nuclear plant .
The reprocessing is a possible move towards producing weapons - grade plutonium .
North Korea had partially dismantled its nuclear reactor under a deal agreed at international talks in early 2007 , in which it was also promised fuel aid .
It is thought to possess enough reprocessed plutonium for between six and eight nuclear weapons .
However , analysts say Pyongyang has not yet mastered the technology to make a nuclear warhead small enough to place on a missile .
Pacman and jelyfish went exploring Moscow .
And it was not a marketing campaign of any sort , just pure act of exploration .
So jelyfish goes back to water .

ANKARA ( Reuters ) - U.S. President Barack Obama told the Muslim world on Monday the United States was not at war with Islam , using his first international tour to try to repair America ’s damaged image abroad .
Obama hammered home his support for the creation of a Palestinian state , despite the recent election of a right - leaning government in Israel , in an effort to show he was serious about reaching out to Muslims .
“ Let me say this as clearly as I can : The United States is not , and will never be , at war with Islam , ” he said in a wide - ranging speech to Turkey ’s parliament .
In his first trip as president to the Muslim world , which had accused his predecessor George W. Bush of bias in favor of Israel , Obama said : “ The United States strongly supports the goal of two states , Israel and Palestine , living side by side in peace and security . ”
Chief Palestinian peace negotiator Saeb Erekat welcomed Obama ’s words , saying he had made a major commitment to the two - state solution .
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ’s office said Israel was committed to reaching peace and would cooperate with the Obama administration to achieve that goal .
Obama is on the last leg of his first overseas trip as president .
He is trying to rebuild ties with Muslims after anger at the invasion of Iraq and war in Afghanistan , made more urgent by a resurgent al Qaeda and Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan .
“ Our partnership with the Muslim world is critical in rolling back a fringe ideology that people of all faiths reject , ” Obama said .
“ But I also want to be clear that America ’s relationship with the Muslim world cannot and will not be based on opposition to al Qaeda .
Far from it .
We seek broad engagement based upon mutual interests and mutual respect .
We will listen carefully , bridge misunderstanding , and seek common ground . ”
Obama ’s visit is a nod to Turkey ’s regional reach , economic power , diplomatic contacts and status as a secular democracy seeking European Union membership that has accommodated political Islam .
“ Given Turkish activity and credibility in the wider region stretching from Afghanistan to the Middle East , passing over energy transit routes , Obama wants to give new blood to a real strategic partnership with Turkey , ” said Cengiz Candar , a leading Turkish commentator and Middle East expert .
ARMENIA BREAKTHROUGH ?
NATO member Turkey is a transit route for U.S. troops and equipment going to Iraq as well as Afghanistan .
As Washington reduces its troops in Iraq , Incirlik air base is expected to play a key role and Obama discussed this with Turkish leaders .
Obama urged the foreign ministers of Turkey and Armenia during a meeting later on Monday to complete talks aimed at restoring ties between the two neighbors , a U.S. official said .

Ankara and Yerevan are engaged in talks to end nearly a century of hostility , including reopening the border -- a move which could help shore up stability in the volatile Caucasus .
Touching on a highly sensitive subject , Obama told reporters he stood by his views on mass killings of Armenians by Ottoman Turks in 1915 , which he has termed genocide , but said he expected a breakthrough in talks between Turkey and Armenia .
“ I want to be as encouraging as possible around those negotiations which are moving forward and could bear fruit very quickly , very soon , so as a consequence what I want to do is not focus on my views right now , ” Obama said , trying to strike a balance over the issue while adding to pressure on the talks .

The U.S. - Turkish relationship suffered in 2003 when Ankara opposed the invasion of Iraq and refused to let U.S. troops deploy on its territory .
Turkey has also criticized Washington for allowing Kurdish separatists to be based in northern Iraq .
Obama drew on his personal background to emphasize his conciliatory message to Muslims .
“ The United States has been enriched by Muslim Americans .
Many other Americans have Muslims in their family , or have lived in a Muslim - majority country .
I know , because I am one of them , ” Obama said in his speech to parliament .
Obama also said he sought engagement with Iran , but added : “ Iran ’s leaders must choose whether they will try to build a weapon or build a better future for their people . ”
Obama offered to improve cooperation in the fight against PKK separatist rebels and backed Turkey ’s troubled EU bid .
“ Turkey ’s greatness lies in your ability to be at the center of things .
This is not where East and West divide , it is where they come together , ” Obama said .

As I mentioned here before , I find Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to be a cowardly , spineless tool .
Yesterday , Reid basically signed on to the latest GOP Manufactured Outrage Event ( TM ) and torpedoed Obama ’s request for funding to shut down Guantanamo .
Here ’s what he said :
QUESTION : If the United States — if the United States thinks that these people should be held , why should n’t they be held in the United States ?
Why should n’t the U.S. take those risks , the attendant risk of holding them , since it ’s the one that says they should be held ?
REID : I think there ’s a general feeling , as I ’ve already said , that the American people , and certainly the Senate , overwhelmingly does n’t want terrorists to be released in the United States .
And I think we ’re going to stick with that .
QUESTION : What about in imprisoned in the United States ?
REID : If you ’re … ( CROSSTALK ) REID :
If people are — if terrorists are released in the United States , part of what we do n’t want is them be put in prisons in the United States .
We do n’t want them around the United States .
Fuck Reid and the horse he rode in on .
It ’s brain - dead shit like this that may someday drive me out of the arms of the Democratic Party .
Is there anyone in the halls of power besides Obama with any intestinal fortitude ?
With all the posts I ’ve had to write on Reid , I am rapidly running out of adjectives synonymous with “ cowardly ” , “ stupid ” and “ ineffective ” .

Update : John Cole highlights this story about Reid ’s re-election chances :
Nearly half of Nevadans have had enough of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid as the powerful Democrat heads into his re-election campaign , a new Las Vegas Review - Journal poll finds .
About a third of the state ’s voters would re-elect Reid if the 2010 election were held today , according to the poll , but 45 percent say they would definitely vote to replace him .
Seventeen percent would consider another candidate .
He and I see eye to eye :
Yeah .
It would just break my heart if Harry Reid loses .
Update 2 : Harry Reid should take some lessons in moxie from Dick Durbin :
Some of my Republican colleagues argue that Guantanamo is the only appropriate place to hold the detainees and they said , and I quote , ‘ We do n’t have a facility that could handle this in the United States , ’ end of quote .
And American prison guards , they went on to say , quote , ‘ have no idea what they ’re getting into , ’ close quote .
Well , I would just say to my colleagues who made those statements , you ought to take a look at some of our security facilities in the United States , and you ought to have a little more respect for the men and women who are corrections officers and put their lives on the line every single day to keep us safe and to make sure that those who are dangerous are detained and incarcerated .
The reality is that we ’re holding some of the most dangerous terrorists in the world right now in our federal prisons , including the mastermind of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing , the shoe bomber , the Unibomber , and many others .

A COUPLE OF SUMMERS ago I was in Boulder , Colorado , where I grew up , for a visit .
On a wildfire - dry Saturday morning , I went with my husband and son to the downtown farmers market .
We got ice water from a drink stand , broccoli from Pachamama Organic Farm , and a muffin from an old favorite , the Brillig Works , where the guy was nice enough to say he remembered me from when I was 17 .
On the way out , we threw the remains of the muffin in a receptacle for compostables and the water cup in a bin for commingled containers .
I was n’t sure what to do with the straw , so we took it with us , because the market is a “ zero waste zone , ” where anything not compostable or recyclable must be “ packed out . ”
I thought of our regular Saturday Greenmarket back in Brooklyn , where there are no recycling bins — just dented metal drums overflowing with newspapers , water bottles , and dog poop .
I said to my husband , “ This would never work in New York . ”
Then I wondered why .
What makes a city good at recycling ?
Is it just a cultural thing ?
Why is Boulder a city of recycling zealots and New York a city of recycling skeptics ?
Many New Yorkers see their recycling program as a total facade — or , at least , a total failure .
Debates about our refuse burn in the massive incinerator online .
“ Is it true that New York and New Yorkers do n’t recycle their rubbish ? ” wonders an Australian on Answerbag .
Closer to home : “ [ A ] lawyer friend of ours who works for the City … said he was fairly certain that the City does n’t actually recycle — that it ’s all a charade , ” writes Brooklynite Carrie McLaren on Stay Free !
Daily , a blog of consumer culture .
McLaren herself does n’t “ believe in such a massive conspiracy , ” but is struck by how many others do .
The origins of New York ’s recycling skepticism are murky , but many point to a notorious 1996 New York Times Magazine cover article by John Tierney titled “ Recycling Is Garbage . ”
According to Tierney , recycling neither made economic sense ( cities lost money doing it ) nor was good for the environment ( he claimed , for instance , that recycling newsprint “ creates more water pollution than making new paper ” ) .
Recycling cranks had been making these arguments for years , but the Times gave their reasoning a kind of counterintuitive cred .
I remember reading the article the Sunday it appeared .
Though I ’d been a committed recycler since my teens — the girl who made a show of collecting the Coors Light cans after the beer bash — Tierney introduced an element of doubt .
I actually agreed with him about some stuff — namely , that recycling served as “ a rite of atonement for the sin of excess . ”
Was it possible that he was right about other things , too ?
In the years that followed , I recalled the piece whenever I needed to rationalize a recycling misdemeanor such as tossing a shampoo bottle into the regular trash .
The technique used to recycle plastic is actually worse for the environment — right ?
I found that others also retained their own Tierney “ facts . ”
One night when I asked my husband why he ’d thrown the breaded - chicken box in the garbage , he cited the glut of recycled paper — a 12 - year - old nugget from Tierney .
Our memories of the story testified to its staying power .
The National Resources Defense Council called Tierney ’s piece “ the most prominent … attack on the nation ’s growing commitment to recycling , ” noting that the article was discussed in more than two dozen major newspapers and prompted New York ’s mayor , Rudolph Giuliani , to mock his city ’s recycling program as “ absurd . ”
Our next mayor , Michael Bloomberg , went even further .
He did n’t just dis the program ; he dismantled it .
In 2002 , Bloomberg suspended the recycling of plastic and glass .
The city was facing a budget deficit , and Bloomberg said his measure would save $ 40 million .
For the next two years , we left our Brooklyn Lager bottles on the stoop for the homeless or just threw them in the trash .
“ That lost the faith of a lot of people , ” says Elizabeth Royte ( see “ Meet the Zero - Waste Zealots “ ) , who immersed herself in the city ’s waste stream for her book Garbage Land .
Now even true believers began to wonder if the new policy just codified what had been happening all along : mobsters collecting your recyclables and , when you were n’t looking , dumping them in with the regular trash .
Bloomberg fully restored pickup two years later , in a contrite acknowledgment that recycling did the city both environmental and financial good .
( According to the city comptroller , savings from the suspension were “ minimal , if any . ” )
At the time , recycling was finally starting to satisfy even the critics who cared only about the balance sheet .
As the price of landfilling garbage was rising , recycling markets were improving .
The costs of the two kinds of disposal had nearly reached parity when the world economy collapsed last fall .
Today the recycling market is depressed .
But New York ’s current contracts with buyers were structured to protect us from such fluctuations .
That ’s good , because another hiatus would be a Sisyphean setback : New Yorkers are still recycling less than they were before the last interruption .
New York City residents — and we ’re just talking residents , not businesses , not schools , not construction sites — recycle 18 percent of their waste .
This is what waste wonks call a “ diversion rate , ” meaning that it measures , by weight , what portion of refuse is diverted from the regular trash .
Weight , rather than volume , or rate of participation , is the established metric primarily because all over the world , people put garbage trucks on scales .
It ’s an imperfect system :
The number on the scale does n’t differentiate between a ton of glass and a ton of paper , or tell us how many lightweight yet toxic BlackBerrys we ’re tossing .
But for better or worse , the diversion rate is the standard measure of a recycling program ’s success .
Our diversion rate is better than Oklahoma City ’s , which , at 3 percent , is the lowest of any major city in the country , but not as high as San Francisco ’s , where residents reportedly recycle nearly half their garbage .
( I say “ reportedly ” because laid - back California only estimates its diversion rates ; type - A New York weighs every truck . )
How can we get New Yorkers — or Philadelphians ( 8.4 percent ) , or Denverites ( 13 percent ) — to recycle more trash ?
Perhaps better marketing ?
The Czech Republic tries to sell citizens on recycling with sexy TV ads .
In one , a mop - top boy and his huge - boobed neighbor reach their communal bins at the same time .
The tagline : “ Any reason is a good reason to recycle . ”
Funny , but in America , it ’s our policies that require manipulation , not just our perceptions .
Even if every New Yorker recycled everything perfectly all of the time , our residential diversion rate would only reach 35 percent .
The city simply does n’t include enough materials in the program to do any better than that .
So what are n’t we recycling that we could be ?
Let ’s start with yogurt cups .
New Yorkers are obsessed with the fact that we ca n’t recycle yogurt cups :
Three times a month , some of my neighbors carry their rinsed - out cups to the Park Slope food co-op , which sends them to Recycline , a company that turns them into toothbrushes , razors , and other items .
Yogurt cups are n’t included in the city ’s recycling program because the resale market for the type of plastic they ’re made out of is limited .
But yogurt cups do n’t weigh very much .
Let ’s say we began collecting them , as well as all of the other kinds of plastics that are currently excluded from our program :
Our residential diversion rate would increase by all of 0.4 percent .
Still , Benjamin Miller , a former Sanitation Department policy planner and the author of Fat of the Land , a history of garbage in New York City , argues that we should collect all plastic containers , as they do in Dallas , San Jose , and San Francisco .
The volatile yogurt - cup market — that ’s a headache for the waste wonks .
The parsing between No. 1s and No. 2s — that ’s a task for sorting facilities .
For residents , recycling should be as “ simple as signs on the street that say , ‘ Pick up after your dog , ’ period , ” says Miller .
If one way to simplify recycling is to change what we collect , another is to change how we collect it .
New Yorkers will tell you that they do n’t recycle because the city makes it too complicated .
Sometimes they cite what turn out to be vestigial misunderstandings from an even more bewildering era .
It ’s news to many people , for instance , that they no longer have to bind newspapers into stacks no higher than 18 inches ( not since the mid-’90s ) , or separate out junk mail and cereal boxes ( that ended in 1997 ) , or sort different kinds of recyclables into clear or blue bags ( 2004 , R.I.P. ) .
These days , some cities are making recycling as mindless as possible by implementing “ single stream ” recycling , in which paper , metal , plastic , and glass are all mixed together in one bin .
Should this be our standard nationwide ?
Proponents argue that it makes people more likely to recycle ; others counter that the quality suffers .
Miller is all for simplicity , but says single stream “ degrades the material and reduces the amount that can be made into new products . ”
A glass recycler told BusinessWeek that single - stream glass arrives mixed in with “ slime , chicken bones , and needles . ”
Chicken bones :
There ’s an idea .
The most dramatic way to boost a city ’s diversion rate is to compost food scraps and yard waste , which in NYC are a weighty 39 percent of our household waste stream .
At least 42 communities , mostly in California and Washington , have residential composting programs .
Could it work in the five boroughs ?
Debatable .
Sixty - three percent of our housing stock is made up of multi-unit buildings — many with exterminator sign - up sheets in the lobby .
San Francisco ’s composting program is lauded , but it serves primarily single - family homes .
( Plus , compost needs a place to go once it ’s collected , and you would n’t believe the Not - In - My - Borough fights over siting such a facility . )
The issue of infrastructure is not easily overcome .
A recent Sanitation Department report stresses , “ It is well - known in the recycling evaluation literature that recycling in multi-unit apartment buildings is particularly difficult , ” citing discouraging studies from sources as varied as the Journal of Applied Social Psychology and the EPA .
( High - rise fun fact : Having a trash chute diminishes the amount of materials a building recycles by almost 11 percent . )
Our apartment buildings also prevent us from adopting the gold standard of garbage disposal , a pay - as - you - throw system , found in 7,000 communities , including San Francisco , where residents get a hefty discount for producing less garbage , but are n’t charged for more recyclables or compost .
A San Francisco recycling spokesman jeered in Chemical & Engineering News in 2007 that New York ’s current free - for - all system is an “ incentive for people to create garbage . ”
“ The benefits of pay - as - you - throw are clear , ” agrees David Hurd of the NYC recycling outreach office .
“ But how do you assess a fee in a big complex of 1,000 apartments ? ”
Miller , however , compares it to water metering : a 19th - century technology New York resisted until the 1980s .
Before those San Franciscans get too smug , though , take note that among things both cities can currently recycle , like paper , the diversion disparity narrows to within a few percentage points .
( And we do n’t “ estimate . ” )
The same high - density , trash - chute - addicted lifestyle that hampers our recycling impulses also has a preventative effect .
New Yorkers produce much less waste than the average American : about 250 pounds less per household per year .
And is n’t that the real point ?
While all Americans could do more to recycle , we also need to , contrarily , reduce our fixation on it .
Recycling is like a rock star whose solo career has eclipsed the rest of the band .
Reduce and reuse — where are they now ?
We obsess over recycling , demand that our cities make it cost neutral and effortless , yet at the same time , we discard “ garbage ” with impunity .
Recycling gives us permission to consume .
But putting a week ’s worth of plastic bottles into a clear bag instead of a black one does n’t address the real problem .
From a literal perspective , John Tierney was right : Recycling is garbage .
A modern soldier depends as much on good intel as a reliable rifle .
Gone are the days when decision - making happened at the highest levels of command and the non-coms just did what they were told .
In a modern world of insurgencies and roadside bombs , the soldier on the ground needs to have as much data as they can , as quickly as they can .
And when DARPA decided to try and solve the problem , their solution was TIGR , the Tactical Ground Reporting System .
Sam Earp , President of Multisensor Science , works as a consultant to DARPA and Mari Maeda is the program manager at DARPA .
Both will be speaking about TIGR at the O’Reilly Where 2.0 Conference in May .
James Turner :
Why do n’t you start by describing the problem that soldiers on the ground face today and how TIGR tries to help ?
Mari Maeda : Okay .
Well , just as you described , the problem is that in the past , the military has focused on feeding the information up the chain - of - command .
The decision - makers are the colonels and generals , and so the soldiers on the ground are just collecting information so they can make big decisions .
Now in Afghanistan and Iraq , really it ’s the patrol leaders , soldiers on the ground , lower echelon soldiers , captains , lieutenants who need to make decisions .
Are they going to take this route or the other route ?
Should they knock on this door or that door ?
Has this person ever been seen before or cited before ?
Does he have useful information ?
All of those day - to - day decisions are being made at the lowest echelon and we really needed a tool to serve those low - level soldiers .
And that ’s why TIGR was created .
JT : Can you describe a little bit about exactly what TIGR gives to the platoon level ?
MM : Yes .
TIGR has a map - based user interface .
And so instead of having a folder full of reports telling you what happened here and who they met with , here ’s a patrol debrief , instead of having Word files or Power Point slides , TIGR ’s a map - based application where you can go and do searches by defining an area .
It could be a rectangle , a circle , a polygon or a route even .
And it ’ll pull back all of the events and people and places , information along that route or in that region .
And it ranges from census collection that was done in the location , names of all of the schools , pictures of schools , videos of an attack that might ’ve taken place .
Very rich multimedia information will be returned to you for the area that you defined .
And so instead of just writing a patrol report that says this happened and hoping someone might read it , you ’re just really looking for geospatially relevant information for the mission at hand .
If you ’re going to take this route and you ’re not familiar with this route that you ’re thinking of taking , you can look and see how many attacks have taken place ; what kind of attacks have taken place ; who ’s been there before .
So all of that information is at your fingertips .
Sam , do you have anything to add to that ?
Sam Earp :
Well , the only thing I would add is that one specific problem that comes up in the sorts of conflicts we ’re in in Iraq and Afghanistan is that soldiers learn very — at some cost , they learn the area that they ’re assigned .
That is they learn the people .
They learn the villages .
They learn the roads .
And that knowledge that they gain over the course of a deployment is often times lost .
When those soldiers rotate back to the United States and new soldiers come in and are assigned a territory , then they come in without all of that knowledge .
They used to come in without all of that knowledge .
And that was actually a very , very dangerous period of time called the turnover of authority .
And one thing TIGR has done is that TIGR has made all of that information available to the soldiers that are coming in new , as it were , to an area , so that they ’re acclimated and have good knowledge of the people and the places and the roads and things of this sort when they arrive .
And this has been very important to the Army because , as I said , that turnover of authority , that change in the soldiers on the ground , was actually an extremely dangerous time for the troops .
JT : In terms of logistically how it actually works , first of all , it sounds like it ’s almost like a very wiki - like process where the consumers are also , to some extent , the contributors .
Is this loaded up before they go on a patrol ?
And can you describe at all physically what it is ?
Is it the kind of thing they dock when they get back to headquarters and it gets uploaded with whatever they did when they were out ?
MM : Right now , TIGR is used back at fixed sites .
They ’re not networked and used in vehicles or as they ’re doing patrols .
And we are actually going to be doing that .
So within the next six months or so , we will have a version of TIGR that you can use in the mobile environment .
But today , TIGR ’s used in the major FOBs and joint - security stations , JSSs and other outposts where soldiers come back to after patrols .
And TIGR ’s used not only after patrols but , of course , before the patrols , before the missions so soldiers can do mission planning , et cetera , on TIGR .
Today as TIGR ’s being used in Iraq and Afghanistan , there is n’t any specific mobile platform or computer that ’s used .
JT : Now , do the individual installations talk to each other as far as keeping each other synced up ?
MM : That ’s the unique feature of TIGR .
TIGR is somewhat like Google Maps and Wiki , but the backend of TIGR was very , very carefully designed so that it would work over military networks in these tactical environments where , as you can imagine , the network is very fragile and the bandwidth is sparse .
And we did not want to overload the bandwidth , the network .
But , at the same time , we wanted the soldiers to be able to share photos and videos and media rich information .
So the backend infrastructure of synchronizing the servers in really the right way .
What to share across the servers was something that we put a lot of thought into .
And so basically what we do is we create a network overlay , a network layer of servers .
And we ’re not just talking about half a dozen servers ; we ’re talking about many , many , many servers both in Iraq and Afghanistan .
And these servers form a network .
And they will share just the information that needs to be shared across the servers .
So things like metadata , text , thumbnails are shared across all of the servers .
But heavier information like the full - blown Power Point slide or video , you ’ll only get the metadata for that .
And if anyone pulls that information locally from a remote server , there ’s a caching mechanism that takes place .
So , again , you want to reduce the bandwidth usage as much as possible .
JT : Beyond the network issues , what are the other challenges of designing a system for deployment in a warfront environment ?
MM : There ’s lots of challenges .
Sam , do you want to take that question ?
SE : Well , I would say there are many , many challenges beyond the network .
And I would like to add that in regards to the network , TIGR is engineered in a way that a commercial product would never have to be engineered .
So I would like to say that the network engineering that went into TIGR is considerably different than you might find for a commercial product .
But I would say another challenge [ is that ]
TIGR was introduced into a warzone .
And it was introduced without any prior training originally .
So we were actually in the middle of a war training soldiers to use this system .
And what was interesting about it is it was basically the soldiers , naturally , are very busy .
And they were in the middle of a war .
And the last thing they wanted to do was take time to learn something new .
So there was a very , very skeptical audience when it was introduced .
And so the value of the system really had to be there for the soldiers to put in the time .
And it was there .
And the soldiers found the system very intuitive , easy to use and easy to learn .
So it really spread virally in some ways throughout Iraq and now Afghanistan .
MM : Just to expand on that point , the first brigade that used TIGR , that brigade actually did train in the US but once TIGR was introduced in Iraq , the other brigades discovered it .
And then , as Sam described , then we had to do on the fly training of all the new users .
And we have really a large number of users in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as in the States .
And just designing a really intuitive user interface is actually really challenging .
Just the placement of the buttons and the behavior of the windows and interaction with the maps , how that takes place intuitively , it ’s a challenge .
And I would say Google Maps is pretty easy to use , but TIGR is actually a lot easier to use than Google Maps and very intuitive .
And that ’s where we get a lot of our praises because you do n’t have to go and spend a week training on the system like with most military systems .
JT : It sounds like though the hardware was probably just stuff that had already been proven for the environment .
I ’m sure that they ’ve got lots of laptops and desktops that had been proved out for that kind of an environment .
MM : That ’s right .
That was one of the considerations when we decided to scale .
And we wanted to make it a web application so that when you have tens of thousands of users , you do n’t want to have to have them load new software and go and get an administrator and soldiers do n’t have administrative privileges on their laptops , right ?
And so we made a web - based application .
So scaling to a large number of users was a very high priority .
Another challenge I do want to mention is back in 2007 , really the Army was not prepared to — there was no process in place to very quickly approve , certify new software , new systems to be brought into theater .
And I think they ’ve improved that in many ways now .
But just going through the formal approval process with the military was also extremely challenging because the process was sort of in flux , changing .
And you can understand their position that you do n’t want some random system to be introduced to the network and possibly crash and jeopardize existing command control systems .
So getting through that process was also a fairly significant challenge initially .
SE : I ’d like to add that , I ’m sure this is obvious , but in addition to the sorts of challenges that have been mentioned , it was a warzone .
And we had people who volunteered to go to that warzone .
And it was an extremely dangerous place .
Logistics are difficult .
You have to rely on the Army .
And the Army , of course , is very busy doing other things , moving soldiers around , making sure everybody has food , making sure that the logistics are in place to support the soldiers .
So we came in with a lot of equipment .
And , of course , we work with the Army and fly by helicopter and do all of those things .
And all of those logistics , even communications , can be very , very difficult indeed .
So that in essence , some of the folks supporting TIGR were often times — they truly have to be independent .
They ’re out on their own in an area that really is n’t very accessible .
And they have to make decisions and figure out what to do for the troops on their own in a dangerous and very austere environment .
So it ’s not a normal environment in any sense .
JT : Just out of curiosity , when you ’re developing an intelligence 2.0 application for the military , what are you developing it in ?
MM : Sam , do you want to take that ?
SE : Do you mean the tools used to do the development ?
JT : Yeah .
What languages are you using ?
What ’s kind of your infrastructure for it ?
SE : Well , primarily right now it ’s C# , and it ’s a Microsoft infrastructure .
But we ’re flexible .
And , in fact , are converting to a UNIX flavor also .
You need a database , right ?
And the GUIs is being supplied by the browser , which is — right now , it ’s Internet Explorer .
And in some ways , we ’re constrained by what the Army will permit on its network .
So I think the intent is to move towards open source tools of various sorts .
And we ’re not quite there yet .
TIGR was developed over a couple of years .
And , as you might imagine , it developed while the developers were deployed .
And the functionality in TIGR has changed and increased in various ways based on feedback from the troops .
So , in a sense , we ’re always playing catch - up .
It ’s not quite as orderly as one might hope because the troops are in love with it and there are many , many users at this point .
And they all have opinions about what it should do .
So we ’re in the middle of it listening to the troops and in the meantime , also trying to build to modern open standards .
I would say one thing that probably has n’t been mentioned is the imagery in TIGR is some of the best the soldiers see anywhere at any time .
And this has meant a great deal to them because a map , a topographic map or something like that does n’t quite do it for a patrol leader .
The patrol leader is very interested in the height of buildings .
Buildings that have been destroyed and might not be there anymore .
The exact nature of the terrain by the side of the road .
Where the turns are .
Where the blind spots are .
Things that are much easier to visualize from imagery than from a map .
So we have worked hard to make sure that our imagery is as good as it possibly can be .
And , in fact , it has really made a lot of difference to the soldiers .
JT : Now , do the soldiers capture that imagery as they ’re out on patrol ?
Or do you kind of do it in advance of their work ?
MM : It ’s in advance of their work .
We have a separate process to update the imagery .
It ’s possible for a soldier to take a cut and paste image taken by UAV and put it into TIGR .
But in general , we ’ve got sort of base map layers and they consist of satellite collected imagery .
And we enhance it with even better resolution imagery for our different cities in different regions where they ’re available .
But we ’ve really streamlined the process so that the TIGR users have access to really the best imagery .
JT : One question I have is whenever you ’ve got information that ’s at least partially being sourced by the users , you always have the question of how do you kind of control the content so that you do n’t get a mess ?
You do n’t get people either putting inane things in or people putting their opinions in or things like that .
Have you had that problem at all ?
MM : We have n’t really had that problem .
And it ’s partly because everybody knows that they ’re entering information for everybody ’s benefit .
So they ’re not going to enter garbage .
At the same time , there are certain missions where you needed to put a lot of information in that was only useful for their own unit , that only they themselves could understand , but it did really clutter up the map .
What we ’ve done in TIGR is that you ’ve got really great discriminating search capabilities so you can search by date and time , unit names , location , types of events .
And so you can do a lot of filtering if you do n’t want to look at all of the garbage .
And I can tell you that over these few years that TIGR ’s been used , the growth in the content ’s been really amazing .
And if you just look at a mile square in the middle of Bagdad and see how much stuff you find in TIGR , it ’s just growing and growing and there ’s a lot .
And so you just do n’t want to do just an anytime search for even a square mile area in Bagdad because you ’ll get too many hits .
But because of the search options — so you can say , “ I just want to look at things from the past 30 days . ”
Or only these types of events , friendly activities or enemy activities or just stuff related to census collection or looking for these names .
You can really reduce the amount of returns that you get and you ’re not bothered by clutter .
SE : The other thing that struck me is the value of information depends on who ’s looking at it .
So that things that a general might not be interested in , this culvert on this road is open .
Okay ?
Might be of real importance to a patrol leader .
So the very fine - grained information that a senior level commander may not really need or be interested in for his or her situation awareness is of critical importance to those patrol leaders .
So while we do n’t find a lot of garbage , when I say garbage , I mean things that are of no value to anybody being put in the system , you do get different views of some of the information depending upon what echelon you ’re talking to , what unit you ’re talking to .
Things that are important to one group may not be important to another .
JT : At least from a public perspective , I do n’t think people are used to DARPA working on things that go directly into the field ; [ they ] tend to be thought of more as doing next generation research and prototyping .
Was this an out of the ordinary project for DARPA ?
Or is it just a lot of this type of work we do n’t hear about ?
MM : I do n’t think it ’s an out of ordinary .
There are a few systems that are actually being used in the field that DARPA worked on .
I mean if it ’s wartime , you need to kind of step up and do things that are needed if they ’re not being done by other organizations .
So it ’s definitely not unique .
But , yes , we do tend to work on next generation systems .
JT : The insurgents we deal with regularly seem to have become masters at repurposing consumer technologies like cell phones and the internet whereas the US seems to largely work with monolithic government contracts .
Are there things we could be doing better to leverage some of the technology that ’s already available to pretty much anyone who has a wallet ?
MM : Yes .
Yes . [ Laughter ]
Let me just leave it at that .
SE : I would say that some of the issues may not be as simple as they appear .
I would point especially to security issues .
JT : You ’ll both be at the Where 2.0 Conference talking about the project , what can people attending the panel expect to hear ?
MM :
They will hear sort of our discovery process of what soldiers really need as they go on missions and the types of wars we ’re fighting now .
They ’ll also hear about the — and I do n’t think we ’ll go into deep detail , but in some detail — of the architecture that we ’ve built that makes it unique and very different from commercial systems , map - based systems and really interesting use cases that we ’ve uncovered .
SE : Yeah .
I would just add there are areas that are of significant contrast with commercial practice , both good and bad .
And our ability to innovate is somewhat constrained .
And I think some of that may come through but also the opportunities .
I mean one way to think about it is that in our private lives , we have email and Blackberry and all kinds of good connectivity everywhere .
And soldiers do n’t .
They do n’t have that .
And so the question is why ?
And what can we do about it ?
And how is it useful to a soldier ?
And I think TIGR largely helped answer that question .
JT : I ’ve been speaking today to Sam Earp and Mari Maeda who are going to be speaking at the O’Reilly Where 2.0 Conference in May .
Thank you so much for taking the time to talk to us .
MM : You ’re welcome .
Thank you .
SE : You ’re welcome .
Thank you .
“ We ’re currently in the process of hiring a director . ”
For the past six months we were discussing the movie with Brett Ratner , and for more timing issues than anything else we had to part ways with Brett .
We all wanted him to do it , believe me ; just the timing did n’t work .
But you never know what can happen . ”
Directoris off the upcomingremake. , the producer behind the upcoming planned reboot of the “ ” franchise , tells Empire Magazine that Brett Ratner ( “ Rush Hour , ” “ X - Men : The Last Stand ” ) is no longer attached to the project .
According to CHUD ( V for Vendetta and the upcoming Ninja Assassin ) will step into the director ’s seat for the film .
He is also the protege of the Wachowski brothers , having previously worked as an assistant director on the “ Matrix ” trilogy .
This news is not surprising , since the Wachowskis were once rumored to take on “ Conan . ”
Producers must have kept a close relationship with the brothers and their team .
Production on the film hopes to get underway on August 24th in Bulgaria .
An Ohio appellate court has upheld the felony hacking conviction of a man who was found guilty of unauthorized access for misusing his computer at work .
Richard Wolf acknowledged that his behavior was inappropriate when he used his work computer to upload nude photos of himself to an adult web site and view other photos on porn sites , but he did n't think he should be convicted of hacking for doing so .
A jury disagreed and felt he exceeded his authorization on the computer , which the appellate court recently upheld ( .pdf ) .
Mark Rasch , a former federal prosecutor of computer crimes , called the conviction a misuse of the computer hacking law .
" This goes to the whole concept . . . that violation of an internal policy on the use of a computer can be piggybacked to make a crime , " said Rasch , who now works as a consultant for Secure IT Experts .
" His uploading of nude pictures is certainly inappropriate and something he could be terminated for , but it was perfectly legal .
When you use the heavy hand of the criminal law to prosecute inappropriate behavior , it 's just an abuse of the criminal statutes . "
Wolf was also convicted of soliciting a dominatrix online for sexual services , a misdemeanor .
Rasch says using the computer evidence for proof of this crime is appropriate , but charging him separately for felony hacking goes too far .
Rasch said the problem stems from an amendment that was made to the federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act – the federal anti-hacking law – that states have added to their own statutes .
" The early statute only talked about unauthorized access – which is breaking into computer , " he said .
" But then they amended it to say ' or exceeding the scope of authorization to access a computer ' . "
The amendment was intended to target employees who have access to a computer but abuse that access to obtain data they should n't have or go into parts of their employer 's network they should n't enter .
The amendment arose from the case of an IRS employee who was caught looking up tax returns on an assistant district attorney who was prosecuting his father , among others .
Authorities tried to prosecute him on hacking charges but ran into difficulty since he was authorized to use the computer system .
Unfortunately , Rasch says , the amendment created an opportunity for prosecutors to interpret the law too broadly .
" That term ' exceeding authorization ' is very loose and ambiguous , " he says .
The case began when Larry Wise , the Superintendent of the Shelby City Wastewater Treatment Plant , where Wolf was employed , was deleting old files from a work computer and found a nude photograph of Wolf .
When police interviewed him , Wolf admitted that in January 2006 he joined a web site called Adult Friend Finder to meet women and that , in violation of established work practices , he uploaded nude photos of himself from his work computer after women he met online requested pictures .
He also admitted accessing various porn sites and spending more than 100 hours doing personal business on his work computer .
Forensic analysis of the computer 's temporary internet files uncovered 703 pornographic photos as well as several sexually explicit e-mails Wolf exchanged with a dominatrix named Mistress Patrice , soliciting her services .
Wolf was convicted on state charges for three counts : unauthorized access to a computer , a felony ; theft of services in office ( essentially for depriving the city of his paid services while he conducted the unauthorized activities on a city computer on city time ) , which is also a felony ; and solicitation of prostitution , a misdemeanor .
He was sentenced to 15 months and a $ 5,000 fine for the two felony convictions and ordered to pay the city about $ 2,400 in restitution for personal business on city time .
On the misdemeanor solicitation charge , he was sentenced to 60 days ( to run concurrently with his other sentence ) and a fine of $ 500 .
His sentence was later reduced to two and a half years in " community control . "
Wolf argued for appeal on grounds that there was insufficient evidence for any of the convictions and that the convictions for unauthorized use of computer and theft of service in particular " are contrary to public policy and create such a manifest miscarriage of justice that such convictions must be reversed . "
The Ohio hacking statute reads in part that " No person , in any manner and by any means , including , but not limited to , computer hacking , shall knowingly gain access to , attempt to gain access to , or cause access to be gained to any computer , . . . without the consent of , or beyond the scope of the express or implied consent of , the owner of the computer , . . . or other person authorized to give consent . ”
The appellate court wrote that Wolf 's conduct was “ beyond the scope of the express or implied consent " and the charge of unauthorized use of a computer was based upon sufficient evidence .
The appellate court vacated the theft - of - service conviction , however .
Judge John
Wise wrote that " while the State presented evidence Appellant spent approximately 100 hours over a five month - period utilizing internet websites that were not related to his job , there was no evidence presented that his job performance suffered or that he failed to perform his job duties .
" Furthermore , even if it could be shown that Appellant failed to perform
such job duties , while it could certainly serve as a basis for termination from his
employment , such could not be the basis of a criminal theft in office charge . "
One of the judges wrote a dissenting opinion on this point , saying the state had proven that the city experienced a measurable loss for the time Wolf wasted on the computer .
The county assistant prosecutor said her office will appeal the ruling to the state supreme court .
UPDATE : David Carto , the attorney who handled Wolf 's appeal , told Threat Level that Wolf was prosecuted because authorities disapproved of the material he viewed online .
" The reason he was prosecuted was clearly because of the content of what he was looking at , " he said .
" If somebody else had been on an internet site studying horticulture , I do n't think he would have been prosecuted .
It was not obscene .
It was just something that was not approved of by certain elements of the city government and by the court in which he was tried .
The prosecutor and the judge both treated this basically as a sex offense . "
Carto said the photos
Wolf viewed were profile pictures from the adult dating site he visited .
Some of the profile photos of women on the site showed nudity but not sexual acts .
He said his client was a good worker and had even been promoted after his supervisors found the pictures .
Initially he was suspended while police investigated the case , but was promoted after he returned to work .
He lost his job , however , when he was convicted of the charges .
He added that the city had never actually disseminated a policy regarding internet usage to tell workers what was inappropriate .
" They had crafted one but they had n't published it , " he said .
" So there was in effect no policy and no protections on the computer – no password protection or filtering of any kind – so basically anybody could access anything on the internet through the city 's computer . "

North Carolina politicians are currently trying to push a change to corporate tax law in the hopes that the breaks will woo Apple into creating a billion dollar server farm in the state .
The Charlotte Observer reports that an anonymous official confirmed that Apple was the company the state is going after , as it was previously unclear who the changes were tailored for .
The breaks could be worth an estimated $ 46 million over 10 years and are apparently " very specific to the project , " according to one unnamed representative .
The bill has already passed through the North Carolina Senate and is slated to hit the House floor today .
If the House approves the bill , it would then go to the governor 's desk .
The Apple project would only qualify for the tax break if it is located in one of the poorer regions of North Carolina .
The company must also provide health insurance , meet an unspecified " wage standard , " and agree to declare itself ineligible for other tax breaks and grants from the state .
The hope is to help curb unemployment , even if it is with a mere 100 full time jobs that the Apple server farm would initially offer .

( New York ) - The US Defense Department 's claim that a former Guantanamo detainee is a " recidivist " to terrorism appears to be based on a confession obtained by Russian authorities through torture , Human Rights Watch said today .
According to media reports , an unreleased Pentagon study has concluded that about one in seven of the 534 detainees who have been transferred from the Guantanamo Bay detention center returned to terrorism or militant activity .
The former detainee , Rasul Kudaev , has been held for more than three years in pretrial detention in Nalchik , a city in southern Russia , where he is accused of participating in an October 2005 armed uprising against the local government .
Human Rights
Watch 's investigations into Kudaev 's case found that he was severely beaten soon after his arrest to confess to crimes .
" If the Pentagon relied on forced confessions for the evidence to prove recidivism , then its conclusions are pretty questionable , " said Carroll Bogert , associate director of Human Rights Watch .
" Terrorism is a label that is widely abused by many of the governments who have taken back their citizens from Guantanamo . "
Kudaev is one of seven Russian citizens whom the US government picked up in Afghanistan after September 11 , 2001 and sent to Guantanamo .
They were returned to Russia in 2004 despite their fears of being tortured and ill - treated back home .
Human Rights
Watch detailed their harassment and mistreatment by Russian authorities in a 2007 report , " The Stamp of Guantanamo . "
Human Rights
Watch interviewed Kudaev 's mother , lawyer , and others familiar with the case in 2006 .
His mother and others say that Kudaev was at home during the Nalchik uprising and that injuries he sustained while being arrested in Afghanistan , which worsened in detention at Guantanamo , made it impossible for him to leave the house , much less participate in armed conflict .
" The detainees begged not to be returned to Russia because they knew they would be tortured there , " said Bogert .
" Kudaev 's case does n't prove that ex-Guantanamo detainees are likely to return to terrorism .
It proves that they should not be sent home to countries that routinely use torture . "
Another Russian former Guantanamo detainee , Ruslan Odizhev , was shot dead in 2007 in what local police claimed was an exchange of small - arms fire in Nalchik .
His mother told Human Rights Watch in 2006 that he had been repeatedly and brutally tortured by security officials before he left Russia for Afghanistan , and that after his return from Guantanamo , he disappeared at least partly to avoid further mistreatment .
Another Russian former Guantanamo detainee has received political asylum in the Netherlands and is living quietly there .
In all , more than 40 former detainees , most of them European citizens or residents , are now living in Europe .
None is known to have engaged in militant or other violent activity .
Hey there , time traveller !
This article was published 24/2/2009 ( 4235 days ago ) , so information in it may no longer be current .
A Manitoba girl thought she was getting a deal when she bought four tickets online to Carrie Underwood ’s concert last December at the MTS Centre for what she thought was a total of $ 193 .
But her mother was shocked when she later learned her credit card account had been dinged for more than $ 1,000 from a TicketMaster subsidiary , TicketsNow .
The girl had joined thousands of other concert fans who purchased tickets to an event at an inflated price from Tickemaster ’s subsidiary , TicketNow .
Last week , the girl ’s mother initiated court action in the Manitoba Court of Queen ’s Bench against Ticketmaster and its related companies — Ticketmaster Entertainment Inc. , Ticketmaster Canada Ltd , Tnow Entertainment Group Inc. , and Premium Investory Inc — claiming the company violated a section of Manitoba ’s Amusement Act .
It states that no person shall sell any ticket for a price higher than its paid value .
Tickets to the Underwood concert were listed at $ 57 each , but the girl ’s mother was ultimately billed $ 252.51 for each ticket — an overcharge of $ 195.51 for each ticket .
Ticketmaster is the exclusive distributor of tickets to all events at the MTS Centre and many concert venues across North America .
It routinely adds in additional charges for such things as printing costs and site fees on top of the ticket price .
But lately , concertgoers across North America have found that when they log in to the TicketMaster website and try to buy tickets to an event , they are directed to another website , TicketsNow , which sells tickets to the same events for a vastly inflated price .
That ’s what happened to the Manitoba girl .
She and her mother could not be reached for comment this morning .
The practice drew international attention when megastar Bruce Springsteen complained when Ticketmaster did the same thing with one of his recent shows in New Jersey .
That prompted ticket buyers in the U.S. to launch a class action lawsuit against Ticketmaster , The Justice Department of New Jersey also launched an investigation .
Ticketmaster announced Monday that as a result of the New Jersey investigation , it would change its selling practises .
Ticketmaster said a software glitch was responsible for redirecting ticket buyers from its own site to TicketsNow .
The company did not admit any wrongdoing , but agreed to pay the state of New Jersey $ 350,000 .
Ticketmaster agreed to compensate ticket holders who complained and change how it handles secondary sales , but would not say if it was changing its selling practises in Canada .
Two class-action lawsuits have been initiated in Canada against Ticketmaster for tickets sold on or after Feb. 9 , 2007 , anywhere in Canada .
A $ 500 - million suited filed Feb. 9 accuses the company of violating Canada ’s anti-scalping laws by conspiring to divert ticket buyers from its main website to TicketsNow .
A second , $ 250 - million lawsuit launched three days later targets the extra fees tacked on when customers purchase tickets through the company ’s website .
Law firms in Ontario and British Columbia are handling the class action suit .
People interested in joining the class action can find more information on the website www.ticketmasterclassaction.com
You ’ll need ticket stubs or other documentation to prove you purchased the concert tickets .

I was coming up with Good Exception Management Rules of Thumb for .
NET .
Here 's what my brainstorming came up with .
What do you have as good Rules o' Thumb ?
Exceptions are exceptional and should be treated as such .
If something exceptional , unusual , or generally " not supposed to ordinarily happen " then an exception is a reasonable thing to do .
You should n't throw exceptions for things that happen all the time .
Then they'd be " ordinaries " .
If your functions are named well , using verbs ( actions ) and nouns ( stuff to take action on ) then throw an exception if your method can't do what it says it can .
For example , SaveBook ( ) .
If it can't save the book - it can't do what it promised - then throw an exception .
That might be for a number of reasons .
If you can , throw an exception that means something , and if there 's an exception that already exists that matches what happened semantically , throw that .
Do n't create a HanselmanException just because you 're writing the Hanselman module unless you 're adding data or valuable semantics to the type .
If you are building a framework ( or even if you 're not ) throw ArgumentExceptions and ArgumentNullExceptions liberally .
Just as your method should throw if it can't do what it promised , it should throw if you supplied it with crap input .
If you are building a framework ( or even if you 're not ) throw ArgumentExceptions and ArgumentNullExceptions liberally .
Just as your method should throw if it can't do what it promised , it should throw if you supplied it with crap input .
If something horrible happens ( something exceptional ) then you need to decide if you can keep going .
Do n't catch exceptions you can't do anything about .
It 's likely if you could do something about it , it would n't be exceptional , and you might consider calling TryParse , or File .
Exists , or whatever it takes to prevent that exception .
There are reasons to swallow exceptions ( catch ( Exception ex ) ) but they are few and far between and they should be logged if appropriate and documented liberally .
Remember always if you do catch an exception and intend to rethrow it , then use throw ; not throw ex ; lest you lose your call stack and good bits of context .
Create a global error handler that logs everything .
A user should n't ever see an exception dialog or ASP .
NET Yellow Screen of Death , but if they do , let them know that you 've been notified .
{smartassembly} is an easy way to make this happen .
So is ELMAH for ASP .
NET .
( I freakin ' love ELMAH )
Yes Response .
Redirect in ASP.NET causes an internal exception .
Yes , it 's a bummer , but there 's a reason .
It was an easy way to stop execution .
If you do n't like it , call its overload and stop page execution yourself .
Personally , I do n't sweat that one , but then I avoid Redirects , too .
