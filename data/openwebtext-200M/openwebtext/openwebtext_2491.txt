Forget about French wines and fois gras – the hottest spots in town are serving up fries , fountain drinks and Filet - o- Fish sandwiches .
The recession has driven droves of penny - pinching execs out of their preferred pricey eateries and into the bolted - down seats of McDonald’s .
Even notoriously picky New Yorkers who hobnob at Michelin - rated restaurants and would n’t even use the bathroom at an Applebee ’s are seeing the benefits of the “ Dollar Menu . ”
“ You ’ve got to save when you can , ” said a resigned John Castellaneta , 55 , an executive who works in lower Manhattan .
“ I ’ve got two kids in college . ”
He ’d rather be eating filet mignon , but yesterday for lunch , he had a Mickey D’s Quarter Pounder and fries .
“ I try to do it once a week .
It ’s cheap and it ’s easy , ” he said .
In the Financial District , Wall Streeters have developed an appetite not only for McDonald ’s hamburgers , they ’re gobbling up its stock , as well .
McDonalds net income increased a whopping 80 percent from 2007 to 2008 – and its shares rose 11.22 percent from January 2008 to January 2009 , while the rest of the market tanked .
“ You hear all the news going on [ about the economy ] , and you want to save money .
This is good value , ” said lunchgoer Mark Drapala , 29 , a sales - account exec who works near Astor Place .
He said he used to hit Mickey D’s only about once a month , but he has stepped up his lunches there to save money .
“ I get the Number 2 meal for $ 5.45 .
I do n’t Super - Size it , ” he said .
His other lunch haunts , which include a deli near his office and a falafel place , cost more than that , he said .
Sandy Horowitz , a Wall Street recruiter , said he , too , hits McDonald ’s for serious savings .
“ In the past , when times are good , I ’d be eating out [ in a restaurant ] , ” said the Queens resident .
He ’s saving by ordering off the Dollar Menu or clipping coupons for the fast - food joint .
People like Horowitz are doing their part to add to McDonald ’s bottom line .
On Monday , the chain surprised industry observers by announcing an unexpectedly strong fourth - quarter performance .
Although it reported a 23 percent drop in earnings from the same quarter in 2007 , the year before included a huge one - off tax gain – and in 2008 , the company significantly increased its daily customers and boasted a 7.2 percent increase in global same - store sales , fueled by a 5 percent increase in the United States .
“ They ’re performing pretty much head and shoulders over any other restaurant , ” said Sarah Lockyer of Nation ’s Restaurant News , a trade magazine .
“ People who have n’t been there for ages are going back . ”
She said the eateries ’ sudden appeal is due to their value meals .
“ You can get a huge breakfast and a cup of coffee for , like , $ 3 . People have traded down from Starbucks and these higher - end coffee shops , ” Lockyer said .

While Amazon 's sold - out Kindle is missing in action this Christmas , Apple 's iPhone is becoming a more attractive e-book reader : NYC - based ScrollMotion has just started selling the first of many e-books it'll sell via the iPhone app store , including big - name books like Philip Pullman 's " The Golden Compass . "
While there 's plenty of e-books for the iPhone already , ScrollMotion has two advantages over its rivals : A gorgeous , feature - filled e-reader app called Iceberg and deals with several major publishers , including Random House , Simon and Schuster , Houghton Mifflin , Penguin , and Hachette .
Will the iPhone replace books -- or even a Kindle ?
Not for serious readers -- the screen is small , the battery life is iffy , etc .
But we could see book snackers reading a chapter a day or so -- or a magazine , or travel guidebook , or reference materials -- on their phone or iPod touch .
Especially if Apple starts selling a bigger - screen " iPod touch HD " of sorts someday .
One downside : Some of ScrollMotion 's publishing partners mistakenly seem to think that people will pay anywhere near ( or more than ) hardcover prices for an iPhone book .
Knopf , for instance , is charging $ 28 for Christopher Paolini's " Brisingr " for iPhone .
This is where Amazon 's ( AMZN ) subsidy gives the Kindle a real advantage -- the Kindle edition of " Brisingr " is $ 9.99 , and even the hardcover is just $ 16.50 at Amazon .
But if publishers keep putting out good titles -- and start charging sane prices , which some already are -- we think there 's a bright future here .
Which would be good news for the publishers , good news for ScrollMotion , and good news for Apple ( AAPL ) , which gets a 30 % cut from all iPhone app sales .

Human hair could be used instead of chemical fertilizers for some plants like lettuce , new research in a horticultural journal suggests .
The hair , which is manufactured into cubes from barbershop and hair - salon waste , provides nitrogen for plants as it decomposes , just as natural - gas - derived sources like ammonia do .
" Once the degradation and mineralization of hair waste starts , it can provide sufficient nutrients to container - grown plants and ensure similar yields to those obtained with the commonly used fertilizers in horticulture , " said horticulturalist Vlatcho Zheljazkov of Mississippi State University .
All plants need nitrogen to grow .
These plants form the basis of the proteins which eventually make their way into our bodies either directly through the consumption either of the plants themselves or of animals raised on plants .
Our bodies turn those proteins into all sorts of useful things — like muscles — and some less useful things , like hair .
In fact , studies carried out in the 1960s found that human hair contains about 15 percent nitrogen [ pdf ] .
Nitrogen is ridiculously abundant .
It composes about 75 percent of the atmosphere , but plants can't use it in its inert atmospheric form .
Luckily , some microbes that grow with legumes pull this N2 out of the air and " fix it " into the reactive nitrogen that all living things use .
Until the development of the Haber - Bosch process for cooking natural gas with more natural gas into nitrogen - rich ammonia , humans depended entirely on these microbes for the production of nitrogen .
We either rotated other crops with legumes or used the nitrogen left over from animal digestion as manure .
The last 50 years , however , have seen enormous increases in the use of synthetic fertilizers using ammonia from the Haber - Bosch process .
Vaclav Smil of the University of Manitoba , one of the world 's foremost experts on energy , estimates that 40 percent of the human population owes its existence [ pdf ] to synthetic fertilizers .
But all that nitrogen takes a lot of energy to produce .
Smil has also estimated that the Haber - Bosch process uses about 1 percent of the world 's total energy usage [ xls ] , or about 150 gigawatts .
That 's about as much coal power as the UNited States plans to add between now and 2030 , so low - energy alternatives to traditional chemical fertilizers could help reduce energy usage .
The new study , published in HortTechnology , shows that both lettuce and wormwood , the psychoactive ingredient in absinthe , grow about as well with hair as a fertilizer as they do with chemical fertilizers .
The plants seem to be able to use about 50 percent of the nitrogen contained in the hair .
The only catch is that the hair takes a while to start decomposing and releasing nutrients into the soil , so it has to be paired with more fast - acting fertilizers .
( And that some people might find decomposing hair fertilizing their salad greens a little gross . )

When the history of this race is written , will Palin be blamed for McCain 's loss ?
Doubtful .
Republicans have been explaining away their weaknesses this year blaming such factors as the recession , being outspent four - to - one by Democrats in some states , President Bush 's catastrophic leadership , the unpopular Iraq war , and so on .
Nonetheless , she did little to help the ticket .
Governor Palin has made clear she sees her experience on the campaign as a launching pad to a more permanent spot on the national stage , not a crash and burn finale .
Can she turn her loss into future success ?
That .
Too. seems doubtful , given the timing .
As the GOP leadership figures out how to move forward , evangelical Republicans will inevitably lose their vice - like grip on the GOP .
With Palin as their spokesmodel ( in the words of shock jock Howard Stern ) , her time seems to have passed along with theirs .

Top Tips for Feeling Good About Your Dial - up Connection and Still Looking Cool in 2009
Think of your dial - up as a great opportunity for multi-tasking .
For instance , click on a page to load .
Now go make a seven course meal for 20 people .
Come back .
Re-connect because it stalled out in the middle due to inactivity .
Set the table , greet your guests , serve three of the courses , then check in again .
With dial - up , it 's not that you 're taking longer to do one thing -- it 's that you 're getting to do MORE things at once .
Share that point with the ungrateful naysayers at your party .
( Give those guests the dinner rolls that fell on the floor and got lightly licked by the dog . )
Did you really want to see those 24 MB photo files of your aunt 's cats in drag ?
Of course you did n't .
With a high speed connection , you 'd have to endure every last blurry , furry , incomprehensible shot .
But with dial - up ?
All you have to do is make an educated guess of what 's probably in the pictures .
Be vague .
" Mr. Fluffy is so funny , is n't he ?
LOL . "
The Aunt is happy ...
You do n't have to spend time wondering if that 's a tail or part of a new feather boa ...
And all is right with the world .
Remember all that time you 'd otherwise be just wasting on YouTube .
Yep , with dial - up , temptation to check out the original 80s video of " Somebody 's Watching Me " by Rockwell , or that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Daffy Duck has his beak blown off twelve times , or the latest Angry Kid claymation -- well , it 's virtually whisked away .
Angry Kid would be Angry Senior Citizen by the time you 'd get things buffered on dial - up .
And you know this .
So perhaps you decide to go outside and actually - gasp !-- meet people .
Dial - up might just make you a real Casanova , if you work it right .
Make sure you use the socialization defense when friends want you to see this new cool video .
Remember -- you are too busy living life for such silliness !
Save the money that you would otherwise spend on Internet shopping .
If it takes you an hour to order it , you 're less likely to buy it , right ?
And did you really need that ionic hamster wheel , anyway ?
Or that portable swiss cheese de-holer ?
Or that Ethnically - Diverse Barbie with special United Nations Ombudsman Action ?
No !
We 're in tough economic times , people !
It is fiscally wise to remain far , far away from that coveted bulk collection of hand - tinted turkey buzzard etchings .
All these high speed people will be in the poor house surrounded by their QVC diamonettes , while you , Dial - Up Diva are counting your dough !
Consider yourself savvy .
Think of the great exercise you 're getting with all the running back and forth to the computer .
You 're on - the - go , you 're working off calories .
You clock ten miles a day just running from floor to floor , checking to see if the page has finally loaded .
So you , you can enjoy that ice cream sundae with hot fudge those fatty - fats on high speed should n't have .
You 're slim and in the game .
ERROR 2874.240. COULD NOT PUBLISH FULL BLOG POST .
THIS CONNECTION MAY HAVE TIMED OUT DUE TO LACK OF ACTIVITY .
TRY AGAIN LATER .
It takes a special sort of someone to still be on dial - up in 2009 .
Someone who charts their own course ...
Sets their own pace ...
Bravely eschews the fads and , um ...... Just does n't get much time off work to have something better installed .
Okay , yes : I 'm talking about .
I admit it -- am still on dial - up here at home .
( Hangs head , shuffles feet . )
On the plus side , see , myis over 100 years old .
So , with computer access technology that 's slightly newer than Atari Pong , I 'd say it evens out .
I mean , even on dial - up , the Victorians wouldloved the computer .
They 'd be ... oh ... reading Charles Dickens e-books ...
And ordering rolls of busy floral wallpaper .
And , hey , if their online order took a half hour to process ?
No big !
Remember , these people spent two days driving twenty miles down the road .
They could spend a day churning butter .
A half hour ?
T'is to laugh !
Still , being on dial - up in a high - speed connectivity world sometimes requires special tactics ... Coping mechanisms designed to help youup - to - speed , when in fact , you 're being passed on the internet highway by energetically Web - surfing turtles .
So for you -- youother people out there on the Internets on dial - up , making with the Googles -- I give you myI hope you , five other remaining people on dial - up who got here via the Googles , that you 've found these points above a helpful way of reinforcing your decision to remain on dial - up .

Armless Man Caught Driving With His Feet
Zing Shen , a 42 year - old man with no arms , was recently caught driving with his feet in Beijing .
Zing told police that ever since he lost his arms in an industrial accident several years ago , he had used his feet to steer his vehicle without difficulty .
He has no arms from the elbows down .
“ He had an automatic so did not need to worry about changing gears and said he had put a lot of practice into learning to control the steering wheel with his legs .
He said he was actually even more careful now with driving than he had been before he lost his arms .
He was surprised when we arrested him . ”

The Paris - based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) released a study Tuesday showing clearly that the gap between rich and poor is widening in Europe and North America .
The report , which covers developments spanning 20 years in 30 countries , contains some interesting nuggets :
• The U.S. has the greatest inequality in the OECD after Mexico and Turkey -- and the gap has grown rapidly since 2000 .
The richest 10 percent of Americans earn an average of $ 93,000 ( highest in the OECD ) - whereas the poorest 10 percent of Americans earn an average of $ 5,800 ( about 20 percent lower than the OECD average ) .
• Since 2000 , income inequality has grown fastest in Germany , although Germany 's gap remains below the OECD average .
• British inequalities have been falling since 2000 , but the rich - poor gap there is still wider than in three - fourths of OECD countries .
• The rise in inequality is generally due to the rich improving their incomes relative both to low - and middle - income people .
• Older people are much less likely to be poor than in the past .
Poverty has shifted from pensioners to young adults and families with children .
The report is likely to fuel popular resentment on both sides of the Atlantic about what is widely perceived to be the essential unfairness of this month 's rapid , massive bank bailouts engineered by governments in response to the financial crisis .
This week Ulrike Mascher , President of Germany 's largest social welfare advocacy organization , drove the point home : " People ask themselves why 500 billion euros can be mobilized very quickly to recapitalize banks while an effective poverty - fighting program is rejected due to budgetary concerns . "
The study offers fodder to those like Mascher who argue that the bailouts must now be followed by economic stimulus efforts .
In the U.S. , Democrats are pushing for such a package , and both President Bush and Fed Chairman Bernanke have voiced support .
In Europe opinions are mixed , but many are watching the U.S. debate .
Anticipation of a U.S. growth package has already pushed the dollar to its highest level against the euro since the summer of 2007 .
The OECD report also offers a caution , however , to those arguing that the best way to curb poverty and reduce inequalities is for government simply to redistribute wealth through social policies .
Such approaches are proving to be less effective because technological progress and globalization are making it harder for low - skilled workers to find work .
Studies by the IMF and many other sources confirm that better access to education and training is more likely to close income disparities .
So who bucked the trend ?
According to the report , the big winner was France - where income inequalities have fallen as fast as the country 's integration into the global economy has risen .
C'est incroyable .

Poll : Nearly one in four say Cheney worst veep in US history Mike Sheehan
Published : Monday December 22 , 2008
Print This Email This Just one percent say he 's best vice president ever
U.S. vice presidents are n't generally known for notoriety attained while in office , but Dick Cheney has left a new mark , a recent survey suggests .
A CNN poll of over a thousand Americans indicates that almost 25 percent believe Cheney is the worst veep in U.S. history .
" An additional 41 percent feel that Cheney is a poor vice president , " CNN reports , " with 34 percent rating him a good number two . "
Just one percent surveyed rank him at the top .
Despite his unpopularity , Cheney " will leave office as one of the most powerful vice presidents in history , " says CNN , playing a " crucial role in many of the Bush administration 's crucial policies " as well as being " a major proponent of using and expanding executive powers . "
For his part , Cheney does n't seem to be bothered by the way the public perceives him .
Seemingly more interested in historical posterity , he 's embarked on a tour of sorts to " [ make ] the affirmative case for the Bush legacy " as a CNN polling director put it , defend some of his actions as vice president , as well as take issue with how incoming VP Joe Biden will dramatically tone down the role of the second - in - command to suit tradition .
" I 'm very comfortable with where we are and what we achieved substantively , " Cheney said Sunday on Fox News .
" Frankly , I would not want to be one of those guys who spends all his time reading the polls .
I think people like that should n't serve in these jobs . "
He also does n't regret cursing at Sen. Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) back in 2004 on the floor of the Senate .
" I thought he merited it at the time , " said Cheney .
The CNN article can be read in full at this link .
Lending at many of the nation 's largest banks fell in recent months , even after they received $ 148 billion in taxpayer capital that was intended to help the economy by making loans more readily available .
Ten of the 13 big beneficiaries of the Treasury Department 's Troubled Asset Relief Program , or TARP , saw their outstanding loan balances decline by a total of about $ 46 billion , or 1.4 % , between the third and fourth quarters of 2008 , according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of banks that recently announced their quarterly results .
Those 13 banks have collected the lion 's share of the roughly $ 200 billion the government has doled out since TARP was launched last October to stabilize financial institutions .
Banks reporting declines in outstanding loans range from giants Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. , each of which got $ 45 billion from the government ; to smaller , regional institutions .
Just three of the banks reported growth in their loan portfolios : U.S. Bancorp , SunTrust Banks Inc. and BB&T Corp .
The loan figures analyzed by the Journal exclude some big TARP recipients that have n't reported fourth - quarter results yet , such as Wells Fargo & Co .
The overall decline in loans on the 13 banks ' books -- from about $ 3.36 trillion as of Sept. 30 to $ 3.31 trillion at year 's end -- raises fresh questions about TARP 's effectiveness at coaxing banks to reopen their lending spigots .
Plans to ride out a possible advertising nuclear winter continue apace at Gawker Media , Nick Denton 's New York blog publishing mini-empire , with the recent announcement that Consumerist.com is being sold to the Consumers Union , publisher of Consumer Reports .
Consumerist is the latest of Denton 's blogs to be sold off , in a move that he described in an e-mail to AllthingsD's Peter Kafka as part of the process of " pruning " his network down to only his highest - growth , most profitable sites .
Hollywood gossip site Defamer.com is also on the block .
Consumers Union claims that it wo n't be making any editorial changes to its new property , with the group insisting that the site 's snarky editorial voice represents a return to the somewhat staid organization 's early roots as a scrappy consumer advocate .
Much more interesting , though , than the actual sale of Consumerist — either what was paid for it ( Kafka says " mid six figures " ) or what will be done with it ( see Portfolio 's Felix Salmon for a good , insidery post on this ) — is Denton 's reason for thinning the herd .
In short , he 's planning for an economy in which online ad spending tanks by a whopping 40 percent before it turns back up again ( whenever that is ) .
Cliff diving : Internet edition ( h/t CR )
Back in November , when doom - and - gloom presentations at public conferences and in private boardrooms were all the rage , Denton published his own take on the economic meltdown .
Called " Doom - Mongering : a 2009 Internet Media Plan , " this read is as gloomy as they come .
Denton takes Mary Meeker 's ( in ) famous Web 2.0 presentation as a starting point ; in it , the Morgan Stanley analyst suggested that for each percentage point decline of GDP growth , advertising market growth drops roughly three times as fast .
But Denton thinks that Meeker is too optimistic , and he refines her results with some other GDP and ad market data from downturns in Indonesia , Sweden , and Japan to arrive at an ad market spending collapse of between 9 and 43 percent over the course of the entire downturn .
Denton then advises publishers to prepare for the worst - case scenario of an eventual 40 percent decline , with a possible 27 percent drop coming in 2009 .
I can't speak in detail to the numbers behind Denton 's projection , so I leave the projection itself as just a data point , maybe an outlier , but not necessarily worth discounting .
( Indeed , if the past few months have taught us anything , it 's that even outliers to the downside can be too optimistic . )
Before moving on to a summary of my own thoughts on this issue , developed over the course of some recent , off - the - record conversations with analysts and media types , I want to offer two more data points for your consideration .
The first datapoint is a widely cited MasterCard report ( linked at Ars but most widely known from the WSJ report on it ) , which shows an unprecedented , double - digit year - over - year decline in the advertiser - heavy luxury goods and electronics categories ( 35 percent and 27 percent , respectively ) .
And this is in the face of super - steep discounts at retail outlets .
The second datapoint is a research note from Morgan Stanley 's Mark Lipacis , who created some ripples in the ( admittedly very small ) semiconductor econ blogging pool with his forecast that chip company revenues could decline as much as 30 percent next year , leading to earnings - per - share drops of as high as 78 percent .
For my own reporting on the severe , margin - killing supply glut facing the chip sector next year , see this post .
In short , a 30 percent decline in net revenues for semis next year would not surprise me , and it would have painful ripple effects in the ad market via reduced spends for companies like Sony , Toshiba , Intel , AMD , and many others .
So things look bad in 2009 , but there 's a light at the end of the tunnel , right ?
Wait ; maybe that 's an oncoming train .
Ad infinitum
Most of the discussion of ad spending and GDP ( non ) growth skips lightly over the question of value , but it 's a question that 's worth asking .
Specifically , what if the end result of all of this pain and trauma will be not a return to the " normalcy " of the past decade but a reappraisal and repricing of the basic units of online display advertising ?
Denton himself touches on these issues twice in his memo .
The first time is a mention in passing of a point that I 've heard made at two different conferences , i.e. , that nothing can move the sales needle in a dramatic and measurable way like good TV exposure ; if you get on Oprah or buy a Superbowl spot , then the very next day you can expect to sell a whole lot of whatever you were hawking .
The second place where Denton touches on this point is when he raises the issue of the restrictive nature of online display ad formats .
I actually think about this a lot , myself , especially in the light of my academic interest in the history of media .
In short , both a TV program and a magazine represent a finite unit of ( more or less ) undivided attention .
Each of these media objects is carefully designed to grab your attention and to hold it within a bounded space — with boundaries being the start and end times of the program for TV , or the two covers of a magazine .
What advertisers buy when they purchase a magazine or TV ad is slice of the attention of some subset of that media object 's audience .
And the ads that they create for those purchased slices are attention - worthy objects in and of themselves , e.g. , Angelina Jolie posing with a diamond watch , or a hilarious vignette centered around a brand of beer .
A web page , in contrast , is typically festooned with hyperlinked visual objects that fall all over themselves in competing to take you elsewhere immediately once you 're done consuming whatever it is that you came to that page for .
So the page itself is just one very small slice of an unbounded media experience in which a nearly infinite number of media objects are scrambling for a vanishingly small sliver of your attention .
Advertisers already seem to have a sense that this sliver of attention that they 're getting is extremely miniscule , and they also know that it grows ever smaller as web users become more proficient at navigating the cacaphony of links in order to focus their attention on precisely what they came to a page for ( content ) .
This being the case , it 's entirely possible that cash - strapped advertisers will have exactly the same kind of " moment of clarity " that shopaholic consumers are reportedly having now that they 've seen entire store inventories marked down 50 percent or more in pre-Christmas sales — that is , they may say to themselves , " We knew all along that this stuff was made in China for a tiny fraction of what it sells for here ; we were nuts to pay so much in markup for it . "
Note that no one should interpret the above as some sort of prediction on my part that display ads will be permanently and drastically repriced downwards because advertisers are deciding that the standard IAB units really are n't worth anything close to what they 've been paying for them .
But I do throw this out there as being somewhere on the spectrum of possible outcomes , and I 'm not alone in entertaining this possibility at least as a hypothetical .
In conclusion , the online advertising experiment in which so many of us have engaged is really only ten years or so old .
Those who say that it's " mature " are not only mistaken , but they drastically underestimate what a true break the web is from the offline media that came before .
We 've had a few hundred years to learn to monetize print , over 75 years to monetize TV , and , most importantly , millennia to build business models based on scarcity .
In contrast , our collective effort to monetize post - scarcity digital media have only just begun .

Obama trounces McCain by thirteen points in NY Times poll RAW STORY
Published : Sunday November 2 , 2008
Print This Email This Sen. Barack Obama ( D - IL ) is trouncing Sen. John McCain in the latest CBS / NY Times poll -- by a margin of 13 percent .
This is three percent more than the Gallup poll released Saturday , in which Obama took the largest Gallup lead ever over McCain .
" With two days left until the presidential election , Barack Obama continues to lead John McCain by 13 points among likely voters , 54 percent to 41 percent , " CBS writes .
" The margin in the new poll , released Sunday , is identical to that in a CBS News poll released Saturday . "
The number of undecideds are dwindling , the poll found .
" More than nine in 10 of each candidateâs voters now say they have made up their minds about who to vote for and are not likely to change , " CBS reports .
" Just seven percent of Obama voters and 8 percent of McCain voters say they still might change their minds , and only 8 percent of likely voters are uncommitted . "
Todayâs uncommitted voters are mostly white , and more than half are age 45 or older .
Just over half are men , and most live in the Midwest and South .
Half describe themselves as moderate , and many are not partisan - four in 10 are independents .
CBS ' poll was conducted among a random sample of 908 adults nationwide , including 804 registered voters , interviewed by telephone Oct. 30 - Nov. 1 , 2008 .
Israel ’s ‘ Fait Accompli ’ in Gaza
by Eric Margolis by Eric Margolis
There are two completely different versions of what is currently happening in Gaza .
In the Israeli and North American press version , Hamas — " Islamic terrorists " backed by Iran — have in an unprovoked attack fired deadly rockets on innocent Israel with the intent of destroying the Jewish state .
North American politicians and the media say Israel “ has the right to defend itself . "
True enough .
No Israeli government can tolerate rockets hitting its towns , even though the casualty totals have been less than the car crash fatalities registered during a single holiday weekend on Israel ’s roads .
The firing of the feeble , homemade al - Qassam rockets by Palestinians is both useless and counterproductive .
It damages their image as an oppressed people and gives right - wing Israeli extremists a perfect reason to launch more attacks on the Arabs and refuse to discuss peace .
Israel ’s supporters insist it has the absolute right to drop hundreds of tons of bombs on " Hamas targets " inside the 360 sq km Gaza Strip to " take out the terrorists . "
Civilians suffer , says Israel , because the cowardly Hamas hide among them .
Actually , it is more like shooting fish in a barrel .
Omitting facts
As usual , this cartoon - like version of events omits a great deal of nuance and background .
While firing rockets at civilians is a crime so , too , is the Israeli blockade of Gaza , which is an egregious violation of international law and the Geneva Conventions .
According to the UN , most of Gaza ’s 1.5 million Palestinian refugees subsist near the edge of hunger .
Seventy per cent of Palestinian children in Gaza suffer from severe malnutrition and psychological trauma .
Medical facilities are critically short of doctors , personnel , equipment , and drugs .
Gaza has quite literally become a human garbage dump for all the Arabs that Israel does not want .
Gaza is one of the world ’s most - densely populated places , a vast outdoor prison camp filled with desperate people .
In the past , they threw stones at their Israeli occupiers ; now they launch homemade rockets .
Call it a prison riot , writ large .
Eyeing the elections
When the so - called truce between Tel Aviv and Hamas expired on December 19 , Israeli politicians were in the throes of preparing for the February 10 national elections .
Israeli politics are playing a key role in this crisis .
Ehud Barak , the defense minister and leader of the Labour party , and Tzipi Livni , the foreign minister and leader of the Kadima party , are trying to prove themselves tougher than Benjamin Netanyahu ’s hard - line Likud party — and one another .
Israel ’s elections are only six weeks away , and Likud was leading until the air raids on Gaza began .
Kadima and Labour are now up in the polls .
The heavy attacks on Gaza are also designed to intimidate Israel ’s Arab neighbors , and make up for Israel ’s humiliating 2006 defeat in Lebanon , which still haunts the country ’s politicians and generals .
A fait accompli
When the air raids on Gaza began , Barak said : “ We have totally changed the rules of the game . ”
He was right .
By blitzing Hamas - run Gaza , Barak presented the incoming US administration with a fait accompli , and neatly checkmated the newest player in the Middle East Great Game — Barack Obama , the US president - elect — before he could even take a seat at the table .
The Israeli offensive into Gaza now looks likely to short - circuit any plans Obama might have had to press Israel into withdrawing to its pre-1967 borders and sharing Jerusalem .
This has pleased Israel ’s supporters in North America who have been cheering the war in Gaza and have been backing away from their earlier tentative support for a land - for - peace deal .
Israel ’s successes in having Western media portray the Gaza offensive as an " anti- terrorist operation " will also diminish hopes of peace talks any time soon .
Obama inherits this mess in a few weeks .
During the elections , Obama bowed to the Israel lobby , offering a new US carte blanche to Israel and even accepting Israel ’s permanent monopoly of all of Jerusalem .
As he concludes forming his cabinet , his Middle East team looks like it may be top - heavy with friends of Israel ’s Labour party .
Obama keeps saying he must remain silent on policy issues until George Bush , the outgoing US president , leaves office , but his staff appear happy to avoid having to make statements about Gaza that would antagonize Israel ’s American supporters .
Obama will take office facing a Middle East up in arms over Gaza and the entire Muslim world blaming the US for the carnage in Gaza .
Unless he moves swiftly to distance himself from the policies of the Bush administration , he will soon find himself facing the same problems and anger as the Bush White House .
Arab deal killed
Israel ’s Gaza offensive is also likely to torpedo the current Saudi - sponsored peace plan , which had been backed by all members of the Arab League .
The plan , now likely defunct , had called for Israel to withdraw to its 1967 borders and share Jerusalem in exchange for full recognition and normalized relations with the Muslim world .
Arab governments will now be unable to sell the deal as they face a storm of criticism from their own people over their powerlessness to help the Palestinians of Gaza .
Egypt , in particular , is being widely accused of collaborating with Israel in further sealing off and isolating Gaza .
It seems highly unlikely they will be able to advance a peace plan with Israel for now .
This is a bonus for right - wing Israelis , who have always been dead set against any withdrawal and strongly supported the attack on Gaza .
Other Israeli factions who were always lukewarm about the Saudi peace plan are now unlikely to reconsider it .
Israel ’s security establishment is committed to preventing the creation of a viable Palestinian state , and refuses to negotiate with Hamas .
Unable to kill all of Hamas ’ men , Israel is slowly destroying Gaza ’s infrastructure around them , as it did to Yasser Arafat ’s PLO .
Israel ’s hardliners point to Gaza and claim that any Palestinian state on the West Bank would threaten their nation ’s security by firing rockets into Israel ’s heartland .
Mighty information machine
Israel is confident that its mighty information machine will allow it to weather the storm of worldwide outrage over its Biblical punishment of Gaza .
Who remembers Israel ’s flattening of parts of the Palestinian city of Jenin , or the US destruction in Falluja , Iraq , or the Sabra and Shatilla massacres in Beirut ?
The US media has focused on the rockets being fired on Israel from Gaza .
Though the torment of Gaza is seen across the horrified Muslim world as a modern version of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising by Jews against the Nazis during World War Two , Western governments still appear bent on taking no action .
Though Israel ’s use of American weapons against Gaza violates the US Arms Export Control and Foreign Assistance Acts , the docile US Congress will remain mute .
Israel ’s assault on Gaza was clearly timed for America ’s interregnum between administrations and the year - end holidays , a well - used Israeli tactic .
Hamas refuses to recognize Israel as long as Israel refuses to recognize Hamas and the rights of millions of homeless Palestinian refugees .
It calls for a non-religious state to be created in Palestine , meaning an end to Zionism .
Ironically , Sheikh Ahmed Yassin , the founder and late leader of Hamas , had spoken of a compromise with Tel Aviv shortly before he was assassinated by Israel in 2004 .
An inherited mess
Israel ’s hopes that it can bomb Gazans into rejecting Hamas are as ill - conceived as its failed attempt in 2006 to blast Lebanon into rejecting Hezbollah .
The Fatah regime on the West Bank installed by the US and Israel after Yasser Arafat ’s suspicious death will be further discredited , leaving the militants of Hamas as the sole authentic voice of Palestinian nationalism .
Hamas , the militant but still democratically elected government of Gaza , is even less likely to compromise .
The Muslim world is in a rage .
But so what ?
Stalin liked to say “ the dogs bark , and the caravan moves on , ” and as long as the US gives Israel carte blanche , it can do just about anything it wants .
The tragedy of Palestine will thus continue to poison US relations with the Muslim world .
Those Americans who still do not understand why their nation was attacked on 9/11 need only look to Gaza , for which the US is now being blamed as much as Israel .
Unless Israel can make 5 to 7 million Palestinians disappear , it must find some way to coexist with them .
Israeli leaders on the center and right continue to avoid facing this fact .
The brutal collective punishment inflicted on Gaza will likely strengthen Hamas and reverse any hopes of a Middle East peace in the coming years .

CFL ’s dead in 2 years ?
Long live LED bulbs !
January 29 , 2009 at 10:03 pm
It looks like the battle between compact fluorescent and LED bulbs is going in favor of the challenger and that the CFL ’s will be at the end of their usefulness in about 2 years .
Both on Cleantechnica ( http://cleantechnica.com/2009/01/29/new-3-led-bulb-lasts-60-years/) and Ecofriend ( http://www.ecofriend.org/entry/eco-gadgets-newly-developed-led-bulbs-take-efficiency-to-a-whole-new-level/) there is a story about a greatly more efficient LED bulb being developed athe University of Cambridge .
The origianl story is here on the Daily Mail site ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1131183/Scientists-invent-2-bulb-60-years–theyre-greener-eco-bulbs.html?ITO=1490).
Excerpt : “ Even better , the bulbs fully illuminate instantly , unlike the current generation of eco-bulbs .
It is reckoned the bulbs , which were funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council , could slash household lighting bills by three - quarters .
If installed in every home and office , they could cut the proportion of electricity used for lights from 20 per cent to 5 per cent a year .
As well as lasting 100,000 hours , ten times as long as today ’s eco-bulbs , the LED bulbs do not contain mercury , so disposal is less damaging to the environment , and they do not flicker – a problem that has been blamed for migraines and epileptic fits . ”
Sounds wonderful and I hope that they get to market sooner than the 2 years they mention in the article !
Until then and while we change over to the new wonderful LED bulbs you will need to recycle your old CFL ’s right ?
Well here comes word via Ecogeek about a new recycling program ( http://www.ecogeek.org/content/view/2519/).
I imagine that my local Whole Foods will be partipating soon .
As always I thank you for your time and interest .

MacRumors has discovered that Apple 's iPhone 2.x Firmware has evidence of the next generation iPhone which has been designated " iPhone2, 1 " .
Apple uses these models numbers to distinguish between different hardware models .
The original iPhone carries the model number of " iPhone 1,1 " while the 3G iPhone is labeled " iPhone 1,2 " .
These numbers do not change for simple storage increases and instead represent functionally different devices .
Similarly , the iPod Touch was originally introduced as the " iPod 1,1 " and the most recent hardware revision was labeled " iPod2,1 " .
The 2,1 iPod Touch added a speaker , volume controls , microphone support and a much faster processor than the 1st generation model .
This new model number can be found in the USBDeviceConfiguration .
plist in an unencrypted firmware .
Meanwhile , at least one developer has noticed actual " iPhone 2, 1 " models in use based on PinchMedia ad serving reports .
( Other numbers blurred out ) .
Rumors of the next generation iPhone point to the support of Multi-Core CPUs and possibly Multi-Core GPUs from Imagination Technologies .
Apple has been building a team of chip engineers over the past year to participate in their own ARM processor designs that will presumably be used in future iPhones .
Schiller previously outlined Apple 's natural product timelines and acknowledged that June is the usual timeframe for major iPhone revisions , although storage increases could happen at any time .
Nice !

Psychologists Reject the Dark Side
Psychologists Reject the Dark Side : American Psychological Association Members Reject Participation in Bush Detention Centers
By Stephen Soldz & Brad Olson
The movement against U.S. torture experienced a significant victory last week .
The members of the American Psychological Association [ APA ] rejected the policies of their leadership , policies that abetted the Bush administration 's program of torture and detainee abuse .
By a vote of 59 % , the members passed a referendum stating that APA members may not work in U.S. detention centers that are outside of or in violation of international law or the U.S. Constitution " unless they are working directly for the persons being detained or for an independent third party working to protect human rights . "
Passage of this referendum is a significant milestone in a years long effort by activist psychologists to change policies that encouraged participation in detainee interrogations because psychologists , the APA leadership claimed , helped keep those interrogations " safe , legal , and ethical . "
Since 2004 , news reports and government documents have provided evidence of the central role of psychologists in designing , implementing , and disseminating the administrations ' program of abusive interrogations , whether conducted by the CIA in its secret " black sites " or by the Defense Department at Guantánamo , and in Iraq and Afghanistan .
As Vanity Fair reporter Katherine Eban described the CIA side of this equation :
" I… discovered that psychologists were n't merely complicit in America 's aggressive new interrogation regime .
Psychologists , working in secrecy , had actually designed the tactics and trained interrogators in them while on contract to the C.I.A . "
On the Defense Department side , the Senate Armed Services Committee reported in June 2008 on the role of military psychologists in helping design the harsh interrogation techniques used at Guantánamo .
As Senator Levin described in his opening remarks :
" a… senior CIA lawyer , Jonathan Fredman , who was chief counsel to the CIA ’s CounterTerrorism Center , went to GTMO , attended a meeting of GTMO staff and discussed a memo proposing the use of aggressive interrogation techniques .
That memo had been drafted by a psychologist and psychiatrist from GTMO who , a couple of weeks earlier , had attended the training given at Fort Bragg by instructors from the JPRA SERE school .
While the memo remains classified , minutes from the meeting where it was discussed are not .
Those minutes ( TAB 7 ) clearly show that the focus of the discussion was aggressive techniques for use against detainees . "
The minutes from that meeting show this psychologist and psychiatrist recommending creating an atmosphere of " controlled chaos , " which would " foster dependence and compliance , " through the creation of " psychological stress " by means of using such techniques as " sleep deprivation , withholding food , isolation , loss of time . "
This strategy was implemented and became standard operating procedure .
For example , in September 2003 , young ( 16 or 17 year old ) Mohammed Jawad became upset during interrogation , talking to pictures on the wall and crying for his mother .
A military psychologist , a behavioral science consultant , was brought in for guidance .
She recommended Jawad be placed in a month of " linguistic isolation " while the interrogator ratcheted up the pressure to break him down .
This treatment apparently contributed to a suicide attempt by Jawad .
Evidence has accumulated of psychologists designing and contributing to detainee abuses sometimes amounting to torture .
Despite the overwhelming evidence , the APA has steadfastly insisted that psychologists should not participate in torture ; they argued , rather , that psychologists were vitally needed to help interrogators better obtain information while simultaneously , according to the APA , preventing detainee abuses .
The APA used a multitude of techniques to defend their policy .
They appointed a task force to formulate ethics policy around national security interrogations without informing the membership or the public that the majority of members were from the military - intelligence establishment .
The APA passed anti-torture resolutions while rejecting attempts to withdraw psychologists from sites that violated human rights or even from the interrogations at Guantanamo and the CIA 's black sites .
The APA also ignored Open Letters from hundreds of their members .
At times these efforts became ludicrous doublespeak .
An APA Board member , for instance , sent around an email claiming that the very Senate Armed Services hearing that implicated military psychologists in the design of torture techniques actually exonerated the psychologists and the discipline .
The association 's ethics director even claimed documents released by the ACLU showed the APA ’s “ policy of engagement ” was working to protect detainees when the document in question apparently merely reported that one psychologist in Iraq once stopped an interrogation prior to the detainee dying or , perhaps , suffering serious physical damage .
Through it all , the APA maintained its close ties to the military - intelligence establishment .
While the APA leadership resisted all challenges to its position , the members and other psychologists and their allies did not remain silent .
Dissident members worked tirelessly to change the organizations ' position .
Some worked within official association committees .
During 2006 - 2007 , members pushed a Moratorium resolution that would have temporarily halted participation in interrogations at the detention sites ; the measure was undercut by APA organizational manipulations , and a derivative effort was decisively defeated by the associations ' Council of Representatives in August 2006 .
A number of prominent psychologists – including a former ethics committee Chair , a former Executive Director of one of the associations ' major divisions , and a former division President – resigned in protest .
New York Times bestselling author Mary Pipher returned an award to the APA .
Hundreds stopped paying membership dues , aided by a policy that allowed dues withholders to remain members for two years .
Colleagues in other countries expressed their disapproval of APA policies .
Physicians for Human Rights documented U.S. psychological torture and many times called for changes in APA policies permitting participation in the settings where that torture occurred .
After years of failing to effect real change through the associations '
Council of Representatives – which infrequently challenges the APA leadership on issues of vital importance to those leaders – dissident members and allies turned in 2008 to new strategies designed simultaneously to take advantage of , and to bypass , the official structures .
Members of the withholdapadues group found a never before used provision in the association by - laws allowing for a member - initiated policy referendum .
Three psychologists – Dan Aalbers , Brad Olson , and Ruth Fallenbaum – got to work writing a referendum rejecting the participation of psychologists at detention centers operating outside of [ as in the Geneva Conventions do n't apply ] or in violation of [ as in enhanced interrogations are approved ] international law or the Constitution .
APA rules require that one percent of the active members ' signatures be obtained on a petition in order to get it submitted to the members for a vote .
It took only a matter of weeks to obtain more than the necessary numbers .
The campaign generated amazing grassroots activism .
People never before heard from were found emailing their successes in convincing other colleagues to vote .
Several brief videos were made by members and distributed on YouTube and Google Video .
Two APA divisions lined up in support .
Conversation about the referendum on psychologist - run listservs was greater than that on any other topic in memory .
The opposition raised concerns , especially among forensic psychologists ; they were concerned that the language could somehow be misunderstood to ban psychologists working in domestic prisons where abuses are prevalent .
This possibility was problematic for many referendum supporters .
Many of those actively supporting the referendum are deeply concerned about the horrific conditions in much of the U.S. criminal justice system .
Yet , it seemed impossible to tackle all issues at once , and the referendum was designed to focus only upon " national security " detainees , held in abusive conditions , with few or no rights .
Thus , the referendum sponsors issued a statement that clarified the applicability of the referendum .
Nevertheless , this statement failed to allay the concerns of some that the referendum could cost psychologists their jobs .
In an unprecedented development , illustrating the high stakes involved in the potential policy change , the Defense Department issued a press release with " talking points " opposing the referendum .
The first two of these talking points unintentionally emphasized the need for the referendum :
" Humane treatment and ensuring detainees are not subjected to cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment is required in accordance with U.S. law .
Behavioral science consultants do NOT support interrogations that are n’t in accordance with applicable law . "
U.S law , as interpreted by the present administration , redefines traditionally proscribed detention and interrogation procedures as " humane " and " legal . "
Therefore , referendum supporters pointed out , this requirement to follow " applicable law " does not protect military , or CIA , psychologists from participating in abuses that would be inhumane if judged by international standards .
The referendum ballots went out by mail on August 1st and were due back on September 15th .
Two days later , the results were announced .
The referendum won with 59 % of the vote .
Furthermore , the turnout , at nearly 15,000 members , was among the highest in any APA election .
The passage of the referendum constitutes a giant step toward creating a united front of health professions opposed to detainee abuse .
While the APA referendum policy differs from policy statements by other associations in significant details — its focus on settings as opposed to the interrogations themselves — it follows previous policy statements from the American Medical Association and the American Psychiatric Association opposing participation in interrogations .
This united front will increase the pressure on the administration to remove health professionals from their roles aiding these abusive detention policies .
It will also escalate the accumulating pressures for a radically different detention policy under the new U.S. presidential administration and Congress next January .
Referendum passage constitutes a giant step forward for those psychologists who have been fighting to change the APA 's policies on involvement in the detention centers .
But the struggle of dissident psychologists is far from over .
First , there is a disagreement with APA leadership as to when the policy change goes into effect ; the leadership claimed initially that the bylaws state that the change does n't go into effect till next August , while referendum supporters believe this claim is an egregious misreading of the bylaws .
Discussions continue regarding the details of referendum implementation .
Moreover , while the APA 's policy is in the process of changing , the organizational and policy conditions — the culture that allowed the APA to advocate for years in support of psychologist participation in detainee interrogations — have not changed .
Activists are focused upon several additional steps to bring about a rejuvenation of their association and their professions .
There is a strong campaign afoot to elect one of the activists as APA President to make sure the new policy is firmly implemented and backed by the organization , as well as to push other efforts making human rights and social justice more central within the profession of psychology .
Steven Reisner , a New York psychologist is running an active campaign .
In the first nomination phase of the campaign , he received the highest number of votes among the five winning candidates .
Passage of the referendum should provide an even stronger boost to his campaign .
Ballots go out to the APA membership this October and are due back November 15 .
APA members have been deeply disturbed by another prior action of the Association .
In 2002 , its ethics committee placed a clause in the ethics code , allowing laws , regulations , and government orders to override professional ethics .
These members are concerned that the clause provides an offensive loophole that is a variation on the Nuremberg defense – " I was just following orders " – into the ethics code .
The APA Council of Representatives called on the ethics committee to address this problem in 2005 .
Despite these instructions , the association has resisted clarifying this clause by adding a phrase as simple as " except when violating fundamental human rights " .
Other disturbing 2002 modifications to the APA ethics code weakened protections for research participants , such as removing a requirement for informed consent from participants " where otherwise permitted by law or federal or institutional regulations . "
Such a clause could , for example , allow experimentation on detainees without their permission , a disturbing violation of professional guidelines and international agreements .
Activist psychologists and their allies also are pushing for accountability for past abuses by psychologists .
While some psychologists , including APA members , have been documented to have participated in abuses likely constituting torture , the APA ethics committee has consistently stalled action against or refused to open cases against these psychologists .
This needs to stop .
Another form of accountability is a ‘ setting right ’ of the historical record .
Given the known facts regarding psychologists and their roles in detainee abuse , and given the extensive denial of these facta and their significance by APA leadership , it is critical to create a detailed public record of the contributions of psychologists to the dark side over the last seven years .
It is imperative that a Psychologist Truth Commission be created that will examine all materials , existing in the public record or available through investigation , and construct such a permanent record .
Also necessary is a careful examination of the many other organizational , ethical , and policy issues that allowed the psychological profession and its major professional organization to become complicit in detainee abuse over the last seven years .
Clinical psychologists often encourage their clients to face harsh truths .
It is similarly necessary for our profession to face these somewhat cold and difficult realities .
Only this will prevent us from recreating this sad episode in our profession 's history when the next national or international crisis hits .
The implications of passage of the referendum extend beyond the APA and psychology .
The referendum will put additional pressure on the DoD to remove psychologists from their roles aiding interrogations and behavior management .
It will also create additional pressure for the development of a mental health system for detainees that is completely isolated from chain of command pressures .
While the DoD is not necessarily bound by APA policy , it generally follows professional ethics policies ; to do otherwise could make its efforts to recruit and retain psychologists and other professionals substantially more difficult .
The implications for the CIA 's " enhanced interrogation " program are less certain , given the secrecy under which that program is conducted .
Yet , even there , the APA referendum will increase pressure for a new administration and Congress to shut down the program . "
Finally , passage of the referendum is being heralded by the wider public as a sign of an impending rejection by U.S. citizens of the " dark side " which has taken over so much of our government and country in recent years .
This feeling was expressed by the conservative commentator , anti-torture activist , and blogger Andrew Sullivan who headlined his posting on the referendum 's passage with " Know Hope . "
Congratulatory emails from around the world have indicated that many find hope in our psychologist colleagues ' rejection of the dark side .
" Finally , good news from the U.S. " one email said .
These correspondents join us in hoping that this rejection of official torture and abuse will be followed by a wholesale rejection from the American public and government .

RANCHO BERNARDO , Calif. , Dec. 2 ( UPI ) --
A Southern California calculus teacher says he 's selling ad space on his test papers to make up for a cut in his supply budget .
Tom Farber , a teacher at a Rancho Bernardo high school , said the district cut his annual copying budget to $ 316 when he needs more than $ 500 to print enough tests to ensure students receive adequate practice for tough tests they 'll take in the future , such as the Advanced Placement Exam , USA Today reported Tuesday .

Farber , 47 , said " tough times call for tough actions " so he started selling ad space on his test papers at $ 10 for a quiz , $ 20 for a chapter test and $ 30 for a semester final .
So far , he has collected $ 350 , with two - thirds of the ads being inspirational messages from parents and the remaining ads coming from local businesses such as a dentist whose ad says " Brace Yourself for a Great Semester ! "
Reaction to the ads has been mixed , though it 's not like Farber is selling ads that say , " This test is brought to you by McDonald 's or Nike , " said Principal Paul Robinson .
We all know , or ought to know , the truth about the State ’s origins .
To a one , they are built on a foundation of violence , and they maintain their statehood through the systematic implementation of violence and oppression .
In Some economics of invasion and the State , constant ‘s most interesting idea is that since overthrowing a State appears to be a public good , then according to conventional wisdom , it will be undersupplied .
In short order , he proceeds to lay out a pretty elementary case for the common defense as public good .
This case , however , is always argued upon a single iteration of the game .
Surely , upon learning that one ’s neighbor had been violently deposed by an invading bandit , the remaining freemen should begin to see the true costs of their failure to voluntarily provide for a common defense .
Historically speaking , this might ’ve been difficult in practice , but I ’m not convinced that this is any longer the case .
One very private good is the ability to hide one ’s assets , or perhaps more importantly , the ability to hide one ’s production from the State .
If the wealth you create was never part of the white market in the first place , it becomes almost impossible to track or quantify .
The State can only steal what it can see , what it knows to exist .
The concept behind the Agorist movement , is to take Constant ’s second course : free yourself , as much as is humanly possible , from the State ’s constraints .
Work with others who share these goals and ideals , to assist them in freeing themselves .
It certainly has a Galt- ian appeal to it : by working together and outside the system with people you trust , to better yourselves , the oppressive state should collapse under its own weight .
New York ’s Gov. David Paterson is in a political pickle and no one would fault the man if he were popping Ambiens to get a decent night ’s sleep .
Paterson , who replaced hooker - obsessed Eliot Spitzer last year when the latter resigned , will be running for governor in his own right in 2010 and surely does n’t need the distraction of appointing Clinton ’s successor .
The rather unseemly “ campaign ” for Paterson ’s nod by about a dozen New Yorkers , with Caroline Kennedy receiving the most attention ( pro and con ) , could be ended immediately if the Governor let common sense be his guide .
As a citizen — born and raised on Long Island — who rarely supports Democrats , I ’m fairly objective about Paterson ’s conundrum , and my unsolicited advice is this : tap former Gov. Mario Cuomo as a placeholder in the Senate and let all the people currently sucking up to Paterson duke it out in the special election that ’ll be held in 2010 .
Such a decision would receive nearly unanimous acclaim , not only from the media and the Democratic party , but conscientious New Yorkers as well , who instinctively dislike the idea of someone receiving the gift of a U.S. Senate seat without facing the rigors of an election .
Cuomo , now 76 , is an elder statesman of the Democratic Party , revered for his keynote speech at the 1984 convention , an impassioned burst of liberal rhetoric that overshadowed Walter Mondale , the sacrificial lamb who lost in a landslide to Ronald Reagan .
Yes , he annoyed party officials with his legendary “ Hamlet on the Hudson ” routine , teasing the faithful with his hints of running for president in ’ 88 and ’ 92 , but Cuomo , the three - time New York governor has made few public enemies , and in a body that includes geriatrics such as Robert Byrd and Frank Lautenberg he ’d fit in just fine .
In fact , Cuomo would likely make the most of this career - capping honor , supporting Obama on the Senate floor with his magnificent oratory , providing more firepower and credibility for the new president than any of the people — including his son Andrew , New York ’s ambitious Attorney General — who Paterson is considering .
The elder Cuomo has given no indications that he ’s interested in filling Clinton ’s spot , but it ’s fairly inconceivable that he ’d reject such a request from Paterson , especially since his tenure would be less than two years .
Some may argue that this scenario presents a conflict of interest , since Cuomo obviously will support his son in 2010 , but compared to the Kennedy machine that ’s small potatoes .
Caroline Kennedy — and by the way , when did she drop the surname of her longtime husband Edwin Schlossberg ? —has arrogantly said that she wo n’t run in the special election if not appointed by Paterson , which ought to tip off Democrats that she believes the seat , held by her uncle Bobby Kennedy for four years in the 60s , is , by accident of birth , hers for the taking .
In contrast , Andrew Cuomo ( divorced from one of RFK ’s daughters in 2003 ) has no fear of facing voters and an election pitting him against Republican Rep.
Pete King would be a dandy .
Kennedy has disappointed supporters by giving interviews that reveal her extemporaneous speaking skills are on a par with those of President Bush ( or her uncle Teddy Kennedy ) , and has also refused to give any details about her finances , which is another minus on her ledger of qualifications for the Senate .
If indeed Kennedy , now 51 , is intent on entering the family business , her debut has been underwhelming .
It ’s all rather mystifying , for if Kennedy , who by all accounts is a bright woman , did compete in the 2010 election and was victorious , it ’s conceivable that should Obama serve two terms she’d be a leading contender for the 2016 Democratic nomination , and possibly become this country ’s first female president .
Ben McGrath , the excellent New Yorker staff writer , wrote about Kennedy ’s flailing candidacy ( focusing on her abundance of “ you knows ” in interviews ) in the weekly ’s Jan. 12 issue and one passage caught my attention : “ On the one hand , [ Kennedy ’s ] lack of polish , or media training , suggests an Everywoman appeal — the mother of three with no Washington experience , like a Sarah Palin [ zing ! ] for Democrats — while at the same time undermining the Kennedy mystique and serving as a reminder of the Bush lesson that dynasties can devolve ( and not just into mangled English ) . ”
A couple of points .
Caroline Kennedy as an “ everywoman , ” given her vast wealth , access to power and political pedigree , does n’t add up .
Say what you will about Palin ( and frankly , I wish she ’d dry up and retreat into Alaskan obscurity ) but you ca n’t brand her as a scion of a political dynasty .
As for the “ Kennedy mystique ” that McGrath mentions , perhaps I ’m in a minority , but that aura eludes me .
Yes , as a young teenager in 1968 , despite supporting Gene McCarthy , I admired many aspects of Bobby Kennedy ’s short and tragic campaign for the presidency , but in the succeeding decades as the sordid details of the Kennedy clan appeared nearly every year , and not just in tabloids , it was apparent that this was a fairly grubby “ dynasty . ”
The New York Times has been restrained about the Caroline Kennedy candidacy in its editorial pages ( although I ’m betting that publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. is in her corner , it ought to be remembered that his predecessors , in 1964 , endorsed incumbent Republican Kenneth Keating over RFK in that Senate election ) , praising her early support for Obama , as well as her “ charm ” and “ quiet but distinguished role in politics , ” but also questioning whether her lack of legislative skills would hinder her ability to bring federal dollars to New York .
Elsewhere in the Times , Nicholas Confessore and Jeremy W. Peters ( Dec. 31 ) , in a “ news ” article , came up with this whopper : “ But Ms. Kennedy ’s own political style seems to have more in common with that of Daniel Patrick Moynihan , who once held Mrs. Clinton ’s seat : cerebral , restrained , dry . ”
How absurd : Moynihan , who unquestionably lapped Kennedy in eloquence , was indeed “ cerebral ” but hardly restrained , as Bill Clinton found out when he expediently passed a welfare reform act in advance of his ’ 96 reelection .
And op - ed columnist Maureen Dowd , for better or worse , gave her own endorsement to Kennedy on Jan. 7 , saying , “ Congress , which abdicated its oversight role as the Bush crew wrecked the globe and the economy , desperately needs fresh faces and new perspectives , an infusion of class , intelligence and guts . ”
Dowd ’s hyperbole notwithstanding — although the continuing economic crisis occurred on Bush ’s watch , it ’s not as if Bill Clinton and his Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin , as well as Alan Greenspan , are without blame — I wonder again that if Caroline Kennedy has such “ guts , ” why wo n’t she demonstrate that by running for Senate in 2010 ?
This is why David Paterson ought to end the short but intense campaign for Clinton ’s seat and appoint a respected and non-controversial figure to represent New Yorkers for the next two years .
No one is better qualified for this position than Mario Cuomo .

Millions may have lauded Barack Obama 's Inaugural speech but what remained unheard was what was said by a First daughter to her father , and between the new President and his predecessor after the swearing - in ceremony .
According to a lip reader , the first African - American president of the United States , just after the ceremony , asked George W Bush : " You OK ? "
As to what was Bush 's reply , according to The Sun , the lip reader said : " So relieved . "
The 43rd president had later informally handed over his former White House residence to Obama saying : " It 's all yours now - good luck . "
And while thousands cheered the hope brought about by their new leader , seven - year - old first daughter Sasha was said to have told her president - dad : " That was a good speech , perfect . "
But as the recession continues , many officials of the college of emergency doctors predict it is only a matter of time until the rising number of uninsured and the delays in getting primary care create a crisis .
“ I think we ’re seeing the tip , ” said Dr. Nicholas J. Jouriles , the group ’s current president .
Patients , he said , will have no choice but to come to the emergency department when they have no money or insurance .
“ They will get turned away elsewhere , ” he said .
One of the doctors ’ major concerns is the long waits by patients requiring a hospital bed .
The doctors group , surveying its members last year , learned of at least 200 deaths related to the practice of “ boarding ”  in which patients on stretchers line the corridors until they can be moved into a bed .
“ Crowding is a national public health problem , ” said Dr. Jesse M. Pines , an emergency physician in Philadelphia .
Patients forced to wait for hours on end for a bed clearly suffer .
“ It was pure hell , ” recalled Robert Roth , whose 90 - year - old mother , Kato , last year spent 36 hours at the emergency department of a Queens hospital , near her home in Jackson Heights , waiting for a room after going to the emergency room in the middle of the night .
Mrs. Roth , who had a recent series of falls , said she had been hearing music in her ears , and both her son and the doctor he called were worried about a possible stroke .
After the first five hours of waiting , she became increasingly disoriented and delusional .
Mr. Roth was unable to stay with her during the entire wait .
After he left and returned , he said , the hospital staff told him they had no idea where she was .
She turned up in an empty room off the emergency department , and her physical and mental condition had clearly deteriorated , Mr. Roth said .
She believed that she had been kidnapped .
When she had to go several weeks later to another emergency department in Manhattan , she endured a 20 - hour wait for a room , again becoming disoriented after several hours , forcing her to be sedated .
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW - ESTABLISHMENT
CLAUSE - ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS
AN INMATE'S EXPANDED VISITATION PRIVILEGES MAY NOT BE CONDITIONED UPON HIS MANDATORY PARTICIPATION IN A SUBSTANCE ABUSE REHABILITATION PROGRAM THAT IS BASED ON THE RELIGIOUS - ORIENTED PRACTICES OF ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS .
SUMMARY
Petitioner then brought a N.Y. Civ. Prac. L. & R. 78 ( McKinney 1995 ) proceeding to annul the prison officials ' determination and to remove participation in the ASAT program as the contingency for his participation in the Family Reunion Program .
The Supreme Court dismissed Petitioner 's complaint without holding a hearing to develop a factual record .
In affirming the Supreme Court 's decision , the Appellate Division noted that the A.A. portions of the ASAT Program do not " demand " any particular religious belief , but only require a level of " spirituality " and " open-mindedness . "
Griffin v. Coughlin , 211 A.D.2d 187 , 190 ( N.Y. App. Div. 1995 ) .
Thus , the Appellate Division determined that the Establishment Clause was not violated where the ASAT Program lacked an actual sectarian practice .

COMMENTARY
State of the Law Before Griffin v. Coughlin
Under the Lemon test , the Court first evaluates the secular purpose of the statute to determine whether the statute violates the neutrality principles of the Establishment Clause .
Second , the Court determines whether the primary effect of the statute is to advance or promote religion .
A statute promotes religion if it conveys a symbol of endorsement .
Grand Rapids Sch. Dist. v. Ball , 473 U.S. 373 , 389 ( 1984 ) .
The test is whether there is " a symbolic union of church and state . . . likely to be perceived by adherents of the controlling denominations as an endorsement , and by non-adherents as a disapproval , of their individual religious choices .
. . . "
Id. at 390 .
The Court uses context to determine " whether particular governmental action is likely to be perceived as an endorsement of religion . . . . "
Id .
For example , governmental actions that favor , prefer , or promote religion have been found to be endorsements of religion .
Id .
Finally , the court will determine whether the statute " fosters an excessive government entanglement with religion . "
Lemon at 613 .
Effect of Griffin v. Coughlinon Current Law
In defense of the ASAT Program , the correctional department argued that references to God actually mean some higher power as the individual may understand such a higher power and not as the concept would be known by any particular organized religion .
Thus , individuals would be free to consider God as some abstract higher power within themselves rather than as a being whom individuals are required to believe in , give thanks to , worship , or praise .
Indeed , ASAT 's Twelve Steps repeatedly state , " God as we [ the participants ] understand Him . "
1996 N.Y. Int. 137 at para .
8 .
Although the Court recognizes that the ASAT Program does not appear to have any intent to impose a particular set of religious beliefs or a particular concept of God upon participants , the Court rejects this lack of intent as enough to satisfy the Establishment Clause .
Terms such as " God " and " prayer " are so imbued with religious meaning that they undeniably favor a religious interpretation regardless of the fact that the ASAT Program allows for a secular interpretation of its doctrines and practices .
The Court failed to find the ASAT Program unconstitutional on the basis of its doctrines and practices .
Instead , the Court holds that the conditioning of special privileges upon participation in such a program is unconstitutional .
Consequently , the Court advances two approaches State correctional authorities could adopt .
First , the State could continue the current ASAT Program if it is conducted on a voluntary basis .
Second , the State could condition special privileges on mandatory participation in the ASAT Program provided it offered a secular alternative to the religious components .
In either situation , the State would maintain the neutrality required by the Establishment Clause .
Dissent
Applying the tripartite Constitutional test for Establishment Clause violations set forth in Lemon v. Kurtzman , 403 U.S. 602 , 612 ( 1971 ) , the dissent discusses several reasons why the ASAT program does not breach Constitutional boundaries .
First , the dissent emphasizes that the principle or primary effect of the A.A. program neither advances nor inhibits religion .
The dissent emphatically declares that the limited religious content of the A.A. literature should not be considered a violation of the Establishment Clause .
" Focusing exclusively on the religious component of any activity would inevitably lead to its invalidation under the Establishment Clause . "
Lynch v. Donnelly , 465 U.S. 668 , 680 ( 1984 ) .
The dissent concludes that the perceived religious aspects of the A.A. Twelve Step program that were transmuted into ASAT are " indirect , remote and incidental . "
1996 N.Y. Int. 137 dissent at para .
8 .
Second , in direct contrast to the majority , the dissent determines that there are no compulsory religious commandments or tenants embodied in the A.A. literature .
Furthermore , the dissent notes that the literature used by A.A. " [s] ubstantially , if not overwhelmingly , suggest [s ] secular and spiritual guideposts " which A.A. members may follow .
Id .. dissent at para .
7 .
Unlike the majority , the Dissent does not give literal meaning to the deistic language contained in the Twelve Steps .
For example , in analyzing Step Three of the Twelve Steps , the dissent found language like " explore the concepts and barriers in accepting a power beyond self , " " exploration of self - centeredness , " " barriers to faith , " and " prayer and meditation " to be nothing more than " suggested discussion topics " .
Id. dissent at para .
30 .
The Dissent does not find references made to " contact with God " and " prayer and meditation " indicative of religious proselytizing .
Instead , the dissent , determines that Step Eleven is mainly about the " goals " of " assisting in understanding the relationship between disease and its effects on the next generation " and " viewing parenting in terms of recovery behavior , " finds those religious references to be meaningless .
Id. dissent at para .
31 .
The Dissent similarly reasons that Step Twelve 's reference to " spiritual awakening " has " no formalized religious significance or content . "
Quoting Step
Twelve , the dissent concludes that the goal of Step Twelve is the " personal exploration of the feelings related to leaving treatment ( and prison ) . "
Id. dissent at para .
31 .
Third , the dissent strongly disagrees with the majority over the coercive aspect of the ASAT program and does not believe that coercion alone " could transform the incidents of religion found in the ASAT program into an Establishment Clause violation . "
Granting the petitioner relief , they argued , would be tantamount to allowing Petitioner to tailor the ASAT curriculum to his particular non-religious preferences .
The dissent believes Petitioner was ineligible for relief because he voluntarily chose to participate in the ASAT program .
Id. dissent at para .
41 . They further argue that the prison officials ' wide discretion as to who would be permitted to participate in the program militated against granting relief because inmates had no guarantee that they would be afforded visits .
Id. dissent at para .
42 .
Finally , the dissent rejects the idea that the ASAT program is similar to those school programs requiring students to pray .
Id. dissent at para .
47 .
The dissent notes that the petitioner was not required , urged or asked by ASAT program officials to pray .
Id. dissent at para .
47 .
The dissent believes the facts in petitioner 's case were more analogous to Zorach v. Clauson , 1996 N.Y. Int. 137 dissent at para .
48 ( citing 343 U.S. 306 ( 1965 ) ( upholding New York 's released time program allowing students to attend religious instruction ) ) .
The dissent believes that the Supreme Court drew a distinction between imposing religion on children and offering religion as a choice open to adults .
Id. dissent at para .
50 .
Unanswered Questions
A related and perhaps more important question is whether attendance at a voluntary program ( if it has analagous aspects and is the only program offered ) may be considered in parole decisions .
It would seem that in light of the courts decision such considerations would necessarily limit the rights of individuals who did not wish to be subjected to the religious training contained in the A.A. program .
Following the logic of this case , the Court would appear to have answered this question , ruling out the possibility of a voluntary program with no secular alternative .
However , the Court holds that this is a viable alternative for the State .
Therefore , this question remains open .
At various points in the decision the Court seems to state different standards to determine if a program is violative of the Establishment Clause .
For instance , early in the opinion , the Court holds that the Establishment Clause is violated where " the program necessarily entails mandatory attendance at and participation in a curriculum which adopts in major part the religious oriented practices and precepts of Alcoholics Anonymous .
. . . " 1996 N.Y. Int. 137 at para .
1 . Later , the Court states that it is the " mandatory and exclusive incorporation of A.A. doctrine and practices " which are offensive under the Establishment Clause .
Id. at para .
9 . While in paragraph fifteen the court indicates that it is the requirements of a number of the steps of the Twelve Step process which are violative of the petitioners rights .
Id. at para .
15 . Still later , the Court notes that it is the complete failure to offer an alternative program which is in error .
Id. at para .
22 .
Consequently , the question remains at what point do the practices of the A.A. program predominate creating an infringement under the Establishment Clause ?
Survey of the Law in Other Jurisdictions
In Youle v. Edgar , the Illinois court held that conditioning the reinstatement of the plaintiff 's driver 's license on participation in A.A. or an ongoing support program is constitutional .
526 N.E.2d 894 ( Ill. App. Ct. 1988 ) .
The court pointed out that the primary function of A.A. is to cope with alcoholism and that the plaintiff had the opportunity to attend an alternative program .
A number of federal courts have recently handed down decisions on situations very similar to Griffin's .
In Kerr v. Farrey , the State of Wisconsin required the plaintiff to participate in Narcotics Anonymous ( A.A. 's drug dependency counterpart ) as part of his incarceration .
No. 94-C-942 , 1996 WL 482133 ( 7th Cir. Aug. 27 , 1996 ) .
The Seventh Circuit found that the state had " impermissibly coerced inmates to participate in a religious program " and thus violated the Establishment Clause .
Id. at 1 . In Warner v. Orange County Dep't of Probation , the State of New York ordered the plaintiff to attend A.A. as a condition of his probation .
No. 1760 , 95-7055 , 1996 WL 507172 ( 2nd Cir. Sept. 9 , 1996 ) .
The Second Circuit found that there was " no doubt . . . that Warner was coerced into participating in these religious exercises by virtue of his probation sentence . "
Id. at 9 .
Both the Kerr and Warner courts noted that the Griffin court reached the same conclusion .
Several federal district courts have held that requiring participation in A.A. to be constitutional .
In O'Connor v. California , the court held that requiring O'Connor to attend A.A. or another self - help group as a condition of his probation was constitutional .
855 F. Supp. 303 ( C.D. Cal. 1994 ) .
However , the court noted that " [ s ] ignificant to [ its ] decision is that the individual has a choice over what program to attend . "
Id. at 308 .
O'Connor could have attended alternative programs , without religious overtones .
Boyd , cited by the Griffindissent , upheld the same requirement of attendance of Alcoholics Anonymous that was at issue in Griffin .
Boyd , 914 F. Supp. 828 ( N.D.N.Y. 1996 ) .
However , the Second Circuit 's holding in Warner leaves Boyd with only questionable precedential value .
The court in Stafford v. Harrison , found that an inmate 's required participation in an A.A. - type program does not violate the Establishment Clause .
766 F. Supp. 1014 ( D.Kan. 1991 ) .
However , the Warner court criticized Stafford as misapplying constitutional law .
The limited amount of case law on this issue indicates that the requirement of mandatory attendance at A.A. meetings as a condition of a criminal sentence or as a prison requirement is likely to be found unconstitutional .
However , if A.A. is merely one option among several available , the courts are likely to find the program constitutional .

Do n't Forget To See The Big Stories Of The Year
This NFL season has been somewhat unpredictable .
Who would have thought the Tennessee Titans would be as good as they are and get yanked out of the playoffs by purple toting Baltimore Ravens ?
Who would think Tom Brady would suffer a season - ending injury , yet the Patriots with backup QB Matt Cassel remained in the playoff hunt ( Bledsoe ’d anyone ? ) ?
Then what about former Arizona Cardinals ’ grocery stock boy , Kurt Warner getting voted to the Pro-Bowl as the starter ?
Then there are the teams that have held true to their pre-season predictions .
What if these losing teams could get the running backs they had in Nintendo ’s 1991 smash hit : Tecmo Super Bowl ?
Would their season records turn out differently ?
I take the opportunity to play hours of Tecmo Super Bowl so I can figure out how these game changing RB ’s would affect the fate of their teams today .
A Brief History of Tecmo Super Bowl
If you ’ve never played Nintendo ’s Tecmo Super Bowl , then you missed out on what was the best football game of its time .
The simplicity of the play calling is what made it so great .
There were n’t pages of X’s and O’s that you had to swim through to figure out which play to call or what defensive package you wanted out on the field like Madden NFL .
Offensively , you had 4 running plays and 4 passing plays .
Defensively , you had a 1 out of 8 ( 12.5 % ) chance at guessing what offensive play your opponent would choose .
If you guessed correctly , you ’d be rewarded with an all - out defensive blitz that left your opponent with zero chance of getting the play off the ground .
Not only were the plays easy to choose , there were two buttons on the controller , ‘ a’ and ‘ b ’ .
You could figure out what button did what without ever reading the manual or learning complicated button combinations .
You could do a quick play against your friend or the computer or you could choose to play a season ’s worth of games and monitor how you ’re doing by looking at the cumulative stats .
Graphics were simplistic and it made the game play quick .
Who needs to see all the drawn out dramatic scenes in Madden NFL when someone makes a sack or touchdown ?
Half - time shows in Tecmo Super Bowl consisted of short clips of some hot 8 - bit digitized cheerleaders like the one below .
Who can beat that kind of original awesomeness ?
Team : The Detroit Lions ( 0 - 16 ) .
Why They Need Help : The Lions finished dead last in their NFC North division and , for that matter , all of the NFL .
The Lions also have the distinguished honor of becoming the first team in NFL history to finish with an 0 - 16 record .
The Lions took immediate action and fired coach Rod Marinelli as a result of the team ’s lackluster performance , but what if they had running back Barry Sanders ?
Would Rod Marinelli’s
Lions be just as horrible ?
The Savior : Barry Sanders
Career Profile :
In 1990 , Barry Sanders topped all other NFL RB ’s by pounding out 1,304 yards on the ground and adding another 480 yds with 36 receptions for a total of 16 touchdowns .
Though not big by NFL standards at 5 ’ 8 ″ , Sanders capitalized on his size by running low to the ground and making himself less of a target for would - be tacklers .
His ninja - like elusiveness and ability to reverse direction seemingly at will ( and often required to do so because would - be tacklers broke through the line ) , would leave defensive players grasping at air .
Sanders was n’t a great blocker and did n’t catch many passes out of the backfield , but no one could deny the fact that he was a running machine .
Tecmo Super Bowl Profile : Barry Sanders hits the hole hard and fast .
When controlling Barry , the slightest touch to the directional pad caused a defender to dive in the wrong direction and you ’d end up with big runs .
The only problem with Barry is his weak receiving ability .
Throw a ball to him while he ’s wide open and he ’d find a way to drop it .
Tecmo Super Bowl Stats :
How He Would Help : Barry Sanders would clearly revive Detroit ’s running game .
The Lions ranked 30th out of 32 teams in rushing offense .
Even behind a mediocre front line , Barry would find ways to hurdle , spin -move or stiff - arm some jerk in the face for a big run .
It ’s NFL Hall of Famer RB Barry Sanders we ’re talking about here !
Team : The Oakland Raiders ( 5 - 11 ) .
Why They Need Help : The Oakland Raiders ended their season on the bottom half of the AFC West ; the first time the team has not held the bottom spot since 2002 .
After a 1 - 3 start , Oakland Raiders Owner Al Davis fired Head Coach Lane Kiffin “ for cause . ”
This is a team that ’s desperate for someone to bring back the franchise glory and where as a fan , you ’d be proud to wear your Raiders gear out on the streets .
The Savior : Vincent Edward “ Bo ” Jackson
Career Profile : Bo Jackson was known for being the original two - sport standout by playing NFL RB for the Los Angeles Raiders and MLB LF for the Kansas City Royals .
Jackson was selected in the 7th round with the 183rd overall pick by the Raiders .
Despite the fact that he would miss part of the NFL season due to MLB commitments , the second string RB behind Marcus Allen would still outrun his counterpart .
In 1990 , Jackson ran for a total of 698 yards in 10 games while Allen ran for 682 yards while playing in all 16 games .
Tecmo Super Bowl Profile :
Bo is the best player in the game .
Although an above average RB in his NFL career , the guy was unstoppable in Tecmo Super Bowl .
He had crazy off - the - line speed , was sure - handed when given the ball and could free himself from opposing tacklers .
When out in the open field , no one could tackle Jackson if you used the patented zig - zag running style to make tacklers dive and miss .
When his physical condition was excellent , Jackson would be the Raider ’s entire offense .
Tecmo Super Bowl Stats :
How He Would Help : Unfortunately for Bo , the Oakland Raiders are doing well with their rushing offense , ranking 10th overall .
Where the Raiders are hurting is in their pass offense , ranking dead last in the league .
Unfortunately for
Bo again is that he stunk at receptions .
Look at his player rating for receptions – a very low 19 points .
I do n’t know if Bo was ever offended by his receptions number like Redskin ’s long snapper Ethan Albright over his player ranking in Madden NFL .
Although the Raiders do n’t need another RB , Bo could make the Raiders running game a bigger threat and shake up defensive packages to give their passing game a chance .
Team : The Buffalo Bills ( 7 - 9 ) .
Why They Need Help :
What looked like a promising season when the Bills started red hot at 4 - 0 , turned into yet another predictable disappointment .
The Bills managed to compile an embarassing 0 - 6 record when playing against teams in their own AFC East Division and have missed the playoffs for nine consecutive seasons .
The Bills franchise has been run into the ground by their front office and have serious deficincies scattered throughout their offense and defense because of their owner ’s unwillingness to spend the money to get quality players .
The Savior : Thurman Thomas
Career Profile : After playing at Oklahoma State University with teammate Barry Sanders , Thurman Thomas left as the school ’s all time rushing leader for a career in the NFL .
Selected in the second round by the Buffalo Bills in the 1988 draft , a mere 2 years later , Thomas was the AFC ’s rushing leader and was only second in the NFL to Barry Sanders with his 1297 yards rushing and 532 yards receiving .
Throughout his career , Thomas was known as a versatile running back who was a great runner and a great receiving option out of the backfield .
In fact , Thomas finished his career as the second all - time leading receiver in Bills history with 4,341 yards .
It also did n’t hurt that he played with the Bills when they had QB Jim Kelly and WR Andre Reed ; creating a deadly offensive combination in the air and on the ground .
Tecmo Super Bowl Profile : Thurman
Thomas is the best all - around running back in the game .
He has good maximum speed so once he breaks through the hole , it ’s hard for an opponent to catch up with him .
Thomas is also a great option for as a second receiver when Andre Reed is covered up .
When he has the ball , he is sure handed and wo n’t fumble the ball .
Tecmo Super Bowl Stats :
How He Would Help :
The Bills finished the season ranking 22nd in passing yards and 14th overall in rushing yards per game .
The stats are n’t bad but they are n’t great either .
The Bills have reliable weapons in WR Lee Evans and RB Marshawn Lynch .
However , neither player is a Pro-Bowl selection .
With a versatile RB like Thurman Thomas , the Bills would have a more balanced passing and rushing offense that would make defense coordinators cringe when they had to choose what package to put out on the field to defend against Thomas ; is he going to run it or will he be the third down check ?
Team : Kansas City Chiefs ( 2 - 14 ) .
Why They Need Help : With President / General Manager Carl Peterson stepping down , the Kansas City ’s front - office is a disaster .
Kansas
City has stated they intend to look for a dedicated president to run the business aspects of the organization and a GM to handle the football operations .
No more putting all of your eggs in one basket .
KC is also saddled with personnel problems .
Chiefs ’
RB Larry Johnson has stated he wants out of KC because he feels the team has changed their offensive priorities and perennial Pro Bowler Tony Gonzalez has stated he only intends to play one more season before retiring ; even shorter if he hears the organization mention the word “ rebuild . ”
With so much turmoil in the organization , KC , a team that has been in the playoffs twice in the last ten years , is in desperate need of a face - lift .
The Savior : Christian “ The Nigerian Nightmare ” Okoye
Career Profile : Okoye played 6 seasons in the NFL ( all with the Chiefs ) before voluntarily retiring due to a nagging knee injury and because he was tired of practicing and perceived playing professional football as more of a job than something he was passionate about .
He ended his career with 2 Pro Bowl appearances and a league rushing title in 1989 when he ran for a league best 1,480 yards .
A native of Nigeria standing 6 ’ 1 ″ and weighing 260 lbs , Okoye had decent speed , but earned the nickname “ The Nigerian Nightmare ” because of his over - powering and bruising running style that punished defenders standing between him and the end zone .
Tecmo Super Bowl Profile :
The creators of Tecmo Super Bowl took Okoye ’s nickname , “ The Nigerian Nightmare ” to heart .
When Okoye gets the ball and hits the hole at full speed , defenders literally bounce off of him because of his incredible hitting power rating .
Even in open - field situations , it ’s impossible to bring Okoye down in a one - on - one situation .
What happens most of the time is he bulldozes you over and you ’re left watching the pixelated player race down the field for an easy touchdown .
Your only hope of stopping him is if two or more defenders get to him at the same time .
Although there are other players in the game with similar hitting power as Okoye , they lack the above average speed Okoye runs with .
Not known for having good hands in the NFL , Okoye is pretty lousy at holding onto the ball and lacks good receiving capability in the game .
Tecmo Super Bowl Stats :
How He Would Help : With Larry Johnson most likely out the door , KC needs a RB .
Who better to bring back the “ wow factor ” to the Chief ’s rushing offense than Okoye and his menacing running style .
Fans would cheer loud and hard every time Okoye stepped on a would - be tackler and would re-ignite the Chief ’s disillusioned fan base .
Here ’s a You Tube clip showing off some of the above mentioned running backs .

ISLAMABAD , Pakistan ( CNN ) -- U.S. Vice President - elect Joe Biden assured Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari on Friday that the incoming Obama administration will continue to support Pakistan 's efforts to strengthen democracy and combat terrorism , according to Pakistan 's Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Vice President - elect Joe Biden meets Pakistani officials in Islamabad , Pakistan , on Friday .
Biden told Zardari that the new U.S. administration would also help Pakistan " meet its socio- economic requirements and capacity building , " the ministry said in a written statement .
The vice president - elect " assured the Pakistani leadership " of the United States ' " continued assistance to Pakistan , " the statement said .
No additional details were provided .
Sen. Lindsey Graham , R - South Carolina , accompanied Biden on the trip .
Biden " described Pakistan as an incredibly valued U.S. ally and said that the U.S. recognized Pakistan 's important contribution and sacrifices in the fight against terrorism , " the ministry said .
Zardari , who took office in September , said " Pakistan needed the support and understanding of the international community in this effort , " according to the statement .
Pakistan 's government is waging a bloody battle against Taliban and al Qaeda militants in its tribal regions along the border with Afghanistan .
The United States has provided Pakistan with billions of dollars in aid for those counterterrorism activities .
Last year , the Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed a bill authorizing $ 7.5 billion in non-military aid over the next five years .
The measure is sponsored by committee chairman Biden and the ranking Republican on the panel , Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana .
It would provide money for developments such as schools , roads and medical clinics , and it conditions security aid on State Department certification that Pakistan is making efforts against the Taliban and al Qaeda .
The bill has not come before the full Senate .
Biden also said he was hopeful that India and Pakistan could resolve their conflicts , according the ministry .
" The U.S. vice president - elect expressed the hope that both Pakistan and India will be able to overcome the current tensions and would resolve their differences peacefully , " the ministry 's statement said .
November 's attacks in Mumbai , India , fueled tensions between Pakistan and India , longtime rivals that have fought three wars since independence and conducted tit - for - tat nuclear weapons tests in 1998 .
India has said Islamic militants trained in Pakistan were behind the three - day siege of India 's financial capital .
Pakistani officials have promised to cooperate with the investigation but have insisted that India show it the evidence supporting its case .
On Wednesday , Pakistan 's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the sole surviving suspect in the Mumbai attacks , which killed more than 160 people , is a Pakistani national , state - run media reported .

In millions : Music purchases *
2004 : 817
2008 : 1,513 Album sales **
2004 : 666.7
2008 : 428.4

* -- Album sales include CD , vinyl , cassette and digital album sales .
** -- Music purchases encompass album sales plus digital tracks , singles and music video .
Source : Nielsen SoundScan
Americans bought more music in 2008 than ever before , but album sales — the music industry 's main source of revenue — dropped for a fourth year .
According to the Nielsen Co. 's year - end figures , music purchases — CD , vinyl , cassette and digital purchases of entire albums ( grouped together as total albums ) , plus digital track downloads , singles and music videos — attained a new high of 1.5 billion , up 10.5 % over 2007 .
More than 70 % of those transactions were digital track downloads , a record total of 1.07 billion that swamped 2007 's previous high of 844.2 million by 27 % .
Last week 's track downloads set a record of 47.7 million , and 71 songs exceeded 1 million downloads this year , compared with 41 last year ( and just two in 2005 ) .
Track downloads outsold albums by a ratio of 2.5 to 1 .
Total album sales dropped to 428.4 million , 14 % fewer than in 2007 , and have fallen 45 % since 2000 .
Even combining album and track sales ( by a formula that counts 10 track downloads as one album sale ) , the 535.4 million total is still down 8.5 % from 2007 and more than 30 % below 2000 's physical album sales of 785.1 million .
Music purchases are " astronomically high , " says Rob Sisco , Nielsen 's president of music , " but it 's a marketplace in transition from physical to digital . "
He sees promise in the rise of digital purchases of entire albums , which reached a high of 65.8 million in 2008 .
New albums by big acts bring the market up , he says , but " there has n't been a steady stream of high - profile releases . "
Other '08 results : • Leona Lewis ' Bleeding
Love was the year 's top - selling digital song with 3.42 million downloads .
Lil Wayne 's Lollipop also topped 3 million , by 160,000 .
Rest of the top five : Flo Rida 's Low , Katy Perry 's I Kissed a Girl , Coldplay 's Viva la Vida .
• Lil Wayne 's Tha Carter III was the No. 1 album , selling 2.87 million copies .
Coldplay 's Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends , Taylor Swift 's Fearless and Kid Rock 's Rock ' n ' Roll Jesus were the only other albums to sell 2 million in 2008 , compared with eight in 2007 .
• Swift , whose self - titled first album was No. 6 for the year , behind AC / DC's Black Ice , sold 4 million albums overall , tops for any artist .
Rihanna was the leader in track sales with 9.94 million .
• Low is the all - time best - selling digital song , with 4.53 million downloads .
The only other track above 4 million is Timbaland & OneRepublic 's Apologize , at 4.01 million .
• Garth Brooks lost ground to The Beatles but is still by far the best - selling artist of the SoundScan era ( post - 1991 , when Nielsen began tracking album sales electronically ) , leading the Fab Four by a tally of 68.1 million to 57.1 million .
• Although vinyl albums gave way to CDs years before SoundScan launched , it 's worth noting that vinyl sales hit a 17 - year high in 2008 with 1.88 million , up dramatically from just under a million in 2007 .
Radiohead's
In Rainbows was the top vinyl seller with 25,800 copies .

Today 's last call deals with perhaps the most egocentric athlete of all time , Rickey Henderson , and perhaps the most unassuming star of all time , Ricardo Montalban .
Henderson was deservedly elected to the Hall of Fame on Monday .
And when he gives his induction speech on July 26 , it might be worth watching .
Why ?
Well , check out faniq.com 's list of the 25 greatest Rickey Henderson stories of all time , and you 'll see why .
Legendary actor Ricardo Montalban passed away today .
What kind of guy was he ?
Well , if my one encounter with him was any indication , he was a pretty classy individual .
About 20 years ago , I went with some friends to a hotel in the Hollywood area that was hosting some sort of dinner or benefit .
Many , many stars were expected to attend , and my friends wanted to hang around outside and watch them arrive .
There were a couple hundred people outside , also hoping to glimpse someone famous .
I went about 300 yards away and sat on a bench next to the public parking lot , reading a book , since I really did n't care about waiting in a crowd to glimpse Rutger Hauer for three seconds .
As the time for the benefit neared , limo after limo arrived , and many celebrities indeed attended .
Milton Berle , Tony Bennett , Johnny Carson and many others all arrived to the thrill of the crowd .
As I was sitting there reading , I glanced to my left and noticed somebody walking toward the hotel from the public parking lot .
It was Ricardo Montalban .
He had driven his own car to the event , and parked with the common people .
I loved Montalban in " Fantasy Island " and " Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khan . "
As he neared , I started applauding quietly , just to let him know I was a fan .
He immediately walked over to me , shook my hand and thanked me .
We spoke for about 15 seconds , and then he continued on his way .
But for those 15 seconds , he made me feel like he was a fan of mine , rather than the other way around .
It 's something I 've never forgotten .
God bless you , Ricardo Montalban , and thanks for the memories .
Mark Evanier at newsfromme.com also has a great Ricardo Montalban story here .

Midway Now Facing February Bankruptcy
After majority shareholder Sumner Redstone sold 87 % of the Mortal Kombat publisher for $ 100 K , investors were able to demand repayment due to the change in control .
All together , Midway faces $ 240 million in debt , though it is primarily concerned with $ 150 million of that , which is owned in $ 75 million increments to two groups of holders .
As of December , the company did not believe it could immediately pay the $ 150 million .
Midway originally had until 2025 to repay one group , and 2026 for the other .
Previously , the investors had until mid-January to decide if they wanted their money back .
Now , Midway has convinced one group to hold off until February 19 , and is attempting to persuade the other group of holders to give it just a little more time .
Midway 's remaining $ 90 million debt is owed to Redstone 's theater business National Amusements .
Oddly , that debt was not mentioned in Midway 's update , perhaps implying that National Amusements may not demand immediate repayment .

CPN ( Maoist ) mass meeting in Kathmandu
By Bill Templer
January 3 , 2009 --
One remarkable laboratory that discussion in much of the world ’s progressive press tends to neglect is the dynamic vortex of revolutionary change in Nepal .
Since spring , Nepal has something that may be making genuine history : a Maoist people ’s movement , that , led by the CPN ( Maoist ) , and the struggle of the People ’s Liberation Army over a decade , has come to state power through the ballot box .
As Tufts University historian Gary Leupp wrote last April : “ It ought to be the ballot heard ' round the world .
It ought to be front page news . [… ]
This moment may in the not distant future be seen as another 1917 , another 1949 . ” [ 1 ]
Leupp has been one of the very few in the left media in the geopolitical North to call attention to this momentous change , and its current developments , albeit with little echo .
Editors of some well - known journals refuse to consider an article that mentions Maoism , however contemporary , in a favourable light .
Washington - based trade union organiser David Hoskins has been one of the few on the Marxist left in the US to stress the world - historical significance of the struggle in Nepal :
“ The state of the revolutionary movement in Asia takes on new significance in light of the recent advances made in Nepal and the rising global capitalist crisis . [… ]
It is our responsibility as US revolutionaries to offer our unconditional support to the Nepalese revolution . ” [ 2 ]
That solidarity was also voiced by the Party for Socialism and Liberation in the United States :
“ The election of Prachanda is an achievement that deserves the support of revolutionaries around the world .
A struggle over Nepal ’s new constitution is bound to pit conflicting class interests against each other in the months to come .
International solidarity will play a key role in facilitating the victory of Nepal ’s workers and peasants . ” [ 3 ]
The present article assumes one can be critical of certain historical aspects of socialism under Mao while still keeping an open mind about the Maoist - led social and political transformation now going on in Nepal , with all the internal upheaval and debate it is generating -- and perhaps learning from its actual tactics and internal controversy .
Whether you agree with CPN ( M ) analyses and strategies or not . , blocking out any sustained focus on the Nepali revolution , labelling change there as ``Stalinist ’’ , ``bolshevik ’’ or ``authoritarian ’’ , can only preclude analysis and critique .
This is all the more pertinent at this extraordinary juncture in the planetary capitalist economic collapse , where conditions worldwide are changing the minds of many .
Fred Goldstein notes : “ Globalization , capitalist restructuring , the hardships of low - wage capitalism , and growing racism and national oppression are creating the material basis for a new era of rebellion and class unity . ” [ 4 ]
Convergence in diversity
The recent mass anti-repression insurrection in Greece is one point of working - class upsurge , what really fuelled Barack Obama ’s presidential victory from below is another .
And the April 2008 election victory of the CPN ( M ) in Nepal is still another .
These nodes of people ’s ferment reflect that “ convergence in diversity ” of the oppressed and exploited from all walks and continents united in opposition to the neo-reactionary order which economist Samir Amin sees as the nucleus for a new stage in the revolutionary project today , “ recognizing the diversity , not only of movements which are fragmented but of political forces which are operating with them , of ideologies and even visions of the future of those political forces . ”
In his projected scenario for grounded socialist change , he sees the Left finding a critical mass and “ moving into the masses to defend , not in rhetoric but in fact in action and through action , their real economic and social interests ” .
[ 5 ]
That is at the core of the struggle in the street and inside the government in Nepal today .
Emergent dynamic agendas for struggle like Prachanda Path -- and the very vigorous internal party debate on how to move forward without sacrificing revolutionary vision -- belong more centrally on our own horizons of discussion .
The revolution in Nepal faces what can threaten to become a quagmire of compromise , reformism and defeat .
Internally , this is a struggle between hostile class enemies for control over the Nepalese state .
It also is confronted with sustained efforts by political elites in Washington , Delhi and other quarters , and by opponents like the bourgeois Nepali Congress on its home turf ( second - largest party ) , to undermine the revolutionary process .
The other major Marxist party in the coalition , with some 15 % of the National Assembly , the CPN - UML ( United Marxist - Leninist ) remains highly critical of the Maoist leadership , a long - standing rival , and could , in fierce rivalry , seek to topple the present government .
[ 6 ]
The Madeshi civil rights movement in the southern plain remains a powerful divisive force struggling for ethnic rights and greater autonomy , and members of the Madeshi People ’s Rights Forum were involved in heavy clashes with the CPN ( M ) in March 2007 .
Demands for more autonomy in the Terai / Madesh south continue . [ 7 ]
The Asian Human Rights Commission has issued The State of Human Rights in Nepal , which paints a complex picture in a highly diverse country with legacies of multiple ethnic oppression .
[ 8 ]
Yet nowhere else in the world has a movement oriented to Marxism and contemporary Maoist thought achieved the effective reins of democratic power , projecting its visions of “ 21st century socialism ” .
This article suggests some sources for looking more openly from afar at what 's happening in Nepal , in a spirit of critical solidarity , getting better informed to enable grounded judgement .
All footnotes are hyperlinks to relevant reports , largely in the Nepalese media .
Revolution in a ‘ least developed country ’
Nepal is a prime landlocked ``least developed country ’’ of 29.5 million , with some 80 % of Nepalis labouring as poor agriculturalists .
Literally sandwiched between Asia ’s two giants , the famous dictum by Prithvi Narayan Shah , founder of the Shah monarchy in the 18th century recently abolished , was that " Nepal is a yam between two stones " .
Much of the country is barely accessible by road , remoteness takes on an almost surreal quality in the hills and mountains north of the narrow southern plain of the Terai ( Madesh ) .
Space there is a largely vertical topography where a hundred languages flourish , where villages in one valley are totally cut off from settlements in the next .
The top 5 per cent of landholders own 27 per cent of agricultural land , the bottom 44 per cent occupy only 14 per cent of the land .
Land reform is crucial for the Nepali masses to dismantle the multiple structures of the feudal system that now still dominate the country . [ 9 ]
The literacy NGO Room to Read is active in building village libraries : “ A child growing up in Nepal faces some of the worst living conditions in the world .
Roughly 50 % of Nepalese live in poverty -- on less than US $ 1 a day .
Of every 100 children in Nepal , 84 live in villages , 47 are malnourished , and 40 belong to extremely poor families [ … ]
While 35 % of males are illiterate , 57 % of females cannot read or write . ” [ 10 ]
A steady torrent of migrant workers continues to pour into India to the south , with nearly 70 % finding menial labour as porters , security guards and restaurant help .
A recent study of trafficked Nepalese girls , most in their early teens , working in debt bondage and near slavery in Indian cities pointed up the desperate plight of young Nepalese women seeking to survive , and often disowned by their families back in the impoverished villages they were raised in . [ 11 ]
Estimates are that some 200,000 Nepalese girls are working as prostitutes in virtual bondage in Indian cities , nearly a quarter under the age of 16 . [ 12 ]
Production for profit or for use ?
Some fanciful neoliberal development speculation sees Nepal as the future entrepreneurial link between China and India , with trans - Himalayan highways , IT parks , vast investment in fibre optics , arguing that “ The rising middle classes -- close to a billion -- in the two countries can be a bonanza for Nepal ” -- at the same time turning the country into a huge Himalayan mega- resort , an illusory capitalist pipe dream . [ 13 ]
Revolutionaries in the CPN ( M ) are guided by alternative visions of economy , society and workers ’ democracy .
But whether they can move forward to a major break with the capitalist cash nexus and , beyond subsistence agriculture , an array of forms of production for use , not profit , remains to be seen .
After decades of disdevelopment , for example , Nepal faces the worst national electricity crisis in Asia , with power cuts lasting up to 10 hours daily , with load shedding up to 16 hours a day projected by early spring 2009 . [ 14 ]
That shortfall is also impacting on tourism , especially in towns like Pokhara .
Some lateral socialist brainstorming is needed on practicable schemes for solar , hydro and geothermal energy .
Transformation and people ’s power are needed literally from the ground up .
Experimentation with LETS ( Local Economic Transfer System ) in rural areas may be one avenue for cooperative change , building community support networks and mutual aid . [ 15 ]
Below I touch on some of the contemporary discussion inside the CPN ( M ) and suggest online material and web sites to explore the dynamic changes in Nepal , largely through indigenous voices in the struggle , refracted in part through the lens of socialist theorist Samir Amin , a chief architect of the 2006 Bamako Appeal [ 16 ] , and in basic solidarity with revolutionary developments on the ground in Nepal .
Prachanda on the CPN ( M ) path
As a point of departure , instructive is the interview with CPN ( M ) chairperson Pushpal Kamal Dahal ( aka ``Prachanda ’’ ) , conducted earlier in 2008 by people from the IPS in Washington , visiting in Kathmandu , on video as Part 1 [ 17 ] and Part 2 . [ 18 ]
Candid and concise , Dahal lays out the vision of the movement in the early weeks of its ascendance to state power .
This is lived experience over a long struggle , with a powerful legacy of liberation that is distinctive to Nepal but applicable far beyond : “ As the CPN - Maoist has already declared its decision to write a 21st century Communist Manifesto , it has also started a debate and discussion in the Communist spirit , not only in the country , but also in the world . ” [ 19 ]
This can be supplemented by Chairman Dahal ’s address , “ A Maoist Vision for a New Nepal , ” given at the New School University on September 26 , 2008 , followed by an extended question and answer period , along with the text of his earlier address that same day to the UN General Assembly .
Likewise of interest is the historic interview with Prachanda by the US left journalist Li Onesto at the height of the People ’s War in the spring of 1999 . [ 20 ]
` All the bases belong to the old class power ’
Yet the compromises that now entails has deepened debate and divisions within the party on future anti-capitalist strategy in transforming Nepal and concrete tactics as the major formation in power , repeatedly frustrated by the actions and rhetoric of the Nepali Congress Party .
Part of that discussion is on the dangers of succumbing to the pull of reformism .
Netra Bikram Chand , aka ``Biplap ’’ , a member of the party ’s central committee , provides critical analysis on “ The differences of opinion within our party ” in the biweekly English paper of the CPN ( M ) , The Red Star . [ 21 ]
Biplap discusses the tactics necessary to destroy the existing “ bases and the bodies of the comprador capitalist power and shatter them . ”
In his view :
The class character of the democratic republic is of a bourgeois class character .
After the constituent assembly , the monarchy has been abolished and the republic has been established , however , there is no change in its class character .
The party has reached up to the super structure of the state power , the constituent assembly government ; but all of the bases belong to the old class power .
He differs with the party 's leader on the shape of a road forward , and fears that if the CPN ( M ) follows the program proposed by Prachanda , “ our party will be drowned into the swamp of reformism up over its head ” .
` On the brink of the change of an age ’
The debate on the future path forward in Nepal came to a head in a national convention of the CPN ( M ) in November 2008 , where , after pretty heated discussion , some solid basis of unity was achieved .
The core issues are outlined by Indra Mohan Sigdel ( aka ``Basanta ’ ’ ) . [ 22 ]
A decision was reached to move toward a “ people ’s federal democratic national republic ” as the longer - term goal , and that among the “ three fronts of struggle ” – the constituent assembly , the government and the street – “ the street struggle would be the principal one ” . [ 23 ]
The street struggle also means involving the masses at the grassroots in the dynamic of discussion , experiment and change .
Kumar Dahal has warned of possible counter - revolution , and likewise stresses the need for struggle “ in the street ” : “ The workers should advance ahead to guarantee and establish the working class as the decisive force in the state .
Workers should advance ahead to take the major responsibilities in the policy - making place . ” [ 24 ]
Part of that struggle in the streets and villages is being carried forward by the CPN ( M ) ’s Young Communist League , with nearly half a million members .
It is organising neighborhood cleanup campaigns , programs to counter youth unemployment , communal development initiatives in agriculture , initiatives against corruption and crime . [ 25 ]
They remain controversial because accused of violence , and are often in a critical spotlight , but their mobilisation of the Nepalese young and hands - on contribution to social betterment cannot be denied .
Agitating on campuses , the All Nepal National Independent Students Union ( Revolutionary ) is the student wing of the CPN ( M ) , struggling to democratise education at all levels . [ 26 ]
It has also been involved in strike action against conservative university administrations on a number of campuses , and in clashes with other student organisations .
In early November 2008 , Finance Minister Baburam Bhattarai announced the government ’s intention to put an end to private primary and secondary schools in Nepal in the near future , because of the privilege that breeds .
This is perhaps the only principled statement in any country to enact policy to eliminate privatisation and commercialisation of education in the name of educational equity .
About a third of Nepal ’s schools are now private , catering largely , though not exclusively , to children from families with higher incomes .
Bhattarai also outlined the government ’s intention to issue some kind of academic certificate to men and women who fought in the people ’s liberation forces and sacrificed their schooling . [ 27 ]
Through all this , the CPN ( M ) is determined to stick to its principles .
Stressing the unwillingness of the party to participate in a coalition government that frustrates the basic promises of radical change made to the Nepalese people , Prime Minister Dahal threatened in December 2008 that his party might leave the government by mid-January to struggle in opposition rather than compromise its program : " Steps of struggle still remain to fulfill what we want .
We are on the brink of the change of an age . ” [ 28 ]
D. Bastola notes : “ As long as the rooted feudalism and comprador bureaucrat capitalism is not abolished , the Nepalese people cannot be free , and the national economy cannot be built up . ” [ 29 ]
` Plain living , hard struggle ’
In December 2008 , the party prepared a battery of new “ codes for simple living ” for all Constituent Assembly members , with guidelines for type of vehicle ( battery - driven Chinese bicycle preferred ) , simple clothing , use mainly of public transport , and a limit of two cell phones .
The codes are in response to “ criticisms that Maoist leaders were starting to lead opulent lifestyles opposed to their proletarian philosophy ” . [ 30 ]
A new democratic space
Writing that “ Nepalese society is committed to fulfil the dream of a new Nepal through an epoch making ideological , political , economic , and cultural transformation , raising the banner of mass insurrection against semi-feudal and semi-colonial conditions in the country ” , the new minister of culture and state restructuring , Gopal Kirati , issued a concept paper in late 2008 for public discussion detailing new ideas for a radical transformation of local and regional organisation , and ethnic autonomous structures , including an “ Autonomous Sherpa State ” .
In this revolutionary design , 800 districts are proposed .
Outlining a new concept of ethnic pluralism and national consciousness , Kirati notes : “ By abandoning the renegade definition of Nepal as a ``yam between two rocks ’’ , the Peoples of the Republic of Nepal will establish a strong definition of nationality .
This definition will be a ‘ dynamite ’ between the two rocks in 21st century rather than a yam , ” grounded on “ proletarian internationalism . ” [ 31 ]
A new international ?
Flanking a spectrum of debate and self - criticism inside the party , Roshan Kissoon and Chandra have a new two - part interview with Samir Amin , “ We need a new international ” [ 32 ] and “ Maoism is needed everywhere in the world ” , [ 33 ] first published in The Red Star .
Samir Amin is current chair of the World Forum for Alternatives . [ 34 ]
The interview also echoes arguments from his new book The World We Wish to See . [ 35 ]
In fundamental solidarity with the CPN ( M ) , he stresses that :
the Nepalese have , at least , succeeded at the first chapter of basing their struggle in peasant revolt and then making , becoming , a force able to overthrow the regime , the King and his comprador servants ; and then coming in to negotiation , agreement , with other possible partners in the building of a national , popular , democratic , hegemonic alternative block ; alternative to the comprador ruling class submitting to imperialism and neo-liberalism . [ 36 ]
He develops a strong argument for the need for the left in the West to look carefully at what is happening on the ground and inside the revolutionary echelon in Nepal .
His book The Future of Maoism ( Monthly Review , 1981 ) can now be read in the light of recent events .
The Cultural Revolution revisited
Bastola stresses that the November 2008 national convention of the CNP( M ) was an exercise in the “ Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution ” , bringing the masses back into the dynamic of transformation .
Changing perspectives on the legacy of Mao ’s vision of transformation for China , and the actual reality of the Cultural Revolution , ``counter - narratives ’’ to the usual take on that era , are being re-explored in the West .
A December 2008 symposium on " Rediscovering China 's Cultural Revolution : Art and Politics , Lived Experience , Legacies of Liberation , " [ 37 ] was organised at NYU in Manhattan by Revolution Books , an affiliate of the Revolutionary Communist Party [ 38 ] , and Set the Record Straight project , with input from Monthly Review and others .
Typical of the widespread blockout on any renewed exploration of the Cultural Revolution in the progressive media of the global North , that symposium received scant coverage .
Among its speakers , historian Dongping Han introduced his new book The Unknown Cultural Revolution : Life and Change in a Chinese Village ( Monthly Review , 2008 ) , that deals with his own experience as manager of a collective village factory during the Cultural Revolution , and his views on Mao ’s thought and its vital relevance to struggles today worldwide . [ 39 ]
Dongping provides an insider ’s view of how farmers in China were empowered through education during the Cultural Revolution , and the special structures of communal democracy that were created : “ Chinese farmers had a strong sense that they controlled their own destiny at the time . [ … ] most Chinese , not just farmers and workers , but professors and artists , were sincerely convinced they were building a better society for themselves , and not just for the working class .
They had a new life . ”
Based on his research and personal experience , Dongping is certain that “ despite the efforts of the last 30 years to bury the Cultural Revolution , this era will stand out for people in China , in other Third World countries , and in Europe and in US and the rest of the developed world as well . [ … ]
Mao's Cultural Revolution should be the most important event in human empowerment in humanity 's 2000 - year history . ”
Revised views of the Cultural Revolution also emerge from the volume edited by X. Zhong , W. Zheng and Bai Di , Some of Us : Chinese Women Growing Up in the Mao Era ( Rutgers UP , 2001 ) , here reviewed in depth by a Maoist - Third Worldist . [ 40 ] ``Prarie Fire ’’ stresses :
The Cultural Revolution , whether intentional or not , was the greatest instance of youth liberation in history . [… ]
Authority at almost every level could find itself challenged by youth .
This did not just affect the public realm , but also the private realm of the family .
In the Manifesto Marx wrote , “ Do you charge us with wanting to stop the exploitation of children by their parents ?
To this crime we plead guilty . ”
The early Cultural Revolution , more than any other period , realized the communist goal of youth liberation . [ … ]
Some of Us , despite its own bourgeois outlook , challenges typical , one - sided bourgeois narratives .
Bai Di is director of Chinese and Asian Studies at Drew University , and also spoke at the December 2008 symposium on the Cultural Revolution at NYU .
Another speaker was Li Onesto , whose book Dispatches from the People ’s War in Nepal ( Pluto Press , 2004 ) was the first account by a foreign journalist of the Maoist insurgency from the inside , as she travelled deep into the liberated guerrilla zones . [ 41 ]
Perhaps an aspect of the Eurocentrism endemic in some quarters of the Northern left is the refusal to even engage with these voices and dissident perspectives .
Why ?
Staying better informed
Progressives interested in keeping informed about developments in Nepal can regularly read the biweekly The Red Star . [ 42 ]
A daily more ‘ mainstream ’ bourgeois political and economic news on Nepal is eKantipur.com . [ 43 ]
The website Revolution in South Asia provides a solidarity window onto the rapidly unfolding events in Nepal and the broader South Asian region . [ 44 ]
An Indian Maoist insurgency is spreading in Orissa and Chhattisgarh states , largely unreported outside India . [ 45 ]
Policy analyst Sean Deblieck , in a bourgeois analysis of how to cope with and neutralise Maoist insurgencies in South Asia , gives an overview of Naxalite movements in India and the CPM ( N ) in Nepal .
He concludes :
The reason that Maoism was able to take root in India and Nepal stems largely from the failings of politicians and their political systems .
It is clear that the lowest castes and classes in these two countries have been largely ignored by their representatives , and development has passed them by .
The Maoists on the other hand are the only party that seems willing to venture into remote areas and to work with the poor .
Chairman Mao was unique in recognising the latent potential of such rural peasants , and left behind powerful tactics and a vague ideology that continue to be of use to this day . [ 46 ]
The activity of the Revolutionary Internationalist Movement ( RIM ) , of which the CPN ( M ) is a part , is a broader frame in South Asia . [ 47 ]
Yet some currents of ``Third - World Maoists ’’ remain fundamentally critical of the RIM , the North American Revolutionary Communist Party ( RCP ) , its chairperson Bob Avakian , and RCP solidarity with the CPN ( M ) strategy to abandon the armed struggle at this juncture and form a coalition government . [ 48 ]
This argument will rage on , part of a vibrant debate .
Press freedom and social democracy
One recurrent flashpoint of controversy within Nepal is press freedom , especially the role of the bourgeois press in its criticism of the CPN ( M ) .
United We Blog !
For a Democratic Nepal , established in 2004 by Nepalese journalists during a period of great repression , continues to be a site for broad discussion of issues and developments . [ 49 ]
Nepal Press Freedom is reporting on intimidation of journalists and fighting to protect and promote “ free , fair , and vibrant journalism ” .
[ 50 ]
In late December 2008 , cadre from the CPN ( M ) attacked the offices of Himalmedia , which publishes three magazines , after an article appeared critical of the Young Communist League .
The Revolutionary Journalists ’ Association Nepal and CPN ( M ) activists condemned the violence , which left many Himalmedia staff injured .
[ 51 ]
Naturally , such conflict , involving the independent media , draws particular media attention .
The FES - Nepal ( Friedrich - Ebert - Stiftung ) , reflecting a longstanding German cultural presence in Nepal , [ 52 ] offers a more social democratic view on the path forward and the current situation . [ 53 ]
So there is a rich heteroglossia of voices and opinions in a dynamic public sphere , as reflected in analytical commentary by political scientist Dev Raj Dahal ( head of FES - Nepal ) on the “ multiple transition ” the country is now facing . [ 54 ]
Beyond the current clash of diverse camps , an alchemy of radical democratic synergy may emerge .
Working - class protest
In any event , the level of militant popular protest by the people is remarkable .
On January 2 , 2009 , in an unprecedented protest action , local people in the town of Kirtipur outside Kathmandu , the home of Tribhuvan University , the oldest campus in the country , shut down the town and university over demands for compensation for land appropriated from their families to build the university 50 years ago and giving locals more employment opportunities on campus .
They vandalised the Tribhuvan University central offices the day before . [ 55 ]
That came amidst widespread labour protests by workers in various sectors across the nation , in part due to the severe power crisis .
People are learning the power of acting collectively , to address critical grievances .
Speaking to workers , Prime Minister Dahal stated that “ pretty soon , the government will make an important announcement , which will help usher the nation in a new era ” , stressing that the feudalistic mindset of political leaders had affected the performance of the Maoist - led government .
He noted that previous political misrule was to blame for the prevailing power crisis : “ During [ their ] 15 - year - long rule , dishonest leaders never thought about the looming power crisis .
People are suffering now because of their inaction . ” [ 56 ]
Progressive Nepali Forum in the Americas
The newly formed PNEFA aims to “ support activities intended to do away with unjust social , economic and political discriminations and exploitations upon the historically marginalized , working - class Nepalis ” . [ 57 ] centering in particular on eliminating caste - based discrimination against some 4.5 - 5.5 million Hindu Dalits ( Untouchables ) in the new Nepal . [ 58 ]
Their plight is extreme , and they may make up nearly 20 % of the total population . [ 59 ]
They voted heavily for the CPN ( M ) in the April 2008 poll .
Other social hegemonies
However remote geographically , Nepal is one of the major laboratories for social and political transformation , and socialist discussion anywhere in the geopolitical South .
The ferment of discourse and praxis developing there are relevant far beyond that country ’s borders , wherever you may stand on the socialist left .
Amin is optimistic about a coming upsurge in the tide of counter - globalisation :
conditions are ripe for the emergence of other social hegemonies that make possible a revival of development conceived as it should be : the indissociable combination of social progress , democratic advancement , and the affirmation of national independence within a negotiated multipolar globalisation .
The possibility of these new social hegemonies is already visible on the horizon . [ 60 ]
Nepal ’s transformation may yet augur those emergent “ new social hegemonies ” at the very top of the world .
In India , a segment of the comprador class may harbour growing fears that Nepal , with a huge impoverished rural agricultural population similar to India ’s , could provide a radical example on the nation ’s very doorstep for “ revolutionary change in the countryside and self - determination for the great majority ” ( ibid. ) , as the global crisis in imperial hegemony deepens and a Maoist - led alliance to the north consolidates its position .

In Amin ’s perspective , that diversity is ample enough to include social anarchists , eco-socialists and others , in some ways analogous to the breadth of the New Anti-Capitalist Party ( NPA ) in France ( http://links.org.au/node/814; see also http://www.npa2009.org).

The events in Nepal would seem to fly in the face of those within the WSF who believe that “ political attack targeted on the state is increasingly irrelevant . ”

Arundhati Roy commented in 2007 on the Maoists in South Asia in a candid interview : “ the Maoists in Nepal have waged a brave and successful struggle against the monarchy .
Right now , in India , the Maoists and the various Marxist - Leninist groups are leading the fight against immense injustice here .
They are fighting not just the State , but feudal landlords and their armed militias .
They are the only people who are making a dent .
And I admire that .
[… ] right now , it is important to acknowledge that they are bearing the brunt of being at the forefront of resistance .
Many of us are in a position where we are beginning to align ourselves on the side of those who we know have no place for us in their religious or ideological imagination . ”

Prarie Fire argues : “ If Prachanda ’s way is really a Trojan horse for an imperialist reorganization of Nepalese society under leftist rhetoric , then Marxism - Leninism - Maoism will be rendered worthless as an oppositional force for other reasons .
Imperialist finance capital ’s reorganization of the economy and political system of Nepal under a social reformist program and rhetoric may , in the short term , genuinely translate into concrete gains for the masses in Nepal .
Political power in the form of a corrupt , traditionalist system run by a God King is hardly the best option in terms of creating a stable , modern political climate to best expedite the transfer of value from Nepal to the imperialists .
An older comprador state is being replaced by a more modern one under a trojan horse , MLM . ”

The Phusion team keeps blazing ahead with Passenger and improving it rapidly .
They ’ve just released version 2.0.5 , which includes a few fixes and introduces compatibility with the Rack - based Edge Rails .
At 37signals , we ’ve already switched over Ta -da List and are busy working on getting the rest of our suite running on Passenger .
It ’s just so much easier to deal with and the memory savings you get through REE are a nice cherry on top .
I keep getting a steady stream of success reports from all over the world as well .
I ’ve even read of a few people getting back into Rails development because Passenger finally took out the inconvenience of deploying .
It ’s hard to argue with the usability .
I ’ve personally been setting up a new server running Ubuntu 8.10 and using Apache 2 with Passenger .
The time it took me to go from a fresh install to a complete production setup was ridiculously low .
There ’s just so much less to worry about .
If you have n’t given Passenger a chance yet , now is definitely the time .
Free Windows 7 Beta Download – 2.5 Million slots only
Microsoft has announced that Windows 7 beta will be available for download , January 9 .
Microsoft will only allow 25 Million downloads though .
For those who have TechNet and MSDN connections , you do n’t have to wait until tomorrow .
[ via CrunchGear ]
Since it ’s free , the Beta version will expire until August 1 , 2009 and it can only be installed over an existing Windows Vista installation .
The Windows 7 Beta will be available in English , German , Japanese , Arabic , and Hindi , and each language will be available in 32 - bit and 64 - bit versions ( except Hindi which will only be available in 32 - bit ) .
Because the Windows 7 Beta will be offered download - only , it will be provided to you as an ISO image ( an .iso file ) that you download .
After downloading either the 32 - bit or 64 - bit ISO image of the Windows 7 Beta , you will be required to burn the ISO image to a DVD to install Windows 7 .
So you want to be sure you have a DVD burner before spending the time downloading the ISO image .
[ via windowsteamblog ]
The download will be available via the Windows 7 page .
Update :
Due to an enormous surge in demand , the download experience was not ideal so we listened and took the necessary steps to ensure a good experience .
We have clearly heard that many of you want to check out the Windows 7 Beta and , as a result , we have decided remove the initial 2.5 million limit on the public beta for the next two weeks ( thru January 24th ) .
During that time you will have access to the beta even if the download number exceeds the 2.5 million unit limit .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- A U.S. Army Criminal Investigations Division investigator has recommended changing the official manner of death for a soldier electrocuted while showering at his base in Iraq from " accidental " to " negligent homicide , " according to an e-mail from the investigator obtained by CNN .
Ryan Maseth , a 24 - year - old Green Beret , died in a shower at his base in Iraq on January 2 , 2008 .
The investigator blames KBR , the largest U.S. contractor in Iraq , and two KBR supervisors for the incident , saying there is " credible information ... they failed to ensure that work was being done by qualified electricians and plumbers , and to inspect the work that was being conducted . "
The e-mail , written late last year , says the investigation report was being reviewed by CID headquarters for a legal opinion to determine probable cause before the case could be referred to the military court system or the Department of Justice for possible action .
No charges have been filed .
Sgt. Ryan Maseth 's manner of death has not officially been changed , CID spokesman Christopher Grey told CNN .
" It may change , but not at this time , " he said , adding that the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology would make that determination .
KBR spokeswoman Heather Browne told CNN the company " cannot comment on the report by an unidentified Army investigator because we have not seen the report . "
" KBR 's investigation has produced no evidence that KBR was responsible for Sgt. Maseth 's death , " Browne said .
" We have cooperated fully with all government agencies investigating this matter and will do so in the future . "
CNN first reported the death of Maseth , a highly decorated , 24 - year - old Green Beret , last spring .
His January 2 , 2008 , death was just one of many fatalities now believed to be linked to shoddy electrical work at U.S. bases managed by U.S. contractors , according to Pentagon sources .
The Pentagon 's Defense Contract Management Agency last year gave KBR a " Level III Corrective Action Request " -- issued only when a contractor is found in " serious non-compliance " and just one step below the possibility of suspending or terminating a contract , Pentagon officials said .
In KBR 's case , it means the contractor 's inspections and efforts to ensure electrical safety for troops have been unacceptable and must be significantly improved , Pentagon sources told CNN .
The CID investigator 's e-mail says work orders to address problems resulted in " fixes [ that ] were only temporary and not done to ensure no future problems would arise . "
The Pentagon and its contract agency have declined requests for an interview to answer questions about Maseth 's death or the other cases .
Just after Maseth 's electrocution , Pentagon officials estimated that about a dozen troops had been electrocuted in Iraq .
But Pentagon officials now say at least 18 troops have been electrocuted since 2003 -- many due to faulty wiring and improper grounding .
The number could be higher if deaths from Afghanistan are included , said congressional sources .
KBR 's contract in Iraq is vast and encompasses numerous responsibilities including the upkeep of U.S. bases and providing basic services on the bases .
The 18 electrocutions occurred in different places and under different circumstances .
At least two lawsuits have been filed against KBR , including one by Maseth 's family , and investigators are trying to determine precisely what role , if any , KBR played in the circumstances that led to those deaths .

Towards a Better Python
Guido recently answered some of his questions on the Google Moderator Site .
One of them was mine , on the future of the CPython VM :
" Do you see the current design of the CPython VM holding back Python the language - particularly in terms of adding a JIT , moving away from reference counting for garbage collection and the concurrency issues around the GIL ? "
Guido answered :
That 's a rather leading question .
I personally do n't think so , but this is actually a level of language implementation where I do n't know a whole lot , and have to defer to the compiler and VM experts .
If you believe CPython cannot be saved , I recommend that you start investing time in working with some of the alternative implementations , like PyPy , Jython or IronPython , in order to ensure that they will be of sufficient quality to take over if CPython ever finds it cannot keep up .
True enough it was a leading question .
CPython is great , and will be with us for a long time .
It is however also true that certain design decisions about the CPython implementation make it very difficult to experiment with alternative strategies .
This is one of the driving forces that led to the creation of PyPy .
As an interpreter translation toolchain it takes descriptions of interpreters written in a restricted ( static ) subset of Python called RPython and compiles them for a variety of backends and platforms ( C , . NET , JVM , LLVM etc ) .
Various aspects of the interpreters are ' pluggable ' , including the garbage collection .
One particularly contentious area of debate amongst and outside the Python community is the effect that the Global Interpreter Lock ( GIL ) has on using Python for concurrent programming .
Python does allow developers to use native threads , but the GIL ensures that only one of them is active at any one time .
Whilst IO and other blocking operations release the GIL , as can C extensions , it makes it impossible to use more than one core from pure Python code on multi-core hardware .
As CPUs get no faster in terms of raw clock speed , but add horse power by upping the number of cores , parallel programming is becoming ever more important .
One solution is using multiple processes instead of multiple threads .
A very powerful library that makes this easier , even having a compatible interface with the Python threading library , was recently added to the standard library : multiprocessing
This is undoubtedly a powerful and effective technique for concurrent programming , but there are plenty of problems for which it simply is n't suited .
Unfortunately some in the Python community simply refuse to believe this .
The net effect is that those who have , or believe they have , problems requiring a concurrent solution are less likely to turn to Python .
( Those who espouse Erlang style actors for concurrency would do well to realise that the Erlang VM uses multiple threads under the hood to actually run its lightweight processes .
Threads can be a powerful concurrency primitive even if we need better APIs for working with them . )
There have been various attempts to remove the GIL from Python before .
One of the advantages of the GIL is that it makes extension programming much simpler .
The latest attempt is basically successful .
Adam Olsen has created a set of patches to the CPython source code in a project called safe thread .
This implements the fine grained locking needed to replace the GIL .
Unfortunately the extra cost of this locking means that for single threaded code the patched interpreter runs ~ 30 % slower than CPython .
The up - side is that multi - threaded code can use multiple cores , and can run faster than standard CPython .
One of the reasons that so much fine grained locking is required is because reference counting is used for garbage collection .
Every time a reference to a Python object is created or removed its reference count is incremented or decremented .
When the reference count reaches 0 the object is disposed of .
This means that Python has deterministic object finalization ( except in the case of cycles where a generational cyclic garbage collector is used ) .
This manipulation of an object 's reference count must be thread safe - if changes were lost due to simultaneous updates then objects may never be garbage collected or collected too early .
Note Deterministic finalization means that a Python object with a __del__ method ( the finalizer ) will have it called immediately that the reference count reaches zero .
This is why it is a common pattern in Python to open files without explicitly closing them .
As soon as the file handle goes out of scope it will be closed .
The exception to this is cycles , which are collected by a separate generational GC .
Unfortunately , because this does n't know what order to break cycles in where there are explicit finalizers it does n't attempt to .
This means that cycles of objects with __del__ methods are n't collected in CPython ( and an app that has them will leak memory ) .
Soooo ... if Python no longer used reference counting for garbage collection then removing the GIL would be easier , right ?
A few days ago this email was sent to the Python developers mailing list :
Hi to all Python developers
For a student project in a course on virtual machines , we are evaluating the possibility to experiment with removing the GIL from CPython
We have read the arguments against doing this at http://www.python.org/doc/faq/library/#can-t-we-get-rid-of-the-global-interpreter-lock.
But we think it might be possible to do this with a different approach than what has been tried till now .
The main reason for the necessity of the GIL is reference counting .
We believe that most of the slowdown in the free threading implementation of Greg Stein was due to the need of atomic refcounting , as this mail seems to confirm : http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-ideas/2007-April/000414.html
So we want to change CPython into having a " real " garbage collector - removing all reference counting , and then the need for locks ( or atomic inc / dec ops ) should be highly alleviated .
Preferably the GC should be a high - performance one for instance a generational one .
We believe that it can run quite a lot faster than ref-counting .
Shared datastructures would get their lock obviously .
Immutable objects ( especially shared global objects , like True , False , Null ) would not .
[ some discussion of details snipped ...]
We know it is the plan for PyPy to work in this way , and also that Jython and Ironpython works like that ( using the host vm's GC ) , so it seems to be somehow agreeable with the python semantics ( perhaps not really with __del__ but they are not really nice anyway ) .
Was this ever tried for CPython ?
Any other comments , encouragements or warnings on the project - idea ?
Best regards : Paolo , Sigurd
Yet another wild - eyed attempt to remove the GIL by crackpots with an even - more - hare - brained - than - usual idea ?
The email was immediately followed by this one from Van Lindberg :
Just an FYI , these two particular students already introduced themselves on the PyPy list .
Paolo is a masters student with experience in the Linux kernel ; Sigurd is a PhD candidate .
Their professor is Lars Bak , the lead architect of the Google V8 Javascript engine .
They spent some time working on V8 in the last couple months .
Maybe not so hare - brained then .
We 'll have to wait and see .
Even if they succeed there are a few issues .
What about all of those extension that both assume and require the presence of the GIL ( or even reference counting itself ) ?
There are possible ways round this .
For Ironclad , an implementation of the Python C API in C# to allow you to use Python C extensions from IronPython , we take a hybrid approach to garbage collection .
We hold a strong reference to objects created by extensions ( preventing .NET from garbage collecting them ) and allow the extension to manipulate the reference count in the usual way .
Periodically we scan our " managed objects " to see if there are objects whose reference count has dropped to zero ( well - one actually ) and we then delete our strong reference - allowing garbage collection to happen normally ( including calling back into unmanaged finalizers to free memory and clean up resources ) .
We have also implemented a GIL for the C extensions even though IronPython has no GIL .
It would be possible to have an external API for existing extensions that implements the semantics of both the Global Interpreter Lock and reference counting whilst having a new API for new extensions that are happy with the more advanced capabilities of a turbo - charged Python .
In the discussion thread that followed in the wake of Paolo and Sigurd 's email Maciej outlined some of the implications of losing deterministic finalisation :
PyPy has a semi- advanced generational moving gc these days .
It 's not as well tuned as JVMs one , but it works quite well .
Regarding semantic changes , there is a couple which as far as I remember are details which you should not rely on anyway ( At least some of the below applies also for Jython / IronPython ) : __del__ methods are not called immediately when object is not in a cycle
methods are not called immediately when object is not in a cycle all objects are collected , which means objects in cycles are broken in arbitrary order ( gc.garbage is always empty ) , but normal ordering is preserved .
is always empty ) , but normal ordering is preserved .
id 's do n't always resemble address of object in memory
resurrected objects have __del__ called only once in total .
The last point is interesting .
If an object is resurrected during finalization ( it creates a new strong reference to itself inside its __del__ method ) I would expect __del__ to be called again when it enters finalization again .
I think this is how the .NET garbage collector behaves anyway .
Of course if you really need true - concurrency ' in - process ' today and you still want to program in Python you can turn to an alternative implementation like Jython or IronPython , neither of which have a GIL .
The challenge faced by implementers of Python is that , because CPython acts as a reference implementation rather than there being a concrete specification , is knowing which parts of Python are specified by the reference implementation and which parts are merely implementation details .
The Python documentation does specifically note some aspects of Python 's behaviour as being not guaranteed and dependent on the implementation .
Other aspects are n't so clear .
Would n't it be good if the Python test suite ( which is ropey but a lot better than test suites for many other language implementations ) clearly separated out the implementation dependent aspects ?
Well , Armin Rigo ( one of the core PyPy developers ) has started doing exactly that .
This is from another email to the Python developer mailing list :
Here is a first step towards classifying the Python test suite into " real language tests " and " implementation details " :
http://bugs.python.org/issue4242
If the general approach seems acceptable to people , I would be willing to port more of PyPy 's test suite patches .
The net result would be to move the test suite towards being more directly useful for alternate Python implementations .
( Right now , all of them have some custom tests plus their own similarly patched copy of the stdlib test suite . )
Note that the patch above is against 2.7 trunk ; the 2.x line is what all non-CPython implementations currently target .
The general idea ( and to a large extend the patches ) can easily be forward - ported to 3.x when it makes sense .
Also , the actual decision of what is a " real " or a " detail " test is of course up to discussion .
The patch above does the classification for test_descr .
It was obtained by running it with PyPy , and for each failure either fixing PyPy , or argumenting ( by adding a comment ) the reason for which it is a detail -- usually referring to " well - known agreement " expressed on python - dev about the matter .
( Of course , " detail " tests still run normally on top of CPython . )
I have n't looked through what he is done , but I expect to have some ' issues ' with the classification .
The PyPy developers ( well - Maciej Fijalwotsit anyway ) believe that Python stack frames are part of the core language specification .
IronPython does n't have Python stack frames ( for performance reasons ) as Jim Hugunin believed that they were merely an facet of the CPython implementation .
Now if only I could find that email where Guido explicitly agrees with this ...
More Changes to Mock : Mocking Magic Methods
I recently released Mock 0.4.0 , my test support library for mocking objects and monkeypatching .
It 's been gratifying and surprising to get so many emails from people using it .
I originally wrote Mock to simplify some of the testing patterns we use at Resolver Systems , and we use a forked version there .
Mock has greatly improved the readability of our tests whilst reducing the number of lines of code needed .
Some improvements made at Resolver Systems ( like assert_called _with and the single argument form of patch ) have fed back into the public version .
The obvious lack in Mock as it stands at 0.4.0 is its inability to mock magic methods .
This means that you can't use it to mock out any of the built - in container classes , or classes that implement protocol methods like __getitem__ and __setitem__ .
The main reason that it did n't support them was the lack of a clear and obvious way to do it .
At Resolver Systems we 've bolted on support for a few of the magic methods as we 've needed them ; unfortunately in an ad-hoc and inconsistent manner .
My requirements for protocol support in Mock ( which I think I 've now met ) were :
A clean , simple and consistent API
Being able to meet most use cases without having to meet all of them
Not unconditionally adding a large number of new attributes to mock objects
Mocks should n't support all the protocol methods by default as this can break duck - typing
It must n't place any additional burden on developers not using them
The solution I 've now come up with is implemented in the SVN repository , and will become Mock 0.5.0 .
So far it is only capable of mocking containers and I 'd like feedback as to whether this is going to meet people 's use cases .
If you are interested in this , please try the latest version and let me know what you think :
Documentation for the new features is not done , but it is all tested so you can check ' mocktest.py ' and ' patchtest.py ' for examples of how they work .
The implementation uses a new class factory called MakeMock .
This takes a list of strings specifying the magic methods ( without the double underscores for brevity ! ) you want your mock objects to have - it returns a subclass of Mock that only has the magic methods you asked for .
For the container methods , the Mock class takes a keyword argument items that can either be a dictionary or a sequence .
This is stored as the _items attribute ( that only exists on mocks with container methods ) , defaulting to an empty dictionary , and can be any mapping or sequence object .
The container methods delegate to this , and all calls are recorded normally in method_calls .
>> > from mock import MakeMock
>> > MagicMock = MakeMock ( ' getitem setitem ' . split ( ) )
>> > mock = MagicMock ( items = { ' a ' : 1 , ' b ' : 2 } )
>> > mock [ ' a ' ]
1
>> > mock .
method_calls
[ ( ' __getitem__ ' , ( ' a ' , ) , { } ) ]
>> > mock [ ' c' ] = 10
>> > mock .
_items
{ 'a ' : 1 , ' c ' : 10 , ' b ' : 2 }
There is an additional bit of magic .
When you instantiate a mock object normally ( using Mock ( ... ) ) , you can use the ' magics ' or ' spec ' keyword arguments to actually get back an instance with magic methods support .
The spec keyword argument takes a class that you want your Mock to imitate , and accessing methods not on the actual class will raise an AttributeError .
When you instantiate a mock object with a spec keyword argument , the constructor will check if the spec class has any supported magic methods ; if it does you will actually get an instance of a mock that has these magic methods .
The magics keyword argument is new , and lets you specify which magic methods you want :
>> > from mock import Mock
>> > mock = Mock ( magics = ' getitem contains ' )
>> > ' hi ' in mock
False
>> > mock [ ' hi' ] = ' world '
Traceback ( most recent call last ) :
. . .
TypeError : ' MagicMock ' object does not support item assignment
>> > mock .
_items [ ' hi' ] = ' world '
>> > ' hi ' in mock
True
>> > type ( mock )
< class ' mock.MagicMock ' >
>> > mock .
method_calls
[ ( ' __contains__ ' , ( 'hi ' , ) , { } ) , ( ' __contains__ ' , ( 'hi ' , ) , { } ) ]
Note that the magics keyword takes a string and does the split for you .
As I implement more magic methods I 'll provide shortcuts for obtaining instances / classes that have all the container methods , or all the numeric methods , or just everything .
The patch decorator also now take spec and magics keyword argument , but that 's not as useful as it sounds .
You will usually be using patch to mock out a class , so you 'll still need to set the return value to be a mock instance with the methods you want .
For comparison methods I 'll allow you to provide a ' value ' object that all comparisons delegate to .
This can also be used for hashing , in - place , right hand side and unary operations .
That does n't leave much left to cover ( descriptors and context management protocol methods - but I 'm not sure how much demand there will be for mocking these . )
Protocol methods supported currently are :
__getitem__
__setitem__
__delitem__
__iter__
__len__
__contains__
__nonzero__
The list of changes that are currently in Mock 0.5.0 :
Mock has a new ' magics ' keyword arguments - a list ( or string separated by whitespace ) of magic methods that the Mock instance should provide ( only container methods available so far ) .
Mock has an ' items ' keyword argument for mocks implementing container methods .
The methods keyword argument to Mock has been removed and merged with spec .
The spec argument can now be a list of methods or an object to take the spec from .
patch and patch_object now take magics and spec keyword arguments
TODO : verify - Nested patches may now be applied in a different order ( created mocks passed in the opposite order ) .
This is actually a bugfix .
MakeMock is a Mock class factory .
It takes a list of magic methods and creates a MagicMock class ( Mock subclass ) with the magic methods you specified .
Currently only container methods are available .
Instantiating a Mock with magics / spec will actually create a MagicMock with magic methods from the method / spec list .
There are still a few things left to do ( apart from implementing support for all the other magic methods ) and some open questions :
Should MakeMock accept a string argument ( and do the split for you ) ?
How should reset affect ' _items ' ?
It should probably take a copy of the items at instantiation and restore it when reset .
Should a failed indexing attempt still be added to ' method_calls ' ?
( Currently not - it just raises the usual exception . )
Should attributes ( children ) on mocks created from MakeMock be plain ' Mock ' or from the same class as their parent ?
( currently they are plain mocks )
Parent method calls if magic methods called on a child ?
( not currently possible as all children will be mocks rather than magic mocks )
The first two of these I will probably decide one way or the other before a 0.5.0 release .
The others I may just leave for a while and see how it gets used .
Python : Values and References
An important step for anyone learning Python is understanding that instead of variables with values Python has names referring to objects ( often described as names bound to objects ) .
This is slightly different to other languages , but only slightly .
Most modern languages ( like Java and C# ) have a concept of variables as references to objects - but they also have variables that hold values directly .
There was a long discussion recently on the Python newsgroup as to whether Python uses " call by reference " or " call by value " .
The discussion was mainly an attempt to persuade one individual that call by value is n't a sensible description of the way that Python passes parameters into function / method calls .
Despite the apparent pointlessness of the topic , a lot of interesting matters were discussed along the way .
Wikipedia defines Call by Value as :
In call - by - value , the argument expression is evaluated , and the resulting value is bound to the corresponding variable in the function ( frequently by copying the value into a new memory region ) .
If the function or procedure is able to assign values to its parameters , only the local copy is assigned - that is , anything passed into a function call is unchanged in the caller 's scope when the function returns .
As you can see , this only partly applies to Python .
Local assignments inside a function do n't affect the calling scope , but values are n't ' copied ' into a function call and changes to mutable objects are seen by the caller .
Wikipedia ( same page ) defines call by reference as :
In call - by - reference evaluation , a function receives an implicit reference to the argument , rather than a copy of its value .
This means that the function can modify the argument , what will be seen by its caller .
This seems to fit Python very well , but it is often taken to mean that assignments to parameters passed in by reference will also affect the calling scope .
Although in Python mutable objects can be modified inside a function / method call - and those changes will be seen by the caller - rebinding the name to a new object will not affect the calling scope .
( Except variables explicitly declared as global , or in Python 3 where you use the nonlocal keyword ) .
A more common understanding of these terms is that in call by value values are copied when passed as parameters , whereas in call by reference a pointer ( reference ) to the object is passed .
By these definitions Python is clearly call by reference and this definition also matches the distinction that languages like C# make between value types and reference types ( I 've not programmed in Java , but my understanding is that it makes the same distinction ) .
In C# , value types ( all numeric types , structs , enumerations etc ) actually live on the stack , whereas reference types ( strings , instances of classes etc ) live on the heap and have a pointer on the stack .
It is complicated by the fact that .NET perpetuates the myth that the primitives ( the value types ) inherit from System .
Object ( a reference type ) .
The runtime does auto - boxing for you where this matters .
This means that when you pass a value type into a method the value is copied .
Structs can be arbitrarily big , so this can be a performance problem .
It is often a performance win for working with the numeric types as you remove a level of indirection .
It is n't without problems though - and some of these can be seen if you develop with IronPython .
System .
Drawing .
Point is a struct ( a value type ) , but it is also mutable ( despite the fact that mutable value types are against the .NET design guidelines ) .
Because it is a value type , when you access it you are often accessing a copy - and if you mutate a copy then your changes can be lost .
The following code illustrates the problem :
>> > r = Rectangle ( 0 , 100 , 20 , 40 )
>> > r . Location . X
0
>> > r . Location .
X = 20
>> > r . Location . X
0
Because r.Location returns a value type ( r.Location is a Point ) , the update to it is lost .
This happens in C# as well as in IronPython , but it is more unexpected in Python because all objects are expected to behave like reference types .
In .NET you can specify that a parameter to a method takes a reference ( ' out ' in C# or ByRef in VB.NET ) .
If you pass in a value type as a reference parameter then the .NET runtime will do boxing / unboxing for you .
This means that we can write code like the following :
int x = 3 ; SomeMethod ( out x ) ;
x can now be mutated by ' SomeMethod ' and have a different value after the method call .
In a ' way ' immutable Python types behave a bit like .NET value types , and mutable types like reference types .
This analogy breaks down when we push it though .
As a final note , Aaron Brady and others point out that much better descriptions for the Python calling convention is " call by object " or " call by sharing " :
From Barbara Liskov 's paper , 1992 : " ... arguments are passed " by object " ; the ( pointer to the ) object resulting from evaluating the actual argument expression is assigned to the formal . "
However a Google search for " call by object " , in quotes , returns mostly Python - related links .
The search for call by sharing was more successful : " Call by Sharing
The caller and called routine communicate only through the argument and result objects ; routines do not have access to any variables of the caller .... if a routine assigns an object to a formal argument variable , there is no effect on the caller . "
Obscure Magic Methods and Pickle Support
One of the appendices for IronPython in Action is a guide to the Python magic methods .
Note Python magic methods are the methods that implement protocols in Python .
They all ( except for the next method on iterators in Python 2.X ) start and end with double underscores .
They are called magic methods because although you explicitly implement them you do n't usually call them directly , instead the interpreter calls them for you .
For example the object creation methods __init__ and __new__ are called at object instantiation .
I have n't covered a couple of the deprecated magic methods ( __coerce__ anyone ? ) , but I think that I 've covered all the others ( including descriptor methods and the new context manager protocol methods - it was fun brushing up on these ) .
Along the way I discovered a few new magic methods that I 'd not encountered before :
__length_hint__( self )
Iterators can implement this as an optimization so that Python can pre-allocate space for them .
The Python tests say that it is explicitly undocumented so you probably wo n't be implementing this yourself , but if you see it method now you know what it is for .
__reversed__( self )
Containers may implement this method to provide an ' optimized reverse iterator ' for instances .
If this method is available it is called by the built - in function reversed .
( Very useful if you implement iteration as a generator - otherwise reversed has to consume the whole generator in order to be able to reverse it . )
__missing__( self , key ) New in Python 2.5 .
This method is called on subclasses of the built - in dictionary ( ' dict ' ) type when a key that does n't exist is requested .
This method is useful for providing default values .
For example : class ListDict ( dict ) :
def __missing__ ( self , key ) :
self [ key ] = [ ]
return self [ key ]
thing = ListDict ( )
thing [ key ] . append ( value )
It is there to support defaultdict , where it is documented .
There are two magic methods not used by the Python interpreter , but used by the pickle module for serialization : __setstate__ and __reduce__ .
UPDATE : They 're documented obliquely here
Pickle can handle most , but not all , pure Python objects .
For some reason ConfigObj instances are one of the object types it can't handle .
( In my experimentation pickle could handle subclasses of dictionaries that also had attributes and I could n't get a minimal sample of an object that pickle could n't handle - ConfigObj can be pretty deeply nested objects though . )
The examples show how these methods for handling serializing objects with open file handles and sockets ( not the case with ConfigObj ) .
Nicola Larosa and I did n't want to have to maintain pickle support in ConfigObj as it is a persistence mechanism itself and we could n't see a use case for serializing them .
Unfortunately libraries like Parallel Python that provided shared access between process use serialization .
Thankfully Christian Heimes providing some code that does the job .
It implements __reduce__ ( along with a function called __newobj__ ) for persisting state and an inverse function called __setstate__ for restoring it :
def __newobj__ ( cls , * args ) :
return cls .
__new__ ( cls , * args )
class SomeClass ( dict ) :
def __setstate__ ( self , state ) :
dict .
update ( self , state [ 0 ] )
self .
__dict__ . update ( state [ 1 ] )
def __reduce__ ( self ) :
state = ( dict ( self ) , self .
__dict__ )
return ( __newobj__ , ( self .
__class__ , ) , state )
You can see that the __reduce__ implementation stores all the values in the dictionary plus attributes stored in __dict__ in the state object .
__setstate__ takes a state object and does the restore .
The pickle module source code has notes that are n't in the docs :
A __reduce__ implementation can direct protocol 2 to use the more efficient NEWOBJ opcode , while still allowing protocol 0 and 1 to work normally .
For this to work , the function returned by __reduce__ should be called __newobj__ , and its first argument should be a new - style class .
The implementation for __newobj__ should be as follows , although pickle has no way to verify this :
def __newobj__(cls , * args ) : return cls.__new__(cls , * args )
Protocols 0 and 1 will pickle a reference to __newobj__ , while protocol 2 ( and above ) will pickle a reference to cls , the remaining args tuple , and the NEWOBJ code , which calls cls.__new__(cls , * args ) at unpickling time ( see load_newobj below ) .
If __reduce__ returns a three - tuple , the state from the third tuple item will be pickled regardless of the protocol , calling __setstate__ at unpickling time ( see load_build below ) .
Note that no standard __newobj__ implementation exists ; you have to provide your own .
This is to enforce compatibility with Python 2.2 ( pickles written using protocol 0 or 1 in Python 2.3 should be unpicklable by Python 2.2 ) .
Vista UAC and Registry Fun
A few days ago I was trying to create a Windows MSI installer that set a registry entry computed at install time .
Naturally , in order to minimise intrusion and permissions difficulties , I decided to use HKEY_CURRENT_USER ( the per user registry hive ) rather than HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE ( the machine wide hive that needs admin privileges to write to ) .
I was using Wix to build the msi .
Wix involves plenty of XML joy to use , but once you have it setup ( with most of the XML generated from Python scripts ) then it is n't too bad .
You can embed an executable to be run at install time as a CustomAction , which is ideal for something needing to be computed at install time .
The magic in your wxs template to create and execute a custom action looks something like :
< Binary Id=" MyExecutable " SourceFile= " MyExecutable.exe " /> < CustomAction Id =" MyExecutable " BinaryKey = " MyExecutable " ExeCommand = " command line arguments " Return = " ignore " HideTarget= " yes " Impersonate = " yes " /> < InstallExecuteSequence > < Custom Action= " MyExecutable " /> </InstallExecuteSequence >
You can use a scripting engine , with either VB or JScript , instead of embedding an executable .
Everything on the intarwebz I read suggested that this was a bad idea .
Many anti-virus programs decide that scripts inside an installer are dangerous and disable them ( whilst running an executable is somehow fine ) , plus it depends on the user not having a broken scripting engine on their machine .
For this to work straightforwardly you need the Impersonate = " yes " line in the CustomAction element .
Installers do n't run as the user who launched the installer - but as some magic user called ' Local System ' instead .
Impersonate makes the executable run as the user .
All is fine if the user running the installer has admin privileges .
Installing anything into C : \Program Files requires admin privileges , so if the user has UAC switched on ( Vista only ) then it will warn them - and then install fine , writing the registry entry correctly .
If they do n't have admin privileges , but work in ( say ) a corporate environment , then the install will require an administrator to come and enter admin credentials .
( Unless they run not as an admin user but with UAC off - in which case they are stuffed .
Vista wo n't prompt and wo n't install . )
When the administrator enters their credentials then instead of temporarily elevating their permissions for the install ( which Windows is well capable of ) - instead it switches the installer to run as the admin user instead .
As a consequence the registry entry is set for the admin user and not for the user who launched the installer in the first place .
As far as I can tell there is no way round this , and the only reliable thing to do is to write a machine wide registry entry instead .
sigh
To ensure that this works you need to tell Wix that your embedded executable requires elevated privileges .
You do this by setting Impersonate = " no " along with Execute = " deferred " ( do n't ask me why ) .
This makes the Custom Action entry in the wxs XML look like this :
< Binary Id=" MyExecutable " SourceFile= " MyExecutable.exe " /> < CustomAction Id =" MyExecutable " BinaryKey = " MyExecutable " ExeCommand = " command line arguments " Return = " ignore " HideTarget= " yes " Impersonate = " no " Execute = " deferred " /> < InstallExecuteSequence > < Custom Action= " MyExecutable " Before = " InstallFinalize " /> </InstallExecuteSequence >
This works reliably , but if anyone has any better techniques for achieving the same goal then I would be glad to hear them .

BMW has finally unveiled the long - awaited 2009 Z4 hardtop roadster .
At a quick glance , the new look seems to be derived from the sleek design of the current Z4 and 6 series , with meaner but classier touch .
The 2009 Z4 buyers will now have the option to add “ BMW Search Powered By Google Maps ” to their BMW Assist and Navigation system - equipped vehicles .
This means drivers can use Google Maps directly from their navigator to search for addresses and phone numbers .
The roadster comes with four different trim levels – sDrive 30 i Manual , sDrive 30 i Auto , sDrive 35 i Manual , and sDrive 35 i Auto .
From the spec sheet alone , the only noticable difference between the Manual and Auto is in the transmission ( one with six - speed manual and the latter six - speed auto ) .
The 30i engine outputs 255 hp at 6600 RPM and 220 ft-lbs of torque at 2600 RPM .
If that ’s still not enough , the 35 i will give you 45 more in horsepower ( 300 hp ) at 5800 RPM and 80 more in torque ( 300 ft- lbs ) at 1400 RPM .

At this week 's Macworld Expo , Apple announced that by April , music from the iTunes Store will no longer be shackled by digital rights management ( DRM ) .
Finally , DRM is good and fully dead for digital music -- gone from CDs , gone from downloads , and largely dead for streaming .
Apple 's announcement comes nearly a year after Amazon.com 's DRM - free MP3 deals went live , demonstrating that the record labels were holding the DRM card until they could wring business concessions from Apple ( in the form of variable pricing ) .
This just underscores that DRM is not really about stopping piracy , but rather about leverage over authorized distributors .
In fact , an inventory of Apple 's remaining DRM armory makes it vividly clear that DRM ( backed by the DMCA ) is almost always about eliminating legitimate competition , hobbling interoperability , and creating de facto technology monopolies :
The majority of these DRM efforts do not have even an arguable relation to " piracy . "
And even where things like movies and audiobooks are concerned , DRM is not only futile , but will likely be counter - productive , making the " legitimate " alternative less attractive than the Darknet options .
This week 's announcement is another step in the meltdown of DRM for music .
But it is also a stark reminder that Apple remains at the forefront of employing DRM to shove competitors to the fringes and wrest control out of the hands of users .
The first Earthrise to be witnessed by a human
Forty years ago , the biggest TV audience in history tuned in to watch humankind 's first close encounter with another world , as the crew of Apollo 8 reached lunar orbit .
Here , the Apollo historian and film - maker Dr Christopher Riley gives his perspective on the mission and how that Christmas Eve of 1968 changed the world .
Back in 1948 , the British astrophysicist Sir Fred Hoyle predicted that when spaceflight enabled us to see the whole Earth from space , the view would change us forever .
Hoyle would have to wait another 20 years before humans would get to see this view with their own eyes , when the crew of Apollo 8 became the first astronauts to leave Earth orbit .
By then , a handful of satellites had snapped a number of breathtaking portraits of the Earth from afar and even a stunning shot of the Earth rising above the Moon 's surface from lunar orbit .
Oh , my God !
Look at that picture over there !
Is n't that something
Apollo 8 crew member But on Christmas Eve 1968 , none of the astronauts on board Apollo 8 were ready for the opportunity to witness their own Earthrise .
In all the months of training and preparation which had preceded the mission , no - one had thought to schedule an attempt for the crew to glimpse and record the most moving of sights , as their jewel of a home planet , suspended in the blackness of space , rose from behind the barren lunar horizon .
The blue marvel
For the first three orbits , preoccupied by the Moon and their latest TV broadcast , the spacecraft was not orientated to give them a chance to see the Earth .
But as Apollo 8 nosed its way back from the far side of the Moon for the fourth time , one of the crew spotted the view by chance from a window , his reaction captured by the on board tape recorder .
" Oh , my God !
Look at that picture over there ! " he exclaimed .
" Is n't that something " The stills were taken orbiting the Moon 's equator , with north at the top
After a quick joke about the fact that it was not in their flight plan to photograph it , the crew abandoned protocol and scrambled to get a snap of the occasion with their stills camera .
The Hasselblad only had a black and white film magazine in , resulting in the image above - the first photograph of Earthrise taken by a human as he watched it happen .
But this first historic picture is rarely reproduced .
Not content with this first monochromatic image , the astronauts rushed to find a colour film , and Bill Anders managed to snap two more frames which became the choice of photo editors for the rest of history .
Quite who spotted the view and took the first black and white Earthrise image is the subject of debate among historians .
Some say it was Bill Anders ( and claim the flight recording proves it ) ; others have pointed to Frank Borman as the man behind the camera .
Nasa is planning to eventually post the recording on its Apollo 8 Flight Journal website , so you can decide for yourself .
Mystery film Perhaps more surprising than the unexpected nature of this historic photo - op is that during the rest of the mission , whilst the crew did spend time photographing and commenting on views of the Earth , they did not think to film an Earthrise on their 16 mm movie cameras .
These Data Acquisition Cameras , as they were called , were carried to record technical mission moments .
The Apollo 8 crew would use them to film each other messing about during quiet moments ; so they were n't averse to deviating from their flight plan .
But it seems that they were too busy with their other scheduled tasks that Christmas Eve to film mankind 's first Earthrise .

The profound juxtaposition of such a vibrant , vulnerable , living blue and white marble of a planet rising from the stark grey lunar landscape was not captured on moving film until the Apollo 10 and 11 crews filmed it the following year .
By the fourth expedition to lunar orbit on Apollo 12 , filming the Earth rising from behind the Moon had lost its magic and was only captured once through a slightly fogged window .
It was the last Earthrise ever filmed during the Apollo era .
Green rise
These images , along with hundreds of other still pictures taken of the whole Earth during Apollo 's nine flights to the Moon , helped to drive the momentum of a burgeoning green movement during the 1970s .
They fuelled an awareness of the vulnerability of the Earth which still resonates with us today and shapes our behaviour , as Fred Hoyle predicted it would .
These images helped to drive the momentum of a burgeoning green movement during the 1970s
Only 24 human beings have ever laid eyes on a view of the whole Earth from space .
But thanks to a new generation of missions carrying high - resolution cameras beyond Earth orbit , moving HD footage of the whole planet is now available for all of us to marvel at .
In 2007 , the Japanese lunar mission Selene transmitted back the first movies of Earthrise from lunar orbit since Apollo .
Even more ambitious , a Nasa project called The Deep Space Climate Observatory ( DSCOVR ) was conceived at the end of the 20th Century .
Its mission was to stream a continuous live colour image of the Earth from a million miles out in space .
The data from DSCOVR was designed to help with modelling climate change .
The first picture of the whole Earth , taken by Lunar Orbiter V Al Gore , who had supported the project from its conception , also suggested that such live footage of the whole Earth broadcast continuously over the internet would provide a powerful modern reminder of the fragility of our home planet - in the way that those first hand snapped Apollo pictures had done all those decades earlier .
" Goresat " as it was dubbed was never launched under the Bush presidency .
Some suggest that DSCOVR would not have helped the cause of an administration committed to a path of oil dependency .
Today , the satellite still rests in storage at Nasa 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland awaiting a more enlightened presidency to give it a green light .
Perhaps , under a new administration , and to mark the 40th anniversary of humankind 's first vision of the Earth from space , that time has now come .

Billy Powell Dead , Lynyrd Skynyrd Keyboardist ( Photos , Video )
Billy Powell 1952-2009
Inducted Into Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame March 13 , 2006
On January 28 , 2009 , 56 , died at his condo in Orange Park , Florida .
Orange Park Police Lt.said that Powell called 911 just before 1 a.m. complaining of difficulty breathing .
Paramedics found him unresponsive in his bedroom still holding the phone .
They performed CPR but he was pronounced dead at 1:52 a.m .
Powell reportedly missed a Tuesday appointment with his doctor for a cardiac evaluation .
A heart attack is suspected .
An autopsy will not be performed , according to Cornett .
The Lynyrd Skynyrd website published the following statement : " A Great Loss - Beloved Pianist for the Lynyrd Skynyrd Band , Billy Powell , passed away last night .
We will post more info shortly .
The family and band request your respect and understanding during this difficult time .
Thank you . "
Powell joined Skynyrd in 1973 and survived the 1977 plane crash that took the lives of band members Ronnie Van Zant , Steve Gaines , Cassie Gaines and several crew members .
He left the group that same year and hooked up with the Christian rock band Vision .
He rejoined Skynyrd in 1989 and remained a member until his death .
Kid Rock inducted the band into the Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame in March 13 , 2006 .
His son , Brandon Powell is a guitarist in the Jacksonville based rock band Syntenic .

Have you seen Mike Huckabee 's weekly show on Fox yet ?
If you have n't , you need n't bother ; it 's mostly a painful exercise in talk - show amateurism .
It has the feel of a local - studio talk show minus the clown used - car salesman .
Last night we instead got the clown wingnut , Ann Coulter .
It actually was a highly amusing exchange , in large part because Coulter had said so many cruel things about Huckabee during the campaign and he replayed several of them .
It was worth it just to see Coulter squirm at having her phoniness on such brilliant display .
In particular it was worth it to see a conservative finally notice that Coulter has a problem with keeping her facts straight .
In truth , this is something that other people have noticed before .
Unfortunately , the extent of Huckabee 's awareness of Coulter 's afactuality reached only to her reportage on him ; otherwise , he thoroughly commended her new book as a fine piece of research , even though it too is so error - riddled that it would be an embarrassment to anyone besides a peroxidized right - wing hustler .
But there was also a revealing exchange midway through it all that made clear that Huckabee was actually trying desperately to earn Coulter 's approval :
Huckabee :
But let me mention a couple of the --
You said that I am against school choice .
I am not .
You said I was bad on immigration , and yet it was Jim Gilchrist of the Minutemen who endorsed me and traveled with me .
Coulter :
You did say that you think illegal immigration is our chance to make up for slavery in America .
Huckabee : Not illegal immigration .
I did not say that .
What I said was that the manner in which we treat people is a way in which we can show our civility and a compassion in a way that we did not show -- Coulter :
And I think you wanted in - state tuition for illegals .
Huckabee : No , here 's what I wanted .
I wanted for kids in my state who have met -- Coulter : [ Giggles ]
Are you running again ?
Because you 're clarifying a lot of points for me .
Huckabee :
Well , I want to clarify , because -- here 's the deal .
If I ever do run again , I want , Ann -- Coulter :
You 'll run more as a conservative .
Huckabee : No , I 'll run as I am , which is a conservative , because that 's what I 've always been .
But I want to make sure that the next time you write about me , we get all this stuff straight .
Coulter : Ye - e - e - e-s , well , a little more conservative and you would 've had my vote .
Of course .
Because the essence of being a right - wing politician these days is to earn the Blessing of the Brownshirt Barbie .
One can't expect to win as a Republican , evidently , unless you pass the Ann Coulter Wingnut Ideological Purity Examination ( which indeed has a family resemblance to a colonoscopy ) .
But notice the issues she 's making him scramble to curry her favor on -- especially immigration .
Huckabee even touts his endorsement by Jim Gilchrist of the Minutemen -- who has since then been largely exposed as a scam artist -- as evidence of his tough stance on illegal immigration .
Indeed , I think we can count on a hard nativist - style stance on immigration to be one of the signature positions of the brand of conservatism that will emerge from the ashes of 2008 .
We keep hearing conservatives tell themselves that the reason they lost last year was that they were n't " true to conservative values , " and this will be one of the issues that they will use to define " true conservatives " ( as Coulter does here ) .
We can only say : Please .
Make our day .
Far be it from us to stop you , O denizens of wingnuttia .
Authorities ' tumble ' pot smuggling ring said responsible for over 900 tons Agence France - Presse
Published : Tuesday December 23 , 2008
Print This Email This Seized in the raid : 25,600 pounds of marijuana , one kilogram of coke , $ 769,000
LOS ANGELES ( AFP )  Authorities in Arizona declared victory on Tuesday against a sophisticated US - Mexican smuggling ring believed to have smuggled more than 900 tonnes of marijuana into the United States .
Thirty - nine people were arrested on felony charges and nearly 60 indicted as part of a year - long investigation into the activities of the Garibaldi - Lopez syndicate known as " Operation Tumbleweed . "
The operation , conducted by multiple law enforcement agencies , led to the seizure of 25,600 pounds of marijuana , one kilogram of cocaine , 769,000 dollars cash , and dozens of vehicles and firearms .
Arizona Attorney General Terry Goddard said in a statement the gang was believed to have smuggled up to 400,000 pounds of marijuana into the United States from Mexico annually since 2003 , a total haul worth one billion dollars .
" Operation Tumbleweed is an historic achievement in the fight against violent border smuggling syndicates , " Goddard said .
" Trafficking across our southern border is the organized crime threat of the 21st century . "
Authorities described the smuggling ring 's operations as highly methodical .
Drivers of trucks carrying drugs were fitted with night vision goggles to allow them to travel in the dark through remote desert regions of the border while load vehicles also carried tarpaulins able to camouflage the vehicles from aerial border patrols .
The organization also used teams of spotters deployed in high terrain near drug routes able to scan for law enforcement and advise drug loads when it was safe to move , the statement said .
Stewart : How MSNBC can take ' mouthpiece ' reins from Fox David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday December 2 , 2008

One result of an Obama presidency is that Fox News will no longer be able to maintain its accustomed role as administration mouthpiece , and The Daily Show 's Jon Stewart wondered on Monday what it might do instead .
He found the answer in a montage used by Fox to urge its viewers , " As your world changes , stay with Fox . "
Stewart summarized the flow of alarming images in the spot by saying , " We will protect you from raging fire , Iranian nutjobs , angry gay - lovers and the Jew whispering to the black man .
Think of us as cable tv 's panic room ! "
Stewart also raised the question of which network could replace Fox in the mouthpiece role , and the obvious answer was MSNBC .
However , Stewart cautioned the MSNBC bosses , " If you want to be the new administration 's news source of choice , you 're going to need foot soldiers . "
Stewart 's first example was Fox 's Bill O'Reilly .
" You 're going to need a freakishly over - sized ruddy - faced Irish multi-millionaire , still clinging to his blue - collar roots , " Stewart explained , " and it helps if he 's quick to anger . "
Stewart handily matched that job description with footage of MSNBC's Chris Matthews berating a conservative radio talk show host .
" But MSNBC , " continued Stewart , " what do you have in a partisan ideologue who fears for the world if it's in any way touched by the hands of his political enemies ? "
To answer that , he juxtaposed clips of Fox 's Sean Hannity telling Karl Rove , " This is a clear and present danger to the United States , " with MSNBC's Keith Olbermann declaiming about something being " a clear and present danger to the peace of this nation . "
" He 's perfect ! " squealed Stewart .
" I 'll take two ! "
" All right , MSNBC , you really want to do this ? "
Stewart continued .
" You 're going to need a token from the other side of the aisle . "
Stewart then drew a not -very - close comparison between Sean Hannity 's former sidekick and token liberal Alan Colmes and MSNBC 's conservative host Joe Scarborough .
" You gave him his own show ? " Stewart exclaimed .
" He 's supposed to be a token , you idiots ! "
But even Stewart had trouble finding any Fox equivalent to MSNBC's " complex , eloquent , even - tempered " Rachel Maddow .
After flipping through images of a couple of Fox 's blond female hosts , he finally settled on Steve Doocy , commenting , " There 's my girl ! "

1.1 : Chris Taylor Gets Some ! pen Source may be all the rage these days , with the righteous and elite deep into the Linux scene , but there was a time when just giving away an executable �never mind the source �was considered a gutsy move .
Where Linux has its Torvalds , its founding father , shareware has a Knopf .
In a , " whose surname is less appealing ? " contest , it would be close .
But Jim Knopf , in a calculated move , decided to change his .
It might be a shock , if you �re used to thinking of shareware as subversive and altruistic , that it had its beginnings in a well - planned marketing campaign .
Jim Knopf authored a simple database for his PC back in 1982 , generically named PC - File , which couldn�t help but garner attention in the bleak year after the original IBM PC was released .
He decided to distribute his program freely , with documentation on the same diskette , asking for $ 25 from persons who found the database useful .
Right up front he trademarked a name for his distribution method : freeware .
Realizing that Knopf didn�t exactly roll of the tongue , he changed his business name to Jim Button .
After getting mentioned in the dry , business - oriented PC magazines of the day , he received �and this isn�t an exaggeration �sacks of mail , a $ 25 check tucked inside each envelope .
Mr. Knopf , er�Button , had a cohort : Andrew Fluegleman .
Andrew authored PC - Talk , a terminal program , which made its appearance at the same time as PC - File .
The difference was that PC - Talk shipped with the source code .
As the story goes , the success of PC - Talk was undermined by programmers who modified the source code and released their own versions of the program , presumably asking that donations be sent their way instead .
So much for open source in 1982 !
With the popularity of PC - File , and other programmers wanting to follow suit , it didn�t take long for the expected backlash against Fluegleman and Button�s trademarking of the term freeware .
Nelson Ford , who later founded shareware retailer Public Software Library , solicited alternatives in a column he wrote for a magazine .
Bob Wallace , author of the unrelated PC - Write word processor , suggested the term " shareware , " and that was that .
In 1985 , the newly formed Association of Shareware Professionals took steps to prevent anyone from trademarking the catchy little buzzword .
None of this has anything to do with games , and understandably so .
In the first half of the 1980s , home computers were rife with game piracy .
These were the days of a bored fourteen year old killing an entire weekend just to remove the pithy copy protection of Apple II Lode Runner and add " Kracked by Kool Kracker " to the title screen ( and just in case the authorities had trouble finding him , the phone number of his BBS ) .
Over on the PC , games were dismissed with sneering , " this is a business machine ! " retorts .
Good thing too , because top of the line four - color graphics were an expensive add - on to an already overpriced and underpowered machine .
Even if you went nuts and dropped the three grand or so , you still ended up with something an order of magnitude less graphically capable than the sub five hundred dollar Atari 400 , complete with spill - proof membrane keyboard .
Oh , sure , shareware games made spotty appearances on the 8 - bit Apple and Atari machines , and even the PC , but nothing that could optimistically be called successful .
When the publisher of Gray Chang�s Dog Daze Deluxe for the Atari 800 folded , he freely distributed the game with a plea for a five dollar donation from satisfied players .
While Jim Button was hiring people to haul his sacks of mail around , Mr. Chang had a single postcard attached to his refrigerator with a magnet .
By 1987 , the PC market had gotten a lot bigger .
The forward thinking game players bought into the flashy Atari ST and even flashier Amiga , and many others hung on to their 8 - bit machines , as the PC could still be summed up by the technical term " ick . "
But Word Perfect , Lotus 1 - 2 - 3 , Sidekick and Turbo Pascal were selling oodles of PCs .
It �s a bit strange , looking back , that a substantial number of PC games from that era were repackaged titles from the Apple II and C64 .
Summer Games anyone ?
Street Sports Basketball ?
That year , Scott Miller walked into the very roomy PC market with a way to make shareware games sell .
The trick to shareware wasn�t so much in the programming as it was in the getting people to pay .
No matter how hard you try to be sincere , " please send me a small donation of $ 10 if you find this program to be useful to you " just plain sounds pathetic .
That kind of panhandling worked for business software because , well , pathetic begging is downright pleasant if it knocks the price of a database from $ 800 down to the lower double - digits .
That , and you tend to be exposed to the author�s pick - up line a lot more if the program in question is something you use every day for months , and not a trifling game that you greedily stuff into your mouth , chew up , and spit on the sidewalk a week later .
Attempts to take the edge off panhandling with humor ( " this program is Beerware .
If you like it , send me enough money to buy a case of beer " ) , torture ( " this screen will appear for two minutes each time you run this program , until you pay for it " ) , and personal endangerment ( " I have put a hex on you .
The only way to remove it is to send me twenty dollars " ) were , much to everyone�s surprise , not tremendously successful .
Scott Miller�s angle was to break a long game up into a trio of episodes .
Part
One was released as freebie enticement , a game you could play all the way through with no strings attached , only to have your victory dance interrupted by the knowledge that Part 2 and Part 3 existed , unconquered .
The game he introduced this scheme with was the Kroz trilogry , a modernized and appealing game in the same vein as Rogue , the minicomputer classic .
Kroz ran entirely in the sixteen colors of CGA text mode , representing worlds and critters with the extended PC character set .
The promise of unexplored box - drawn maps and rampaging , umlauted vowels in the remainder of the trilogy resulted in over $ 100,000 being tossed Scott�s way .
Kroz spawned more Kroz , not to mention Scott�s company , the now legendary Apogee Software Productions , founded with his friend and long - time game programming partner , George Broussard .
Apogee�s games grew from ASCII to four color CGA ( Broussard�s Arctic Adventure ) , to sixteen colors of EGA glory ( Todd Replogle�s Dark Ages ) .
The long string of EGA side - scrolling games wasn�t broken until Halloween Harry was released in 1993 and solidified Apogee�s reputation .
Funnily enough , the rest of the world was ready to write off the Enhanced Graphics Adapter from the first glimmer of the new decade .

Tom Cruise Today Show Video 12/15/2008
returned to NBC's Today show on Monday , 12/15/2008 - three years after his heated on - air discussion with
" I came across arrogant " Cruise says of his 2005 appearance on the show .
" I could have handled that better . "
Crusie sat down with Lauer to discuss his family , his marriage to Katie Holmes , and his new film " Valkyrie . "
View video of Tom Cruise 's return to the Today show below .
Part 1 of this three - part feature explored startups that focus on open source software in the enterprise space .
Part 2 highlights startups with consumer - oriented open source products .
Part 3 profiles three startups with an emphasis on mobile open source software .
Open source is out of the closet and is being accepted as the new kid on the block by mobile device makers .
The use of open source products in both enterprise and consumer circles is unprecedented .
However , the mobile marketplace , until recently , was more like a wayward stepchild to Windows - based parents .
Despite the growing foundation of the Linux OS in the mobile market , the development of applications to embed in handheld open source development has been sluggish .
Last year , Nokia pledged to open up the Symbian platform .
Google ’s November 2007 announcement of its plan to introduce a new open source mobile platform called “ Android ” caught the mobile communications industry by surprise .
The subsequent absence of any definitive information until recently about this new platform scattered momentum for new products in the mobile space .
While product developers waited for Android to become more than vaporware , a la Mobile , a young startup in the mobile apps space , made a business decision that thrust it into the catbird ’s seat .
It jettisoned the nearly two years of product development it had done for existing mobile phone devices and rushed to develop applications for Android devices that , at the time , it did n’t know anybody would want or use .
“ We made a very bold strategic decision a month after Google made the Android announcement .
On Dec. 7 , we switched entirely to Android and left behind everything we had done .
At that time , no one knew much about Android .
It was just a lot of noise .
Some call this a risky move on our part .
But today we are very happy with that decision , ” Pauline Alker , CEO of a la Mobile , told LinuxInsider .
Android Anxiety
As one of the newest technologies in the mobile communications field , Android is off to a solid start .
That puts a la Mobile in a very good position , according to Bill Hughes , principal analyst for Instat ’s Wireless Group .
“ I ’m very optimistic about Android , but is it a sure thing ?
The Novus operating system was pretty good , too .
There are a number of Linux initiatives out there .
So Linux is a platform — definitely optimistic .
Android has good momentum .
I think that a la Mobile putting its efforts in Android is a good move , ” Hughes told LinuxInsider .
As the new kid on the block , Android has generated a decent following .
Actually , it ’s better than what Hughes would have thought , he allowed .
On the negative side , Google is coming into this market without a lot of history .
In addition , though many big - name mobile hardware makers say they ’re working to create new Android handset , there is currently only one phone on the market using the software stack .
Superstar Status ?
Android is not a quantum leap in the mobile space , according to Hughes ; however , considering that Google has never done a mobile operating system before , it will be significant .
In fact , he already sees very solid interest among a large number of players .
“ The metrics in the wireless industry are different , so it tends to skew what ‘ successful ’ is .
The net of Google is that people in the industry for a while will work with them to modify their ambitions to be realistic .
They will use their market power to change things , ” said Hughes .
“ Android will certainly sell in the millions of units and will be one of the major players .
We ’re certainly tracking them as a major line item in terms of our smartphone OS , ” he concluded .
No - Man’s Land
Founded in June 2005 , a la Mobile focuses on developing mobile Linux solutions .
Up to November 2007 , the task at hand was putting a whole Linux system stack together .
At that time , there was no single standard , according to Alker .
“ Our job was to step in and put a whole Linux stack together , test it , certify it so it was ready to bring to market for a hardware device , ” she explained , adding that back then Linux on mobile devices was a niche market .
As a young startup , a la Mobile focused on bringing Linux apps to the small OEMs .
Linux was not in the mainstream in the U.S.
So the company took it to a market where Linux was much more talked about — China and Taiwan , for instance .
“ We knew until there was some kind of standard around an application framework we would not become a mainstream .
We used the time to gather a lot of experience in Linux and got very comfortable working with a lot of different devices , ” she said .
A Sea Change
By November 2007 , a la Mobile was getting traction with several customers .
All that changed when Google announced Android .
“ We felt good about this .
Android was the breakthrough we were waiting for .
We knew until something like this happened , Linux would always be a niche for mobile devices , ” Alker said .
It was still a difficult road to pave .
People were very skeptical about it .
Google was just getting an SDK ( software developer kit ) out to developers .
So her company tooled around writing apps for it on a PC .
No one knew when the first Android device would come out , she noted .
Starting Over
Still betting that the hunch would pay off , Alker made the life - or - death decision to reorganize her company around Android apps development .
She put three teams together in key locations based on skill sets .
The biggest team was deployed in China to develop the kernel .
She gathered application developers to an office in Belarus and placed the systems architecture team at the corporate headquarters in the U.S .
“ We are very comfortable working in different time zones .
It gave us the ability to work around the clock , ” said Alker .
Those efforts produced seven applications built on an old smartphone .
The program coders completed this task in one month .
In January 2008 , a la Mobile made a public announcement about the Android apps ’ availability .
Frustration Festered
Alker continued to push her programmers to develop applications through 2008 .
Because Android was n’t happening yet , people were really skeptical .
“ We went through a period of frustration .
We told people that they did n’t have to wait .
We could help them get to market very quickly when it happened .
But nobody wanted to listen .
We continued to develop our core applications , ” she said .
Last September , the first Google phone — known as the G1 — came out , and everything changed .
A la Mobile got its apps on the G1 in two days .
With the race to market on , the company was ready to go .
Framework Formed
The last few years have seen a battle for a framework standard .
Now the lines are drawn — LiMP , LiMo , and now Android .
The fields are cleared up , according to Alker .
“ We pretty much stand alone as the full supplier of applications for Android .
We have at least 14 applications that we wrote .
The momentum for Android is tremendous in the U.S. and the UK , ” she said .
Vendors have already sold 1.5 million G1 units .
The projection for 2009 is between 7 million to 10 million units .
For 2011 , predictions are for a 20 to 25 percent share of the total handset market worldwide , Alker detailed .
“ The openness of Android and its deep branding and customization are its big advantages .
The market is changing rapidly .
2009 is a critical year in the adoption of Android , ” Alker concluded .
Varia Variety
Another newcomer to the mobile open source space is Varia Mobile , which had its birth throes in September 2007 .
Its founders divested from Tegic Communications , an AOL property , to form this new endeavor .
This company is concentrating on Linux devices .
Based in Seattle , Varia made its mark as the developer of one of the first Linux - based cellular phones available in the consumer marketplace .
That product is an example of the company ’s prominence in the mobile space .
It ’s a business - to - business software development company that specializes in developing custom branded Linux - based OS solutions .
Perhaps having an edge over other startups , it forged its own identity from the start with an existing staff that worked together for some seven years .
Its software inventory includes a suite of software applications and a significant patent portfolio .
Varia Mobile is pursuing solutions for bringing content providers , mobile operators and hardware manufacturers together to build innovative , content - rich applications for the mobile ecosystem .
The company hopes to achieve this goal by making personal mobile devices that are easy to use .
Adhere Ad Platform
Citex Software , based in Egypt , also cut its teeth as a newcomer to the open source mobile space in early 2007 .
It offers a suite of software products for the mobile advertising community .
In all likelihood , its offerings will serve the ad revenue needs of vendors and carriers regardless of the platform embraced .
Its free , open source Adhere Ad Server forms the core of the platform .
It supports numerous ad formats , including text , pictures , Web banners , audio and video .
In addition , the ad platform supports advanced ad targeting criteria to ensure the effectiveness of the ad campaigns .
Adhere Ad Server includes the Adhere User Profiles Server , which is key to Adhere ’s targeting capabilities .
The platform also includes sample applications and engines to manipulate various mobile media and to utilize them effectively as advertising channels .
The current release of Adhere includes sample SMS ( short message service ) advertising applications packaged as a weather forecast service and a currency exchange rates service .
The next release will introduce an SMS Tagging and Forwarding Engine ( STAFe ) and a Mobile Web Ad Serving and Tracking Engine ( WASATe ) .
The company ’s future product plans will add support for other mobile advertising channels including MMS ( multimedia messaging service ) , audio and video content .
Bringing Up Open Source , Part 1 : Enterprise Edition
Bringing Up Open Source , Part 2 : The Consumer Side
Let ’s talk about Python 3.0
There ’s an old joke , so old that I do n’t even know for certain where it originated , that ’s often used to explain why big corporations do things the way they do .
It involves some monkeys , a cage , a banana and a fire hose .
You build a nice big room - sized cage , and in one end of it you put five monkeys .
In the other end you put the banana .
Then you stand by with the fire hose .
Sooner or later one of the monkeys is going to go after the banana , and when it does you turn on the fire hose and spray the other monkeys with it .
Replace the banana if needed , then repeat the process .
Monkeys are pretty smart , so they ’ll figure this out pretty quickly : “ If anybody goes for the banana , the rest of us get the hose . ”
Soon they ’ll attack any member of their group who tries to go to the banana .
Once this happens , you take one monkey out of the cage and bring in a new one .
The new monkey will come in , try to make friends , then probably go for the banana .
And the other monkeys , knowing what this means , will attack him to stop you from using the hose on them .
Eventually the new monkey will get the message , and will even start joining in on the attack if somebody else goes for the banana .
Once this happens , take another of the original monkeys out of the cage and bring in another new monkey .
After repeating this a few times , there will come a moment when none of the monkeys in the cage have ever been sprayed by the fire hose ; in fact , they ’ll never even have seen the hose .
But they ’ll attack any monkey who goes to get the banana .
If the monkeys could speak English , and if you could ask them why they attack anyone who goes for the banana , their answer would almost certainly be : “ Well , I do n’t really know , but that ’s how we ’ve always done things around here . ”
This is a startlingly good analogy for the way lots of corporations do things : once a particular process is entrenched ( and especially after a couple rounds of employee turnover ) , there ’s nobody left who remembers why the company does things this way .
There ’s nobody who stops to think about whether this is still a good way to do things , or whether it was even a good idea way back at the beginning .
The process continues through nothing more than inertia , and anyone who suggests a change is likely to end up viciously attacked by monkeys .
But this is also a really good analogy for the way a lot of software works : a function or a class or a library was written , once upon a time , and maybe at the time it was a good idea .
Maybe now it ’s not such a good idea , and actually causes more problems than it solves , but hey , that ’s the way we ’ve always done things around here , and who are you to suggest a change ?
Should I go get the fire hose ?
It ’s rare that any large / established software project manages to overcome this inertia and actually take stock , figure out whether “ the way we ’ve always done it ” is still a good way to do it , and then make changes in response .
This week Python 3.0 was released , and it represents one of those rare instances : Python 3.0 was designed to clear up a lot of now - inertial legacy issues with the Python language and figure out good ways to do things now instead of unquestioningly sticking with what seemed like good ways ( or , more often , the least painful ways ) to do things five or ten years ago .
Of course , this is causing some people to ask whether it was a good idea ; all other things being equal , it ’s better to maintain compatibility than to break it , and if the break does n’t seem to offer anything really major or impressive over the previous compatible version , then it ’s natural to ask what , exactly , made this necessary .
Jens
Afke has rather notably posted some thoughts along those lines , and this post is an attempt to respond and explain , as clearly as I can , why I think Python 3.0 is and will be a good thing even though it ’ll create a staggering amount of work for me , my co-workers and my friends and colleagues ( since I deal with two large Python 2.x codebases on a daily basis , the migration is not going to be simple or short for me ) .
Death by a thousand cuts
I really like Python .
It ’s my language of choice for new projects , my language of choice for hacking up quick things to play with and the language I get to work with every day at my job .
Python fits my brain in ways that no other programming language ever has , and I agree with pretty much all of the basic design philosophy behind it .
And by and large , I think writing ( and reading — something just as important , which too many other languages have neglected )
Python is one of the more pleasant ways to code for a living .
But .
For as long as I ’ve been using Python there have been little moments of pain .
None of them in isolation is enough to make Python itself painful , but taken together and occasionally stumbled over , they definitely have an impact on the experience .
There ’s a passage in Good Omens that does a great job of approximating the effect this sort of thing has on a programmer , when compounded over a period of years .
Some demons are meeting and discussing the evil things they ’ve done — tempting a priest , corrupting a politician , etc. — and one of them proudly declares that he tied up a phone system for most of an hour :
What could he tell them ?
That twenty thousand people got bloody furious ?
That you could hear the arteries clanging shut all across the city ?
And that then they went back and took it out on their secretaries or traffic wardens or whatever , and they took it out on other people ?
In all kinds of vindictive little ways which , and here was the good bit , they thought up themselves ?
For the rest of the day .
The pass - along effects were incalculable .
Thousands and thousands of souls all got a faint patina of tarnish , and you hardly had to lift a finger .
Running into the warts in Python , from time to time , has much the same result : it diminishes the joy of programming in slight and subtle ways .
Working with Unicode , for example , has most likely taken years off the collective lives of Python programmers everywhere .
The Universal Feed Parser , which is arguably the best feed - parsing library on the planet , pithily glosses over some of the pain in its documentation , but Beautiful Soup , which is almost certainly the best screen - scraping library on the planet , expresses the agony of Unicode handling in a way that may not comply with corporate coding style guides :
Beautiful Soup uses a class called UnicodeDammit to detect the encodings of documents you give it and convert them to Unicode , no matter what .
If you need to do this for other documents ( without using Beautiful Soup to parse them ) , you can use UnicodeDammit by itself .
Meanwhile in the Django world , Malcolm , I ’m sure , is now slightly crazier than he was before his heroic effort to make Unicode handling as painless as possible for Django applications .
Now , Unicode and character encoding in general constitute a genuinely brain - bustingly hard problem , but Python — that is , Python 2.x — did almost nothing to help with this .
It had two types of strings : one for Unicode and one for strings in some particular encoding ( remember : Unicode is not an encoding ) , and so lots of Python software which worked with text had to develop all sorts of heuristics and libraries and helpers to work out what , exactly , any given string really was and how to work with it .
Even more Python software simply never bothered , which meant that you could quite easily pass a string into some module you were using and find a UnicodeDecodeError staring back at you out of the abyss .
Python 3.0 fixes this , or at least insofar as it ’s possible to “ fix ” character encoding and Unicode handling at the language level : there ’s one string type and only one string type , and that type is Unicode .
No longer must you guess whether a string is either of multiple types or in any of a bewildering number of encodings ( some of which may not even be supported by your copy of Python ) ; strings are strings are strings , and that ’s that .
If you need to interact with systems which want sequences of bytes in some particular encoding , there ’s a separate type — bytes — which lets you do that , and to go from str to bytes you have to encode the string , and to get weird non -default encodings you have to say that you ’re going to use a weird non -default encoding .
If Python 3.0 introduced the new Unicode handling and no other changes whatsoever , I ’d be willing to call it a win .
But wait , there ’s more !
One of the great strengths of Python , perhaps one of its greatest strengths , is its philosophy of “ batteries included ” ; though the Python core language is rather small , and the number of things in the built - in namespace is puny compared to some other languages , it comes with a large standard library of modules covering all sorts of things that Python programmers will need to do .
But there ’s a downside to this : to stay useful , good modules need to evolve over time , and sometimes need to be replaced outright , and modules which ship in the standard library can’t easily do this because of the need to preserve backwards compatibility .
As a result , the standard library for Python 2.x grew to include a strange mish - mash of oddball historical corner cases .
For example :
There were two modules for working with URL s : urllib ( which came first ) and urllib2 ( which , obviously , came second ) .
s : ( which came first ) and ( which , obviously , came second ) .
There were multiple cases of modules which started out written in pure Python but then switched to , or were supplemented by , versions written in C for speed , leading to situations like pickle versus cPickle , StringIO versus cStringIO , and so on .
versus , versus , and so on .
There were modules which , though related in function , were developed or added at different times or in different ways , and so never could go into logical , topical package namespaces without breaking compatibility ( see : six different top - level modules related to HTTP ) .
) .
There were modules for specific tasks which had to stay , for compatibility , even though they ’d been superseded by more general or more generic implementations ( for example , md5 and sha , both of which are now better handled by hashlib ) .
Even though all these great modules were available , the fact that their organization was a bit haphazard and redundant introduced another layer of low - grade tarnish on the soul .
Python 3.0 reorganized the standard library to make more sense , and even renamed a few things to fall more in line with common conventions .
No longer do you first try to import a C - based version of a module and then fall back to a Python - based version .
No longer do you try to import hashlib and then fall back to md5 .
No longer do you hunt through multiple separate but related top - level modules to find the one with the bits you need .
Though small , these sorts of changes have a major long - term impact on the clarity and maintainability of any kind of significant Python codebase .
And although this will involve a fair amount of migration work for large projects which use lots of libraries , it ’s still a big win going forward .
Similarly , less - obvious bits are changing in significant ways ; for example , Python has long had two types of classes , largely for historical reasons , and the older of the two is nowhere near as useful or flexible as the newer .
For the curious , a new - style class inherits directly from object , or inherits from some other class which ultimately derives from object , while a “ classic ” class does n’t .
The Python 2.6 documentation covers this ( and goes on , elsewhere , to list some very useful things which only work with “ new - style ” classes ) , and Python 3.0 does away with the last remaining backwards - compatible support for the old - style classes , bringing with it a logical unification and general cleanup which will be extremely welcome to this Python programmer .
Just the beginning
Although at the start I paid only the most cursory attention to the Python 3.0 development process , every time I looked into it in any detail I was struck by the amount of time and thought which went into the changes which have been made to the language .
There are , so far as I can tell , no frivolous “ we just did this because we liked it ” differences between Python 2.x and Python 3.x ; every breaking change seems to have been discussed to death , justified based on real - world problems and even then carefully considered and reconsidered just to see if a backwards - compatible way could prevail .
Python 3.0 came out of a years - long process of development by people who were simultaneously actually using Python and taking notes on how it could be better , and it shows .
Jens states in the comments to his article that he feels like the changes in Python 3.0 are “ academic ” , by which I assume he means “ irrelevant to real developers and practical concerns ” .
Based on some of the examples above ( and plenty more which can be found by browsing the new documentation ) , I hope it ’s now clear that this is simply incorrect .
Python has , for as long as I ’ve been using it , come under continual fire from people who felt it did n’t embody some theoretical notion of purity that they cared about —
Python does n’t make threads the One True Way to do concurrency , Python does n’t force everything to be an explicit invocation of a method on a class , Python is n’t a pure functional programming language , etc. — and over that entire time Python has steadfastly resisted the idea of purity for purity ’s sake ( or , more derisively , an “ academic ” notion of purity ) .
As the Zen of Python makes clear , “ practicality beats purity ” .
Python 3.0 is and was developed to be a practical language .
The changes which break compatibility with Python 2.x are in many ways small and may seem insignificant at first glance , but small changes have big effects , and a cleaned - up , less - soul - tarnishing Python is , in my opinion , a goal which justifies a few breaks between major versions .
Besides , evolving the language over time in response to practical concerns is the way they ’ve always done things around here .
India Sleepwalks To Total Surveillance
By Binu Karunakaran

I t was n't tough for a protagonist in a Kundera novel to figure out if he / she were living in a police state .
Looking out of the apartment window they could see agents of the state keeping a watch over them from a car parked in the street round the corner .
Sometimes shady characters broke in and rummaged through shelves looking for letters or diary notes .
Their phones were wiretapped and there was absolutely no way of knowing if the friend they met for a drink last night was an informer or not .
It was our age of innocence and Kafka was n’t thought to be a realist .
Under repressive regimes people lived in constant fear , but the terror they felt and the machinery that enforced it was tangible .
Not any more .
We live in a time when information about our personal lives and behaviour are being gathered , stored and shared by governments and multinational corporations on a scale that no one ever thought was humanly possible .
In the name of fighting terrorism governments across the world have been creating new regulations that infinitely augment the state power of surveillance with no meaningful public or parliamentary debate .
The Information Technology ( Amendment ) Bill , 2006 passed by the Indian Parliament recently allows the government to intercept messages from mobile phones , computers and other communication devices to investigate any offence .
Not just cognizable offence , the kind you witnessed in Mumbai 26 / 11 , but any offence .
Any email you send , any message you text are now open to the prying eyes of the government .
So are the contents of your computer you surfed in the privacy of your home .
Around 45 amendments have been made to the original Act , which now treats both publishers of online pornography and its consumers on equal footing .
A law so sweeping in its powers that it allows a police officer in the rank of a sub- inspector to walk in or break in to the privacy of your home and see if you were surfing porn or not .
It ’s the personal morality of the official that will decide whether the picture / content you were looking at was lascivious or appeals to prurient interest .
The amended Act also grants the state absolute power to block access to any website in the national interest .
In short a total gag and surveillance act that does n’t set any limits for law enforcers , or have inbuilt safeguards against misuse .
And if writing abstract legal language with hues of victorian morality can be considered an art form the architects of the new IT Act are nothing less than artists .
Thou shall not author a joke .
Not even forward one
Any person who sends , by means of a computer resource or a communication device , — ( a ) any content that is grossly offensive or has menacing character ; or ( b ) any content which he knows to be false , but for the purpose of causing annoyance , inconvenience , danger , obstruction , insult , injury , criminal intimidation , enmity , hatred or ill will ... shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years and with fine .
Thou shall not surf Bollywood news
Whoever publishes / transmits / causes to be published / transmitted in the electronic form , any material which is lascivious or appeals to the prurient interest or if its effect is such as to tend to deprave and corrupt persons who are likely , having regard to all relevant circumstances , to read , see or hear the matter contained or embodied in it , shall be punished on first conviction with imprisonment of either prescription for a term which may extend to two years and with fine which may extend to five lakh rupees and in the event of second or subsequent conviction with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to five years and also with fine which may extend to ten lakh rupees .
Thou shall not watch porn
If the material is sexually explicit act or conduct then the punishment on first conviction is imprisonment which may extend to five years and a fine which may extend to ten lakh rupees .
In the event of second or subsequent conviction imprisonment may extend to seven years and fine to ten lakh rupees .
But one has to admit that there is concern on part of the government on what could be the impact of the law on art and literature .
So section 67 does not extend to any book , pamphlet , paper , writing , drawing , painting , representation or figure in electronic form , provided it is in the interest of science , literature , art or learning or religion .
That means M.F Hussein can't be framed under IT
Act anymore , and that photos and videos are not considered art .
‘ So what ? ’ is the familiar rhetoric .
Why fear if you 've got nothing to hide ?
Why should law abiding citizens be bothered about some ' inevitable invasion ' into privacy in the wake of increasing terror attacks ?
After all the perpetrators of terror are known to use Internet and other modern communication tools to plan and execute deadly strikes like that happened in Mumbai .
After months of speculations , Ronaldo finally decided to join Corinthians .
Ronaldo was training with his “ soul club ” , Flamengo in the past couple of months and everybody thought he will choose between them and the other European clubs that were interested in him .
The Brazilian superstar had an amazing career so far winning almost everything that a football player could dream at .
Ronaldo is considered by many of football specialist not only the best striker but the best ever football player .
The former Golden Ball winner has an amazing goal rating managing to score 319 goals in 451 club games and 62 goals in 97 games for Brazil .
The Brazilian superstar played during his career at clubs like Cruzeiro , PSV , Barcelona , Internazionale , Real Madrid and Milan .
He suffered three major injuries .
Many people still consider that we never seen Ronaldo at his best because of this injuries .
The last injury , that he suffered last time when he was playing for Milan , looked like it will be the end of career for him but he managed to recover again .
Now it remains to see how the things will go and if this is the right choice for R9 .

Is the US heading for a depression ?
By Steve Schifferes
Economics reporter , BBC News
The sharp contraction of the US economy accelerated in the last three months of 2008 , with official figures showing GDP shrinking at an annualised rate of 3.8 % .
With forecasters already predicting the worst US recession since World War II , how big a danger is there that the US economy will slip into a depression similar to the 1930s ?
The latest figures paint a gloomy picture of the US economy .
Consumer spending , which makes up two - thirds of the economy , fell for the second quarter in a row , by 3.5 % .
For all the talk of this being a consumer - led downturn , the credit crunch is hitting businesses even harder
Paul Ashworth , Capital Economics
US enters recession
This drop was led by a 22 % drop in spending on durable goods like automobiles and washing machines .
The decline in motor vehicle production was so great that it alone contributed 2 % to the fall in GDP .
Businesses hit Businesses as well as consumers have been hit hard by the slowdown .
Exports , which had helped boost GDP earlier in the year , fell sharply , by 19.7 % , as foreign markets for US products were hit by their own recessions .
US recession is a continuing disaster , President Obama says Investment fared even worse .
Residential investment fell 23.6 % as the glut of foreclosed properties reduced new home sales .
Business investment was down 19.1 % , led by a 27.8 % drop in purchases of equipment and software .
Business inventories of unsold goods mounted .
If the inventory build up - which is likely to be temporary - is excluded , GDP fell at an annualised rate of 5.1 % .
" For all the talk of this being a consumer - led downturn , the credit crunch is hitting businesses even harder , " said Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics .
Consumers save
The economic uncertainty does seem to be changing consumer behaviour .
People are saving more in preparation for the coming downturn .
The personal savings rate rose to 2.9 % , more than double the 1.2 % rate in the previous quarter .
Mr Ashworth predicts the savings rate will double again , to 5 % .
Consumers are being hit by a triple whammy : rising unemployment , which could rise from 7 % to 10 % of the workforce by the end of the year ; restricted access to credit ; and falling asset values .
The fall in stock markets and house prices has reduced household wealth by 20 % , from the middle of 2007 .
This alone has reduced consumption by around 1 % , some economists estimate .
It may make sense for consumers to save instead of spend , but in an economy as reliant on consumer spending as the US , this does add to recessionary pressures .
How long ?
The key question in whether this will turn from a recession to a depression is how long the slowdown will last .
FDR pledged a New Deal to combat the recession
In the 1930s , output declined for four years , with GDP cut by half while unemployment soared to one - quarter of the workforce .
Despite the New Deal , output did not recover to its 1929 level until World War II when there was a massive boost in government spending .
At the moment , most economic forecasters are predicting that the US slowdown will last around two years , with the economy returning to weak growth by 2010 .
The National Bureau of Economic Research says the current economic slowdown actually began at the end of 2007 and is likely to be the longest post - war recession .
The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) estimates a drop in real GDP for 2009 of 2.2 % , followed by a rise of 1.5 % in 2010 , while the IMF predicts a fall of 1.6 % this year , following by a recovery of 1.6 % in 2010 .
But economic forecasts have changed frequently in the past year .
It is unclear what will happen after 2010 , said the IMF 's chief economist Oliver Blanchard .
Government rescue ?
The only thing currently boosting the US economy is Federal government spending , which rose 5.8 % in the quarter .
The government may have to help the millions who have lost their homes
But even if Mr Obama gets rapid approval for his $ 800 bn stimulus plan - which has passed the House of Representatives and is currently being considered by the Senate - it will take some time for the money to be felt in the economy .
Only $ 170bn will be spent before 1 October 2009 , representing just over 1 % of US GDP , according to the Congressional Budget Office .
The bulk of spending ( including tax cuts ) would occur in 2010 ( $ 354bn ) and 2011 ( $ 174bn ) .
Individual states may not be able to rapidly increase spending on infrastructure projects which make up a large part of the stimulus package .
It is also unclear how many jobs will be created : President Obama aims to create 3.5 million new jobs , but others say the stimulus package could create between 1.2 and 3.6 million more jobs .
Financial squeeze Big US banking groups may need a bigger bail - out .
The other big uncertainty is whether the financial sector can be restored to health and at what cost .
There is now $ 2.2 trillion of toxic bank debt worldwide , the IMF says , $ 500 bn more than it estimated a few months ago .
The collapse of financial markets in the autumn had a dramatic effect on consumer and business confidence .
There are plenty of reasons why growth might be even less than forecast , the IMF 's Olivier Blanchard said , not least if banks have so many bad debts , they will further drag down the real economy .
The Obama administration still has $ 350 bn left of the $ 700 bn bailout for banks approved in October last year .
It may need to ask for more .
If it gets the money it needs and if the money is spent promptly and wisely , the US might just escape with a relatively mild recession .
But given the extraordinary events of the past six months , most economists are still hedging their bets .

METHUEN , MASSACHUSETTS
– Tomorrow night ’s City Council meeting might look like a rock concert , and that ’s because marijuana is on the agenda .
Mayor William Manzi is asking the council to increase the fine for people caught smoking pot in public .
The mayor ’s proposal has sparked plenty of criticism , including from local rock band Prospect Hill .
The band posted a video on the Web site youtube.com , urging fans to attend tomorrow night ’s meeting to protest Manzi ’s proposal .
“ The bottom line is , we love doing this , ” lead singer Adam Fithian said in the video while holding what appears to be a joint .
A posting on bostonfreedomrally.com says that in addition to Prospect Hill , Girls for Ganja — a group that ’s creating a calendar showing pictures of girls smoking marijuana — and “ concerned residents of Methuen ” will be there .
“ Party at City Hall , ” Prospect Hill drummer Mark Roberge of Lawrence says on the video .
Manzi is laughing .
Today , he posted the band ’s video on his blog , billmanzi.com , and wrote , “ I will bring the potato chips and twinkies .
See you Tuesday . ”
The mayor said he ’s happy to see people take an interest in local politics , even if he does n’t agree with them .
“ It ’s good that people get involved , in particular young people , in pushing a viewpoint that they think is important , ” he said .
In November , 65 percent of the state ’s voters approved easing the state ’s marijuana laws , decriminalizing the possession of an ounce or less of marijuana .
People caught with a small amount will be forced to hand over the drug and pay a $ 100 fine , while anyone under 18 will be required to complete a drug awareness program or face a stiffer $ 1,000 fine .
Approximately 61 percent of Methuen voters favored decriminalizing the drug .
Last week , Manzi said he wants the council to pass a local bylaw that will increase the penalty somebody faces if they ’re caught smoking dope .
The bylaw could either give police the authority to criminally charge people caught lighting up in public , or slap them with a $ 300 fine , which would be added to the current $ 100 fine they face under a state law that went into effect this month .
Prospect
Hill does n’t like that idea .
“ Sixty five percent of voters said ‘ Yes , ' ” Fithian said .
“ So and then try to renege on this , I do n’t think that ’s going to happen . ”
In an interview today , Manzi said he does not want to instate criminal penalties , and he would like to reduce the proposed fine from $ 300 to $ 100 , which would mean somebody caught smoking pot would face a total fine of $ 200 ( $ 100 for smoking and $ 100 for possession ) .
Saying he ’s trying to compromise with opponents , Manzi said he would look at limiting the smoking fine to people caught using the drug in parks , playgrounds and school property .
People caught smoking elsewhere would only face the $ 100 fine for possession .
“ The concern here is that we ’re promoting a family atmosphere in our parks , ” Manzi said .
The mayor contends that some people got the wrong idea by the referendum passed in November , and they think marijuana is now legal .
Tomorrow night ’s meeting begins at 7 p.m. in the Great Hall of City Hall , at 41 Pleasant St .
“ Now everyone needs to go and show up and , you know , show their support , ” Roberge said .
“ Even if you ’re not going to go and speak , just go and be there . ”
The extra presence should “ help convince them otherwise , ” he said .
– Article from The Eagle - Tribune on January 19 , 2009 .
These days it seems like it is our patriotic duty to consume more .
And if we do n't choose to spend more money ourselves , the government will do it for us .
But wait a minute .
Is n't it excessive spending that got us into this mess in the first place ?
Spending more now seems like drinking Scotch to cure a hangover .
Despite this apparent paradox , ...
I have previously characterized the “ libertarians are free - riders ” argument as nonsense , as a slimy tactic which poisons the well with unearned guilt .
Recent discussion threads at Reddit caused me to re-examine the “ social contract ” the most convincing arguments in support of which , although still fallacious appeals to emotion , fall back on the “ free rider ” argument : those who do not pay their “ fair share ” are somehow cheating everyone else , they are “ stealing ” from society .
In a nutshell , anyone who works for a living , anyone who produces anything whatsoever of value , is not a free rider .
I want to take the time to extrapolate on that line of thought .
Collectivists of all creeds typically resort to some argument that relies on one ’s acceptance of the subsidies of history as the base justification for their “ social contract ” .
It is of paramount importance to understand first and foremost , that although history could have been different , none of us having had any say in the matter , the entire course of human existence happened in only one particular sequence , he culmination of which is the Present , imperfect as she may be .
The consequences , to some extent , we all bear , and the benefits to some extent , we all reap .
The Present could have been different , but it is not .
The Present only is .
We can not deny the language that has evolved over the millenia , the wheel , the lever , the wedge , the inclined plan , the transistor , the cotton gin , the x-ray , the microchip , penicillin or any of the myriad inventions , discoveries and luxuries that make all of our lives easier than they were in generations past .
One “ accepts ” these subsidies , not because he or she is a “ free rider ” , but because one can not deny them .
What we deny , is that merely because we inherited these things , owe a debt to future generations ( who will also inherit these things , and then some ! ) .
Further , we deny that we owe a debt to past generations who created these things ; they did not invent for our sake ( and even if they did , this does not create an obligation for us ) , they invented for their own sake , the benefits of which they have fairly reaped .
But neither can we deny the many injustices or atrocities that have been perpetrated by men long dead , which served to injure us or our brethren , to impede the progress of humanity , to reduce by some amount the real standard of living which we could otherwise enjoy .
The question then is , what can be done about the sub -optimal distribution of property ?
I content that in order to alleviate those now suffering from past wrongs , it is not necessary to perpetrate further injustices on some scapegoat , class warfare - style .
It is not necessary to cause injury .
We can not , nor should we be asked to , make penance for the sins of our fathers , except by arresting any ongoing injustices , removing impediments , breaking down the walls that cage us all , and tolerating them no longer , forever .
We can set things right only by freeing ourselves and ceasing to rely upon that which is wrong .
All we need to do is stop hurting people .
Texas Border Patrol agents seized 7,828 pounds of pot during a truck inspection near Laredo Thursday morning .
Agents said they were checking the driver during an immigration check along Interestate 35 when a drug - sniffing dog alerted agents to the drugs .
When agents opened the trailer they found 264 bundles containing marijuana .
Investigators said the pot has a street value of $ 6.2 million .
The driver is in custody and could face felony drug smuggling charges .
President Obama will direct the EPA today to reconsider a Bush - era decision that stopped California and more than a dozen other states from setting their own stricter limits on auto emissions , according to sources familiar with the matter .
Should the agency allow a waiver from federal rules , states could require automakers to increase the fuel efficiency of cars and trucks far above current limits .
It also would fulfill a long - held goal of environmentalists , as well as one of Obama ’s campaign promises .
A waiver would be another dramatic rebuke of Bush administration policies , as well as a swift statement that the new president intends to put his own stamp on environmental issues .
“ This should prompt cheers from California to Maine , ” said Frank O’Donnell , president of Clean Air Watch , who praised Obama as “ a man of his word ” for the decision .

Tim Carmichael , senior policy director at the Coalition for Clean Air , hailed the decision as a vital step for the administration and the world in the fight against global warming .
Passenger vehicles are estimated to emit 25 % of the greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S .
“ I think Obama got a clear message that this is a priority not only for California state protection but also for planetary protection , ” Carmichael said .
A waiver would be a bitter defeat for the auto industry , which had for years hotly contested the implementation of the California rules and had applauded the Bush administration decision in December 2007 to deny a state waiver for California .

A spokesman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers said Sunday that the industry group did not have a comment on the matter .
Mike Moran , a spokesman for Ford Motor Co. , said the company would not release a statement until Obama made a formal announcement .
At least 17 other states have adopted or are considering California ’s rules , and a waiver also would allow them to regulate tailpipe emissions .
Altogether , those states , which include New York and Florida , represent about 40 % of the population , according to auto industry estimates .
That has provoked considerable anxiety among carmakers .
They could be forced to spend billions of dollars to comply with the California emissions rules , which are distinct from -- and more rigorous than -- federal fuel standards passed in 2007 .
The federal standards would raise the national fleet average to 35 miles per gallon by 2020 .

Bush ’s waiver denial provoked California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to sue the federal government .
Separately , Congress launched an investigation on the decision - making process at the Environmental Protection Agency , which must grant California the waiver before the state may regulate emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases .
Last week , Schwarzenegger sent a letter to President Obama asking that the agency reconsider the matter .
“ Your administration has a unique opportunity to . . . move America toward global leadership on addressing climate change , ” the letter said .
Also last week , Mary Nichols , chairwoman of California ’s Air Resources Board , asked the EPA to open a “ reconsideration process ” in a letter she sent to Lisa Jackson , that agency ’s new administrator .
In December , Nichols indicated that the state board had been in close contact with Obama ’s transition team to help plan a way to pass the waiver and adopt specific rules on rolling out the regulation .

Earlier this month , Jackson pledged to reconsider the request -- and hinted that she supported granting it -- during a Senate hearing into her nomination .
After Obama turns the matter over to the EPA , the agency is expected to take several months to reach a final decision on whether to reverse the Bush denial .
News of Obama ’s expected statement won quick praise from Sen. Barbara Boxer ( D - Calif. ) , who said it was “ more than welcome news . ”
As chairwoman of the Environment and Public Works Committee , she said , she plans to work with the EPA to move a waiver through quickly .

“ An immediate EPA review of the waiver decision shows respect for California ” and the other states , Boxer said , while they wait for the “ green light to address global warming pollution from motor vehicles . ”
In 2002 , California passed a law to reduce greenhouse gas emissions for vehicles , but could n’t enforce it , as a series of lawsuits filed by the auto industry held it up .
Last year , judges handed down several rulings that would allow the rule ’s adoption , but an EPA waiver was still required .
The California rules do n’t strictly limit mileage .
But by setting caps on carbon emissions , they would effectively require vehicles to reach as much as 42 mpg by 2020 , according to some estimates .
Currently , only two mass - produced vehicles , the Toyota Prius and the hybrid Honda Civic , average at least 42 mpg .
Advertisement
To reach that level on a fleetwide basis , automakers would likely have to invest in costly new technologies such as hybrid drive trains .
Industry estimates put the per-vehicle cost of compliance as high as $ 5,000 .
The Bush administration had been charged with developing final rules for the new federal mileage requirements , but elected to pass that task on to Obama , citing the auto industry ’s deep economic woes .
Those rules must be published by April , and it is expected that the administration will make an announcement on them as soon as today .
In taking up the tailpipe emissions issue after less than a week in office , Obama is sending a signal about the importance his administration places on environmental matters , environmentalists said .
There had been some expectation among them that Obama would instruct the EPA to grant the California waiver immediately , using the existing regulations .
Advertisement
But by sending the matter back to Jackson , Obama also indicates that he is aware of the auto industry ’s difficulties and willing to develop rules that would accommodate some of its immediate concerns .
Last month , the Bush administration agreed to give General Motors Corp. and Chrysler $ 17.4 billion in emergency loans .
The two automakers , which suffered the worst sales declines in a quarter - century last year , have until Feb. 17 to submit restructuring plans to the federal government , which will evaluate those plans by the end of March .
In addition to technological concerns , automakers worry that having the California rules in place would create regulatory chaos , with two separate rules on the books .
They have argued that if government is going to regulate carbon emissions , as is the case in Europe , there should be one national rule .
Advertisement
That ’s a position echoed by environmentalists , who believe that California ’s regulations would open the door for serious discussion for a new countrywide standard .
“ It ’s not going to happen overnight , ” said Spencer Quong , a senior analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists .
“ This is a huge notice that the administration is going to deliver on its promise to clean up the environment and fight global warming . ”

A UK campaign to raise money to buy London bus-ads to promote atheism was a massive success — 800 of the busses took the streets today , and the campaign is spreading around the world .
Today , thanks to many Cif readers , the overall total raised for the Atheist Bus Campaign stands at a truly overwhelming £ 135,000 , breaking our original target of £ 5,500 by over 2400 % .
Given this unexpected amount , I 'm very excited to tell you that 800 buses – instead of the 30 we were initially aiming for – are now rolling out across the UK with the slogan , " There 's probably no God .
Now stop worrying and enjoy your life " , in locations all over England , Scotland and Wales , including Manchester , Edinburgh , Glasgow , York , Cardiff , Devon , Leeds , Bristol and Aberdeen .
From today 's launch , two hundred of the buses will run in London , because the campaign was originally started as a positive counter - response to the Jesus Said ads running on London buses in June 2008 .
These ads displayed the URL of a website which stated that non-Christians " will be condemned to everlasting separation from God and then you spend all eternity in torment in hell … Jesus spoke about this as a lake of fire prepared for the devil " .
Our rational slogan will hopefully reassure anyone who has been scared by this kind of evangelism .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
In a brutal week for the job market , an assortment of companies across various industries announced more than 100,000 job cuts .
The bulk of the job loss news occurred on Monday , when several major U.S. companies announced sweeping job cuts , pushing the day 's total to more than 70,000 .
" The picture is still pretty glum out there , " said David Wyss , chief economist for Standard & Poor 's , noting that January is often a bad month for the job market , because companies want to include the reductions in their annual tax returns .
Pfizer ( PFE , Fortune 500 ) , the leading drugmaker in terms of annual pharma sales , and Caterpillar ( CAT , Fortune 500 ) , a heavy equipment manufacturer based in Peoria , Ill. , each said they would cut 20,000 jobs .
These are the biggest reported eliminations among U.S. - based companies .
New York - based Pfizer said the cost - saving restructuring would occur before and after its merger with Wyeth ( WYE , Fortune 500 ) , to be completed later this year .
Caterpillar Chief Executive Jim Owens blamed the " rapidly deteriorating global economy " in his quarterly earnings report .
Later , on Friday , Caterpillar added another 2,110 job cuts to its previously announced reductions , bringing its tally to more than 22,000 .
Boeing ( BA , Fortune 500 ) announced its massive layoffs on Wednesday .
The Chicago - based airplane manufacturer said 10,000 workers , including 4,500 previously announced reductions , would lose their jobs .
The company blamed this on dwindling demand for its aircraft .
Chico's ( CHS ) , a retailer of women 's clothing based in Fort Myers , Fla. , said on Friday that it was cutting 180 positions .
The retail industry has been hard - hit in recent months by a slow - down in consumer spending , partly because so many people have lost their jobs .
Also on Friday , the newspaper publisher A.H. Belo ( AHC ) said it was cutting 500 jobs .
Chief Executive Robert Decherd , in a letter to colleagues , blamed the " rapid deterioration in the U.S. economy . "
The U.S. economy lost 2.6 million jobs in 2008 , according to government reports .
This includes 21,137 mass layoffs , a seven - year high .
In a mass layoff , 50 or more workers are laid off at a time .
The job market is n't expected to get any better any time soon .
The Conference Board forecast two million job losses for 2009 .
" [ The job losses ] are going to continue until sales stabilize and that might not become apparent until the summer , " said Moody 's chief economist John Lonski .
" There 's every reason to believe that the magnitude of job destruction will rise yet again in February and March . "
Not everyone agrees that job losses will continue at their current pace .
Robert Brusca , chief economist at Fact and Opinion Economics , said that " when the pace of the loss is this severe , the period of severity is n't very long . "
He said companies might be overzealous in reporting their eliminations , lessening the need for further cuts down the road .
While opinions differ about the severity of cuts , nobody 's talking about job growth for the foreseeable future .
" There 's no reason to anticipate a hiring frenzy any time soon , " said Rich Yamarone , director of economic research at Argus Research , in an email to CNNMoney.com .
" Labor usually accounts for about 75 % of a company 's costs , and if the outlook remains bleak , they slash jobs .
There is no reason to believe this trend will stop any time soon . "
It was bound to happen , but we never imagined it was going to be so soon .
Phandroid says that Sony Ericsson will release their first Android - based telephone in summer 2009 , according to IDG Sweden .
Update : Gustaf Brusewitz has said that no specific timetable has been officially announced yet .

We expect to initially focus on higher - end products , but we will also add products for a broader mass market at a later date .
The first Android handset will arrive in the summer .
The development has started , but it 's still early in the process , and we cannot comment on the timing at this stage .

That was the official word from Gustaf Brusewitz , an official Sony Ericsson spokesman for Sony Ericsson in Sweden .
He also added that they will continue to develop for Symbian and Windows , to get all their bases covered .
HTC , the current makers of the G1 , will also come with their own Android cellphones in summer 2009 .
Not only model , but a whole portfolio , according to HTC exec Peter Frølund :
Yes , we will have one or more Android - products by the summer of 2009 .
I can say that we are working on a portfolio of models .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
Personally , I can't wait to see what HTC and Sony Ericsson will bring to the table in terms of hardware design and - hopefully - User Interface overhauls .

At 63 , rock icon Debbie Harry appears to have discovered the fountain of youth .
Or , at the very least , a really good , er , eye cream .
Nothing prepared us for the phenomenal success of Museo and Museo Sans , the year ’s top geometric display fonts .
When introducing Museo , a clean yet unconventional semi-serif , designer Jos Buivenga got everyone ’s attention by offering three out of the five styles for free .
On the strength of the paid weights alone , Museo made it to the top of our list of hot new fonts .
When its sans - serif companion was launched some months later , again with part of the family offered at no cost , it smoothly sailed to the top spot as well .
Both typefaces are lucid and versatile , great for cool - looking headlines but also very effective in medium - sized texts .
As a bonus , we could n’t resist giving the Museo pair an extra-special award for the year ’s best marketing strategy .

Several Religious
Right groups have demonstrations planned for Inauguration Day ; others are busy selling product and raising cash for the long slog against Obama
In politics , commerce , and fundraising , timing , if not everything , is essential .
Next week 's inauguration of President - elect Barack Obama is providing all sorts of opportunities for conservative organizations to market their messages and peddle some goods at the same time .
On January 8 , the Christian Defense Coalition ( CDC ) , an organization headed by Reverend Patrick J. Mahoney , announced that they had received permission to display what it calls a pro life vigil -- 25 large signs showing the development of life from conception to birth -- along the parade route during the Presidential Inauguration .
Repent America , another Christian conservative group , is planning " a massive evangelism effort in Washington , DC . [ where ] church groups and individuals [ will ] ... hand out tracts and engage in one - on - one witnessing efforts during " Inauguration Day activities , according to a report by OneNewsNow , the America Family Association - sponsored news service .
Over at the PatriotShop.US , a division of the Tennessee - based online publication , The Patriot Post , commerce is king during the run-up to Obama 's Inauguration .
While the Christian Defense Committee is holding its vigil , Repent America is passing out flyers and looking for converts , and The Patriot Post is flogging its merchandise , another group , Our Country Deserves Better PAC , is seeking cash .
Gathering the troops
Claiming that President - elect Obama is on the " wrong side of history and human rights by embracing the most radical abortion policies of any President in American history , " the Christian Defense Coalition 's Patrick Mahoney added , " While millions will be celebrating along the Inaugural Parade route , we will be speaking `truth to power ' and calling justice and equality for all Americans . "
Mahoney pointed out that " While millions will be celebrating along the Inaugural Parade route , we will be speaking `truth to power ' and calling justice and equality for all Americans . "
" We know ... president - elect Barack Obama [ to be ] a very aggressive , pro-abortion , pro-homosexual political figure -- and now he 's going to be our president , " Michael Marcavage , president of Repent America , told OneNewsNow .
" So it 's only expected that these particular things are going to be pushed in our nation even more . "
' Celebrate the Obamination Inauguration '
You can " celebrate the Obamanation Inauguration " with a host of Patriot Post products including " Bitterly Clinging to Guns and Religion " posters , tee shirts and bumper stickers ; an " O - Bummer " sticker ; a Che Obama tee shirt and bumper sticker ; " Politically Incorrect Guides " to American History , Capitalism , Global Warming , Islam , the Middle East , the Constitution , Hunting ; and other assorted sundries from mugs to coin holders to even a Holy Cross .
According to its website , The Patriot Post is " America 's most widely read Internet - based publication ... [ and ] is a highly acclaimed journal advocating individual liberty , the restoration of constitutional limits on government and the judiciary , and the promotion of free enterprise , national defense and traditional American values . "
The online publication , headed by Mark Alexander aims to be " a hard - hitting rebuttal to contemporary political , social and mainstream media protagonists on the Left , ... written for those who seek a brief , informative and entertaining analysis of the week 's most significant news , policy and opinion . "
The California - based Our Country Deserves Better PAC , the group that failed to derail the presidential candidacy of Obama , intends to serve as ' the loyal opposition '
Having failed to defeat Obama , despite spending thousands of dollars on anti-Obama television advertisements in several swing states , and launching its " Stop Obama Tour , " which drew few anti-Obama enthusiasts as it lumbered around the country , the California - based Our Country Deserves Better PAC is asking for financial support for a long term campaign against Obama .
In a new ad run by HumanEvents.com , Our Country is looking to " serve as one of the leading conservative organizations that will help prepare for a conservative resurgence in 2009 and 2010 . "
As Inauguration Day approaches , Our Country is warning conservatives that " Obama is perhaps the most liberal person ever to be elected to serve as Commander in Chief of these United States of America , and it is now the responsibility for conservatives to serve as the `loyal opposition ' to Obama 's liberal policies - just as MoveOn.org , Code Pink and all the liberal organizations stood up to the Bush Administration and Republicans in Congress . "
Our Country 's HumanEvents.com ad is more like Election 2008 Redux :
The two videos it " showcase (s ) " have been used before : one features Howard Kaloogian , the chairman of the PAC who served as Assistant Republican Leader in the California State Assembly during his six - year term in office and who , in 2003 , helped lead the drive to recall California Governor Gray Davis , warning Americans about the impact on the country Obama will have if he is elected ( " Obama 's Liberal Policies are Wrong " ) ; the other is a gushing tribute to Alaska Governor Sarah Palin ( " Sarah's a Fighter " ) .
It is imperative that we both champion our conservative values and articulate to the American people why these policies are not only right and moral , but also best for America -- and that we stand up for and celebrate the best conservative leaders who champion these ideals .
That is what the Our Country Deserves Better PAC has done to date , and that is what we will continue to do with your financial support .
It 's time for conservatives to fight back !!
It 's time for us to stop licking our wounds and to fight for our conservative beliefs and the future of America .
At Our Country 's website , the featured story is headlined " Rahm Emanuel Must Resign . " a campaign that asks supporters to " Sign the petition demanding that Obama 's Chief of Staff , Rahm Emmanuel , resign for his inappropriate conduct in the Obama Senate Seat corruption scandal . "
Our Country 's fundraising efforts is being organized by Complete Campaigns.com , which , according to its website , " provides outstanding web - based services to help campaigns effectively track supporters , voters , fundraising , and volunteers . "

I had a dream : Israeli Arab students , enraged by the war in Gaza , were protesting at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem .
A counterdemonstration by Jewish students erupted .
When the head of university security , a Holocaust survivor , tried to intervene , the Arab students called him a Nazi .
Actually , I did n’t dream this .
Shlomo Avineri , a political scientist at the university , related the incident .
But dreams cut to the quick .
There ’s no point denying that a line of sorts runs from the dozens killed by Israeli fire near a United Nations school in Gaza back to the Palestinian “ Nakba ” of 1948 and Berlin 1945 .
History is relentless .
Sometimes its destructive gyre gets overcome : France and Germany freed themselves after 1945 from war ’s cycle .
So did Poland and Germany .
China and Japan scarcely love each other but do business .
Only in the Middle East do the dead rule .
Their demand for blood is , it seems , inexhaustible .
Their graves will not be quieted .
Since 1948 and Israel ’s creation , retribution has reigned between the Jewish and Palestinian national movements .
Farewell , VHS ... and do n't let the door hit you on your way out .
Though most of us have given up our VHS players by now in favor of something a little less dated , there have been the usual stragglers in the " old ' n ' busted video format " department that have kept VHS alive long past its expiration date .
But with the last major VHS supplier in the US ditching the format at the end of this year , the sound of the death knell has forced us to reminisce on VHS and other formats we wish would die with it .
VHS , which became wildly popular in the 80s and rode out its popularity well into the 2000s , has been on a very steady decline since the advent of DVD ( and now digital downloads and Blu-ray ) .
As a result , most VHS distributors have long ago ditched the format , but not Distribution Video Audio Inc. , which prides itself in keeping little tidbits of pop culture alive .
But this is one trend that is finally going to the grave after the 2008 holiday season is over , despite steady sales over the last several years .
" It 's dead , this is it , this is the last Christmas , without a doubt , " Distribution Video Audio co-owner Ryan Kugler told the L.A. Times .
" I was the last one buying VHS and the last one selling it , and I 'm done .
Anything left in the warehouse we 'll just give away or throw away . "
The last Hollywood - produced VHS movie was released sometime in 2006 , which was already well into DVD release territory .
Kugler points out , however , that even though major retailers ( like Walmart and Best Buy ) were phasing out their VHS selection , bargain basement stores like the Dollar Tree and mom-and - pops were still buying inventory from him .
He says he also sold to public libraries , military bases , and cruise ships , although those venues are looking for DVDs now too .
As it turns out , Distribution Video Audio now sets up discount DVD displays for big - box retailers , although Kugler warns that DVD 's days are numbered as well .
" The DVD will be obsolete in three or four years , no doubt about it .
Everything will be Blu-ray , " he said .
With VHS 's death about to become a reality , the Ars staff got to thinking about what other formats we'd like to see buried before the end of this decade .
I , for one , wish car makers would stop even offering to put cassette players into vehicles — the only function those things are good these days is acting as a cheap intermediary between an iPod and a stereo system .
Several other staff members chimed in with the QuickTime .mov and the dusty old .gif when it comes to file formats .
What are some of yours ?
Scientists had plenty of reasons to celebrate in 2008 .
The Large Hadron Collider fired up for the first time , a temple of science opened its doors , several companies promised cheap genome sequencing and President - elect Obama hired a fantastic team of science advisers .
After decades of work , researchers made rat stem cells , built the first memristor and watched a language evolve like an organism .
But none of those accomplishments impressed us as much as the breakthroughs on this list .
10 . Troubleshooting stem cell therapy
In 2007 , scientists learned how to reprogram skin cells into stem cells , without cloning or destroying embryos .
It seemed too good to be true , and it was .
The tissues grown from those cells had a nasty tendency to become cancerous , which made them useless for regenerative medicine — the science of building and fixing body parts .
In 2008 , several research groups figured out what was going wrong and solved the problem .
Researchers had used an an adenovirus to slip four genes into each cell , but the microbe was causing lots of collateral damage .
By switching to a different kind of virus , scientists at The Whitehead Institute and Massachusetts General Hospital were able to make the procedure safe .
9 . Turning water into fuel
Companies like Nanosolar and Solyndra slashed the cost of solar energy , but scientists are still looking for a clean way to store all that juice .
Daniel Nocera of MIT has an elegant solution :
Use electricity to break water into hydrogen and oxygen , store it in separate tanks , then recombine the gases in a fuel cell when you need power .
Anyone can do this .
Just hook a 9 - volt battery to electrodes and dunk them into a jar of water .
The problem is that it takes a lot of energy to do this .
If you want to fill tanks with those gases , and use them to run a fuel cell , you 'll need to do it very efficiently .
Nocera , and his team at MIT , found a catalyst that makes the task of splitting H 2 O remarkably easy .
It could store the energy harvested by solar cells and wind farms .

8. Marking greenhouse gas levels — 800,000 - year high
The numbers on Wall Street were dismal in 2008 , but even more frightening figures came from Antarctica .
When scientists traveled to the frozen continent and analyzed ancient pockets of air trapped deep in the ice , they learned that our atmosphere has 28 percent more carbon dioxide now than at any other time in the past 800,000 years .
Thomas Stocker of the University of Bern provided some of the most compelling evidence to date that we are irreversibly warming our planet .
He showed that the rise and fall of CO 2 concentrations in the atmosphere matched the melting and thawing of the polar ice caps , and identified a period in which the greenhouse gas was at an all time low .
Another team , led by Jerome Chappellaz of Joseph Fourier University in Grenoble , drew the same conclusions by measuring methane levels in ice core .
They remarked that another greenhouse gas , CH 4 , has not risen above 800 parts per billion in the past 650 millenia , and currently it is at over twice that level .
7. Building loudspeakers from carbon nanotubes
Scientists have been tinkering with carbon nanotubes for decades , and this year the work has paid off .
Chinese scientists have used the nanotubes to make transparent audio speakers and sheets of paper stronger than steel .
The speakers work by a thermoacoustic effect :
They vibrate and make noise when heated by an electrical current .
The scientists demonstrated in YouTube videos that their prototype could blast a scratchy but understandable version of the Moldovan pop song " Dragostea din tei " while it was taped to the side of a waving flag .
Another team at Florida State University made paper that is far lighter and stronger than steel by pressing sheets of carbon nanotubes together .
Those composite materials , developed by Ben Wang and his team , could make aircraft parts and body armor .
In a perfect sheet of the material , all of the carbon nanotubes should be pointing in the same direction .
Wang figured out how to align the tiny cylinders with magnetic fields .
Thanks to that discovery , and other advances , buckypaper could be on the market within a year .
6 . Sequencing entire genome of a cancer patient , including tumor
For the first time , doctors sequenced the entire genome of a cancer patient , and also read the genetic code of her diseased cells .
That allowed them to pinpoint the exact mutations responsible for the illness .
In the short run , that data will give cancer researchers a much better understanding of the disease , but their real triumph is bringing the medical community a step closer to offering personalized health care .
Cancer is hard to fight because nearly every case is different , and yet doctors use a somewhat one - size - fits - all approach to treating patients .
As new medications like gene therapy and RNA interference become widespread , oncologists will be able to tailor treatments for patients because of what 's wrong with their genetic code .
In the meantime , some physicians are using simple genetic tests to predict which medications will work well on their patients .
5 . Breaking the petaflop barrier
The latest generation of supercomputers can perform more than a quadrillion operations per second , and that remarkable capability will revolutionize the way scientists do research .
It will allow them to identify meaningful patterns in unfathomably large mounds of data , and perform simulations with unprecedented accuracy .
Meteorologists could know exactly where a hurricane will strike days before it makes landfall .
Neuroscientists may be able to emulate a simple brain .
So far , two machines have broken the petaflop barrier , and as more follow we 'll see monumental advances in every field of science .

4. Curing HIV in Germany
Some people are remarkably resistant to HIV , and scientists have found two ways to give that immunity to others .
In the first case , Berlin doctor Gero Huetter transplanted bone marrow from a virus - resistant donor to a man who had both HIV and leukemia .
By doing that , he cured both diseases with one treatment .
It sounds great , but Huetter had to kill off his patient 's immune system with drugs and radiation before replacing it with a better one .
Because that tactic is tremendously harsh and risky , it is unlikely that the miraculous procedure will catch on .
Instead , his victory provided solid evidence that gene editing might offer a viable solution .
Every virus - resistant person has two mutant copies of a gene called CCR5 , and a new biotech tool called zinc finger nucleases can give anyone that mutation .
Instead of transferring bone marrow from another person , doctors could take a few cells from a patient , modify them to be HIV - resistant and then put them back in .
3 . Finding another building block of life in our galaxy
This has been a very big year for astrobiology .
Several teams of researchers have found the building blocks of life outside our solar system and others have spotted dozens of planets that are n't much bigger than earth .
When astronomers in France pointed the IRAM radio telescope at a region of the Milky Way filled with newborn stars , they found signs of a sugar molecule called glycolaldehyde .
It is an ingredient of RNA , the substance that may have played a key role in the dawn of life .
Until then , the organic chemical had only been spotted at the chaotic core of our galaxy .
Using the Hubble telescope , another group of researchers found the first evidence of water and carbon dioxide on a planet outside our solar system .
2. Growing a new organ from a patient 's own stem cells
Thanks to stem cell research , people with failing organs may not need to wait for a donor or take harsh medications that prevent their immune systems from rejecting transplanted tissue .
One of the greatest examples of regenerative medicine — the science of building or fixing body parts — took place this year , when doctors removed some cells from a 30 - year - old woman with tuberculosis and used them to grow a new trachea , replacing a segment that was destroyed by the bacterium .
They took stem cells from her bone marrow , layered them onto a decellularized trachea from a deceased donor , and surgically implanted it in the woman .
Four months later , Claudia Castillo could breathe well and showed no signs of the side - effects that patients have when they receive an organ from someone else .
1. Finding ice on Mars
After a seven - month journey through space , the Phoenix lander touched down on Martian soil , and soon after discovered ice .
On May 31 , two days after the lander 's robotic arm went to work , its camera caught a glimpse of something shiny under the craft .
Lead researcher Peter Smith speculated that the landing rockets had blown a thin layer of soil away , exposing buried ice .
The big announcement came on Jun. 19 , after scientists compared two photos of a ditch called Dodo - Goldilocks .
In the first image , several bright nuggets were visible , and four days later the chunks had disappeared .
Taking the temperature and atmospheric pressure into account , the specks had to be ice that sublimated after being uncovered by the mechanical claw .
The red planet may have an inhospitable climate , but at least it has water , and that will be tremendously useful when the first group of explorers lands there .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Bank stocks took a nosedive Friday , as investors worried about dour economic data and questions about how soon aid for the financial sector will arrive .
Among the biggest losers were two institutions that have been at the center of the bailout controversy , Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) and Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) .
Shares in Citi slid nearly 9 % and Bank of America slipped about 3 % .
Other big decliners included Cincinnati - based Fifth Third ( FITB , Fortune 500 ) , which dropped more than 20 % after an analyst downgraded the stock .
The selloff comes on a day dominated by the news that the economy contracted at a 3.8 % annualized rate in the fourth quarter .
That 's the steepest quarterly decline in economic activity in more than two decades .
Meanwhile , announced layoffs topped 100,000 for the week .
The entire market fell Friday , leaving the S&P 500 with its biggest ever January loss .
But banks in particular have been hard hit .
Citigroup has lost nearly half its value this year , for example .
And the KBW Bank Index has plunged more than 35 % .
Adding to the gloom for banks , a news report indicated that progress may have slowed in the government 's efforts to devise a plan to remove toxic assets from bank balance sheets .
Citing unnamed sources , CNBC said key details of the plans have yet to be worked out .
Friday 's slide comes two days after bank stocks staged a substantial rally on word that the Obama administration was making headway on a multifaceted effort to ease strains in the banking industry .
The plan is expected to include a government - backed so - called aggregator bank that would take over bad loans and securities from private lenders , and an insurance plan that would reduce the risk of substantial losses on other bank holdings .
Investors have been hopeful that a comprehensive federal response to the banking crisis could lure private capital back into the markets after a year where several major global stock indexes plunged more than 40 % and numerous financial institutions collapsed .
Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner has said the administration is working on a program that may be ready for public consumption in coming weeks .
But observers say the administration will likely need to go to Congress for more money to fund any rescue plan -- an overture that is n't likely to be popular with the public or Republicans in Congress , who unanimously opposed the fiscal stimulus plan that passed the House this week .
Geithner told Congress earlier this month that he had n't reached the conclusion that the administration will need more money than the $ 350 billion available under the Troubled Asset Relief Program , but he stressed that this could change were the economy to worsen .
Obama spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters at a White House briefing Friday afternoon that officials are still discussing the shape of any financial stability package .
He said that for now , the administration is more focused on making sure that spending under the second half of the TARP is more precisely focused and better managed than the first half .
The Bush administration drew scathing criticism in Congress for its failure to insist that banks getting money use it for lending , and for generally failing to give taxpayers a good handle on how the money was being spent .
" I know there have been different reports about different ideas and different money figures that have floated around , " Gibbs said .
" The administration right now is focused on ways of changing the way that program has been administered for this set of money differently than that last set . "

The Conservatives have chosen their youngest candidate to stand for a parliamentary seat with 19 - year - old Nick Varley to run for City of Durham .
Mr Varley is certainly the youngest Conservative parliamentary candidate in living memory , and possibly of all time , although that has not been corroborated yet .
He lives in the constituency and grew up in nearby Chester - Le - Street .
Caroline Spelman , Conservative party chairman , said : " I am delighted Nick has been selected for the City of Durham and congratulate him on becoming the Conservative 's youngest candidate .
" I am sure he will bring a fresh perspective to tackling the issues of the day in Durham and do an excellent job of holding this Labour government to account , when [ Gordon ]
Brown finally has the confidence to call a much need general election . "
City of Durham is considered a very safe Labour seat .
The 2009 NHL All - Star Game Skills Competition – Breakaway Challenge just concluded , and just like last year , it entertained .
Alex Ovechkin shot last , and below is video from his attempts .
As we noted earlier , Ovechkin and Evgeni Malkin have had an interesting relationship , but Malkin came to Ovechkin ’s assistance on Ovechkin ’s final attempt and goal .
Ovechkin scored with Malkin ’s stick , wrong handed .
Ovechkin ’s first attempt was a recreation of “ The Goal ” that he scored in his rookie season , however the commentators did n’t realize what he was doing .
He had said in an interview earlier in the day that he was going to attempt a shot that he had done in a regular season game .
Alex was named the winner in the Competition , for the second year in a row , with 42.8 % of the vote , however the other guys made some impressive attempts as well .

A remote Cumbrian farmhouse which provided the backdrop for the cult British film Withnail and I has been put up for auction with a guide price of £ 145,000 .
Sleddale Hall , near the village of Shap , south of Penrith , has remained largely untouched since it featured in the 1987 comedy , which followed the hedonistic , alcohol - fuelled antics of a pair of out - of - work actors .
The film , which was written and directed by Bruce Robinson , is set in 1969 and starred Richard E Grant , right , as the eponymous Withnail and Paul McGann as his thespian sidekick .
The pair decide to leave their dingy flat in London for a weekend in the country , but arrive at the house with no food and have to make do with the contents of the drinks cupboard .

The stone house , which is being sold by the water company United Utilities , is more than a mile from the nearest inhabited house and is only accessible by a dirt track .
It dates back to the 18th century and contains many of the original features seen in the film .
It is due to go under the hammer in London on 16 February .
Paul Mooney , of Savills estate agents , said : " Withnail is an iconic film and there may be a few eccentrics who would be interested in owning a piece of film history . "

But do big - breasted women really attract more male attention ?
To answer the question , psychologist Nicolas Gurguen — who has studied the sexual benefits of makeup , dog ownership , and other social cues– has now added cup size to his repertoire .
Gurguen knew that previous studies found that guys rate large breasts as more physically attractive than average breasts .
But does that affect men ’s behavior in real - life situations ?
To find the answer , he created a variety of studies involving young women and an assortment of padded bras .
In one experiment , young women were instructed to sit in a nightclub for several nights — sometimes unpadded , sometimes lightly padded , and sometimes heavily padded under a snug shirt — while the researchers counted the number of men who approached them .
Unsurprisingly , the bigger a woman ’s breasts appeared , the more men approached her .
But here ’s the nagging question :
Does having big breasts simply boost a woman ’s confidence , encouraging her to unconsciously display more seductive body language ?
Could it be the attitude rather than the boobs that actually attracts guys ?
Addressing this technicality in a second experiment , Gurguen recruited a twenty - year - old flat - chested woman and gave her his stash of trick bras .
Put on a bra under a tight shirt , he said , stand on the side of the road like a hitchhiker , and stick out your thumb to catch a ride .
Cars sped by quickly ; motorists had time to see the woman ’s silhouette but not her expression or any other subtle body language .
The woman alternated between wearing unpadded ( A - cup ) , lightly padded ( B - cup equivalent ) , and heavily padded ( C - cup equivalent ) bras .
The results ?
Size , it turns out , really does make a difference .
Significantly more male drivers pulled over when the woman was wearing the C - cup bra than the A - cup bra .
( Important : Although more cars stopped for the woman with a C - cup than B - cup silhouette , the difference was not statistically significant . )
Female drivers , meanwhile , were no more compelled to stop for a bosomy hitchhiker .
Why are men so attracted to breasts ?
Do they signal receptivity , fertility , nurture ?
In BLONDES I address the question from a scientific standpoint — there are several fascinating psychological and evolutionary theories , including a new one from neuroscientist Larry Young that I blogged about earlier this week .
Breasts are a hot research topic in these troubled times .
Perhaps Gurguen will investigate a link between recessions and breast size .
To what extent are women really still willing to pump and pad themselves ?
How much is a little lift really worth ?
Understanding what are visitors doing on a website and how they are browsing that site is crucial for information architecture specialists .
I ’m using AWStats and Google Analytics to monitor websites .
Nevertheless , I always felt that I did n’t see the whole picture .
Recently I found how to view the stats from another perspective : graphs !
aiSee is a great piece of software , it ’s a “ graph browser which supports 15 layout algorithms , fast visualization of huge graphs , recursive graph nesting , easy printing and export of graphs to various formats ” .
In the Applications section I found Apache2GDL – a Perl script that generates visitor movement graphs from Apache log files .
It parses the access.log file and produce a *.gdl file for aiSee .
Let ’s give it a try , below is the result graph for the log file taken from www.cnaa.acad.md.
Huh , what an ugly image !
There are so many edges that connects nodes because there are a couple of nodes that are connected to an enormous number of other nodes .
After examining the graph image ( the graph is interactive , you can zoom in / out and display information for a node ) and the access.log , I found the nodes with many connections :
page hits from search engines : a single node ( the search engine ) has connections with a lot of other nodes ( website pages ) site hits without a referrer result in a picture as in N.1 .
( Search engine crawlers and some download managers do not provide a referrer ) it turns out that there are special ( popular ) pages that are connected to almost all other website pages .
In my case , an example of such page is Site Search .
Notice that the graph displays all it finds in the access.log file except hits from search engine crawlers ( the Apache2GDL script was written back in 2005 and may not catch all the crawlers ) .
Said that , you should remove from your log file all the *.css , *.gif and whatever files your do n’t want to appear in the graph .
In my case , this procedure was already accomplished by Apache itself : I configured it to exclude some files and IP addresses from logging .
Here is how to do it :
SetEnvIfNoCase User - Agent “ SomeGreedyBOT ” skip-log
SetEnvIf Request_URI “ \.( gif|js|css|css|ico ) $ ” skip-log
SetEnvIf Remote_Addr “ 192\.168\.0\.1 ” skip-log
…
CustomLog /var/log/access.log combined env=!skip-log
Let ’s remove the hits without a referrer and hits comming from other domains except the website domain itself ( www.cnaa.acad.md):
> grep -v ‘ “ - ” ‘ new.log > new2.log
> grep ‘ http://www.cnaa.acad.md’ new2.log > new3.log
> sed ‘s / http\:\/\/www\.cnaa\.acad\.md//g’ new3.log > new4.log
The first grep removed NoReferrer hits , the second one selected only those lines that have a “ www.cnaa.acad.md” substring , thus excluding all hits from other domains .
The ‘ sed ’ command was used to remove the domain name from the log file .
This was done because for Apache2GDL the URL’s ‘ http://site.com/page.html’ and ‘/ page.html ’ are NOT the same .
Well , Fig2 has less noise in it , but not very useful .
I ’ll just mention that the few nodes we see at the corners represents the short time user sessions after they enter the site from a search engine result page .
Let ’s see what happens in the middle of the graph : zoom in and see which node has the most edges :
We can see that ‘ search.ns ’ node have a lot of connections .
This proves that the search facility is frequently accessed .
By already knowing how useful the search is , we can exclude the hits to / from search .ns in order to have a cleaner picture of how users are browsing the website .
But , instead of excluding nodes , we can go another way : we can group multiple nodes based on some criteria thus reducind the number of edges .
In our case , the grouping will be according to website categories .
The biggest categories of www.cnaa.acad.md are ‘ Theses ’ and ‘ Scientists ’ .
All url ’s that starts with ‘/ theses / ’ is a navigation page that finally leads to a thesis page .
A thesis page has the following format : ‘/ thesis / nnnn / ’ where nnnn is a number and represents the thesis ’s id .
There are a lot of theses nodes in the graph that just clutter the graph .
By replacing ” / thesis / nnnn / ’ addresses with ” / thesis / ’ we ’ll group all nodes into one .
Also url ’s of the form ‘/ person / nnnn / ’ that denotes a scientist ’s page will be replaced by ‘/ person / ’ .
> sed ‘s:/ thesis/[^/]\+:/thesis:g’ new7.log > new8.log
Notice the [ ^ / ]\+ in the sed regexp that means “ one or more char that is not a slash ” .
You see that the + sign is preceded by \ .
This is different from the perl version : [ ^/ ]+.
That ’s better !
It ’s obvious that grouping criteria is site specific .
To obtain a nice graph you need to know the url architecture of the website ( because urls are the only info you can get from access.log files ) .
If a website is well structured and has a hierarchical url architecture , you can group by the uppermost two or three folders , i.e. change ‘/ xxx / yyy / zzz / whatever / …/’ to ‘/ xxx / yyy / zzz / ’ .
Control the granularity level by adjusting the folder ’s depth .
Here is the regexp that pertains the first two levels ‘/ xxx /yyy / ’ :
sed ‘s :/\([^ /]\+\ ) /\([ ^ /]\+\ ) / [ ^ “ ]\+/:/\1/\2/:g’ new10.log > new11.log
I ’ll make another “ node grouping ” iteration :
The graph has become readable now .
But I see one more adjustment that can improve readability .
Why to display “ weak ” edges ?
Let ’s hide those edges with values that are 4 or less .
I modified the source of Apache2GDL and added a simple IF check that excludes the unimportant edges .
Ah , and I also excluded nodes that have only a few edges .
By the way , you can try different layout algorithms .
Although , forcedir is best suited in our case .
At the beginning I mentioned Google Analytics .
It offers a couple of useful reports : Navigation Summary , Entrance Paths , Entrance Sources , Site Overlay .
Below is a screenshot of the Navigation Summary report .
I think graph visualization will be a nice complementary tool .
The aiSee has a self - explanatory motto in this respect : “ A picture is worth a thousand words ” .
I described just one scenario of how graph visualization can be used in apache log analysis .
The intention was to create an overview report and see the whole picture , but the log file can be filtered to create some biased graphs .
Apache2GDL already have an URL based filtering option : “ The URL pattern should be set to the name of your domain ( example.com ) or a particular directory within that domain ( example.com / something ) “ .
( Remember that we had removed the domain name from the log files for our report ) .
Apache2GDL is a simple script , but it ’s just a proof of concept .
It can be improved by adding filtering options :
IP ranges – for example to create graphs based on geographical location ( compare the usage stats by country )
the number of connections an edge represent – the noise level can be greatly lowered by removing unimportant edges .
Color groups – different colors can be associated to the sections of a website based on URL pattern matching .
You have to zoom in the graph if you want to find what page a node represent .
It would be far more informative to color the nodes .
In conclusion , I ’ll emphasize that drawing a nice graph is a site specific task .
The intention of this article was to give your an incitement .
A graph representation is usually self - explanatory and is well suited for presentational purposes .
The information should be presented in a way that will enhance the assimilation by the audience .
P.S. I ’ve tried to apply the “ noise ” filtering ( edge&node removal ) before grouping nodes .
It should mark out single web pages instead of site categories .
Here is how the graph from Fig 4 . looks now :
I also decided to change the color of the nodes depending on URL pattern .
I really like the results : red : homepage , blue : theses section , yellow : scientists & doctoral students , green : normative acts , magenta : the search page and the nodes that represent all thesis ’s pages ( the blue ones are navigational pages ) .
White nodes are pages we are not interested in .
I ’ve also reduced the node ’s size .
Abstract
This paper presents a new intermediate format called Static Single Information ( SSI ) form .
SSI form generalizes the traditional concept of a variable definition to include all information definition points , or points where the analysis may obtain information about the value in a variable .
Information definition points include conditional branches as well as assignments .
Because SSI form provides a new name for each variable at each information definition point , it provides excellent support for both predicated analyses , which exploit information gained from conditionals , and backwards dataflow analyses .

The evolution of the PSP has been one of small incremental updates rather than drastic aesthetic and hardware reconfigurations .
Since its debut in 2005 the PSP has undergone two mild hardware adjustments with the PSP - 2000 and the PSP - 3000 .
While the 2000 series altered the handheld in terms of form -- slimming down the hardware by 33 % in weight , and 19 % in thickness -- the 3000 series made some notable functional improvements , such as a built - in microphone .
The 2000 and 3000 series ensured the continued success of the PSP brand across North America and Europe , many gamers have been clamoring for a full - fledged PSP 2 for months .
Although Sony has consistently denied that any such product is in development , rumors and predictions have been circling for over a year about a forthcoming PSP 2 .
Last weekfor the seemingly inevitable sequel to the popular handheld , citing hardware improvements like dual thumbsticks and a touch screen interface , but now we 've learned that our hopes and dreams for the system may be , in part , dead on the money .
IGN has learned from several credible sources that the PSP 2 is indeed on the horizon , and will be packing multi - touch technology .
According to our sources , the PSP 2 will feature a widescreen multi- touch interface comparable to that of the iPhone for both in - game control and menu navigation .
Unfortunately , we were unable to secure any additional details on the alleged new system , but this latest batch of rumors seems to fall in line with other recent claims orbiting the vast recesses of the internet .
This latest batch of rumors comes on the heels of an allegedly official Sony survey leaked by enthusiast blog , , which asked consumers what features would compel them the most to buy a new PSP .
Among the choices offered by the survey were a touch screen interface , Bluetooth support , an integrated hard drive , GPS , and nationwide wireless networking .
If true , the survey seems to further suggest that Sony is in the process of drastically revising the PSP 's core hardware .
We contacted Sony representatives for further comment on the matter , but their response was unsurprisingly straight out of the rumor - response playbook , " We can't comment on rumors or speculation .
" For more on the PSP 2 , stay tuned to IGN.com .

Professor Richard Dawkins has hit out at science teachers being " so ignorant of science " after a poll showed a majority backed the teaching of creationism in schools .
The outspoken Oxford professor was responding to research out last month by pollster Ipsos Mori which found 65 per cent of teaching staff backed its discussion .
Creationism remains a politically sensitive subject .
Many believe there is no place in science lessons for the belief that the Earth was created by God as told in the Bible .
And just one in four teachers agreed with the view that creationism should not be taught in schools .
Although a majority agrees science lessons are not the place for it to be discussed Prof Dawkins , author of The God Delusion , blamed Tony Blair 's attitude for current guidance from the Department for Children , Schools and Families .
" Tony Blair was always soft on that , " he told politics .co.uk .
" He would say things like ' in the interests of diversity ' and things like that .
I do n't know about the Brown government . "
Commenting on the Ipsos Mori poll , Prof Dawkins added : " I think there 's a misperception it 's kind of fair there are these two theories [ creationism and evolution ] .
If there were two theories , of course it would be fair .
There are n't . "
He added : " I 'm a bit shocked that science teachers should be so ignorant of science . "
Prof Dawkins was speaking as he supported the launch of the Atheist Bus Campaign , which will see bus advertisements bearing the slogan : " There 's probably no God .
Now stop worrying and enjoy your life . "
Though pleased with the adverts , which will feature on 800 buses in Britain , he said he would have liked to see different slogans used in ways which would address ways in which children receive influence on religious issues outside school .
" Slogans which I 'm particularly keen on are with respect to children - ' there 's no such thing as a Christian child ' , for example , " he commented .
" I think the automatic labelling of children with the religion of their parents is absolutely despicable . "
Revd Jan Ainsworth , the Church of England 's chief education officer , said both she and the Archbishop of Canterbury were against teaching creationism as if it was a scientific theory in schools .
She added : " Many schools rightly include the subject in RE lessons or in the discussion of the development of scientific ideas .
" Part of the role of education is to explore and challenge contrasting ideas and viewpoints , and to encourage students to debate these and reach their own informed opinions - and these discussions should include creationism . "
Questions over welds delay Bay Bridge project

Construction of the tower portion of the Bay Bridge 's new eastern span is running months behind schedule , amid questions over whether key portions being made at a Chinese steel plant are defective .
Inspectors hired by Caltrans to monitor the fabrication of steel girders that will support the tower 's roadway reported finding cracked welds last year , Caltrans records show .
The discovery has raised the question whether Bay Area taxpayers are getting a substandard product that could wear out prematurely and require costly repairs in a decade or two .
Caltrans and others in charge of the bridge construction say the welds are safe and that fixes have been made - but also say the inspectors interpreted the welding standards too rigidly .
Meanwhile , the inspection outfit that sounded the alarm has since been replaced .
" I can understand people being worked up about safety and quality with the welds , " said Steve Heminger , executive director of the Metropolitan Transportation Commission and part of a three - member Toll Bridge Program Oversight Committee overseeing the $ 6.3 billion bridge construction .
" But we 're concerned about being on schedule because we are racing against the next earthquake . "
Heminger , of course , is referring to worries about the safety of the existing eastern span , part of which collapsed during the 1989 Loma Prieta quake .
State transportation officials say that , as a result of cushion time built into the construction process , they still expect to meet their targeted 2013 date for opening the new eastern span .
But at the least , the months of delays caused by questions over the welds are expected to add tens of millions of dollars to the project 's price tag .
The welding holdup is reminiscent of the flap four years ago when union whistle - blowers said faulty welds had gone unrepaired inside pilings for the skyway portion of the span .
A resulting federal investigation came up empty - but not before it halted bridge work for weeks and cost taxpayers millions .
This time , the welds in question are contained in 900 bridge panels that are being assembled into football field - size deck sections that will stretch across the 1,800 - foot - long tower portion .
The sections were supposed to have begun arriving from China in October , but now they are n't expected to get here until at least April .
And " that 's the best we can do , " said Andrew Fremier of the Metropolitan Transportation Commission .
" It 's more likely this summer . "
The panels are being made by the Zhenhua Port Machinery Co. of Shanghai , which is fabricating most of the steel for the $ 1.4 billion signature tower on behalf of the span 's joint - venture builder , American Bridge - Fluor Enterprises .
ZPMC , as the company is commonly known , is the same firm that built the mammoth cranes that tower over the Port of Oakland - indeed , it builds 80 percent of the container cranes used around the world .
" This is not a fly - by - night operation , and they could n't command that kind of market share if they were putting out a shoddy product , " Heminger said .
Just to make sure everything was running smoothly , American Bridge put 50 employees on the ground in Shanghai .
Caltrans sent another 45 staffers and consulting inspectors to monitor the fabrication process .
Soon after ZPMC started production in late 2007 , however , the inspectors hired by Caltrans began finding problems - specifically , an unacceptably large number of welding flaws in the new panels - according to internal agency memos and e-mails turned over to The Chronicle under a Public Records
Act request .
In a memo dated March 6 , 2008 , supervisor Patrick Lowrey of the inspection firm MacTec Engineering and Consulting reported that as many as 65 percent of the more than 30 welded panel sections his office examined - either visually or using ultrasonic testing - failed to meet specifications .
The memos also reveal that the inspectors questioned ZPMC 's ability to handle the complex bridge construction job - and that they were frustrated by Caltrans officials ' demands that the project proceed despite the allegedly substandard welds .
On March 27 , 2008 , for example , Lowrey complained to his boss at MacTec , Jim Merrill , that Caltrans had shifted his team 's primary inspection role in China " to one of collecting and analyzing data to justify decisions to move the project forward despite not being in compliance . "
Lowrey said ZPMC had failed to provide most of the quality control documentation required under its contract with American Bridge and Caltrans , and had failed to produce a single test weld that conformed to the contract specifications .
Four days later , Merrill wrote to Caltrans principal engineer Peter Siegenthaler to complain about the " random weld quality " on more than 100 panels and recommended that the entire production be halted until ZPMC improved its welding process .
Caltrans officials , working with ZPMC and MacTec inspectors , say they eventually worked out a program to tag and repair all the bad welds .
But e-mails from inspectors show problems persisted .
On May 23 , 2008 , MacTec inspector Andy Velasco e-mailed his bosses to say that cracked welds on one deck panel had been replaced , but that the fixes had n't been tested to make sure they were done right .
On another panel that had been similarly repaired , Velasco wrote , his team did a spot check and found cracks in more than a dozen new welds .
ZPMC officials insisted that the redone welds did not need to be rigorously inspected , Velasco wrote .
Last month , Caltrans dropped MacTec from its three - year , $ 63 million inspection contract and replaced it with another outfit , Caltrop Corp .
Some MacTec officials suspect they were pushed off the job for complaining about the welds , something Caltrans strongly denies .
Caltrans Director Will Kempton said MacTec lost the job when its contract expired , and the state 's bridge oversight panel that he serves on recommended putting out the work to competitive bid .
Although MacTec was doing a good job , he said , Caltrop came in with a stronger presentation .
Whatever the case , Caltrans says as many as 100 bridge panels are now coming off the ZPMC assembly line each month , and it hopes they 'll start arriving in the Bay Area come spring .
After consulting with a structural steel expert from Lehigh University in Pennsylvania , Caltrans officials concluded the decks will be safe , and that the earlier problems were the result of strict weld standards that essentially allowed for no cracks .
In other words , a few minor cracks are OK .
" That is the role of the inspectors , to identify issues and problems , " Kempton said .
" When these issues are raised , we have to deal with them , and that 's what we did . "
And while " yes , we did modify the acceptance criteria " for the welded bridge sections , Kempton said , " we developed what we think are acceptable standards . "
As for how much the delays have added to the bridge 's overall price tag ?
Ultimately , Kempton said , that could depend on just how much time ZPMC can shave off the job by speeding up the remaining fabrication .
" I 'm not going to speculate on the costs ... in the paper , " Kempton said .
" That will be negotiations between the contractor and ( us ) .
" The bottom line is , we will have a safe bridge . "

Ruby for systems administrators
Harnessing the power of Ruby for more efficient systems administration
Ruby is a highly feature - rich , free , simple , extensible , portable , and object - oriented scripting language .
It has gained immense popularity of late on the worldwide Web .
This popularity can at least partly be attributed to the very powerful Web application development framework , Rails , which is written in Ruby .
Rails , or Ruby on Rails ( ROR ) , as it is called , provides a very powerful platform to very quickly and efficiently develop a Web application .
It is highly scalable and there are many sites on the Web that have been built using Ruby on Rails .
Besides the use of Ruby with Rails as a Web application development platform , there is another less - heralded side to Ruby , which is Ruby as a powerful scripting language , much in the same league as Python or Perl .
It has immense capabilities , owing to the availability of many built - in and external libraries , the power of which can be harnessed to solve a great deal of the scripting needs that might crop up in any work environment .
Systems administration is one such work environment that demands a lot of scripting for making things simpler and more efficient .
User management , Process management , File Management , Software package management , and other basic automation requirements are better handled with scripting than with monotonous manual effort .
Ruby comes in very handy in this scenario .
It has a good set of libraries for achieving this .
In this article , I will start with examples showing how Ruby can be put to use for simplifying some of the basic scripting needs of systems administration .
These examples introduce the capabilities of Ruby as a powerful alternative to shell scripting .
The examples definitely provide room for a lot of improvement and can be further enhanced or customized as seen fit .
After the basic examples , I will introduce a very powerful system administration library for Ruby called Cfruby .
This library incorporates a wide set of functionality to make systems administration and management easier .
For this article , I assume that the reader has a working knowledge of Ruby .
The basic examples that I present here use pure Ruby and hence should work on any UNIX® - like system supported by Ruby , as well as on Windows® .
For the more advanced Cfruby examples , you will need access to a UNIX system .
All the examples below have been tried with Ruby v1.8.4 on a Linux® box .
They should work with the latest version of Ruby , as well .
Ruby in action
The first example here searches for files that match the given pattern in the path specified and gives the detailed information of these files in a user - friendly manner .
This does n't depend on any command - line utility , but just uses Ruby 's built - in APIs for achieving the objective .
Hence , it will work on any platform where Ruby runs .
Also , it shows how powerful Ruby can be to greatly simplify such scripting requirements .
Here , it does not just emulate the * nix " find " command , but builds upon it , thus showing the customizing power when using Ruby .
Listing 1 . Search for files matching a given pattern in the given path and display their detailed information
require ' find ' puts " " puts " -----------------------File Search-----------------------------------" puts " " print " Enter the search path : " searchpath = gets searchpath = searchpath .
chomp puts " " print " Enter the search pattern : " pattern = gets pattern = pattern.chomp puts "----------------------------------------------------------------------" puts " Searching in " + searchpath + " for files matching pattern " + pattern puts "----------------------------------------------------------------------" puts " " Find.find ( searchpath ) do | path| if FileTest.directory ?( path ) if File.basename( path ) [ 0 ] == ?.
Find.prune #
Do n't look any further into this directory .
else next end else if File.fnmatch ( pattern , File.basename( path ) ) puts " Filename : " + File.basename( path ) s = sprintf ( " %o " , File.stat ( path ) . mode ) print " Permissions : " puts s print " Owning uid : " puts File.stat ( path ) .uid print " Owning gid : " puts File.stat ( path ) .uid print " Size ( bytes ) : " puts File.stat ( path ) .size puts "---------------------------------------------------"
end end end
In this example :
Lines 5 - 11 - Queries the user for the search path and search pattern .
Line 16 - Uses the Ruby ' find ' method from the ' Find ' class to traverse through the searchpath specified .
Line 17 - Checks if the file found is a directory .
If it is and it is not '.' , it traverses recursively into the directory .
Line 24 - Uses the ' fnmatch ' method of ' File ' class to check if the file found matches the pattern given .
Line 25 - 34 - Prints the details of the file , if the file matches the pattern .
Here is a sample output of this script .
Listing 2 . Sample output of the first example
[ root@logan ] # ruby findexample.rb
-----------------------File Search-----------------------------------
Enter the search path : / test Enter the search pattern : *.rb
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Searching in / test for files matching pattern *.rb
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Filename : s.rb Permissions : 100644
Owning uid : 1 Owning gid : 1 Size ( bytes ) : 57 ---------------------------------------------------
Filename : test.rb Permissions : 100644
Owning uid : 0 Owning gid : 0 Size ( bytes ) : 996 ---------------------------------------------------
Filename : s1.rb Permissions : 100644
Owning uid : 1 Owning gid : 1 Size ( bytes ) : 39 ---------------------------------------------------
One of the most common requirement during systems administration is to efficiently work with zip files for managing backups or to move a set of files from one machine to the other .
Ruby comes in handy here .
The second example , here , builds upon the first example , by incorporating a scenario wherein you would want to zip up the list of files you got as a result of the search .
The built - in zlib module helps in handling gzip files and is good enough for most cases .
But , here I will use another good Ruby library called " rubyzip " to create and work with zip archive files .
Please see the Related topics section for a link to download the same .
Also , note here that this example uses pure Ruby and does n't depend on any command - line utility being present on the machine .
Installing rubyzip
Download the ' rubyzip ' gem from the link provided and copy it into your system .
( It was ' rubyzip -0.9.1.gem ' when this article was written . )
Run gem install rubyzip - 0.9.1.gem
Listing 3 . Working with zip files
require ' rubygems ' require_gem ' rubyzip ' require ' find ' require ' zip / zip ' puts " " puts " ------------------File Search and Zip-----------------------------" puts " " print " Enter the search path : " searchpath = gets searchpath = searchpath .
chomp puts " " print " Enter the search pattern : " pattern = gets pattern = pattern.chomp puts "----------------------------------------------------------------------" puts " Searching in " + searchpath + " for files matching pattern " + pattern puts "----------------------------------------------------------------------" puts " " puts "----------------------------------------------------------------------" puts " Zipping up the found files ... "
puts "----------------------------------------------------------------------"
Zip:: ZipFile.open (" test.zip " , Zip:: ZipFile:: CREATE ) { |zipfile| Find.find ( searchpath ) do | path| if FileTest.directory ?( path ) if File.basename( path ) [ 0 ] == ?.
Find.prune #
Do n't look any further into this directory .
else next end else if File .
fnmatch ( pattern , File.basename( path ) ) p File.basename(path ) zipfile.add( File.basename( path ) , path ) end end end }
This script creates a zip named ' test.zip ' of the files found as a result of the search based on the provided search path and search pattern .
This example does this :
Lines 9 - 15 - Queries the user for the search path and search pattern .
Line 23 - Creates a new ZipFile , named ' test.zip .'
Line 25 - Uses the Ruby ' find ' method from the ' Find ' class to traverse through the searchpath specified .
Line 26 - Checks if the file found is a directory .
If it is and it is not '.' , it traverses recursively into the directory .
Line 33 - Uses the ' fnmatch ' method of ' File ' class to check if the file found matches the pattern given .
Line 35 - Adds the matched file into the zip archive .
Here is a sample output :
Listing 4 . Sample output of the second example
[ root@logan ] # ruby zipexample.rb
-----------------------File Search-----------------------------------
Enter the search path : / test Enter the search pattern : *.rb
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Cfruby - Advanced system administration
As the Cfruby site defines , " Cfruby allows managed system administration using Ruby .
It is both a library of Ruby functions for system administration and an Cfengine - like clone ( in effect a domain specific language or DSL for system administration ) . "
Cfruby is basically a package made up of two parts :
Cfrubylib – A pure Ruby library with classes and methods for system administration .
This includes file copying , finding , checksumming , package management , user management , and more .
Cfenjin – A simple scripting language helpful in scripting system administration tasks ( without knowing Ruby ) .
Cfruby can be downloaded as a Ruby gem or as a tar zipped file .
The gem way is the simplest and the easiest .
Get the gem and install it using the " gem install " comand .
Installing Cfruby :
Copy the downloaded Cfruby gem file into your system .
( Was ' cfruby - 1.01.gem ' as of the writing this article . )
Run gem install cfruby - 1.01.gem .
Cfruby should now be installed on your system .
Putting Cfruby to use
Now I will show Cfruby 's capabalities and how it can greatly ease system administration and management .
There are two basic ways to access the functionality provided by the Cfruby library :
Using the Ruby classes from libcfgruby directly .
Using the cfrubyscript wrapper , which provides a neater interface to libcfruby .
Using Ruby classes from libcfruby directly
Libcfruby is the core of Cfruby , a collection of modules providing a variety of functionality for making system maintenance and setup easier .
To use libcfruby you need to add ' require_gem ' cfruby ' ' to the top of the script , after installing the Cfruby gem .
This will give direct access to all of the core modules in libcfruby that can be used in the script in any way needed .
The only disadvantage with this method is that it libcfruby is big and has all the classes and methods stacked into their own namespaces .
So , to access any of the classes , you would need to qualify it with the namespace .
For example , libcfruby provides a method to get the type of your system .
To get that , you need to do something like this :
Listing 5 . Getting the type of OS using libcfruby
require ' rubygems ' require_gem ' cfruby ' os = Cfruby : : OS ::OSFactory.new.get_os( ) puts ( os.name )
This is just to get the name of your operating system .
So , as you do more with libcfruby , your script will become a lot more cluttered with all the namsepace specifications .
This is where the next method of using Cfruby comes in handy .
Using the cfrubyscript wrapper , which provides a neater interface to libcfruby
To use the cfrubyscript wrapper , you need to add :
Listing 6 .
Using cfrubyscript
require ' rubygems ' require_gem ' cfruby ' require ' libcfruby/cfrubyscript '
Doing this includes cfrubyscript into your script , which gives a nice and simpler interface to access the functionality of libcfruby .
What cfrubyscript achieves is :
It exports a set of variables to the global namespace like $ os , $ pkg , $user , $ proc , and $ sched .
It pulls most of the major modules into the main namespace , so you can call FileEdit . set instead of Cfruby : : FileEdit.set .
It adds a number of helper methods to String and Array that do Cfruby things ( install programs , edit files , and more ) .
It also gives you a nice logger .
So , no more namespace specification clutter in your scripts .
The same example above of getting the type of OS of your system now becomes :
Listing 7 .
Getting the type of OS using cfrubyscript
require ' rubygems ' require_gem ' cfruby ' require ' libcfruby/cfrubyscript ' puts ( $os.name )
It just translates into one single call , using the global variable $ os .
Cfruby is really powerful and provides a wide variety of functionality to manage * nix - like systems .
Now look at a few of them and some basic examples of using them .
User management
One of the most common and most important tasks in any systems administration is the management of users and groups .
Cfruby provides a powerful set of methods to achieve it in a portable and simple manner .
This is achieved by using the UserManager object that can be obtained from the OS module , like below .
Listing 8 . Getting the UserManager object using libcfruby
require ' rubygems ' require_gem ' cfruby ' osfactory = Cfruby : : OS ::OSFactory.new ( ) os = osfactory.get_os ( ) usermgr = os.get_user_manager ( )
If you go the cfrubyscript way , there will already be a global user manager object available as $user , which can be directly used to invoke the methods .
I will follow this method as it is much simpler and easier to read .
Here is how to use it to create and delete a user .
Listing 9 .
User management using cfgrubyscript
require ' rubygems ' require_gem ' cfruby ' require ' libcfruby/cfrubyscript ' $ user.adduser(' newusername ' , ' password ' ) $ user.deleteuser('usernametodelete ' , true )
What does it do ?
Lines 1 , 2 – As usual , here is included libcfruby and cfrubyscript into the script .
Line 3 – This creates a new user with the username as ' newusername ' and with the password specified as the second argument .
Line 4 – This deletes the user with username as ' usernametodelete . '
The second argument is either true or false , to specify whether to delete the home directory of the user being deleted .
Similarly , group operations are possible by using the addgroup ( ) and deletegroup ( ) methods in the UserManager object .
Process management
The other important task of an administrator is to keep a track of the processes running on the system and manage them .
Cfruby comes in handy here as well , providing the means to handle processes efficiently .
You can do this with Cfruby .
Listing 10 .
Process management using cfgrubyscript
require ' rubygems ' require_gem ' cfruby ' require ' libcfruby/cfrubyscript ' $ proc.kill ( $proc.vim ) ' ps – aef'.exec ( )
What does it do ?
Line 3 – Uses the global Process Manager object $ proc to kill the ' vim ' process specified as the argument .
$ proc.vim is a Process Info - type object of the ' vim ' process running on the system .
These are automatically created by the cfrubyscript .
Line 4 – Starts a new process with the specified command ' ps –aef . '
You can directly invoke the exec method from your command string .
Package management
Managing the software on the system is another task that a systems administrator has to take care of .
Cfruby provides methods to easily install and remove software from the system .
Listing 11 .
Package management using cfgrubyscript
require ' rubygems ' require_gem ' cfruby ' require ' libcfruby / cfrubyscript ' all = $ pkg.packages ( ) installed = $ pkg.installed_packages ( ) ruby.install ( )
What does it do ?
Line 3 – Uses the global $ pkg Package Manager object created by cfrubyscript and gets all the packages available on the system by calling the packages ( ) method .
Line 4 – This gets the list of all installed packages .
Line 5 – This installs the Ruby package by invoking the install method .
You are able to directly invoke the install helper method from the package name itself .
This is the level to which things are simplified .
File management
Cfruby also helps in managing the files on the system .
Creating , editing , deleting , changing ownership , and changing permissions and more are easily achieved with the methods provided by Cfruby
Listing 12 .
File management using cfgrubyscript
require ' rubygems ' require_gem ' cfruby ' require ' libcfruby/cfrubyscript ' ' /etc/ssh'.chown_mod( ' root ' , ' wheel ' , ' u=rw , g=r , o-rwx ' , `:recursive` => true )
What does it do ?
Line 3 – Changes the owner and group and the permissions of the file ' / etc/ssh . '
Directly invokes the chown_mod ( ) method from the file itself .
This is again made possible by cfrubyscript 's helper objects and methods .
Note how it takes just one line to achieve this .
So , the above examples should have given you an idea as to how powerful Cfruby is and how easy it is to use it to administer and manage systems in an easy and efficient manner .
Also , it makes the whole task of systems administration more easy and more fun with the higly intuitive set of classes and methods that it provides .
There is lot more to know about Cfruby and its complete set of functionality .
It has a good set of documentation to go with it .
I suggest that you take a look at the documents to unleash the full power of this Ruby library .
Please look at the resources section for the links .
Summary
Ruby is not just for Web application development working with the Rails framework .
It can also be used as a powerful as a scripting language and a very good alternative to the usual shell scripting , commonly used to achieve the scripting needs in systems adminstration .
With its set of built - in modules and a few external libraries , Ruby can make systems adminstration more efficient and definitely much more fun .
Ruby is a very useful and powerful tool that is a must - have tool in every system administrator 's toolbox .

Israel 's defence Minister , Ehud Barak , warned yesterday that his country was engaged in " a war to the bitter end " with Hamas as a third day of fierce bombing brought the estimated Gaza death toll to 320 .
Two Israelis were killed in retaliatory rocket barrages last night as Hamas struck deep inside Israeli territory .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Mr Barak 's declaration to the Knesset – the Israeli parliament – came as Israel continued its comprehensive bombardment of Hamas targets after overnight aerial attacks that devastated large parts of the Interior Ministry and the Islamic University .
Amid signs of increased international restiveness about the Palestinian death toll , Mr Barak insisted that " we have nothing against Gaza residents " but added : " We are engaged in an all - out war against Hamas and its proxies .
This operation will expand and deepen as much as needed . "
As Israel launched a further 20 air attacks and declared Israeli communities to the border area a " closed military zone " for the first time , Gaza militants continued to fire more than 70 rockets and mortars at southern Israel .
One killed an Israeli in Ashdod – 18 miles away from Gaza – for the first time .
Another Israeli was killed in the border kibbutz of Nahal Oz .
After the earlier death of an Israeli Arab construction worker in a rocket attack in Ashkelon , the total of Israeli deaths since the Israeli bombardment began on Saturday is now four .
As the international outcry mounted over the scale of the Israeli crackdown , the Prime Minister 's spokesman issued a robust statement , saying Gordon Brown had been " appalled " by the continuing violence in Gaza .
The Foreign Secretary , David Miliband , spoke of the " unacceptable " loss of human life .
European foreign ministers scheduled an emergency meeting in Paris today .
But as President George Bush continued to blame Hamas for the worst violence in Gaza in living memory , the UN secretary general , Ban Ki-moon , criticised Israel 's " excessive " force and urged the international community to do more .
" I think regional and international partners have not done enough .
They should do more , " Mr Ban said , in a rare departure from the diplomatic norm .
" They should use all possible means to end the violence and encourage political dialogue , emphasising peaceful ways of resolving differences . "
But with troops , tanks , armoured vehicles and reportedly artillery stationed around Gaza , Mr Barak said – even before last night 's rocket barrages on Ashdod and Ashkelon : " Unless the criminal fire at Israeli citizens stops immediately , Israel will utilise all the legal means at its disposal in order to halt the enemy 's aggression . "
Moussa Abu Marzouk , the Damascus - based deputy head of Hamas 's political bureau , ruled out a truce in current conditions .
He said : " We are going to defend ourselves , defend our people and defend our land . "
He laid down as conditions for a ceasefire : " Stop all kinds of aggression , open all ( crossings ) , stop all the violence against the people in the West Bank . "
Meanwhile , the Israeli military said it had hit a Hamas truck carrying Grad missiles – which have a longer range than home - made Qassams – in the northern town of Jabalya .
It also said it had killed a senior commander of Islamic Jihad , Ziad Abu Tir , in a strike on southern Gaza .
For the first time since the bombardment began , the Israeli navy in the Mediterranean joined the attacks , hitting what the military said were Hamas vessels .
While hospitals and morgues were still full to overflowing , normal traffic was minimal , with many shops closed in populous Gaza City in the wake of a succession of strikes by F - 16s , combat helicopters and pilotless drones .
The Foreign Press Association protested at the closure of the Erez crossing into Gaza , saying that the " world 's media is unable to report accurately on events inside Gaza at this critical time " .
Journalists were also excluded from Israeli communities adjacent to the border , fuelling speculation that a ground operation could be in preparation .
As demonstrations by Palestinians were staged in several parts of the West Bank , Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum urged Palestinian groups to use " all available means " against Israel , " including martyrdom operations " .

Burning Windows questions we have n't answered ?
Tell us in the comments .
I explicitly do n’t want to go over the exact scenario that this is relating to .
I want to talk about a general sentiment that I got from several people from Microsoft a few times , which I find annoying .
It can be summed up pretty easily by this quote :
You all know that we work on the Agile process here , right ?
We get something out ( perhaps a little early ) and then improve it .
Codeplex is for open source and continuous improvement with community feedback .
The context is a response to a critique about unacceptable level of quality in something Microsoft put out .
Again , I do not want to discuss the specifics .
I want to discuss the sentiment , I got answers in a similar spirit from several Microsoft people recently , and I find it annoying in the extreme .
Agile does n’t mean that you start with crap , call it organic fertilizer and try to tell me that it will improve in the future .
Quality is supposed to be built in , it is the scope that you grow incrementally , not the product quality .
I actually find the open source comment to be even more annoying .
Open source does not mean that you get someone else to do your dirty work .
And if you take something and call it open source , it does n’t mean that you are not going to get called on the carpet for the quality of whatever you released .
Calling it open source does not mean that the community is accountable for its quality .

Bisu might choose Savior into his group just to remind him what Savior said to Bisu in the interview before the MSL gomtv S1 Finals
Savior : " Bisu has to atleast win 3 titles to beat / challenge me "
now that Bisu has 3 titles he just might choose Savior but i doubt it and hope he doesnt .

After watching their GSL Bo3 ( WATCH IT if you haven't )
I 'm hoping for as much Flash vs Bisu as possible ( prefereably a Bo5 between the two , though if they HAVE to tussle in the group stages that 's fine too ^^ )
Other players I 'm rooting for : Nada !
FBH , Jaedong ... actually I like almost all players who 've made it into the group stages .
Just hope we do n't end up with 4 protoss at the end .
A bit too many PvP's in the Club day MSL for my liking .
Although considering the number of terrans that might not happen =P
Not on any of the comeback bandwagons for 2009 , though I do hope savior shows some strong play .
Lot 's of potential for great games from him if he does . =)

Its funny all the bad players are zerg or protoss , except go . go , but even that loser ( I hate him ) gets his unfair amount of wins .
If he is lucky with grouping FBH could be the upset winner of this msl .
I 'm praying jaedong / bisu / flash / stork / kal and yell0w are far away from each other .
esp I want jaedong as far as way from kal as possible .
Kal is the only protoss who always plays better then jaedong ( only against jaedong ) , even when he lost finals he played better .
I want bisu and jaedong to get luckbox draws to the fiinals
That terran lineup is crazy .
I do n't think I 've ever seen such a completely solid groups before .

Would be funny having a group of Fbh savior much and hwasin / go. go .
When savior beats either fbh / bisu straight up is when we can say that hes back .
Besides Effort i think zero has potential to be next big zerg .
Either he always was this good and he had some bad luck with nerves because some of his early games were really bad or he improved a lot .

Wall Street ’s crisis spells deepening attacks on average New Yorkers
By Sandy English
17 December 2008
The rapid deepening of the capitalist economic crisis has shown how fragile the social rights of the working class are .
Job losses , utility cutoffs and evictions from homes and apartments continue to increase , and budget cuts in education , healthcare , and social and essential services are mounting .
Nowhere is this process more intense and concentrated than in New York City and its surrounding communities , home to more than 18 million people .
The New York metropolitan area , with one of the highest poverty rates in the United States and its highest concentration of multimillionaires and billionaires , provides the nation ’s most graphic expression of social inequality .
Since August , massive layoffs in a number of industries , including the city ’s massive financial sector , have led to a deterioration of living standards for the entire working class in and around the city , ranging from the poorest layers to better - off professionals .
To compound the social misery of the working class , because of falling tax revenue from Wall Street , both the New York State government under Democratic Governor David Paterson and the city government under billionaire Mayor Michael Bloomberg have announced sweeping budget cuts that will affect education , agencies that serve the homeless , and Medicare for the poor and the elderly .
Bloomberg announced last week that city agencies must slash $ 1.4 billion from their budgets next year .
Rising unemployment
As of October — before many of the recent mass layoffs had taken effect — 225,000 New York City residents were unemployed , according to a report issued last week by the watchdog Fiscal Policy Institute ( FPI ) .
Only a third of these workers receive unemployment benefits .
Even so , among this smaller section , the number has shot up 75 percent since October 2007 .
The New York Times quoted the FPI ’s chief economist and author of the report , James Parrott , as saying , “ Unemployment is starting to shoot up in New York City , and it ’s affecting a spectrum of workers , both professionals and blue - collar .
It ’s hitting young workers and older workers and it ’s poised to rise dramatically in the weeks and months ahead . ”
The report cites a 50 percent increase in the number of workers with a college education or higher filing for unemployment benefits , reflecting the substantial job losses among professional layers .
One industry particularly hard hit is the information sector , which includes many Internet workers .
As the online Information Week observed , “ One of the worse IT job markets right now for new jobs is the New York City metro area , which has been hit hard by layoffs in the financial world . ”
The FPI report registers a 41 percent increase between October and the same period a year ago in filings for unemployment benefits for those aged 20 - 25 and a 46 percent increase for those aged 60 - 65 .
The number of blue - collar workers filing for benefits increased by 50 percent , and people who work in private households , overwhelmingly poor immigrants , filed at a rate 75 percent higher than a year ago .
Also skewing the jobless rate , particularly for poorer layers of the working class , is the persistent misclassification of workers as “ independent contractors ” in the residential construction industry , which employs many immigrants from Mexico , China , and the Caribbean and South Asia .
“ Misclassification , ” the FPI report says , “ is done to avoid employer responsibility for payroll taxes , health and other employee benefits , paid time off , and other labor protections . …
[ T ]he number of construction workers who have lost jobs is probably greater than the payroll numbers indicate . ”
The New York City Comptroller ’s Office anticipates a further loss of 175,000 jobs in the next year , roughly double the estimate that state budget offices made five months ago .
The FPI report notes that this number is smaller than 340,000 jobs lost in the city during the 1989 - 1993 downturn and during the 2001 - 2003 recession , when 221,000 jobs were lost .
However , the report observes , “ the unprecedented nature of the current economic crisis makes any forecast fraught with uncertainty so it is conceivable that this downturn could be very long and drawn out and result in a greater cumulative job decline . ”
The number of people filing for unemployment in the city and across the state has already become so large that an unprepared New York State department of unemployment is planning to double its staff by the end of December to overcome long wait times .
Unemployment call centers will also extend their operating hours .
The New York Post reported recently that nearly 1,000 people lined up on Fifth Avenue outside the Pierre Hotel , which has been undergoing renovations and will reopen in the spring , to apply for 200 positions .
Some people showed up as early as 6 a.m .
More foreclosures and evictions
According to Crain ’s New York Business.com , in the third quarter of 2008 , 3.5 percent of the area ’s home mortgage borrowers were seriously delinquent on their payments .
While this is lower than the national average , it still marks an increase of 50 percent since last year .
One forecast reported earlier this month on Crain ’s anticipates the number of home loan borrowers seriously delinquent on their mortgages to double in the next year .
Serious delinquency — missing mortgage payments for three months or more — is considered a precursor of foreclosure .
Not only homeowners are affected .
According to a recent investigation by the New York Daily News , since mid-April there have been 1,538 evictions of renters in foreclosed housing in the city ’s boroughs outside of Manhattan .
A study by the Fruman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University estimated that in 2007 , at least 38,000 renters were affected by foreclosures in the city .
In the borough of Queens , in particular , housing courts are dealing with eviction petitions from banks that own foreclosed properties .
The News noted : “ Banks there have filed 871 foreclosure - related evictions between April 21 and Oct. 17 involving 480 properties , records show . ”
According to court records reviewed by the newspaper , other figures for evictions since April include Rochdale Village in South Jamaica ( 41 evictions ) , Far Rockaway ( 38 ) and South Ozone Park ( 32 ) .
“ We ’ve certainly seen increases , especially in Queens and Staten Island , ” said Louise Seeley , executive director of the nonprofit advocacy group , the City - wide Task Force on Housing Court .
“ In the same period , Brooklyn had the second - highest number of foreclosure - related evictions , at 351 .
Staten Island had 195 , followed by the Bronx with 121 evictions Relatively few evictions occurred in Manhattan , where a vastly different housing stock has been largely unaffected by the foreclosure virus . ”
Wealthier suburban areas have also seen a foreclosure surge .
Westchester County , just north of the city , boasts one of highest per capita income rates in the state , yet by December , it had recorded 2,431 foreclosure filings and foreclosures , up by almost 59 percent since 2007 .
Statewide , foreclosure filings increased 19 percent during the third quarter compared to a year earlier , the state ’s banking department said .
An increase in homelessness
More than 35,000 people live in New York City homeless shelters , the majority of them families with children .
According to the web site of the Coalition for the Homeless , the most recent city figures show that 1,446 families entered shelters in September .
That was the highest number in a single month since the city began keeping statistics 25 years ago .
New York has seen record numbers of families admitted to shelters in each of the last three months .
The Coalition ’s web site notes : “ Despite evidence of rising family homelessness , Governor Paterson , Mayor Bloomberg , and State and City officials are planning dramatic budget cutbacks in vital services — building on recent cuts in homelessness prevention and other services .
The current city budget already includes more than $ 3 million in cutbacks to homelessness prevention programs , while the State has also reduced funding for prevention and other vital homeless services . ”
Thousands more sleep on the streets each night .
The billionaire mayor ’s budget cuts will reduce by 51 percent the capacity at city drop - in homeless shelters and at churches and synagogues , which mostly serve this population , who are often emotionally or mentally disturbed .
The city also will cut the number of the drop - in centers , which serve the homeless who live on the streets , from nine to seven .
Shortfalls in food aid
There has been a 28 percent spike in the number of people using food pantries and soup kitchens in the last year , according to the New York City Coalition Against Hunger ( NYCCAH ) .
At the same time , there has been a fall in corporate and individual donations to Food Banks in the city .
The Food Bank of New York , which provides 300,000 meals a day in the city , has seen a 40 percent decline in donations at the end of the fiscal year .
In a recent New York Times “ Q and A ” piece on hunger , Joel Berg , the executive director of the NYCCAH commented : “ Over all , one - sixth of New York City residents — 1.3 million people — are food insecure , a term used by the USDA to describe an individual who cannot always afford to obtain all the food that he or she needs .
Four percent of New York City residents ( 323,974 people ) are classified as having ‘ very low food security . ’
One - fifth of New York City children — 417,656 children — are food - insecure ; 341,888 are classified as having low food security ; and 75,768 are classified as having very low food security . ”
Anne Duggan of the Food Bank for New York City told Reuters : “ We ’re seeing more and more people coming to the front door and less and less food coming through the back door .
We ’re being squeezed from both sides and we have n’t seen the worst of it . ”
Transportation costs to rise
The Metropolitan Transit Authority ( MTA ) , which operates the city ’s public transportation , will seek a 24 percent fare hike in 2009 .
The Daily News quoted a statement by MTA CEO Elliot Sander that the Authority ’s budget gap widened to $ 1.2 billion and that “ draconian ” cuts and fare hikes were coming .
Any increase in fares will put further economic pressure on the millions of New Yorkers who depend on the subway and buses to get to work .
The News quoted a mail carrier from Brooklyn , Bryan Tate : “ I ’m on the borderline of middle class and poor .
You ca n’t just keep taxing us , fare - hiking us , and asking us for more and more without eventually breaking us , ” Tate said .
“ It ’s not fair .
You have these Wall Street executives throwing a party with [ money they got in ] a bailout and we ’re left holding the bag . ”
Cuts in education and libraries
As a result of city budget cuts , 475 Department of Education jobs are to be eliminated .
And each school will see a budget reduction of 1.3 percent .
Full - time teaching jobs are not yet being eliminated , but funds for custodial services tutoring , books , and after - school and weekend programs are being slashed .
The city has had to renege on its Capital Plan for schools , which had allowed for the construction of 76 new school buildings and the installation of wireless Internet access over the next five years .
The city now claims that it will put up only 42 new school buildings for 25,000 more K - 12 students .
The advocacy group Class Size Matters , in a report issued at the end of October , noted that “ approximately 167,842 new school seats would be necessary to eliminate trailers and other temporary spaces , relieve overcrowding and reduce class size to the goals in the city ’s state - mandated class size reduction plan . ”
Cuts of $ 69 million from the state and $ 11 million from the city to budgets for higher education have already had an impact .
Adjunct teachers at the City University of New York have been laid off , and students now face a $ 300 tuition increase next semester and a $ 600 increase next year .
These cuts come at a time when the economic crisis has closed the doors to private colleges for thousands of graduating high - school students in the city and increased applications to the city colleges .
Two - year community colleges in the CUNY system have experienced a spike in applications
Noting a similar increase in applications for the city ’s four - year colleges , the New York Times observed : “ In September and October — one - third of the application period for the spring semester — the number of applicants who made a CUNY college their first choice was already 15 percent greater than all of last year .
In some fields , like health services , the growth has been even more rapid , as much as 30 percent on some campuses . ”
Bloomberg has also proposed a 2.5 percent cut in subsidies to libraries and cultural institutions this year and 5 percent next year , which would almost certainly result in a reduction of hours for many branches .
Many children in New York depend on the library as a place to study , and tens of thousands of adults and children use the library branches to access the Internet because they cannot afford their own computers .
All indications are that these conditions are only the beginning of a massive and abrupt drop in the living standards , economic security , and social rights for all strata of New York City ’s working population .

CNN : Ecstasy successfully used to treat PTSD David Edwards and Stephen C. Webster
Published : Thursday November 13 , 2008
Print This Email This Dr. Michael Mithoefer is at the forefront of a controversial field of study .
He is leading a pilot study into using MDMA -- the pure form of the illegal drug ecstasy -- to treat depression and post traumatic stress disorder .
In a Thursday segment , CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta reported on Gail Westerfield , a Georgia woman who took part in Dr. Mithoefer 's trial , ingesting MDMA as a treatment for her PTSD stemming from a childhood assault and being raped in college .
" Some doctors say it 's the well known effects of ecstasy : Open alertness , euphoria , calmness , that could prove useful when it comes to therapy , " said Gupta .
" It can remove some of the obstacles in therapy and act as a catalyst to the therapeutic process , " said Dr. Mithoefer to Nature News .
Among the 21 patients in the study , those who received MDMA saw their mental well being improve more significantly than those on a placebo .
No major side effects were recorded in the study .
" Did it work ? " asked Gupta of Westerfield .
" Oh , absolutely , " she said .
" I had recurrent dreams since I was a little kid .
It 's like , I would be walking through a house and all the lights would turn out , and then this force would overwhelm me .
After the MDMA , I fought it once and it never happened again . "
In the four years since her last MDMA session , Westerfield has not experienced another nightmare , reported Gupta .

At what level are technology decisions made ?
Do the teams decide what tools and languages are used , or is it the architect , directors , the CTO or someone else ?
Assuming the team does n't make the decision , what happens if the team disagrees with the decision maker ?
What kind of hardware are developers given , and who decided that this was the ideal setup ?
If I want to reformat my Windows box and run Ubuntu , do I have that freedom ?
How much freedom am I given to customize my work - space ?
If my teammates and I want to convert our cubes into a common area with pairing stations , what kind of hurdles are we likely to encounter ?
How does the organization chart look ?
If there are 2 levels between me and the CTO , do I need to follow the chain of command , or am I able to go directly to the CTO if I feel it 's appropriate ?

If you 've ever read tips on interviewing then you know it 's a good idea to have questions ready to ask someone who 's just interviewed you .
If you 're not good at remembering questions under - pressure you should write down a few and take the note with you .
Most of my important questions are answered in the interview :
What does your software process look like , what tools do you use , etc .
However , I have a few questions that do n't usually come up during the normal course of an interview .
The last one is really my favorite .
People actually tend to be pretty honest about what they 'd like to change at their organizations .
Obviously , the answers are going to vary largely by the type of organization you are looking to join .
If you 're interviewing at Google , it 's probably not easy to get on the CTO or the CEO 's schedule .
So , I do n't think there 's right or wrong answers , but in context the answers can help guide whether the organization is a good fit for you .
JERUSALEM–International calls to investigate Israel over alleged war crimes in the Gaza Strip prompted Prime Minister Ehud Olmert on Sunday to promise military personnel state protection from foreign prosecution .
" The commanders and soldiers sent to Gaza should know they are safe from various tribunals and Israel will assist them on this front and defend them , just as they protected us with their bodies during the Gaza operation , " Olmert said .
Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al - Malki said after meeting counterparts from the European Union , Egypt , Turkey and Jordan in Brussels that Olmert 's comments should not preclude action against Israeli military figures .
" It does not mean there is an immunity against legal actions ... More of such efforts will be seen also in the near future . "
Last week , the military censor ordered local and foreign media in Israel not to publish names of army commanders in the Gaza war and to blur their faces in photos and video for fear they could be identified and arrested while travelling abroad .
Israeli media reports said the military had been advising its top brass to think twice about visiting Europe .
Speaking at a weekly cabinet meeting , Olmert said Israel 's justice minister would consult the country 's top legal experts and find " answers to possible questions relating to the Israeli military 's activities " during the 22 - day war .
Some 1,300 Palestinians , including at least 700 civilians , were killed , medical officials said , in the offensive Israel launched in the Hamas - ruled Gaza Strip with the declared aim of ending cross - border rocket attacks .
The civilian deaths sparked public outcry abroad and prompted senior U.N. officials to demand independent investigations into whether Israel committed war crimes .
Ten Israeli soldiers and three civilians , hit by rocket salvoes , were killed in the conflict .
Israel said hundreds of militants were among the Palestinian dead and that it tried its best to avoid civilian casualties in densely populated areas where gunmen operated .
Rights group Amnesty International has said that Israel 's use of white phosphorus munitions – which can cause extreme burns – in built - up areas of the Gaza Strip was indiscriminate and therefore constituted a war crime .
Israel has said it used all weapons in Gaza within the limits of international law .
Its military , however , has opened an investigation into white phosphorous use during the conflict .
In a quick start to efforts by U.S. President Barack Obama 's new administration to shore up a shaky Gaza truce and revive Israeli - Palestinian peacemaking , his envoy , former U.S. Sen .
George Mitchell , is expected in Israel on Wednesday .
He plans to visit the occupied West Bank , Egypt and Jordan .
A Western diplomat said Syria was not currently on his schedule .
Palestinians have lobbied for a tougher international response to Israel 's military crackdowns .
Yet legal frameworks are problematic .
The International Criminal Court in The Hague has no jurisdiction to investigate in the Gaza Strip , as it is not a state .
Though the Palestinian Authority has been functioning as an interim sovereign polity since 1993 , it was forced out of Gaza last year by Hamas after the Islamists won an election .

And while Israel has not signed the Rome Statute that enshrined the ICC , it can still be investigated , but that would require a U.N. Security Council mandate .
Any such proposal would probably be vetoed by Israel 's ally , the United States .
Some European nations allow for war crimes lawsuits to be filed privately against members of Israel 's security services .

It looks like 20th Century Fox is settling in on a name for this film , in fact they ’ve already already taken the web domain DragonballEvolutionmovie.com .
For a generation of anime fanboys ( and fangurls ) Dragonball has a cherished place in their childhood , and I hope Hollywood does n’t get it wrong ( although from what I ’ve seen Im not too hopeful ) :
Dragonball Gets a New Title ?
“ 20th Century Fox may have extended the title of its upcoming “ Dragon Ball ” adaptation to Dragonball Evolution .
If it ’s indeed the new title the studio is going with , we should find out for sure soon .
Written and directed by James Wong , the big screen version stars Justin Chatwin , James Marsters , Jamie Chung , Emmy Rossum , Eriko Tamura , Joon Park , Chow Yun -Fat , Texas Battle , Randall Duk Kim and Ernie Hudson .
Opening in theaters on April 8 , the film is based on the manga created by Akira Toriyama . ”
At the request of the Federal Trade Commission , a U.S. district court has issued a temporary halt to a massive “ scareware ” scheme , which falsely claimed that scans had detected viruses , spyware , and illegal pornography on consumers ’ computers .
According to the FTC , the scheme has tricked more than one million consumers into buying computer security products such as WinFixer , WinAntivirus , DriveCleaner , ErrorSafe , and XP Antivirus .
The court also froze the assets of those responsible for the scheme , to preserve the possibility of providing consumers with monetary redress .
According to the FTC ’s complaint , the defendants used an elaborate ruse that duped Internet advertising networks and popular Web sites into carrying their advertisements .
The defendants falsely claimed that they were placing Internet advertisements on behalf of legitimate companies and organizations .
But due to hidden programming code that the defendants inserted into the advertisements , consumers who visited Web sites where these ads were placed did not receive them .
Instead , consumers received exploitive advertisements that took them to one of the defendants ’
Web sites .
These sites would then claim to scan the consumers ’ computers for security and privacy issues .
The “ scans ” would find a host of purported problems with the consumers ’ computers and urge them to buy the defendants ’ computer security products for $ 39.95 or more .
However , the scans were entirely false .
According to the complaint , the two companies charged in the case – Innovative Marketing , Inc. and ByteHosting Internet Services , LLC – operate using a variety of aliases and maintain offices in various countries .
Innovative Marketing is a company incorporated in Belize that maintains offices in Kiev , Ukraine .
ByteHosting Internet Services is based in Cincinnati , Ohio .
The complaint alleges that these two companies , along with individuals Daniel Sundin , Sam Jain , Marc D’Souza , Kristy Ross , and James Reno , violated the FTC Act by misrepresenting that they conducted scans of consumers ’ computers and detected a variety of security or privacy issues , including viruses , spyware , system errors , and pornography .
The complaint also names a sixth individual , Maurice D’Souza , as a relief defendant who received proceeds from the scheme .
On December 2 , 2008 the FTC requested and received a temporary restraining order from the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland .
Under its terms , the defendants are barred from falsely representing that they have run any type of computer analysis , or that they have detected security or privacy problems on a consumer ’s computer .
They also are barred from using domain names obtained with false or incomplete information , placing advertisements purportedly on behalf of a third party without that party ’s consent , or otherwise attempting to conceal their own identities .
The order also mandates that companies hosting the defendants ’
Web sites and providing domain - registration services take the necessary steps to keep consumers from accessing these Web sites .
The FTC seeks to permanently bar the defendants from engaging in “ scareware ” marketing .
The FTC also asks the court to order the defendants to provide monetary redress to consumers or otherwise give up their ill - gotten gains .
As part of an ongoing effort to warn the public about the risks posed by scareware and other types of Internet fraud , the FTC has produced a new alert for consumers .
To learn more , see the alert “ ‘ Free Security Scan ’ Could Cost Time and Money ” at http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/alerts/alt121.shtm.
The Commission vote authorizing the staff to file the complaint against the defendants was 4 - 0 .
The complaint was filed on December 2 , 2008 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland .
NOTE : The Commission authorizes the filing of a complaint when it has “ reason to believe ” that the law has been or is being violated , and it appears to the Commission that a proceeding is in the public interest .
A complaint is not a finding or ruling that the defendants have actually violated the law .
The Federal Trade Commission works for consumers to prevent fraudulent , deceptive , and unfair business practices and to provide information to help spot , stop , and avoid them .
To file a complaint in English or Spanish , visit the FTC ’s online Complaint Assistant or call 1-877-FTC -HELP ( 1-877-382-4357 ) .

You ’ve decided to try your hand at photography ?
Congrats !
By this point , you ’ve got your creative vision and lots of exciting ideas but it can be tricky to determine which photography equipment you need .
But the real question is , where do you start ?
For photographers looking for the best , we ’ve compiled a list of ultimate photography equipment list that all photographers need .
Gimbal Stabilizer
It is essential to add a gimbal stabilizer to your photography equipment for beginners .
It holds your camera in place to prevent unwanted shaking and blurry shots .
These camera stabilizers work especially well for long exposure shots .
Use it for shots such as :
Landscape
Portrait
Street
For additional help against camera shaking , try adding a remote shutter release to your photography list for beginners .
It allows you to use a remote trigger connected and take a photograph without physically touching your camera .
Lighting Equipment
Lighting equipment is a must - have for your beginner and professional photography equipment list .
Use an external flash to create optimal exposures .
Use the Guide Number ( GN ) to calculate for accurate exposure .
If you do n’t want to use a flash , try a reflector .
A reflector is used to redirect light to the subject you ’re capturing .
Reflectors come in different colors and types and your needs will differ based on your current project .
Memory Cards
All photography kits for beginners must have memory cards .
We recommend having a handful of smaller memory cards on in case your card dies during a shoot .
The average photo is about 30 MB large .
Memory cards typically come in four sizes :
16 GB 32 GB 64 GB 128 GB
Lens Filters
Lens filters are important to add to your photography equipment list for beginners .
There are three main lens filters :
Ultraviolet filters ( UV ) Polarizing filters Natural density filters ( ND )
UV filters work to reduce haziness in your photos .
They also help to protect your lens from dirt , water , and dust .
Polarizing filters are important to define contrast in your photos .
They also work to eliminate glare and increase color saturation .
ND filters reduce the amount of light and can be especially helpful in extra bright settings .
Camera Bag
A camera bag is a lifesaver .
It helps protect your camera gear and provides an easy way to carry your equipment .
Depending on the size and amount of materials you ’re carrying , you can use a :
Messenger bag
Backpack
Do n’t want to carry around a bag ?
Try using camera straps to safely and easily transport your camera during longer shoots or in challenging terrain .
Cleaning Kit
To ensure your camera is getting the best care possible , invest in a cleaning kit .
They help to keep your camera lens clean and taking optimal photos .
Your cleaning kit should include :
Air blaster
Lens cleaning wipes
LensPen

Over the last 30 years human rights have triumphed .
They unite left and right , north and south , church and state .
The cosmopolitan world order promises the fulfilment of Enlightenment principles and an end to strife .
Yet human rights have only paradoxes to offer .
Despite the statements about a universal right to life , every day brings more atrocious news from Darfur , Congo , Palestine and Mumbai .
Despite pious statements about equality and dignity , at no other period has there been such huge economic gap between north and south or between the rich and the poor .
According to an Oxfam report in October , over 1 billion people do not have enough food .
Human rights are an expression of the human urge to resist public and private domination and oppression .
Their force unites Chinese dissidents , the defenders of refugees , immigrants and detainees of the war on terror as well as schoolkids in Greece .
In the hands of western governments however they have become the latest version of the civilising mission .
In the west , the rise of neoliberal capitalism coincided with the cosmopolitan and humanitarian turn .
The spread of human rights is not the result of the liberal or charitable disposition of the west exported to the south along with the second hand clothes offered to Oxfam .
Global moral and civic rules are the necessary companion of neoliberal capitalism .
Over the last 30 years , legal rules regulating investment , trade , aid and intellectual property have emerged .
The World Bank , the IMF and the WTO impose " economic restructuring " conditions on developing states in loan and aid agreements .
These constrain their ability to make decisions about wage levels , education , health and social security policies , they dictate the privatisation of public services and utilities and open trade while maintaining the protective policies for crucial western agricultural and manufacturing sectors .
Robert Cooper has called these arrangements the voluntary imperialism of the global economy .
It is an imperialism " acceptable to a world of human rights and cosmopolitan values " .
Economic rules have been supplemented by various treaties and rhetorical statements on rights which prepare the future world citizen , highly moralised and regulated , but also highly materially differentiated despite the common rights everyone should enjoy from Helsinki to Hanoi .
The ( implicit ) promise to the developing world that adoption of the neoliberal model of good governance and limited rights will inexorably lead to western economic standards is fraudulent .
Historically , the western ability to turn the protection of formal rights into a limited guarantee of material , economic and social rights was based on huge transfers of value from the colonies to the metropolis .
The necessary reverse flows are not politically feasible .
The successive crises and re-arrangements of neoliberal capitalism lead to dispossession and displacement of family farming by agribusiness , to forced migration and urbanisation .
These processes expand the number of people without skills , status or the basics for existence .
They become human debris , the waste - life , the bottom billion .
The new lingua franca of cosmopolitanism and humanitarianism presents the globe as a common symbolic space which promises prosperity , equal rights and perpetual peace .
But as Immanuel Wallerstein put it , " if all humans have equal rights , and all the peoples have equal rights , then we cannot maintain the kind of inegalitarian system that the capitalist world - economy has always been and always will be . "
Neoliberal capitalism 's " human waste " is presented as a natural disaster or inevitable life contingency and is abandoned to the magnanimity of philanthropists and the good will of pop stars .
When the chasm between the missionary statements on equality and dignity and the bleak reality of obscene inequality becomes apparent , the false promises of humanitarianism will lead to uncontrollable types of tension and conflict .
Spanish soldiers met the advancing Napoleonic armies , shouting " Down with freedom ! "
It is not difficult to imagine people meeting the " peacekeepers " of the New Times with cries of " Down with human rights ! "
Social and political systems become hegemonic by turning their ideological priorities into universal principles and values .
In the new world order , human rights are the perfect candidate for this role .
Their core principles , interpreted negatively and economically , promote neoliberal capitalist domination .
This is not inevitable .
If formulated differently , their abstract provisions could subject the inequalities and indignities of late capitalism to withering attack .
But this cannot happen when the critique of injustice is formulated in the terms of that which begets and supports injustice .
The usefulness of rights comes to an end when they lose their aim of resisting injustice .
PARIS 
More than six years after opening its doors , the International Criminal Court in The Hague began its first trial on Monday , as Thomas Lubanga , a former Congolese warlord , took his seat in the dock facing a crowded court and public gallery .
Supporters of the court have hailed the long - awaited trial as a momentous step for the tribunal , created to try large - scale human rights violations , while critics contend it has been far too long in coming .
Mr. Lubanga was taken to The Hague almost three years ago , and his case has moved in fits and starts .
Now , both sides see the trial as the institution ’s first full - scale test , one that will be closely watched by lawyers and human rights activists the world over .
Mr. Lubanga , 48 , once the leader of a powerful and violent militia , is accused of war crimes , including commandeering children under the age of 15 and sending them into war to maim and kill .
He pleaded not guilty to the crimes on Monday , which prosecutors said occurred in 2002 and 2003 during ethnic fighting in the Ituri region of eastern Congo .
Turf wars within the court , bitter legal squabbles and irritation among the trial judges had almost torpedoed the case .
Last July , as the trial was about to start , judges put a halt to the proceedings , citing legal and strategic errors by the prosecution , and said Mr. Lubanga should be set free , though he was ultimately kept in custody .
The judges said the prosecution ’s handling of evidence amounted to “ wholesale and serious abuse ” of the process and ruled that a fair trial was not possible at that point .
Roman structures at pre-Roman site of Baalbek ( Enlarge
Approximately 86 kilometers northeast of the city of Beirut in eastern Lebanon stands the temple complex of Baalbek .
Situated atop a high point in the fertile Bekaa valley , the ruins are one of the most extraordinary and enigmatic holy places of ancient times .
Long before the Romans conquered the site and built their enormous temple of Jupiter , long even before the Phoenicians constructed a temple to the god Baal , there stood at Baalbek the largest stone block construction found in the entire world .
The origin of the name Baalbek is not precisely known and there is some difference of opinion among scholars .
The Phoenician term Baal ( as the Hebrew term Adon ) simply means ‘ lord ’ or ‘ god ’ and was the title given to the Semitic sky - deity worshipped throughout the archaic Middle East .
The word Baalbek may mean ' God of the Bekaa valley ' ( the local area ) or ‘ God of the Town ’ , depending on different interpretations of the word .
Ancient legends assert that Baalbek was the birthplace of Baal .
Some scholars have suggested that Baal ( the Assyrian Hadad ) was only one of a triad of Phoenician deities that were once venerated at this site - the others being his son Aliyan , who presided over well - springs and fecundity , and his daughter Anat ( Assyrian Atargatis ) .
In the Seleucid ( 323-64 BC ) and Roman ( 64 BC - 312 AD ) periods , the town became known as Heliopolis , the ‘ City of the Sun . '
The sky / sun god Jupiter became the central deity of the shrine during this time .
Arguably the most important deity of the Romans and taking over the role of Zeus in the Greek pantheon , Jupiter was probably chosen to replace the much earlier worship of the Phonecian god Baal who had many characteristics in common with the Greek Zeus .
Many Roman emperors were of Syrian birth , so it would not have been unusual for them to have promoted the worship of the country 's indigenous deities under their adopted Roman names .
Whatever the nature of the pre-Roman worship at Baalbek , its veneration of Baal created a hybrid form of the god Jupiter , generally referred to as Jupiter Heliopolitan .
The Romans also assimilated the worship of the goddess Astarte with that of Aphrodite or Venus , and the god Adonis was identified with Bacchus .
Roman structures at pre-Roman site of Baalbek ( Enlarge
The origin and development of Baalbek may be considered from two quite different paradigms of prehistory , one the conventional approach that views civilization as having only begun in middle Neolithic times and the alternative approach which suggests that developed cultures existed in what is archaeologically known as the Paleolithic period .
Let us first examine the chronology of Baalbek from the conventional interpretation , following which I will discuss some amazing site anomalies that can only be explained by recourse to a far older and now lost civilization .
According to theories stated by the mainstream archaeological community , the history of Baalbek reaches back approximately 5000 years .
Excavations beneath the Great Court of the Temple of Jupiter have uncovered traces of settlements dating to the Middle Bronze Age ( 1900 - 1600 BC ) built on top of an older level of human habitation dating to the Early Bronze Age ( 2900 - 2300 BC ) .
Biblical passages ( I Kings , IX : 17 - 19 ) mention the name of King Solomon in connection with a place that may be ancient Baalbek ( “ And Solomon built Gezer and Beth - Horon , the lower , and Baalath and Tadmor in the wilderness ” ) , but most scholars are hesitant to equate this Baalath with Baalbek and therefore deny any connection between Solomon and the ruins .
Because the great stones of Baalbek are similar , though far larger , than the stones of the temple of Solomon in Jerusalem , archaic myths had arisen that Solomon erected both structures .
If Solomon had really erected the site of Baalbek , however , it is astonishing that the Old Testament has mentioned nothing of the matter .
After the time of Solomon , the Phoenicians became masters of Syria and chose the site of Baalbek for a temple to their Sun- god Baal - Hadad .
Little is known of Baalbek from this period .
The late 11th century BC witnessed the arrival of an Assyrian army on the Mediterranean coast but because Baalbek is not mentioned alongside the names of other Phonecian cities , it has been assumed that Baalbek was an obscure religious center with no political or trading importance .

The first - century AD Jewish historian Josephus tells of Alexander 's march through the Beqa'a on his way to Damascus , during which he encountered the city of Baalbek .
Following the death of Alexander in 323 BC , Phoenicia was ruled successively by the Ptolemaic kings of Egypt and the Seleucid kings of Syria until the arrival of the Romans .
The name Heliopolis , by which Baalbek was known during Greco - Roman times , derives from Greek association with the site beginning in 331 BC .
Meaning ‘ City of the Sun’ , the name was also used by the Ptolemies of Egypt between 323 and 198 BC , in order to express the importance this holy site held for the Egyptians .
A sacred site with this same name already existed in Egypt and the new Ptolomaic rulers may have found it provident to link the ancient sky - god of Baalbek with the Egyptian god Re and the Greek Helios in order to establish closer religious and cultural ties between their newly established Ptolomaic dynasty in Egypt and the eastern Mediterranean world .
In the historical writings of Ambrosius Theodosius Macrobius , a Latin grammarian who lived during the 5th century AD , the god of the holy place was called Zeus Heliopolitanus ( a Greek god ) and the temple was mentioned as a place of oracular divination , similar to such sites as Delphi and Dodona in Greece and the temple of Amun at Siwa in Egypt .
The golden age of Roman building at Baalbek / Heliopolis began in 15BC when Julius Caesar settled a legion there and began construction of the great Temple of Jupiter .
During the next three centuries , as emperors succeeded one another in the imperial capital of Rome , Heliopolis would be filled with the most massive religious buildings ever constructed in the far reaching Roman Empire .
These monuments functioned as places of worship until Christianity was declared the official religion of the Roman Empire in 313 AD , following which the Byzantine Christian emperors and their rapacious soldiers desecrated thousands of pagan sanctuaries .
At the end of the 4th century , Emperor Theodosius destroyed many significant buildings and statues , and constructed a basilica with stones from the Temple of Jupiter .
This signaled the end of Roman Heliopolis .
The city of the sun declined and lapsed into relative oblivion .
In the year 634 , Muslim armies entered Syria and besieged Baalbek .
A mosque was built within the walls of the temple compound , which was itself converted into a citadel .
Over the next several centuries , the city and region of Baalbek were controlled by various Islamic dynasties including the Umayyads , Abbasids and Fatamids as well as the Seljuk and Ottoman Turks .
During these years , Baalbek was ravaged by the Tartars in 1260 , Tamerlane in 1401 and was also shaken by numerous powerful earthquakes .

In the 1700 ’s , European explorers began to visit the ruins and in 1898 the German emperor , William II organized the first restoration of the ancient temples .
Following the lead established by the Germans , extensive archaeological excavations were carried out by the French government and later the Lebanese Department of Antiquities .
While a great deal of much needed restoration work was performed by these archaeologists , the analysis of the ancient origins and use of the site was limited by the prevailing academic view of prehistory which does not recognize the possibility of sophisticated civilizations in early Neolithic or pre-Neolithic times .
Particular structures at the Baalbek ruins can , however , only be explained by recourse to such extremely ancient cultures .
The ruins of Baalbek , situated on a large hill ( 1150 meters ) with an expansive view over the adjoining plains , are bordered on two sides by the town of Baalbek and on the other sides by agricultural land belonging to local farmers .
Within the sprawling complex are a profusion of temples and platforms filled with a stunning collection of fallen columns and sculptures .
The primary structures at the ruins are the Great Court ; the Temple of Baal / Jupiter situated upon the massive pre-Roman stone blocks known as the Trilithon ; the so - called Temple of Bacchus ; and the circular temple believed to be associated with the goddess Venus .
Let us briefly discuss the Roman constructions first .
The Great Court , begun during the reign of Trajan ( 98 - 117 ) , measured 135 meters by 113 meters , contained various religious buildings and altars , and was surrounded by a splendid colonnade of 128 rose granite columns .
These magnificent columns , 20 meters tall and of enormous weight , are known to have been quarried in Aswan , Egypt but how they were actually transported by land and sea to Baalbek remains an engineering mystery .
Today , only six columns remain standing , the rest having been destroyed by earthquakes or taken to other sites ( for example , Justinian appropriated eight of them for the basilica of Hagia Sophia in Constantinople ) .
Massive foundation stones of Baalbek ( Enlarge
The Temple of Baal / Jupiter was begun during the reign of Emperor Augustus in the late first century BC and completed soon after 60 AD .
The single largest religious edifice ever erected by the Romans , the immense sanctuary of Jupiter Heliopolitanus was lined by 104 massive granite columns , imported from Aswan in Egypt , and held a temple surrounded by 50 additional columns , almost 19 m ( 62 ft ) high .
The Temple is believed to have been consecrated to a triad of deities : Hadad ( Baal / Jupiter ) , the god of Heaven ; Atargates ( Astarte / Hera ) , the wife of Hadad ; and Mercury , their son .
As the vast temple complex expanded throughout Roman times , the so - called Temple of Bacchus was constructed in the middle of the 2nd century BC .
It is called the Temple of Bacchus ( the god of fertility and good cheer ) mainly because a number of its sculptured reliefs have been interpreted by archaeologists as scenes from the childhood of this god ( although some scholars argue this temple was dedicated to Mercury , the winged god of communication ) .
The best - preserved Roman temple in the world , it is sixty - nine meters long by thirty - six meters wide and is surrounded by forty - two columns nineteen meters in height .
At the beginning of the 3rd century a lovely circular temple was added to the Baalbek complex .
While early European visitors assumed it was a Venus temple due to its ornamentation of seashells , doves and other artistic motifs associated with the cult of this goddess , it is not known for certain which deity the shrine was actually dedicated to .
During Byzantine Christian times the temple was used as a church by Greek Catholics and dedicated to the early Christian martyr Saint Barbara .
Stone of the Pregnant Woman , weighing approximately 1000 tons ( Enlarge
The great mystery of the ruins of Baalbek , and indeed one of the greatest mysteries of the ancient world , concerns the massive foundation stones beneath the Roman Temple of Jupiter .
The courtyard of the Jupiter temple is situated upon a platform , called the Grand Terrace , which consists of a huge outer wall and a filling of massive stones .
The lower courses of the outer wall are formed of huge , finely crafted and precisely positioned blocks .
They range in size from thirty to thirty three feet in length , fourteen feet in height and ten feet in depth , and weigh approximately 450 tons each .
Nine of these blocks are visible on the north side of the temple , nine on the south , and six on the west ( others may exist but archaeological excavations have thus far not dug beneath all the sections of the Grand Terrace ) .
Above the six blocks on the western side are three even larger stones , called the Trilithon , whose weight exceeds 1000 tons each .
These great stones vary in size between sixty - three and sixty - five feet in length , with a height of fourteen feet six inches and a depth of twelve feet .
Three other even larger monoliths are found in a limestone quarry a quarter of a mile from the Baalbek complex .
The first , called the Stone of the Pregnant Woman ( Hadjar el Hibla in Arabic ) or Stone of the South ( Hadjar el Gouble in Arabic ) is sixty - nine feet by sixteen feet by thirteen feet ten inches and weights an estimated 1000 tons .
This stone lays at a raised angle with the lowest part of its base still attached to the quarry rock as though it were almost ready to be cut free and transported to its presumed location next to the other stones of the Trilithon .
A second stone was discovered nearby in the 1990 ’s and weighs an estimated 1200 tons .
A third , only recently discovered beneath the Stone of the Pregnant Woman , may exceed 1200 tons but its size and weight are estimates because its base has not yet been excavated .
Why these stones are such an enigma to contemporary scientists , both engineers and archaeologists alike , is that their method of quarrying , transportation and precision placement is beyond the technological ability of any known ancient or modern builders .
Various ‘ scholars ’ , uncomfortable with the notion that ancient cultures might have developed knowledge superior to modern science , have decided that the massive Baalbek stones were laboriously dragged from the nearby quarries to the temple site .
While carved images in the temples of Egypt and Mesopotamia do indeed give evidence of this method of block transportation - using ropes , wooden rollers and thousands of laborers - the dragged blocks are known to have been only 1/10th the size and weight of the Baalbek stones and to have been moved along flat surfaces with wide movement paths .
The route to the site of Baalbek , however , is up hill , over rough and winding terrain , and there is no evidence whatsoever of a flat hauling surface having been created in ancient times .
Baalbek Aerial View
Next there is the problem of how the mammoth blocks , once they were brought to the site , were lifted and precisely placed in position .
It has been theorized that the stones were raised using a complex array of scaffolding , ramps and pulleys which was powered by large numbers of humans and animals working in unison .
An historical example of this method has been suggested as the solution for the Baalbek enigma .
The Renaissance architect Domenico Fontana , when erecting a 327 - ton Egyptian obelisk in front of St Peter 's Basilica in Rome , used 40 huge pulleys , which necessitated a combined force of 800 men and 140 horses .
The area where this obelisk was erected , however , was a great open space that could easily accommodate all the lifting apparatus and the men and horses pulling on the ropes .
No such space is available in the spatial context of how the Baalbek stones were placed .
Hills slope away from where lifting apparatus would need to have been placed and no evidence has been found of a flat and structurally firm surface having been constructed ( and then mysteriously removed after the lifting was done ) .
Furthermore , not just one obelisk was erected but rather a series of giant stones were precisely put in place side - by - side .
Due to the positioning of these stones , there is simply no conceivable place where a huge pulley apparatus could have been stationed .
Great foundation stones at Baalbek
Archaeologists , unable to resolve the mysteries of the transportation and lifting of the great blocks , rarely have the intellectual honesty to admit their ignorance of the matter and therefore focus their attention solely on redundant measurements and discussions regarding the verifiable Roman - era temples at the site .
Architects and construction engineers , however , not having any preconceived ideas of ancient history to uphold , will frankly state that there are no known lifting technologies even in current times that could raise and position the Baalbek stones given the amount of working space .
The massive stones of the Grand Terrace of Baalbek are simply beyond the engineering abilities of any recognized ancient or contemporary builders .
Great foundation stones at Baalbek
There are several other matters about the Baalbek stones that further confound archaeologists and conventional theories of prehistoric civilization .
There are no legends or folk tales from Roman times that link the Romans with the mammoth stones .
There are absolutely no records in any Roman or other literary sources concerning the construction methods or the dates and names of the benefactors , designers , architects , engineers and builders of the Grand Terrace .
The megalithic stones of the Trilithon bear no structural or ornamental resemblance to any of the Roman - era constructions above them , such as the previously described Temples of Jupiter , Bacchus or Venus .
The limestone rocks of the Trilithon show extensive evidence of wind and sand erosion that is absent from the Roman temples , indicating that the megalithic construction dates from a far earlier age .
Finally , the great stones of Baalbek show stylistic similarities to other cyclopean stone walls at verifiably pre-Roman sites such as the Acropolis foundation in Athens , the foundations of Myceneae , Tiryns , Delphi and even megalithic constructions in the ‘ new world ’ such as Ollyantaytambo in Peru and Tiahuanaco in Bolivia .

LA PAZ , Bolivia , Jan 29 , 2009 ( UPI via COMTEX ) – The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration has removed all its agents from Bolivia , complying with orders by President Evo Morales , officials said .
The DEA began pulling agents out several weeks ago and the last agents left Thursday , the Los Angeles Times reported .
The development comes even as Bolivian officials say coca cultivation and cocaine processing are growing .
Morales ordered the DEA out in November , more than three decades after the DEA began working there .
He expelled U.S. Ambassador Philip Goldberg last year and the Bush administration has decertified Bolivia ’s anti-drug campaign .
Citing senior law enforcement officials , the Times reported this is the first time the DEA has been ordered to pull its entire operation out of a country .
Officials said DEA personnel would be redeployed to bordering countries , where they could monitor developments in Bolivia .
Morales , 49 , has led Bolivia for three years , raising taxes on foreign companies and using the revenue for senior pensions and increased public works spending .
Leftist - leaning Venezuela and communist Cuba have been close allies .
Bolivians voted Sunday to swing their country toward socialism and allow Morales to seek re-election this year .
– Article from United Press International on January 29 , 2009 .
TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Japan launched a satellite on Friday to monitor greenhouse gases along with seven smaller satellites in a mission that could boost business for the country ’s cash - hungry space program .
An H - 2A rocket No. 15 ( H - 2A F15 ) carrying Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency ( JAXA ) Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite ( GOSAT ) , known as " Ibuki " in Japan , blasts off from the southern island of Tanegashima January 23 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Kyodo
The H - 2A rocket , carrying the biggest number of satellites ever for a Japanese rocket , took off from the tiny island of Tanegashima 1,000 km ( 620 miles ) south of Tokyo , after a delay of two days because of poor weather .
“ The launch was a significant one for the peaceful use of space , since the satellite will contribute to tackling the universal issue of global warming , ” Chief Cabinet Secretary Takeo Kawamura said in a news conference .
“ I think the strategic implementation of space development and use will grow from now on . ”
The main satellite will enable scientists to calculate the densities of carbon dioxide and methane from 56,000 locations on the Earth ’s surface , which Japan hopes will contribute to global efforts to tackle climate change .
The greenhouse gas observation satellite separated from the rocket and is functioning normally , and four smaller satellites have also been successfully deployed so far , said a spokeswoman at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency ( JAXA ) , Japan ’s space agency .
It is still unclear if the other three satellites on board have been deployed , she said .
The mission is also a test for Japan as it sets its sights on the satellite - launch business in the face of competition from Europe , the United States and Russia , as well as newer entrants such as China and India .
China launched a communications satellite for Nigeria in 2007 and launched Venezuela ’s first satellite last year .
India has also heated up the Asian space race , launching its first unmanned moon mission last October .
Japan clinched its first commercial satellite order earlier this month , when South Korea ’s space agency asked Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to launch KOMPSAT - 3 , designed to take images of the Earth .
The launch will be in 2011 or 2012 .
COMPETITIVENESS
Experts hailed the KOMPSAT - 3 deal as paving the way for more business in Japan , although price competitiveness remained an issue .
“ Japan will try hard to bring costs down , ” said Yuzo Suga , professor of global environment studies at Hiroshima Institute of Technology who uses data from satellites in his research .
“ In the case of Earth - monitoring satellites , it ’s becoming important to have multiple satellites so the observation is constant .
Prices need to be kept low for that . ”
Japan cut costs for the latest H - 2A launch to a new low of 8.5 billion yen ( $ 96 million ) , but it faces tough competition .
“ Russia and China have a huge legacy of military space programs , ” said Lance Gatling , of aerospace consultants Gatling Associates .
He said Japan had made great strides on a limited budget , but that the price and limited availability of launch windows could hamper commercial launches .
Launch dates at Japan ’s Tanegashima station have to be agreed with local fishermen .

The latest satellites , including mini-satellites from JAXA , universities and private business , are being launched for free , but the space agency is considering charging for future launches .
More money would be welcome for JAXA , currently running on an annual budget of 188 billion yen ( $ 2 billion ) , just a fraction of NASA ’s $ 17 billion annual spending .
In another sign Japan is eager to expand its space program , it ended a decades - long pacifist policy last year separating space development from the military and passed a law allowing military use of space .
Japan ’s space program was in tatters in the late 1990s after two unsuccessful launches of a previous rocket , the H - 2 .
The program suffered a further setback in 2003 when it had to destroy an H - 2A rocket carrying two spy satellites minutes after launch as it veered off course .
But it safely launched its first lunar explorer last year and hopes to send astronauts to the moon by 2025 .

Perhaps this viewpoint also stems from the fact that typed text typically requires a machine to be properly done , ( whether it be a typewriter or a computer , ) because , in a way , machines are seen as being superior to the fleshy elegance of humanity .
After all , we do n't expect perfection of spelling or grammar in the mad scribbles of a physician , the love - notes we find wedged in the strangest ( and yet always most familiar ) places by our own special someone , or the handwritten letters we get from highschool students or children studying abroad .
Not convinced ?
Consider any science fiction film or television show - the machine is always far more capable , advanced , and less likely to make mistakes than the actors .
As a society , we 've grown to accept this odd fact , we 've almost been conditioned by various forms of media to believe that machines have been programmed not exactly to be perfect , but to be somewhat above the human mind in their analytical capacity .
To err is human , as the saying goes , but we expect better from the clearly legible etches left on the amorphous walls of cyberspace by the millions upon millions of individuals that go tracking through its depths every day .
After all , how hard is it to use a spellchecker , right ?
The report indicates that Mr. Haynes was an early proponent of the idea of using the agency that trains soldiers to withstand torture to devise plans for the interrogation of prisoners held by the American military .
These trainers  who are not interrogators but experts only on how physical and mental pain is inflicted and may be endured  were sent to work with interrogators in Afghanistan , in Guantánamo and in Iraq .
On Dec. 2 , 2002 , Mr. Rumsfeld authorized the interrogators at Guantánamo to use a range of abusive techniques that were already widespread in Afghanistan , enshrining them as official policy .
Instead of a painstaking legal review , Mr. Rumsfeld based that authorization on a one - page memo from Mr. Haynes .
The Senate panel noted that senior military lawyers considered the memo “ ‘ legally insufficient ’ and ‘ woefully inadequate . ’ ”
Mr. Rumsfeld rescinded his order a month later , and narrowed the number of “ aggressive techniques ” that could be used at Guantánamo .
But he did so only after the Navy ’s chief lawyer threatened to formally protest the illegal treatment of prisoners .
By then , at least one prisoner , Mohammed al - Qahtani , had been threatened with military dogs , deprived of sleep for weeks , stripped naked and made to wear a leash and perform dog tricks .
This year , a military tribunal at Guantánamo dismissed the charges against Mr. Qahtani .
The abuse and torture of prisoners continued at prisons run by the C.I.A. and specialists from the torture - resistance program remained involved in the military detention system until 2004 .
Some of the practices Mr. Rumsfeld left in place seem illegal , like prolonged sleep deprivation .

These policies have deeply harmed America ’s image as a nation of laws and may make it impossible to bring dangerous men to real justice .
The report said the interrogation techniques were ineffective , despite the administration ’s repeated claims to the contrary .
Alberto Mora , the former Navy general counsel who protested the abuses , told the Senate committee that “ there are serving U.S. flag - rank officers who maintain that the first and second identifiable causes of U.S. combat deaths in Iraq  as judged by their effectiveness in recruiting insurgent fighters into combat  are , respectively , the symbols of Abu Ghraib and Guantánamo . ”
We can understand that Americans may be eager to put these dark chapters behind them , but it would be irresponsible for the nation and a new administration to ignore what has happened  and may still be happening in secret C.I.A. prisons that are not covered by the military ’s current ban on activities like waterboarding .

Looping : for vs. doseq [ Update Aug 2012 :
This article describes a version of Clojure before 1.0 , but all the details related to macros and lazy seqs are still true in Clojure 1.5a3 . ]
Newcomers to Clojure are often surprised to find that for is not a flow - control mechanism , but instead a lazy - generator .
This may trip you up if you want side - effects : ( defn count - and - print - words [ text ] ( let [ words ( re-seq # " \S + " text ) ] ( for [ word words ] ; not what I want ( println word ) ) ( count words ) ) ) user= > ( count - and - print - words " What 's that blue thing ? " )
4
No words are printed , because nothing uses the return value of for and so , being lazy , it does nothing at all .
What you want is doseq : ( defn count - and - print - words [ text ] ( let [ words ( re-seq # " \S + " text ) ] ( doseq [ word words ] ( println word ) ) ( count words ) ) ) user= > ( count - and - print - words " What 's that blue thing ? " )
What 's that blue thing ?
4
But for has a lot of power that 's been missing from doseq , specifically nesting loops , : while , and : when .
In case you 're not familiar with these , here 's a quick example that just ( inefficiently ) lists the factors of the Fibonacci numbers under 100 : ( def fibs ( lazy - cat [ 0 1 ] ( map + fibs ( rest fibs ) ) ) ) ( def some - factors ( for [ fib fibs : while ( < fib 100 ) fac ( range 2 fib ) : when ( zero ? ( rem fib fac ) ) ] [ fib fac ] ) ) user= > some - factors ( [ 8 2 ] [ 8 4 ] [ 21 3 ] [ 21 7 ] [ 34 2 ] [ 34 17 ] [ 55 5 ] [ 55 11 ] )
Is n't that the most beautiful definition of fib ?
Alas , it 's not my invention .
Anyway , if I want to be able to have nesting , : while , and : when in an imperative , non-lazy loop , I 'll have to write a macro .
A good way to start is with an example of calling your macro .
Start with the simplest useful example : ( my - doseq [ i ( range 10 ) ] ( prn i ) )
The first rule of writing macros I heard somewhere that the first rule of writing macros is : do n't write a macro .
This is a cute way of reminding you to only write a macro when it 's necessary .
In this case it 's necessary because I want my - doseq to be able to define new locals ( i in the above example ) .
If my - doseq were a function and i was n't defined yet , the example would n't even compile .
So here are some ideas that I 've found useful when writing macros :
Do n't write a macro ( perhaps a function would do or the macro already exists ) .
Write an example usage ( start with a simple one ) .
Expand your example usage by hand .
Use macroexpand when your macro does n't work .
when your macro does n't work .
Experiment at the REPL
Break up complicated macros into smaller functions .
Our own looping macro I 'll demonstrate all these as we go along .
Write out by hand the code the macro should produce for this example : ( loop [ i - seq ( seq ( range 10 ) ) ] ( when i-seq ( let [ i ( first i- seq ) ] ( prn i ) ( recur ( rest i- seq ) ) ) ) )
Try that out to see that it prints 0 through 9 , just like it should .
Note that without the call to seq , passing in an empty collection ( instead of range ) would cause ( when i-seq ... ) to succeed when it should n't .
It 's an important detail to remember -- use seq to get a false value for an empty collection .
If you do n't understand the above loop , take a moment to walk through it -- it 's the foundation all the following examples are built on .
A macro for this simple case is pretty straightforward : ( defmacro my - doseq [ [ sym init ] & body ] `( loop [ sq# ( seq ~init ) ] ( when sq# ( let [ ~sym ( first sq # ) ] ~@body ( recur ( rest sq # ) ) ) ) ) )
The hand - coded loop is in this macro almost verbatim .
The backquote is what makes this work , and enables the placeholder magic : sq# for a temporary local name , ~ to insert a parameter , ~@ to splice in a parameter that 's a seq .
This is n't terribly impressive , though -- it 's almost a straight copy of how doseq is already defined .
Next up : nested loops .
Nested loops
First , the example usage : ( my - doseq [ i ( range 3 ) j ( range 3 ) ] ( prn i j ) )
Expanded by hand : ( loop [ i - seq ( seq ( range 3 ) ) ] ( when i-seq ( let [ i ( first i- seq ) ] ( loop [ j - seq ( seq ( range 3 ) ) ] ( when j- seq ( let [j ( first j - seq ) ] ( prn i j ) ( recur ( rest j - seq ) ) ) ) ) ( recur ( rest i- seq ) ) ) ) )
I 'm actually not sure if this one easier to expand by hand or to just write the macro to do it for you .
The pattern to notice , though , is that where our earlier expansion had the body , this one has another loop .
What we want is a function that produces the loop part , but which can be called again if there 's a nested loop : ( defmacro my - doseq [ seq - exprs & body ] ( let [ emit ( fn emit [ [ sym init & rest - exprs ] ] `( loop [ sq# ( seq ~init ) ] ; same loop as before ( when sq# ( let [ ~sym ( first sq # ) ]
~( if rest - exprs ; more rest - exprs ? ( emit rest - exprs ) `( do ~@body ) ) ( recur ( rest sq # ) ) ) ) ) ) ] ( emit seq- exprs ) ) )
The main loop is recognizable from the previous version , but now it 's in its own local function so it can be called again .
Where it used to simply splice in ~ @body , it now has an if to either recurse ( if there 's another nested loop ) or in the terminal case splices in ~ @body like it did before .
The use of `( do ~@body ) instead of just body may be a bit surprising , so let 's take a moment to look at why .
It shows up in a ~ expression inside a let body , so let 's strip it down to just that and see what goes wrong with a plain body : user= > ( defmacro tmp [ & body ] `( let [ ] ~ ( when true body ) ) ) nil user= > ( macroexpand '( tmp ( prn 1 ) ( prn 2 ) ) ) ( let* [ ] ( ( prn 1 ) ( prn 2 ) ) )
Can you spot what 's wrong with that expansion ?
What if you run it : user= > ( tmp ( prn 1 ) ( prn 2 ) ) 1 2 java.lang.NullPointerException ( NO_SOURCE_FILE:0 )
Both the prn 's get run , but then the first one 's return value is at the head of a list , so Clojure tries to invoke that return value .
The prn function always returns nil , and the attempt to invoke nil causes the NPE .
There a couple ways to solve this , one of which is to splice the whole body into a do : user= > ( defmacro tmp [ & body ] `( let [ ] ~ ( when true ` ( do ~@body ) ) ) ) nil user= > ( macroexpand '( tmp ( prn 1 ) ( prn 2 ) ) ) ( let* [ ] ( do ( prn 1 ) ( prn 2 ) ) )
By putting the word do at the head of the list , we get the behavior we want .
Implementing the : when filter
So now that nested loops are working , next up is support for : when and : while .
The main difficulty here is that the number of items our emit function has to consume each iteration depends on how many of these options follow the init value : ( my - doseq [ prod ( range 13 ) fac ( range 2 prod ) : when ( zero ? ( rem prod fac ) ) ] ( prn prod fac ) )
One approach to this kind of problem is to assume , for the moment , that the input to my - doseq was open to change .
What format would make it easiest to write the emit function ?
Perhaps : [ { : name prod : init ( range 13 ) } {: name fac : init ( range 2 prod ) : when ( zero ? ( rem prod fac ) ) } ]
By grouping the name , initial expression , and all options together for each nesting level of the loop , the macro could be written : ( defmacro my - doseq [ seq - exprs & body ] ( let [ emit ( fn emit [ [ bind - map & rest - binds ] ] `( loop [ sq# ( seq ~( :init bind - map ) ) ] ; changed to use : init ( when sq# ( let [ ~( : name bind - map ) ( first sq # ) ] ; changed to use : name ~( if rest - binds ( emit rest - binds ) `( do ~@body ) ) ( recur ( rest sq # ) ) ) ) ) ) ] ( emit seq- exprs ) ) )
This works , but is very awkward to call ... but that 's a problem we can solve later .
For now let 's make : when work , by inserting an if clause that defaults to true if no : when is given : ( defmacro my - doseq [ seq - exprs & body ] ( let [ emit ( fn emit [ [ bind - map & rest - binds ] ] `( loop [ sq# ( seq ~( :init bind - map ) ) ] ( when sq# ( let [ ~( : name bind - map ) ( first sq # ) ] ( if ~( or ( : when bind - map ) true ) ; new " if " clause ~( if rest - binds ( emit rest - binds ) ` ( do ~@body ) ) ) ( recur ( rest sq # ) ) ) ) ) ) ] ( emit seq- exprs ) ) )
If no : when clause is given , such as with the prod loop shown earlier , that part of the macro will expand to : ( if true ( loop ... ) )
This is slightly inefficient , but completely removing the if would make the macro significantly more complex .
Instead we 'll leave it in and rely on the JVM to optimize it away at runtime .
Implementing the : while limiter A minimal example using : while : ( my - doseq [ { : name fib : init fibs : while ( < fib 40 ) } ] ( prn fib ) )
That 's really a terribly verbose syntax .
I promise we 'll fix it soon .
To get the : while part working , a when clause is inserted to skip both the body and the recur when the test expression is false : ( defmacro my - doseq [ seq - exprs & body ] ( let [ emit ( fn emit [ [ bind - map & rest - binds ] ] `( loop [ sq# ( seq ~( :init bind - map ) ) ] ( when sq# ( let [ ~( : name bind - map ) ( first sq # ) ] ( when ~( or ( : while bind - map ) true ) ; new " when " clause ( if ~( or ( : when bind - map ) true ) ~( if rest - binds ( emit rest - binds ) `( do ~@body ) ) ) ( recur ( rest s q # ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ] ( emit seq- exprs ) ) )
Try that out to see that it works .
Edit November 5th : Good news ; after a few days and a ton of media attention it turns out that this was a false alarm , and Bournemouth Council says no bannings ever took place .
I 'll leave the original post as is below though .
----
Wow , this is very odd .
I actually wrote before about replacing Latin terms with English - derived terms here , but I do n't agree that banning the Latin terms is a good idea , and of course the other solution is to simply start studying Latin ( or Latino sine Flexione / Interlingua ) again .
The biggest problem is that there 's no clear borderline between Latin terms that everybody knows and those that most do n't ; in the middle you 're going to find a lot of terms like nota bene that a great deal still know quite well but others find completely foreign .
This includes bona fide , eg ( exempli gratia ) , prima facie , ad lib or ad libitum , etc or et cetera , ie or id est , inter alia , NB or nota bene , per , per se , pro rata , quid pro quo , vis - a - vis , vice versa and even via .
Its list of more verbose alternatives , includes " for this special purpose " , in place of ad hoc and " existing condition " or " state of things " , instead of status quo .
In instructions to staff , the council said : " Not everyone knows Latin .
Many readers do not have English as their first language so using Latin can be particularly difficult . "
i.e .
that is
ad hoc
existing condition
existere
conditio
The second paragraph shows the problem : the alternatives are more verbose .
Some of the English words I 've proposed for Latin terms have been less verbose , such as groundlaw instead of constitution .
Replacingwith , andwith ( two words that come from the Latinand , mind you ! ) just is n't going to work .
This comment from a supporter of the Latin ban is also ridiculous :
However , the Plain English Campaign has congratulated the councils for introducing the bans .
Marie Clair , its spokesman , said : " If you look at the diversity of all our communities you have got people for whom English is a second language .
They might mistake eg for egg and little things like that can confuse people .
not
In other fields ( e.g. anatomy or law ) where Latin had been widely used , it survived only in technical phrases and terminology .

1000th post
Steve J. at Radamisto notices that even though Barack Obama has n't even been sworn in yet , Sean Hannity is organizing the wingnuts already into a would - be force to attempt to stop him from enacting " radical " policies :
Since the election , Hannity has described his radio show as the outpost of " the conservative underground , " as if a show that 's legally on over 500 stations could be underground in any real sense of that word .
There is little doubt that there are many conservatives who think America will become a radical country under the Democrats and last night I heard on Mike Gallagher 's show of a group that is trying to organize these people - Grassfire .
They ask people to " join the resistance " and sign a petition that opposes what they mistakenly think will happen if unopposed .
They hope to have 1,000,000 signatures on the petition by Inauguration Day and right now , they are quite a bit short of that goal ...
Hannity has been embarrassing himself regularly lately by promoting every conspiracy theory in sight about Obama .
Expect the pace to pick up as the Inauguration approaches -- and really take off afterward .
Conservatives are expected to oppose Obama , naturally .
But only wingnuts will believe every bit of garbage thrown at him and spin it into a massive belief system about the looming oppression of a socialist state , yadda yadda yadda .
It probably would happen to any elected Democrat , but it will be even worse for Obama .
The German government has proposed regulations that will oblige local ISPs to apply a government - mandated block list .
The proposal , from the Ministry for Families , is designed to prevent access to child pornography .
Federal Family Minister Ursula von der Leyen told a conference in Berlin that a " binding agreement " with major ISPs will be available as soon as early March , Der Spiegel reports .
The proposed list would be updated daily and appears to function in much the same way as a similarly motivated blocklist maintained by the UK's Internet Watch Foundation ( IWF ) .
One difference is that IWF is independent of government and its list is applied on a voluntary basis by UK ISPs , whereas the German plan involves a state - administered scheme .
The IWF 's blocklist has become controversial of late , particularly because recent attempts to block offensive images in the Internet Archive 's Wayback Machine continue to leave the entire archive intermittently unavailable to some users at ISPs that apply the blacklist .
In December , the IWF responded to a complaint over images in a Wikipedia entry on Virgin Killer , a 70s album by German rockers The Scorpions , by blocking the content .
Once the filter came down surfers visiting the site from ISP who applied the control appeared to come from a single IP address , a factor that meant Wikipedia removed their ability to edit the " free encyclopedia anyone can edit " .
The image of a naked pre-pubescent girl contained in Virgin Killer remained widely available outside Wikipedia .
Days after applying the control , the IWF agreed to lift the ban , while maintaining that the Virgin Killer image is " potentially in breach " of UK anti-obscenity laws .
The two examples illustrate that blocklists , which serve a useful purpose in blocking offensive content , can be something of a blunt tool .
The German government blocklist can expect to encounter the same sort of problems hit by the IWF list of late .
German civil liberties activists are also concerned that the role of the list will be expanded over time .
Such a mission creep in the functions of the systems could , for example , allow a future hypothetical German administration to block access to abortion - advice websites or other content that somehow becomes " unacceptable " .
The minister rejected arguments that future censorship concerns are any reason to avoid applying a system to control access to content universally regarded as repugnant .
" Child pornography is a problem issue and clearly identifiable , " von der Leyen said . ®
Last Monday
I gave a presentation about Sustainable IT at the Big Microsoft Virtualisation kick off in Bellevue , Washington .
Tuesday that week my day was relatively free so my time was a jump ball – who in the Microsoft Analyst Relations team would grab it ?
Two business units stepped in ; developer tools and a group within Microsoft ’s game division .
ACES Studio is the creator of Flight Simulator , a software product even hardened Microsoft haterz love .
I was intrigued but I must admit I was also worried that meeting Shawn Firminger , manager for ACES , was going to be a bit of a waste of his , and my , time .
After all , I ’m an infrastructure analyst and troublemaker , not a games guy .
On the way over Sarah Tatone , the analyst relations rep from Waggener Edstrom , told me not to worry because the ACES division , with its new ESP platform , is about more than games - indeed it already has aviation companies such as Lockheed as customers .
Industrial applications of Flight Sim do n’t exactly sound like a developer - led or grassroots story , now do they ?
I need n’t have worried .
Not only was what I was to discover probably the single coolest initiative I have seen from Microsoft in the 13 years I have been watching the firm on a professional basis– but it ’s also very relevant to RedMonk for a number of reasons .
Battle Plans and Maintenance Fees
The agenda was to learn about ESP .
What ’s that ?
Microsoft describes it so :
“ Microsoft ESP is a visual simulation platform that enables organizations to create , deliver , and realize the enormous benefits of immersive simulations while gaining a strong return on investment that ’s not readily available from other simulation tools today .
Simulations built on Microsoft ESP engage users in immersive experiences with very realistic land , sea and air environments . ”
The key phrase there is land , sea and air .
Flight Sim after all is very cool but almost too realistic – not everybody wants to actually fly a plane .
But next up will be Train - SIM ( of course not everyone is train spotter either , but run with my here … ) , then automobile and underwater .
Microsoft basically wants to model the entire world as accurately as possible , embedding “ real ” physics into the system .
The ambition is stunning - and so is the work .
Microsoft is not only looking to establish a simulation of everything , but then to integrate it , with , for example , Virtual Earth .
The model will grow over time and become more realistic .
Currently , for example , if you ’re using Train - SIM , traveling through a particular geography , the foliage is going to be typical rather than actual - going forward though why not model every major tree on a route ?
Clearly doing so would require participation from world and dog , but that ’s not impossible with the internet as a model .
We know user generated content is capable of amazing things .
But once you know what the world actually looks like and behaves , you can begin to model changes to the system .
What if we deforested this area ?
What if we removed all the natural predators from a particular marine ecology ?
What if we banned all car traffic from a city ?
What might the alternatives look like ?
Microsoft ’s initial customers are likely to ask more prosaic questions .
Firminger had some truly scary statistics about the costs of keeping aircraft in flight for military training purposes .
Anyone for $ 7 k an hour for maintenance , per plane ?
The big difference now with Flight - SIM - it has evolved from game into a certified platform , which creates all kinds of new revenue opportunities for Microsoft , which will drive further evolution of the platform .
The US military already makes extensive use of gaming technology , which could be leveraged in planning for actual battles .
Import the street and then run scenarios :
If we attack insurgents on this street in Falluja what will be lines of site where we should position our own snipers and take out theirs ?
At the risk of getting carried away , could we have modeled the surge ?
Could technology like this have helped the military make the case for more feet on the ground during the initial attack on Iraq ?
War Games can embed significant truths .
My hope though is that ESP quickly moves beyond applications for the military - industrial complex and into other spaces .
Certainly the PC economics – commodity hardware oh yes , the platform is now being designed for multicore — involved make it likely .
If the only people that can get their hands on World - SIM are military departments then Microsoft will have failed .
But frankly that ’s not going to happen .
Flight - SIM remains an incredible way to lose hours of your life .
Just wait til you can get your hands on the rest of it .
The rise of Bit Miles and Virtual Terraforming
One area that I believe holds out great promise for this kind of simulation technology is in sustainable and sustainability modeling .
Take the pilot training example above ; while the highest cost may be for maintenance engineers , but how much fuel is being needlessly burned ?
Training in the real world is expensive .
Moving Atoms has a cost .
I have recently started talking about Bit Miles as a Greenmonk narrative , defined as is the carbon cost associated with moving a good or creating a service that could instead have been delivered digitally .
Bit Miles offer us a moral imperative to digitize : a simulation of the world is a beautiful opportunity to rethink and potentially dematerialize business processes .
Why not Supply Chain Simulator ™ , which would pull together all of your plant information ( pulled in from OSI , say ) , where your people are located ( Peoplesoft ) , and how you move goods and services ( SAP ) around the world ?
An organisation could begin to run really deep “ What If ” scenarios about the energy costs of their businesses with simulations like these .
But what would really make these models sing is the fact they ’d be visual and immersive .
Telling is rarely as effective as Showing .
What would a low energy manufacturing business look like ?
With virtual technology we could maybe work it out .
At this point it might seem that I have gone off the deep end , but the ESP team inspires that in you .
I did n’t see a single Powerpoint slide during my visit .
Rather Shawn likes to open up people ’s imaginations .
Willows on Leather : a culture of design
Therefore , when you visit the Willows Building where ACES is location , your imagination hits the ground running .
One obvious distinction between this and other Microsoft groups is the culture of design .
They do n’t call them games designers for nothing .
I remember thinking that even Matt Jones , design god ( see the Dopplr User interface ) , brutal skeptic and piss - taker extraordinaire might have been impressed .
Matt Jones works with Matt Biddulph , Dopplr ’s CTO , in a classic developer / designer conversation ( I dislike the term workflow for something that is clearly not procedural ) .
From the specific to the general : designer - developer collaboration is perhaps the biggest issue ESP will need to solve as a platform .
Who is going to build and extend the platform ?
What kind of tools will they require ?
The ACES team needs to build something that would make Matt and Matt say – aha – ” we have to use this for something . ”
The ACES design culture does n’t stop at visual and eye candy though .
If you want to see , or should that be hear , some deep modeling , see Microsoft ’s sound engineering in Flight - Sim .
I was introduced to one of the sound designers , and he let me feel a simulation rather than seeing it .
You put a set of noise - canceling headphones on , and through them hear the faint noises of other pilots on the mission .
What you feel though is something entirely different :
The roar of the engines , coming through a ludicrous set of speakers in the corner , comes right through your stomach .
It ’s a weird , cool , realistic feeling , and I am pretty sure all hardcore gamers will expect this kind of setup as part of their experience going forward .
Clearly for real flight training , noise simulation is invaluable for verisimilitude .
Then Shawn kicked it up a notch - “ show him the cone stuff ” .
It was time for basic physics 101 – stand behind an aircraft and you hear something very different than if you stand to one side .
All of this difference is captured within the Microsoft modeling , which I must admit I thought was absurdly cool .
The sound architecture stuff may be old hat - it ’s probably as common as Wii numchucks in that community .
I ’ll be getting an email from Jones saying : “ well done granddad ” …
But it does seem to me that including sound as a modeling dimension could be a boon for building design , for example .
Cutting back on the Cool Aid
It ’s important not to get too carried away when you ’ve seen some impressive demos .
The reality of delivery can be very different , especially at Microsoft .
I was there when Microsoft “ delivered the bits ” for Longhorn ( later Vista ) in 2003 .
So I have to be skeptical .
The ESP team is beginning to bring in functionality from other Microsoft games - a human figure renderer here , a line of sight function there .
That ’s cool , but the more Microsoft platforms ACES needs to integrate with the greater the likelihood of failure .
To be fair to Microsoft it seems to better understand the dangers of integrated aggravation these days .
It got it right with the x -Box , although the Zune went too far in trying to be different ( just what my Windows machine needs for a music device - a whole new music player ! ) .
What about other players and approaches ?
IBM believes SecondLife can begin to play a training and simulation role for its customers , and make for improved virtual learning .
It ’s hard to believe Adobe wo n’t make a play for the world of 3d modeling and simulation beyond its current capabilities in building models , and its clearly far more experienced at building tools designers like to use .
Frankly Microsoft ESP would do well to integrate with Adobe tools for exactly that reason .
Google will surely introduce What If on top of Google Earth , and has repeatedly shown its awesome number crunching and data gathering capabilities .
Apple ’s Hollywood experience should n’t be ignored either .
But then none of these are showstoppers - rather they are potential competitors , which is all to the good .
Giz a Job
At the end of the meeting I told the team - though I was n’t really actually about to ask for a job , this was a Microsoft team I could actually imagine joining .
I ca n’t think of a stronger endorsement .
BusinessWeek came away impressed too .
If Microsoft gets the tooling right , can establish the right programming languages and standards , makes the world hackable , does n’t end up in a digital rights management rat-hole , and provides the right tools it could revolutionise a number of industries .
Microsoft needs to think about open sourcing some content , in order to sustain a world community to populate its models .
ESP needs to become an architecture of participation , and if it is , then we might begin to know the shape of Web 3.0 .
It looks a lot like the real world , only simulated .

Blurst 's Raptor Copter game built using Unity3D and Mono just hit the Apple AppStore .
From the announcement :
Raptor Copter has become our first Unity - made iPhone game to hit the App Store !
We ’re making it available for a limited - time price of $ 0.99 .
The game is a loose follow - up to Off - Road Velociraptor Safari .
Instead of a jeep , you have a Chinook helicopter , but the basic game loop is the same : Capture raptors , drop them into factories , and teleport their sweet meats to the future .
You can get it for your iPod Touch or iPhone from this Raptor Copter iTunes Link .
Cute video :
Unity3D is using Mono 's full static compilation to allow the game to run JIT - less and interpreter - less on the iPhone .
The pilot scheme is said to have proved popular
Shoppers at an Asda store in the West Midlands are now able to get a hospital blood test taken as they shop .
The West Bromwich supermarket has teamed up with Birmingham City Hospital and nearby Sandwell Hospital under an NHS pilot scheme .
The blood tests are taken by a qualified phlebotomist , in a location removed from where any food is sold .
Rob Ashley , pathology manager at the hospital , said : " It 's really good for the patients , it 's about convenience . "
The blood samples taken in - store are then sent to the hospitals to be analysed .
The pilot scheme , which began in September , has been funded by Sandwell Primary Care Trust and is being trialled until April .
Any patient within the catchment area , who has a referral letter from their GP , is given the choice to have their sample taken at the supermarket rather than at hospital .
Mr Ashley said the scheme has already proved " popular " with patients .
" Rather than going all the way to the hospital , where they have to pay to park and wait with all the other patients , they can get it done at local sites - like Asda , " he said .

WASHINGTON --
A pair of NASA scientists told a group of space officials at a private meeting here Sunday that they have found strong evidence that life may exist today on Mars , hidden away in caves and sustained by pockets of water .
The scientists , Carol Stoker and Larry Lemke of NASA 's Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley , told the group that they have submitted their findings to the journal Nature for publication in May , and their paper currently is being peer reviewed .
What Stoker and Lemke have found , according to several attendees of the private meeting , is not direct proof of life on Mars , but methane signatures and other signs of possible biological activity remarkably similar to those recently discovered in caves here on Earth .
Stoker and other researchers have long theorized that the Martian subsurface could harbor biological organisms that have developed unusual strategies for existing in extreme environments .
That suspicion led Stoker and a team of U.S. and Spanish researchers in 2003 to southwestern Spain to search for subsurface life near the Rio Tinto river -- so - called because of its reddish tint -- the product of iron being dissolved in its highly acidic water .
Stoker did not respond to messages left Tuesday on her voice mail at Ames .
Stoker told SPACE.com in 2003 , weeks before leading the expedition to southwestern Spain , that by studying the very acidic Rio Tinto , she and other scientists hoped to characterize the potential for a " chemical bioreactor " in the subsurface - an underground microbial ecosystem of sorts that might well control the chemistry of the surface environment .
Making such a discovery at Rio Tinto , Stoker said in 2003 , would mean uncovering a new , previously uncharacterized metabolic strategy for living in the subsurface .
" For that reason , the search for life in the Rio Tinto is a good analog for searching for life on Mars , " she said .
Stoker told her private audience Sunday evening that by comparing discoveries made at Rio Tinto with data collected by ground - based telescopes and orbiting spacecraft , including the European Space Agency 's Mars Express , she and Lemke have made a very a strong case that life exists below Mars ' surface .
The two scientists , according to sources at the Sunday meeting , based their case in part on Mars ' fluctuating methane signatures that could be a sign of an active underground biosphere and nearby surface concentrations of the sulfate jarosite , a mineral salt found on Earth in hot springs and other acidic bodies of water like Rio Tinto that have been found to harbor life despite their inhospitable environments .
One of NASA 's Mars Exploration Rovers , Opportunity , bolstered the case for water on Mars when it discovered jarosite and other mineral salts on a rocky outcropping in Merdiani Planum , the intrepid rover 's landing site chosen because scientists believe the area was once covered by salty sea .
Stoker and Lemke 's research could lead the search for Martian biology underground , where standing water would help account for the curious methane signatures the two have been analyzing .
" They are desperate to find out what could be producing the methane , " one attendee told Space News .
" Their answer is drill , drill , drill . "
NASA has no firm plans for sending a drill - equipped lander to Mars , but the agency is planning to launch a powerful new rover in 2009 that could help shed additional light on Stoker and Lemke 's intriguing findings .
Dubbed the Mars Science Laboratory , the nuclear - powered rover will range farther than any of its predecessors and will be carrying an advanced mass spectrometer to sniff out methane with greater sensitivity than any instrument flown to date .
In 1996 a team of NASA and Stanford University researchers created a stir when they published findings that meteorites recovered from the Allen Hills region of Antarctica contained evidence of possible past life on Mars .
Those findings remain controversial , with many researchers unconvinced that those meteorites held even possible evidence that very primitive microbial life had once existed on Mars .

In a white - steepled church along a stretch in picturesque canyon country , the preacher laid out the basic blueprint of a godly marriage : Husbands lead , wives submit .
Speaking recently before hundreds of worshipers at Placerita Baptist Church in Newhall , guest preacher Chris Mueller affirmed the view that loving male headship and gracious wifely submission are God ’s plan for spouses .
Placerita , like many conservative Christian churches , teaches that a wife ’s role is to be her husband ’s helpmate ( Genesis ) , “ workers at home ” ( Titus ) and submissive to her husband in everything ( Ephesians ) .
So how do these congregants square such teachings with their support for Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , the conservative evangelical Christian who is aiming to become vice president while her teenage daughter is pregnant , her infant son has Down syndrome and her husband took a leave from work to serve as “ Mr. Mom , ” as People magazine put it ?
Advertisement
“ It ’s probably presumptuous of us to figure out how she is going to balance all of this , ” said Pat Ennis , a Placerita congregant who heads the home economics department at The Master ’s College , a Christian institution in Santa Clarita .
“ The most important thing is that she can do it in God ’s strength . ”
Ennis reflects nationwide polling showing widespread support for Palin , Republican Sen. John McCain ’s running mate , among evangelical Christians .
Earlier this year , some evangelicals criticized McCain for not speaking as openly about his faith as some candidates .
But according to the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life , his standing among white evangelical Protestant registered voters has risen from 61 % in June to 71 % in a poll conducted Sept. 9 - 14 .
Evangelical Christians form the bulwark of the Republican voting base .
And many , like Ennis , see no conflict between Palin ’s candidacy and biblical teachings on women ’s roles .
Advertisement
Many say that biblical restrictions on women ’s leadership apply to church and home , not the secular world -- clearing the way for a woman to run the nation but not a congregation .
And so long as Palin ’s husband , Todd , approves , they say , her career conforms with teachings on wifely duties .
But to others , this view contradicts biblical teaching .
“ The Palin selection is the single most dangerous event in the conscience of the Christian community in the last 10 years at least , ” said Doug Phillips , president of Vision Forum , a Texas - based ministry .
“ The unabashed , unquestioning support of Sarah Palin and all she represents marks a fundamental departure from our historic position of family priorities -- of moms being at home with young children , of moms being helpers to their husbands , the priority of being keepers of the home . ”
Voddie Baucham , a Texas pastor who has criticized the Palin selection as anti-family in a series of blogs , said that the overwhelming evangelical support demonstrates a willingness to sacrifice biblical principles for politics .
“ Evangelicalism has lost its biblical perspective and its prophetic voice , ” Baucham wrote .
“ Men who should be standing guard as the conscience of the country are instead falling in line with the feminist agenda and calling a family tragedy . . . a shining example of family values . ”
Advertisement
In an interview , Baucham said the hundreds of responses he ’s received are running 20 to 1 in his favor .
But he said he has also been castigated for “ breaking ranks ” by some , who argue the election is too important to raise divisive issues .
He and other like - minded pastors disagree .
“ It ’s more important for us to truthfully represent the priorities of Scripture than it is for us to win an election , ” Phillips said .
Palin may have taken center stage at the moment , but the evangelical Christian world has been buffeted for years by growing tensions between those who support egalitarian roles for men and women and those who promote “ complementarianism . ”
That ’s the view that God values men and women equally but granted them distinctly different roles .
Some of the debate centers on whether the Bible allows women to serve as civil leaders .
Vision Forum leaders argue that it does not .
They cite passages in Genesis , Isaiah , Ephesians and elsewhere that they say establishes male headship over women and are critical of female leadership .
Advertisement
Others counter that restrictions on female leadership apply only to church and home .
They include Albert Mohler , president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Kentucky ; and Randy Stinson , whose Kentucky - based Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood was established to combat growing feminism in evangelical churches .
Most of the debate on Palin , however , centers on whether a mother with young children is violating Scripture by running for such a demanding office as vice president .
The key biblical verse at issue is Titus 2:5 , which many evangelical Christians believe lays out God ’s command to younger women to be workers at home subject to their husbands .
Although many conservative Christians agree that women should place homemaking over working outside , many are hesitant to apply those views to Palin .
Christian author Martha Peace , whose book “ The Excellent Wife ” tells women to submit to husbands and be good homemakers , said she would not make the same choice as Palin .
Advertisement
Ditto for Richard Land , who heads the Southern Baptist Convention ’s Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission and recommended Palin to the McCain campaign .
He also would not do as the Palins have done .
“ I ’m not hard - wired to be the ‘ First Dude , ’ ” he said .
But Peace and Land are two of many who say the public should stay out of what is a matter between the Palins and their pastor .
“ I would n’t presume to make that judgment for another family , ” Land said .
Others cite biblical passages they believe affirm Palin ’s decision to join the GOP ticket .
Take the woman at Placerita Baptist Church , where the women ’s ministry offers classes on “ Heavenly Homemaking ” and Bible classes on the apostle Paul ’s epistle that declared husbands are the head of wives , as Christ is the head of the church .

Eighteen women gathered recently to discuss Palin .
They included stay - at - home moms and home - schoolers , small business owners and nurses , some with high school diplomas and others with doctoral degrees .
All of them expressed support of Palin , particularly for standing against abortion and embracing her infant son .
Janice Hodgson , who worked in the mortgage business until recently , said Proverbs 31 offers a positive view of working women with servants -- suggesting , she said , that it is fine for Palin to hire nannies to help care for her children .
Barbara Barrick , the women ’s ministry coordinator , said she looks to Deborah , a prophetess and judge , as a biblical example of a female leader .
Ennis cited Abraham ’s wife , Sarah , and Queen Esther as other women called by God for special missions .
“ If God has put her in this position , ” Ennis said of Palin , “ then I need to pray for her and look to God to multiply her resources . ”

“ Older women likewise are to be reverent in their behavior , not malicious gossips nor enslaved to much wine , teaching what is good , so that they may encourage the young women to love their husbands , to love their children , to be sensible , pure , workers at home , kind , being subject to their own husbands , so that the word of God will not be dishonored . ”
Ephesians 5:22 -24

“ Wives , be subject to your own husbands , as to the Lord .
For the husband is the head of the wife , as Christ also is the head of the church , He Himself being the Savior of the body .
But as the church is subject to Christ , so also the wives ought to be to their husbands in everything . “
1 Timothy 2:11 -15
“ A woman must quietly receive instruction with entire submissiveness .
But I do not allow a woman to teach or exercise authority over a man , but to remain quiet .
For it was Adam who was first created , and then Eve .
And it was not Adam who was deceived , but the woman being deceived , fell into transgression .
But women will be preserved through the bearing of children if they continue in faith and love and sanctity with self - restraint . ”

Proponents of accepting performance enhancing drugs ( PEDs ) in sports argue that their harmful health effects have been overstated , that health risks are an athlete ’s decision to make , that using drugs is part of the evolution of sports much like improved training techniques and new technologies , and that efforts to keep athletes from using PEDs are overzealous , unproductive , unfairly administered , and bound to fail .
Opponents argue that PEDs are harmful and potentially fatal , and that athletes who use them are cheaters who gain an unfair advantage , violate the spirit of competition , and send the wrong message to children .
They say PED users unfairly diminish the historic achievements of clean athletes , and that efforts to stop PED use in sports should remain strong .
PROS & CONS BY CATEGORY
For a growing startup , customer support is one of the most important things .
You need to be talking to them to :
Keep them happy !
Happy users talk to others about their experiences .
Gain insight into how your users are thinking and what they need .
Find out what is working , what is not work and what is confusing in your product .
We receive many support emails every day .
We also have multiple people responsible for our products .
That ’s why I researched a lot about the helpdesk solutions and found out that they are too complex , confusing and difficult to maintain .
Instead we have been using Gmail for many years and it worked well for us .
You can access to your Gmail account no matter where you are .
It even works perfectly on my iphone .
You get to access the same familiar user interface .
There are features like labels , filters and canned responses that makes you wonder if Gmail team has designed it as a Help Desk solution .
There is no worry about installation or maintenance .
It is also completely free .
There are many cool tools that integrate with Gmail .
Gmail is amazingly fast and responsive for a web based application .
Gmail search works incredible well .
It is also very fast and easy to use .
You can browse your search results without re-doing your searches .
It just works .
Gmail shows messages together in threads .
It is very easy to keep track of what has been said and even print all conversation at once .
Gmail spam filter is excellent .
I do n’t link automatic responses , but if you would like to send an automatic email to the customer saying something like “ we have received your email and will be responding in 24 hours ” .
You can easily set that up using Vacation Responder feature .
If someone else is responding to a message , it will show up as “ Draft ” so you never have problem with multiple people responding to the same request .
Here are some best practices that worked well for us :
Keep Projects on Separate Accounts
We have separate gmail accounts for each product .
All emails related to that product is sent to that account .
You can either setup your accounts to redirect to the gmail account , or you can just get Gmail to pull emails from POP account in your server .
Either way works fine .
So , how do you keep track of multiple gmail accounts ?
This is a minor problem .
But there are solutions to that .
If you have multiple browsers installed on your computer , you can keep them open at the same time .
For example , I use both Firefox and Safari , so I usually keep separate Gmail accounts open on them .
Another possible solution is to use Gmail Notifier Firefox Addon .
I use it to switch between multiple Gmail accounts and see if there are any new messages on a particular account .
Keep Your Inbox Clean
It is important to keep your inbox as clean as possible .
Use the Archive button .
Use it a lot !
You should process all new messages when you login .
If something can be replied quickly or high priortity , reply it on the spot .
Then archive it .
If it is something that needs to wait for a while , I give it labels such as “ TODAY ” , “ NEXTDAY ” , “ THISWEEK ” and “ THISMONTH ” .
Always keeping your Inbox processed creates a sense of control .
Once your inbox becomes larger than your screen or goes to the second page , you cannot see all of your emails at once and that is kind of stressful .
If you have n’t read Getting Things Done already , I ’d highly recommend it .
Use Labels Wisely
In addition to the labels like “ TODAY ” that describe the urgency , we also have labels for each user .
So , if someone else thinks one of the emails can only be answered by me , he applies “ Aytekin ” label .
It is also important to give labels meaningful colors .
“ TODAY ” label should probably be red while “ THISMONTH ” label can be light green .
This way , instead of reading the labels , you can simply spot them from their colors .
We also have labels such as “ testimonial ” and “ feature request ” which makes it easier to keep track of other things you would like to come back in the future .
Use Canned Responses
On many occasions , you will have to answer same questions .
Instead of explaining the same things again , you can use one of the canned response feature .
It is available on the Gmail Labs .
I actually use TextExpander and quite happy with it .
So , you can always use a separate application , but I think Gmail ’s own canned responses feature has an advantage .
You can access it from any computer !
Keep Your Google Docs Close
I have been moving away from MS Office to Google Docs and I am pretty happy about it .
If you are receiving documents from clients , it is a good idea to keep them on your Google Docs so that you can access them from anywhere .
You can also have spreadsheet documents such “ Features Requests ” , “ Bugs ” and keep them on the same Gmail account .
Things to Keep in Mind :
There has been a lot of reports of people getting locked out of their Gmail accounts .
Unless you have a Premium account , you will get a very slow support and resolution .
On many occasions , you will receive emails email from multiple users with the same subject line .
This causes Gmail to assume they belong to the same thread .
This may cause some confusion if you are not careful .
When you send email from your own domain , some Outlook users see “ On behalf of MyCompany Support ” on the receiver .
I do n’t know why this is happening and how to solve .
Maybe upgrading to Google Apps and doing all of your emails on them would solve it .
This would only work in small companies .
We are a small company with 4 employees .
Our employees even know root passwords for our servers , so it is not a problem to use the same gmail account .
However , if you are any larger or if you have any trust issues , it is probably not a good idea .
This is probably not a unique idea .
I am sure many small companies are doing this .
According to Jason Fried in this video , 37 Signals also uses Gmail for tech support .
I also found another article on the subject .
Are you also using Gmail for as a help desk solution ?
What has been experience ?
Kim Jong-il was shown visiting two factories in Sinuiju North Korea has released undated photos of leader Kim Jong - il visiting factories , amid continuing speculation about the state of his health .
State news agency KCNA said Mr Kim had offered workers praise and guidance at the cosmetics and machine factories .
South Korean and US officials say Mr Kim suffered a stroke in August , but North Korean officials deny he is ill .
A number of photos have been released recently , though experts have questioned the authenticity of some .
Mr Kim , who is 66 and reportedly suffering from heart disease and diabetes , has not been seen at key events in recent months .
But in the latest in a series of photos apparently meant to show that Mr Kim is in good health , KCNA published several photos of him said to be on an official visit .
Some were said to show him standing outside a building at the cosmetics factory , while others showed him near an orange bulldozer at the engineering plant .
Mr Kim praised the " high quality " of the toilet soap , toothpaste , cream and lotion produced at the cosmetics factory , and the " persevering and tireless efforts " of the workers , KCNA reported .
North Korea has recently released a series of pictures of its leader Though the photos were undated , Mr Kim praised workers at the Rakwon Machine Complex for meeting its quota for this year " as of the end of October " , the agency said .
Both factories are in the western city of Sinuiju , on the border with China , the agency said .
Mr Kim 's reported illness comes as international negotiations continue over North Korea 's nuclear programme .
North Korea said last year it would give up its nuclear programme in return for aid and diplomatic concessions , but progress towards dismantling its Yongbyon nuclear reactor has been patchy .

Dixie Chicks singer Natalie Maines is at the center of a defamation lawsuit by the stepfather of Steve Branch who was one of the 8 year old boys slain in 1993 .
The “ Big Mouth ” Dixie Chick spoke out on behalf of the three people charged in the slaying and made comments that Terry Hobbs ( step father ) was involved in the killings .
Hobbs filed suit on November 25th , 2008 in Pulaski County Circuit Court against all three of the girls in the band “ The Dixie Chicks ; ” He claims that he suffered loss of income , emotional distress and damage to his character as a result of the statements .
He is seeking compensatory and punitive damages .

Group members : Natalie Maines , Emily Robison and Martie Maguire ( aka Martie Seidel ) .
In fall of 2004 they participated in the Vote for Change concert tour organized to encourage the defeat of George W. Bush in the U.S. presidential election .
Emily Robison is married to musician Charlie Robison and Natalie Maines is married to actor / director Adrian Pasdar .
Maines and Pasdar first met in May 1999 , at the wedding of Emily and Charlie Robison .
PRAGUE ( Reuters ) - The Czech Republic , which takes over the European Union ’s presidency on January 1 , defended Israel ’s strikes against Hamas on Tuesday .
The EU has called for a cease - fire to end the violence that has killed almost 350 Palestinians .
Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said Israel had the right to defend itself .
“ Let us realise one thing : Hamas increased steeply the number of rockets fired at Israel since the cease - fire ended on December 19 .
That is not acceptable any more , ” Schwarzenberg told daily Mlada Fronta Dnes in an interview .
France , which will hand over the EU ’s rotating presidency to Prague , has condemned Israel ’s strikes and the rocket attacks from Hamas militants and called for both to stop immediately .
It also said it deplored the many civilian casualties and condemned Israel ’s “ disproportionate use of force , ” echoing comments from U.N. Secretary - General Bank Ki-moon , who has also called for a cease - fire .
Schwarzenberg , a staunch ally of Washington , said Hamas had excluded itself from serious political debate due to its rocket attacks on Israel .
He also indirectly blamed the group for the growing death toll , saying it put its bases and gun warehouses in densely populated areas .
“ Why am I one of the few that have expressed understanding for Israel ? ... I am enjoying the luxury of telling the truth , ” Schwarzenberg told the daily .
He said under the Czech EU presidency he would try to push through a policy that would lead to peace , saying “ I would be very happy if it helped the Palestinians . ”
He said he would not support either side in the conflict but rather work as a mediator .
The paper cited his office as saying he would take part in an extraordinary of EU foreign ministers in Paris on Tuesday evening to discuss the attacks .
Hamas won elections in Gaza in 2006 and then took over the coastal strip in 2007 after routing rival Fatah forces loyal to President Mahmoud Abbas .
A sizable subset of what some on this site call “ doomers ” are convinced that the demise of the petroleum economy will bring social breakdown and a violent struggle of all against all .
Some are even preparing for the chaos to come .
I 'm convinced we have to take end - of - affluence scenarios , including the scarier ones , seriously .
But it can help everyone confront these possibilities if we try to think more intricately about how people might respond .
In particular , we need to face head - on the question whether social breakdown and violence are inevitable .
This essay was written by Michael W. Foley ( TOD user greenuprising ) , a former professor in the social sciences at an eastern U.S. university who I now know as a local farmer .
At a recent Farmers ' Market , I suggested that we needed a more empirical and scholarly discussion of the potential for social breakdown , especially violence , during energy descent .
Thankfully , he agreed to write the following for The Oil Drum .
The concerns I 'm adddressing here are pretty U.S. - centric , though I 'm drawing on examples from around the world .
Images of marauding bands sacking grocery stores and small farms and of neighbors guarding their hoards with shotguns mainly come out of the American imagination , I suspect .
In places like Western Europe and Latin America , with old traditions of militant social organization , acute shortages might bring people out into the streets all right , even entailing looting and such ( remember the Latin American “ food riots ” of the 70's and 80's ? ) , but crystallizing pretty quickly into organized efforts to get governments to respond .
But I 'll try to suggest some conclusions that might have broader relevance than the U.S .
First , some reasons to be concerned .
As Richard Heinberg notes , we 're facing not just peak oil but “ peak everything ” -- cheap energy , cheap food , abundant water with which to grow it , clean air and water and soil , a reliable climate , and government resources to deal with the cascading crises .
The financial crisis and world recession / depression wo n't be turned around by a few hundred billion dollars for the bankers , and “ restarting growth ” is little more than a recipe for widening the gap between the economy and the real , physical limitations of the planet .
As mainstream a figure as Lester Brown documents the slowdown in agricultural productivity , the decline of water resources , and the threat of climate change to future food production .
Whether because of rising seas or abrupt disruptions in food supplies , lots of observers predict massive displacements of people and enormous strains on governments competing for ever scarcer energy , water , and food resources .
Border conflicts escalating to war seem likely in some parts of the world , and war will breed still more social disruption .
Hunger and climate refugees , in any case , could be expected to besiege the still - affluent countries , including the United States , straining the resources of these countries still further .
Add to that the possibility of a dramatic interruption of petroleum supplies , and there is plenty of reason to worry .
And social disruption can turn nasty very quickly .
The classic example is the Ik , an African hunter - gatherer group deprived of their land and forced into agriculture on a small parcel of unsuitable farm land .
Colin Turnbull 's
The Mountain People describes a social breakdown that went so far that children preyed upon their elders in loosely organized gangs .
In Yugoslavia , a society with high levels of education and a long history of inter-ethnic cooperation , things fell apart still more rapidly in the face of the IMF - sponsored financial crisis of the early eighties and the decision of state - level politicians to carve out their own power bases with a claim to independence from the union .
And throughout Africa , the predatory states of the seventies gave way in the face of the economic crisis of the eighties , and seemingly intractable conflicts followed in quick succession .
At the same time , we have to recognize that economic and ecological collapse do n't necessarily lead to violence .
We have lots of cases of localized peace in the midst of violence and even cases of “ intractable peace . ”
Consider the Great Depression in the United States , for example .
A quarter of the population was unemployed , ten thousand banks failed , taking people 's life savings with them , and food shortages were not uncommon .
But the level of violent crime did not rise notably , many people shared food willingly with wandering hobos , and people organized , more than anything else , to pressure government for help , which eventually came .
In Somalia , to take a surprising example , when things fell apart in clan - based political strife and widespread famine before and after the U.S. intervention in 1989 , people eventually turned to Islamic courts to adjudicate disputes and begin to re-organize local community life .
The courts movement , together with leaders of relatively stable regions , eventually came together against the warlords of the clans to create a new government , until the U.S. unleashed the Ethiopians against them .
But the peace had come from the bottom up .
And in one of the most violent countries in the world , Colombia , dozens of “ peace communities ” in war - torn areas generally manage to stave off guerrillas , paramilitaries , and the Colombian Army .
The sign reads :
The community freely : participates in community work ; says ' No ' to injustice and impunity ; does not participate in the war either directly or indirectly , nor bears arms ; does not handle information or offer it to any of the parties to the conflict .
So what makes for non-violent outcomes to social crisis ?
And could we expect this to apply to a peak everything crisis in the United States ?
I do n't have any firm answers and want to provoke a discussion more than anything else .
But here are a few suggestions .
First , in most of the violent outcomes listed above , violence is not a matter of social banditry but is politically organized .
In Croatia and Bosnia , politicians “ played the ethnic card ” in trying to secede from the union and recruited thugs to organize violence against both their political opponents and members of other ethnic groups .
Though these groups recruited thousands of men , the desertion rate was astounding , according to John Mueller ; most people , including young men , preferred to take their chances with their families than to fight .
Ashutosh Varshney has a fascinating study of religious conflict in India , where he shows that cities with similar levels of religious division could have long histories of communal violence – or not .
The crucial factor was politically motivated thuggery .
Where politicians hired thugs to stir up communal violence , you had riots ; where the politicians did n't feel compelled or able to do so , there was no such violence .
Even where social banditry is widespread , as in El Salvador and Nicaragua after those countries ' civil wars , we see the most overt sorts of violence , like highway robbery , fairly quickly suppressed by local police forces , replaced by more sporadic and harder to target crime , like kidnapping .
Franjo Tudjman , former president of Croatia , played the ethnic card to beat out liberal and socialist rivals and sent armed bands to stir up ethnic conflict among Croatia 's tens of thousands of Serb residents , sparking civil war .
The first conclusion , then , might be that , absent some sort of political motivation , we 're unlikely to see large - scale violence .
The prospect of armed gangs roaming the countryside called up by many “ doomers ” is also unlikely , so long as local law enforcement remains intact ( and why should we think it would just fall apart ? ) .
In cities , it makes sense to worry about rioting and looting in the event of food shortages .
But again , Americans might recall their own experience .
In the fuel crisis of 1975 , when Arab countries cut oil supplies to the United States in retaliation for U.S. support for Israel in the 1974 war , we had enormous lines at gas stations and some theft ( this was when we started worrying about whether our gas caps had locks , remember ? ) , but very little violence beyond a fist fight or two at the pumps .
Food riots could be more serious , but these are usually responses to specific events : the government announces a sudden price increase ; a bakery closes its doors and rumors spread that the owner is hoarding food ; and – always important – the police step in with force .
Most riots , in fact , start with police violence .
Police conduct is key , even when people in the street start the violence .
SWAT teams can do a lot of damage ; they generally exacerbate violence when lots of people are involved .
In Seattle , for example , the WTO protests only became “ riots ” when out - of - town , SWAT trained police crossed their own line in the sand and started lobbing tear gas in the Capitol Hill neighborhood .
Young people enjoying life in that area 's outdoor cafes , who had had no part in the protests , rose from their seats and started pelting the police with rocks and their own tear gas canisters .
In New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina , the hysterical news reports to the contrary , violence was almost wholly the work of white vigilantes inspired by those same reports to “ defend ” their communities against supposed looters .
So a second conclusion is that we look to the police , and their training , for help in averting violence .
Above all , local police should have good relations with their communities .
They should also put as much effort into restraining vigilantism as into defending property .
We ought to learn something about media hysteria and rumor mills from New Orleans , too .
The examples of ethnic and religious violence in Yugoslavia and India also suggest lessons about leadership and community .
In the Indian cities that did not have a history of violence , in Varshney 's study , it was because community leaders from both sides ( Hindu and Muslim ) worked together on a regular basis .
Business leaders had little tolerance for politicians who stirred up violence , and some of them depended on a workforce made up mostly of people from a different religion .
In Croatia and Bosnia , leaders who opposed ethnic nationalism lost power struggles to those who hoped to gain by independence from Yugoslavia .
Third lesson : Leadership plays a big role in promoting or avoiding violence .
When I lived in Washington , D.C. , a riot in a predominantly Salvadoran neighborhood in response to police abuse was stopped by a young Salvadoran woman , leader of a legal aid organization , who went out into the streets in the middle of the night to talk to the angry men , many of them drunk .
Though most of them did n't know her , they knew who she was and responded to her courage .
Fourth lesson : Community is also important .
Neighborhood watch committees apparently help bring down crime in urban neighborhoods .
On the other hand , they notoriously do n't promote community in their neighborhoods .
In Guatemala and Guerrero , Mexico , local vigilantes broke waves of banditry in the face of police and judicial indifference or complicity by taking justice into their own hands ; but vigilantes are dangerous beasts themselves .
Most of these worked because the community and its leaders could restrain them from running amock .
Where a feeling of community exists , neighbors watch out for one another .
This does n't break down easily .
It can also force leaders , police and other authorities to play positive roles in crises , if the Indian examples are right .
So , yes , stockpile food ; but also build community and prepare to share .
So what are the prospects for violence in the United States ( and other affluent societies ) in the event of a “ hard landing ” ?
As far as large - scale violence goes , I 'd say chances are next to nil .
The political class is too wed to economic elites ( national and local ) to promote mobilization that would be to their detriment , and they have too much coercive power at their disposal to tolerate violent would - be counter - elites .
Urban rioting would be sporadic and impossible to sustain without this sort of political support .
At the local level , we could see some increase in banditry .
But a lot depends on how solid local communities are , how their police are likely to behave , and how prepared they are to react generously in a time of crisis .
As I said , these are n't real firm answers , just quick conclusions based on my reading of history and patterns of social violence over the last couple centuries .
Hacking a 9 Volt Battery
Have you ever been in a situation where your television remote 's AAA batteries died and you desperately needed new ones but could only find a 9 Volt battery around your house ?
Well if you dismantle a 9
Volt battery you will actually find 6 AAAA batteries ( Quadruple A ) that can push 1.5 Volts of energy each .
Technically they are n't AAA batteries , but if you put some fully charged AAAA batteries in a AAA battery device , it should still indeed work if you are in a pinch .
Watch the following video for exact instructions on how to take apart a 9 Volt battery .

ALBUQUERQUE —
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will decide in two weeks whether to study if the Canada lynx should be protected in New Mexico under the Endangered Species Act .
The Dec. 15 deadline was set in a settlement filed Monday in a lawsuit the Western Environmental Law Center filed in April on behalf of conservation groups to force the federal agency to act on their petition to protect the lynx in New Mexico .
Lynx have been reintroduced in southern Colorado , and some have wandered south into New Mexico .
Although the federal government lists the elusive , furry cats as threatened in 14 states , including Colorado , they have no federal protection in New Mexico .
The lynx pictured here heads into the woods after her release in Colorado in 1999 .
" We think it ’s very important that the species be listed , given that it ’s traveling into northern New Mexico , " said Rob Edward of WildEarth Guardians '
Denver office , who said the settlement offers hope for the lynx in the Southwest .
The lawsuit filed in federal court in Washington complained that Fish and Wildlife failed to act on the organizations '
August 2007 petition within 90 days as required by the Endangered Species Act .
The law gives the agency the deadline to decide whether a petition provides sufficient information for the agency to then determine whether a listing may be warranted .

( CNN ) -- A treasure map to a baby ?
Meredith Kolk , shown with her husband and son , has tried alternative fertility methods .
That 's just one of many things Meredith Kolk tried when she had problems getting pregnant .
At age 40 , the mother of one longed for another child but knew the odds were against her .
Kolk says a poster board with cutout images of happy babies kept her focused on her goal .
" Making this board helped me feel like I could have a vision to look at every morning and every night about what I wanted for my family .
It helped keep me centered because the process is frustrating and it can be very nerve - wracking . "
Kolk turned to in vitro fertilization and also used alternative approaches in hopes of increasing her chances of getting pregnant .
She did 30 minutes of meditation each morning before going to work .
" I would visualize me pregnant with a healthy baby and a doctor saying ' yes , you 're pregnant . ' "

Kolk also received weekly acupuncture and made changes to her diet .
She added wheat germ and nuts and swapped low - fat dairy foods with whole - milk foods .

Kolk says that doing these things helped her to stay calm .
Dr. Alice Domar , executive director of the Domar Center for Mind / Body Health in Waltham , Massachusetts , says her research shows a medical link between stress and infertility .
" The part of the brain that controls all aspects of reproduction is called the hypothalamus .
It 's also the part of the brain that controls how we respond to stress .
And so it made sense to me intuitively that there could be a connection between stress and infertility , " she said .
Domar specializes in women struggling with infertility .
She says that if a woman can learn stress management through relaxation techniques , her chances of getting pregnant will double .
On the day we visited the center , 39 - year - old Sarah Weatherhead underwent acupuncture .
She 's had in vitro fertilization three times without success and is waiting to hear if her fourth try has worked .
She believes being more relaxed could help her chances of getting pregnant .
" I tend to be very positive about it , but it 's difficult , especially when I 've had so many failed cycles . "

Weatherhead is playing the ultimate game of beat the clock .
In fact , one study shows that 33 percent of women are infertile by age 40 .
That number increases to 87 percent by age 45 .
Doctors say the best hope for older women is donor eggs .
" A lot of women initially are very reluctant to go down the route of donor egg because they 'll lose that genetic connection with the child , " says Dr. Jane Ruman , an infertility specialist with Reproductive Medicine Associates of New York .
" But the fastest way to get a child into your home is usually with a donor egg . "
The technology is so successful that a 70 - year - old woman in India gave birth to a baby girl in November .
While no age limits are enforced in the United States , most fertility centers maintain a cutoff of between 50 and 55 .

Domar says her research shows that women over 40 make good mothers .
" They tend to be more comfortable with their role as parents .
They can provide more financial opportunities .
So from a psychological perspective , it 's a good situation . "
Weatherhead believes she has more to offer a child at her age .
" I think I 'm smarter .
I like myself better .
I 'm more accepting of myself , " she said .
Weatherhead says that if in vitro fertilization does n't work , she is open to adoption .
After three cycles of in vitro fertilization , Kolk did become pregnant and gave birth to twin girls , Calliope and Josephine , in October .
She says she ended up with exactly what she had visualized with her treasure map : happy , healthy babies .

MIKE DUFFY wanted to be ready to switch from over - the - air analog TV broadcasts to an all - digital signal that will occur across the country next February .
His Chattanooga , Tenn. , hilltop home was nearly in the line of sight to a nearby TV station antenna and he had never had a problem getting analog TV signals .
He assumed he would have no difficulty with digital signals .
So he hooked up a digital converter box to his old TV and attached the rabbit - ears antenna he had always used .
His new digital picture was sharp and detailed  for as long as he remained sitting in his chair .
When he stood up the picture would deteriorate into blocky images or disappear completely .
“ It did seem to be affected by the position of people in the room . ” he said .
Mr. Duffy had discovered that over - the - air digital signals behave differently from analog signals .
That wo n’t matter to most Americans come the switchover .
They either own a digital TV or get their signal through cable or satellite .
But 17 million households have an analog TV that receives its signals over the air  13 million of them use a rabbit - ear antenna .
That means that not only do they have to buy a digital converter box ; they may have to buy a new antenna .
An additional 18 million homes have TVs that get over - the - air signals , but the residents have other TVs that are connected to cable or satellite services .

BERLIN ( Reuters ) - A busy intersection in the German city of Kassel turned into a lake of frozen beer on Tuesday when some 1,600 bottles smashed after poorly secured crates flew off a delivery truck , police said .
The truck , carrying 12 tonnes of freshly brewed beer , lost most of its load on a sharp left - hand turn at the bottom of a hill , according to Kassel police inspector Wolfgang Jungnitsch .
Nearly 80 crates carrying about 800 litres flew off the truck , most of the bottles smashed , and their contents quickly froze in the chilly temperature of about - 4 degrees Celsius ( 25 Fahrenheit ) , he said .
“ A sheet of ice quickly formed and the air was filled with beer fumes , ” Jungnitsch said .
It took an hour to clear the intersection , and police said the trucker faced a fine for not securing his load properly .
Eating less does n’t just boost physical health .
In elderly people , it seems to improve memory too .
Restricting calorie intake has been shown to increase lifespan in mice , reduce the risk of heart disease in people and boost cognitive ability in elderly animals .
To see if the cognitive benefit held for people , Agnes Flöel and colleagues , at the University of Münster in Germany tested the short term memory of 50 people with an average age of 60 , who were overweight , but not obese , and then got one - third to eat 30 % fewer calories than normal each day .
After three months , the dieters scored 20 % higher on the test than they had before the diet , recalling on average 12.5 words compared to 10.5 .

“ Two words may not seem like much , but it ’s more than the difference between people under 30 and above 50 , ” says Flöel .
Those who did not go on the diet showed no change .
The dieters had lower levels of glucose and insulin in their blood which previous studies have linked to greater neural function .

We learned on Monday that incoming president Barack Obama 's Presidential Inaugural Committee ( PIC ) selected Microsoft 's Silverlight framework for the official Internet video stream of the inauguration ceremony .
This choice has generated some controversy among Linux enthusiasts , because it requires Silverlight 2.0 , which is not yet supported on the open source operating system .
Several developers on Novell 's Mono team leaped into action and worked late into the night so that Linux users will be able to watch the stream with Moonlight , an open source implementation of Silverlight 1.0 .
Their efforts , which were undertaken in collaboration with Microsoft , have ensured that the PIC stream will be accessible to Linux users who download the Moonlight browser plugin from the project 's web site , as well as to PPC Mac users who rely on Microsoft 's Silverlight 1.0 plugin .
Novell 's Aaron Bockover , who is well - known in the Linux community for creating the Banshee audio player , was one of the developers whose participation was instrumental in guaranteeing Silverlight 1.0 compatibility for the PIC stream .
After he and his colleagues finished the project at 3 AM ( ET ) , he took some time to share some of the details behind the intense undertaking .
" It was quite an evening , " he told me .
" I was in a movie when [ Mono project manager ]
Joseph Hill called me , asking if I could do the work .
The movie had just started .
I bailed , walked to the office , and got to work . "
Seven hours later , he and his team rejoiced as they sent the final changes to Microsoft .
The project involved building an alternate web player that is compatible with Silverlight 1.0 and is capable of supporting the PIC stream .
To achieve this , Bockover adapted some existing code that he originally wrote for an ongoing Windows Media compatibility project that is connected with Novell 's SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop distribution .
Developers Larry Ewing and Geoff Norton also participated in building the player and assisted Bockover with testing and debugging .
" Basically , we just wanted to make sure that while we do n't yet support Silverlight 2.0 on Linux , this historic and much welcomed event would be accessible to Linux users , " Bockover told me .
" It was entirely a joint effort , and Microsoft was responding to a huge volume of input and concern from Linux users and Mac users . "
Microsoft assisted the Moonlight developers by providing them with access to a test stream and by facilitating communication with iStreamPlanet .
Bockover told me that he and his colleagues were in constant communication with Microsoft via e-mail during the entire process .
The other side of the collaborative effort is documented by Microsoft 's Ben Waggoner , who published a blog entry at 3 AM with his own perspective .
" We 've heard a lot of requests to add support for [ Linux and PPC Macs ] , and so we teamed up with the Moonlight team at Novell and they 've created a Silverlight 1.0 version of the player that works great in both Moonlight and PowerPC Macs , " Waggoner wrote .
" That something like this could come together on such short notice is a testament to the chops and passion of the Moonlight team and the great platform we 're both implementing .
I 'm glad we got this chance to demonstrate how serious we are about this collaboration . "
Some critics of Mono and Moonlight doubt Microsoft 's commitment to interoperability , argue that Microsoft 's technology in this area is n't dominant enough to justify replication , and believe that the open source implementations will never be able to achieve sufficient compatibility to provide practical value .
Monday night 's collaborative effort by Microsoft and Novell on defies the assessments of these critics and provides some compelling evidence of the need for an open source Silverlight implementation .
Microsoft clearly has the clout to get its format adopted for high - profile usage scenarios , which means that there is a very real need to have a Linux implementation .
Microsoft has also demonstrated its willingness to facilitate the advancement of Moonlight and accommodate Linux users .
The fact that Moonlight can be used today to stream the inauguration shows that the browser plugin has legitimate value to Linux users and sufficient compatibility to get the job done .
Moonlight is improving all the time and , according to the project 's roadmap , is on track to get preliminary Silverlight 2.0 support by March .
Although there are still some valid questions about the scope of Microsoft 's long - term commitment , the company is definitely helping to make Moonlight a success today , and will likely be pressured to continue doing so for the foreseeable future in order to compete with emerging web standards and technologies from other vendors .
Late nights and preternatural dedication are the cornerstone of the Moonlight narrative .
The earliest incarnation of the browser plugin originally emerged in 2007 after an epic 20 - day hackathon , during which a small team of globally dispersed developers produced a functioning prototype in only 20 days by voluntarily working nights and weekends .
The same degree of commitment and technical excellence went into the extraordinary effort Monday night to bring the inaugural to Linux users .

The Amish , the religious sect that has determinedly kept the modern world at bay , have been leaving a quiet life of farming for jobs in small businesses  all the while trying to balance their own values with the culture of the marketplace .
“ Their whole intent is to not be caught up in the hustle and bustle of the modern world , ” said John Swaffer , advertising manager at the Keim Lumber Company , a lumber mill in Charm , Ohio .
The Amish move into the world of commerce has been more out of necessity than desire .
Over the last 16 years , the Amish population in the United States  mostly in Pennsylvania , Ohio and Indiana  has nearly doubled , to 230,000 , and the decreasing availability and increasing cost of farmland has forced many of these agrarian families , especially the younger generation , to gravitate to small business as their main source of income .
The businesses , which favor such Amish skills as furniture - making , quilting , construction work and cooking , have been remarkably successful .
Despite a lack of even a high school education ( the Amish leave school after the eighth grade ) , hundreds of Amish entrepreneurs have built profitable businesses based on the Amish values of high quality , integrity and hard work .
A 2004 Goshen College study reported that the failure rate of Amish businesses is less than 5 percent , compared with a national small - business default rate that is far higher .
( According to a federal study , only two - thirds of all small - business start - ups survive the first two years and fewer than half make it to four years . )

Saddles used by the disabled stolen from Katy group ' They stole from a bunch of handicapped kids , ' owner says
Harris County sheriff 's detectives are trying to figure out who stole an estimated $ 20,000 worth of saddles and bridles earlier this week from a Katy nonprofit recreational horse riding program that serves special - needs children .
The break - in at the Halter , Inc. facilities at 17410 Clay Road marked the second time in three weeks that burglars have broken into the group 's offices .
" They stole from a bunch of handicapped kids , " said Halter , Inc. owner Maria Pinzon .
" Whoever did this is going to have to really live with what they 've done .
If they have a change of heart and are willing to return it to us , we'd be very happy to get our stuff back .
" Our biggest fear is they 're going to come back and steal our horses , " Pinzon added .
" That would be a monumental devastation to most of these children .
I can replace a saddle , but I can't replace a best friend . "
The latest burglary was discovered early Wednesday .
Intruders cut through locks and chains to get into the facilities , then stole 16 western saddles and six bridles .
The loss is estimated at $ 20,000 , Pinzon said .
The stolen saddles included 10 horse saddles and six pony saddles .
Three weeks ago , intruders also cut through locks and chains to get inside and steal the group 's stock trailer , which was used to take horses to Special Olympics and United Cerebral Palsy events , Pinzon said .
" It 's just going to make it harder for us , " she said today .
" We can't do our riding lessons without saddles .
We 're a small nonprofit .
We do n't have much money . "
About 100 children participate in the group 's various programs each year , Pinzon said .
Halter , Inc. offers educational and recreational riding programs in a therapeutic setting , she said .
Because the group uses miniature horses , children as young as 1 year old are able to ride , she said .
Sheriff 's detectives have no suspects , said Lt. John Legg .
No fingerprints could be recovered because considerable condensation had accumulated by the time the latest break - in was discovered , he said .
" We believe the key to solving this crime is going to be the suspects attempting to sell the equipment that was stolen , " Legg said .
" We 're really relying on any information from citizens who may run across individuals attempting to sell saddles or other equipment . "
Among the items stolen this week was a black pony saddle studded with diamond - shape silver , Pinzon said .
After the break - ins drew attention from the media , donors gave three saddles and one bridle to the nonprofit group , she said .
Pinzon said she is at a loss to explain the burglaries to the children who ride the horses .
" I 'm going to keep going on and I 'm going to find a way to make sure it works out for the kids , " she said .
" That 's what I 've dedicated my life to . "

Sixty - six percent of voters under age 30 preferred Barack Obama to John McCain 's 32 percent .
Obama has historic youth mandate
President - elect Barack Obama 's 34 - point margin of victory with voters under 30 was the largest in a generation , cut across lines of class , color and education — and the most impressive youth mandate in modern American history , according to an exclusive Politico analysis .
Sixty - six percent of voters under age 30 preferred Obama while just 32 percent favored McCain — nearly four times the size of John F. Kennedy 's lead with the group in 1960 , which led him to famously declare in his inaugural address that “ the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans . ”

While Lyndon Johnson also won the under - 30 vote by a 2 - to - 1 ratio in 1964 , he did so as a sitting president , who crushed Barry Goldwater by some 22 points in the national popular vote , which Obama won this year by just six points .
In other words , never in post - war American politics have youth voted so differently than older generations as they did in 2008 .
Obama lead with the group this year is easily the largest of any newly elected president in the of modern polling .
Sixty percent of all new voters this year were under age 30 , according to a report by Tuft ’s Tisch College Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement , or CIRCLE .
Until this election , no Democratic presidential nominee had won more than 45 percent of young whites in at least three decades .
Obama won 54 percent of young white voters .
The youth vote made up 18 percent of the electorate this year , one point more than in the last three presidential elections .
Young whites this year constituted 11 percent of the electorate , and young blacks and Hispanics 3 percent each .
Seventy - six percent of young Hispanic vote preferred Obama , as compared to 67 percent of the overall Hispanic vote .
That marks a 14 - point rise in young Hispanic support for the Democratic candidate since the previous election , and a 10 - point improvement with the Hispanic population overall .
Fifty - two or 53 percent of eligible youth turned out to vote , marking at least a four percentage - point rise since 2004 by CIRCLE ’s tally , continuing an upward trend in youth turnout since 2000 — and the highest percentage since 1992 .
While during the primaries Obama ’s white youth support was mostly limited to the college - educated , he bested McCain among white youth without a college degree by 52 - 45 percent , while winning those with a degree by 57 - 41 percent .
Remarkably , he did this even while McCain won with whites of all ages without a degree by 58 - 40 percent .
Obama won precisely half of all young working - class white men , 10 points better than any Democrat since the Reagan era .
Obama won among young white women without a degree by 54 to 45 percent , the first time a Democrat had more than 50 percent support from this group in the post - Reagan era .
His highest level of support from young whites came from college - educated women , who backed him by 61 to 38 percent .
While Obama won only 24 percent of white evangelicals , a slight improvement from Kerry 's 21 percent , 32 percent of young white evangelicals supported him , double the 16 percent who backed Kerrry .
In a new study , aged laboratory animals that ate a diet rich in the berry and grape compound pterostilbene performed better than those in a group that did not eat the enriched diet , scientists with the Agricultural Research Service ( ARS ) have reported .
Pterostilbene reversed measurable negative effects of aging on brain function and behavioral performance .
Neuroscientist James Joseph , psychologist Barbara Shukitt - Hale and colleagues at the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University in Boston , Mass. , collaborated on the study with chemist Agnes Rimando of the ARS Natural Products Utilization Research Laboratory in Oxford , Miss .
For the two - part study , the researchers wanted to determine if pterostilbene would be effective in reversing the effects of aging on mature rats .
For the first part of the study , they tested seven stilbene compounds in cell cultures and found that pterostilbene was the most effective at preventing oxidative stress .
For the second part of the study , they fed aged rats one of three diets : control , or control adjusted to include either low or high concentrations of pterostilbene .
The results indicated that in aging rats , pterostilbene was effective in reversing cognitive decline and that improved working memory was linked to pterostilbene levels in the hippocampus region of the brain .
The study results are the latest in a series of ARS cell culture and animal model studies published in the last decade that shed light on relationships between various dietary components and brain function while aging .
The authors noted that there are additional berry compounds showing similar potential , which they continue to investigate in animal and cell models .
The researchers followed protocols approved by the Frederick , Md. - based Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International and a Boston , Mass . - based Internal Animal Care Review Committee .
The study was published recently in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry .
CONTRARY to popular belief , a rush of blood to a certain brain region is not always linked to neural activity there , a finding that may guide future brain scan experiments .
Functional MRI scans measure blood flow in the brain .
Neuroscientists interpret this as a sign that neurons are firing , usually as someone performs a task or experiences an emotion .
This enables them to link the emotion to the brain region where there was blood flow .
Now , Aniruddha Das from Columbia University in New York and colleagues have shown that blood flow can occur without accompanying neural activity .

CEO of top
Swiss bank dies suddenly , sparking rumours of suicide
Bank chief Alex Widmer died unexpectedly
The CEO of Julius Baer , Switzerland 's biggest private bank , has died unexpectedly .
Alex Widmer , a widower , died aged 52 , leaving behind three children .
It has been reported that close friends of Mr Widmer 's family said he committed suicide , though Swiss police will not confirm this .
Julius Baer dates back to the 19th century and manages more than 360 billion Swiss franch in assets for wealthy individuals and institutions .
Shares in Julius
Baer have lost some 60 per cent this year as markets have worried about outflows at its hedge fund GAM .
However a spokesman for the bank said there was no link between Mr Widmer 's death and the group 's current activities , but declined to give further details on the cause of death on Wednesday night .
A source said employees at the bank had been told Widmer had died from an unspecified illness .
In an interview with Bloomberg conducted the day before his death , Mr Widmer said : ' Even if global wealth creation is getting slower , we should do better than the rest . '
A Zurich - based trader who did not want to be named said : ' It is a great shame .
It is very sad .
He [ Mr Widmer ] embodied Julius Baer .
He was the most important person in private banking .'
Following the news , shares in Julius Baer fell 6.5 per cent to 34.60 Swiss francs , underperforming a 1.5 per cent drop in the DJ Stoxx index of European banking stocks .
Mr Widmer will be succeeded by Hans de Gier , who served as the CEO of Julius Baer Group until September 2008 when he stepped down to focus on his role as chairman of hedge fund unit GAM .
' This is a setback for the bank .
Widmer is widely regarded as the architect of its new direction , ' Claude Zehnder , a ZKB trading analyst said .
' However , with De Gier they have someone very experienced in place who knows the bank inside out , ' he said .
Commenting on Mr Widmer 's death , Chairman Raymond Baer said in a statement : ' We have lost a dear friend , a good colleague and a charismatic leader .
Alex very successfully opened up new dimensions for the Private Banking business of Julius Baer .
' His enormous commitment , his active relationship and close involvement with the clients and his passion for banking will forever serve as a model for us . '
Mr Widmer joined the Julius Baer Group in 2005 as a member of the executive board and head of private banking and became the CEO of Bank Julius Baer in November 2007 .
The bulk of his career was spent at Credit Suisse , where he worked for 19 years , as global head of private banking from 2002 to 2005 and as a member of the executive board .
Before that he was the chief executive of Credit Suisse 's Asia - Pacific and Middle East business .
He also worked in Tokyo and New York early in his career after gaining a doctorate in economics from the prestigious St. Gallen university in 1985 .
Alex came across some beautiful images of Aurora Borealis ( northern lights ) .
They are called aurora australis
In the southern hemisphere .
I thought it might be interesting to throw in some of the appearances of the aurora in mythology that I found at wikipedia .
In Bulfinch ’s Mythology , Thomas Bulfinch claimed in 1855 that in Norse mythology :
The Valkyrior are warlike virgins , mounted upon horses and armed with helmets and spears .
/…/
When they ride forth on their errand , their armour sheds a strange flickering light , which flashes up over the northern skies , making what men call the “ aurora borealis ” , or “ Northern Lights ” .
Pretty stunning stuff .
Must be incredible to see it live .
Check out more pictures …
An old Scandinavian name translates as “ herring flash ” .
The northerners believed the aurora was a reflection cast by large swarms of herring into the sky .
Yet a different Scandinavian source calls them ” the fires that surround the North and South edges of the world . ”
The Finns named the northern lights revontulet , or fox fires .
According to their legend , foxes made of fire lived in Lapland .
And , the fox fires were the sparks they took up into the atmosphere on their tails .
In Estonian the northern lights are called virmalised , which is a spirit being of higher realms .
Some are bad guys and some are good .
The Sami people believed that a person should be careful and quiet when in the presence of the northern lights ( called guovssahasat in Northern Sami ) .
To mock the northern lights or singing about them was considered dangerous and could be reason for the lights to come down on a person and kill him / her .
The Algonquin think the lights are their ancestors dancing around a fire .
In Latvian folklore the aurora borealis , especially if red and observed in winter , are fighting souls of dead warriors especially if it is red and seen in the winter .
It is an omen foretelling disaster .
Russian folklore associates the northern lights with the fire dragon ( “ Ognenniy Zmey ” ) .
The dragon came to women to seduce them when their husbands were gone .
The northern lights in Scotland were known as “ the mirrie dancers ” or na fir -chlis .
The dance often ended in a fight – “ the mirrie dancers bled each other last night ” .
The appearance of the lights also predicted bad weather .
Prospectors during the Klondike Gold Rush believed that the aurora borealis was the reflection of the mother lode of all gold .
And , the Inuit people of Alaska say that the “ shadows ” within the display are relatives and friends who have gone to the sky .
They march and dance to remind the living people of their presence .
When dogs bark and howl at the sounds of the aurora borealis , it is because the dogs recognize their companions .
I was fortunate to see a bit of the northern lights when my wife and I took a cruise there last fall .
Now I realize we missed a lot more than we saw .

German Investigators Worried Growing Links Seen Between Hells Angels and Neo-Nazis
Motorcycle gangs have long kept the police busy with violence and drug trafficking .
But now investigators are alarmed by a new threat : Militant neo-Nazis are rising through the ranks of the Hells Angels in Germany .
Lately , it seems like everywhere you turn , someone is crowing that they saw the current financial crisis coming .
George Soros. John Paulson .
Steve Eisman .
Armando Falcon .
There are so many of them , you wonder who did n’t see it coming .
The answer is , well , most people .
After the jump , have a look back at some of the stocks chosen in the annual investment guides of some leading publications ( including , alas , this one ) as smart buys in 2008 .
Jon Birger , senior writer , Fortune ’s Investors Guide 2008
What he said then : “ Question :
What do you call it when an $ 8 billion asset write - down translates into a $ 30 billion loss in market cap ?
Answer : an overreaction … Smart investors should buy [ Merrill Lynch ] stock before everyone else comes to their senses . ”
What we know now : Merrill agreed to sell itself Bank of America to avoid a Lehman - like flameout in a deal closing in January .
Meanwhile , Merrill ’s shares plummeted 77 percent .
Elaine Garzarelli , president of Garzarelli Capital , in Business Week ’s Investment Outlook 2008
What she said then : “ Garzarelli is advising investors to buy some of the most beaten - down stocks , including those of giant financial institutions such as Lehman Brothers , Bear Stearns , and Merrill Lynch .
What would cause her to turn bearish ?
Not much .
‘ Our indicators are extremely bullish . ’ ”
What we know now :
As of January 1 , none of these firms will still exist .
Lehman went bankrupt .
JPMorgan and Chase bought Bear Stearns in a fire sale .
We all know Merrill ’s fate .
Sarah Ketterer , CEO of Causeway Capital Management in Fortune ’s Investors Guide 2008
What she said then : Q : “ Sarah , where to you see value ? ” A : “ There are [ financial firms ] that have been tainted by this huge credit problem … Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been pummeled .
Our stress - test analysis indicates those stocks are at bargain basement prices . ”
What we know now :
The federal government placed these two lenders under “ conservatorship ” in September .
By then , shares of Fannie and Freddie had lost 90 percent of their value .
Jon Birger , senior writer , in Fortune ’s Investors Guide 2008
What he said then : “ CEO Jeffrey Immelt has been leading a successful makeover at General Electric , though you would n’t know it from GE ’s flaccid stock price .
Our bet is that in a stormy market investors will gravitate toward the ultimate blue chip . ”
What we know now : GE ’s stock price has tumbled 55 percent percent this year and it ’s on the verge of losing its triple - A credit rating .
Analysts are nervous about its financial - services division , which provides about half of GE ’s earnings .
Archie MacAllaster , chairman of MacAllaster Pitfield MacKay in Barron ’s 2008 Roundtable
What he said then : “ A lot of people think Bank of America will cut its dividend , but I do n’t think there ’s a chance in the world .
I think they ’ll raise it this year ; they have raised it a little in each of the past 20 to 25 years .
My target price for the stock is $ 55 . ”
What we know now : BofA may not have gone the way of Lehman .
But investors who sold when MacAllaster told them to buy were shrewd .
The bank ’s share price now hovers around $ 14 , and it has slashed its dividend in half .
One of our own : James J. Cramer , contributing editor , in his “ Future of Business ” column in New York Magazine
What he said then : “ Goldman Sachs makes more money than every other brokerage firm in New York combined and finishes the year at $ 300 a share .
Not a prediction — an inevitability . ”
What we know now :
In mid-December , Goldman Sachs ’ share price was $ 78 .
The firm also announced a $ 2.2 billion quarterly loss , its first since going public nine years ago .
Sarah Palin expressed displeasure Friday with media reports of her recent comments .
Palin : Kennedy qualified , experienced
Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin expressed displeasure Friday with media reports of her recent comments about Caroline Kennedy .
“ I was not commenting at all on Caroline Kennedy as a prospective U.S. senator , but rather on the seemingly arbitrary ways in which news organizations determine the level and kind of scrutiny given to those who aspire to public office , ” Palin said .
“ In fact , I consider Ms. Kennedy qualified and experienced , and she could serve New York well . ”

“ As a public official , I expect criticism and I expect to be held accountable for how I govern , ” the Alaska governor added .
“ But the personal , salacious nature of recent reporting , and often the refusal of the media to correct obvious mistakes , unfortunately discredits too many in journalism today , making it difficult for many Americans to believe what they see in the media . ”
In an interview with conservative filmmaker John Ziegler for his coming move “ How Obama Got Elected , ” posted on YouTube on Wednesday , Palin said that Kennedy has gotten softer treatment in the press because of a “ class issue . ”
“ I ’ve been interested to see how Caroline Kennedy will be handled and if she will be handled with kid gloves or if she will be under such a microscope , ” Palin said during the interview .
“ It ’s going to be interesting to see how that plays out and I think that as we watch that we will perhaps be able to prove that there is a class issue here also that was such a factor in the scrutiny of my candidacy versus , say , the scrutiny of what her candidacy may be . ”
Palin ’s office released the remarks along with a statement expressing “ dismay ” with coverage of the comments , especially with a story in Politico Thursday that the office said “ inflames ” the governor ’s comments on Kennedy .
“ Ironically , the latest media eruption concerning the governor came out of an interview she gave to a filmmaker who is creating a documentary on distortions by the national press , ” the statement read .
“ Particularly troubling was a post on Politico.com titled , ‘ Palin : Media Goes Easy on Kennedy . ’
The headline inflames the governor ’s quote in the transcript , in which she answered a question about media treatment of the prospect that Caroline Kennedy would be appointed to the U.S. Senate . ”

The latest TIC data provides yet more evidence that financial globalization -- the rise in cross - border flows -- has peaked .
At least temporarily .
Foreigners are buying far fewer long - term US bonds than they used too .
Look at a plot of gross foreign purchases of US long - term bonds and gross foreign purchases of US equities .
Both are heading down .
Net long - term bond flows are heading down too .
Net equities are n’t heading down , but ( see below ) that is largely because Americans are now selling their foreign equity portfolio faster than foreigners are selling their US equities .
It is also striking , at least to me , that bond inflows have been so much larger than equity inflows over the past few years .
Popular coverage of the " markets " in the US focuses on the equity market .
But the capacity of the US to sustain its low savings rate hinged not on foreign demand for US equity but rather foreign demand for US bonds .
Apart from a brief period around the .com craze , the US never financed its external deficit by selling equity to the world .
What is driving the fall in demand for long - term US bonds ?
Number one , a fall in demand for corporate bonds .
Remember that all " private " mortgage backed securities are considered corporate bonds in the balance of payments data .
Private US demand for foreign bonds is also falling .
The fall in demand for corporate bonds over the last three months has been quite sharp -- comparable to the fall in the three months after the August subprime crisis .
Then again , there is no need to look at the balance of payments data to know that things are bad .
But a second factor is now also at play .
Central bank demand for long - term bonds is falling .
Right now that is largely because central banks are shifting ( rather dramatically ) into short - term bills .
But the fall in the pace of reserve growth implies that the overall pace of central bank purchases of both short and long - term US debt should eventually slow .
Over the past 12 months , central bank purchases of t- bills have exceeded total foreign purchases of equities by a factor of about four .
Foreign purchases of long - term Treasuries ( mostly from central banks ) exceeded foreign purchases of equities by a factor of between five and six .
And total foreign demand for Treasuries exceeded foreign demand for US equities by a factor of about ten .
If the US were n’t the US , I suspect analysts would now be worried about a fall in the quality of financing for the US external deficit .
The US external deficit is increasingly financed at the short - end of the curve ( usually a danger sign ) and by the sale of the United States existing portfolio of external assets , not by the sale of long - term debt .
But the financing of the US deficit always has been a bit strange .
The big surge in demand for US debt afterall corresponded with a weak dollar , not a strong dollar .
It reflected a world where private capital was flowing into the emerging world , financing enormous reserve growth that fed back into enormous central bank demand for US debt .
It that sense it was n’t ever a sign of true strength .
And the surge in foreign demand for corporate bonds after 2004 clearly reflected the expansion of the shadow banking system .
American money market funds bought short - term paper issued by various " vehicles " in Europe ( and especially the UK ) that bought long - term US debt .
This flow reflected the need for institutions who borrowed short and lend long to take credit risk when the yield curve flattened as much as anything else .
That intermediation just happened to be structured in a way that generated large cross - border flows .
It did n’t , it turns out provide much net financing .
That is why -- at least in my view - the collapse of European demand for US corporate bonds did n’t force an immediate correction in the current account deficit .
Conversely , the surge in short - term inflows to the US coincided with the dollar ’s recent rally .
That in some sense is the puzzle .
In the past , record demand for US financial assets was strangely enough tied to dollar weakness .
And now a deterioration in the quality of the inflows is tied to dollar strength .
Go figure .
Still , it is hard to be too worried about this shift so long as the dollar remains strong .
Too strong actually .
In the long - run , as Martin Wolf rightly notes , the US needs to be able to rely at least in part on net exports for growth .
The dollar ’s recent rally makes that harder .
Moreover , the current account deficit is going down not up , largely because of the fall in oil prices .
That -- together with the world economy ’s broad - based weakness -- seems to mitigate against a near - term dollar crisis .
No one right now wants to see their currency appreciate .
Not when exports are falling across the board .
At the same time , it is risky to finance a large external deficit with short - term debt .
Even for the US .
If the US deficit starts to head back up again -- as , for example , the effect of the recent fall in oil prices wears off and a large fiscal stimulus in the US stimulates the world economy -- without a shift in the composition of inflows , there would be cause for concern .
That just highlights a bigger issue , one that I do n’t think has been settled :
How will the world ’s remaining current account deficits be financed in the post - crisis world ?
Right now , they are in some sense being financed by the unwinding of all the pre-crisis bets .
And by running down existing stocks of foreign assets .
But that process cannot last forever ...
Analysis by Stephen Leahy
QUEBEC CITY , Canada , Dec 15 ( IPS )
The roof of our house is on fire while the leaders of our family sit comfortably in the living room below preoccupied with “ political realities ” .
That was essentially the message from 1,000 scientists from around the world along with northern indigenous leaders gathered in Quebec City for the International Arctic Change conference that concluded last weekend .
“ Climate change and its impacts are accelerating at unexpected rates with global consequences , ” delegates warned in a statement .
Presenting data from hundreds of studies and research projects detailing the Arctic region ’s rapid meltdown and cascading ecological impacts , participants urged governments to take “ immediate measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions ” .
By happy coincidence , 190 governments were meeting at the same time in Poznan , Poland to do just that : reach an agreement on how much to reduce emissions from the burning of fossil fuels .
Except that they decided to do nothing .
They could n’t even agree to help poorer nations survive the ever - worsening climate crisis by providing funds to strengthen infrastructure , build flood defences and improve agriculture .
In chance hallway encounters in Quebec City , scientists — strictly off the record for fear of losing funding — said climate change is happening far faster and is having much larger impacts than they ever imagined .
“ Climate change will be an overwhelming global tragedy without major reductions now , ” said one Canadian expert .
In Poznan , politicians declared the meeting a success and pledged to agree to cut emissions at next year ’s meeting in Copenhagen .
Meanwhile , the physics of carbon and climate will not wait for economic recovery or a more felicitous political climate .
In 1992 , the global community came together in Rio de Janeiro , agreed climate change was a real danger and promised to reduce their emissions of CO2 and other global warming gases .
It took five years to create the first climate change treaty , the Kyoto Protocol , which committed rich countries to emissions reductions of five percent below their 1990 levels .
Many countries will meet their very modest reduction targets — with notable exceptions like Canada and Japan , which are grossly over - target by 30 percent .
But as far as the atmosphere is concerned , all that counts is global CO2 emissions , and they ’ve skyrocketed .
Emissions of CO2 have been growing about four times faster since 2000 than during the previous decade , despite efforts to curb emissions in a number of Kyoto Protocol signatory countries , reports the Global Carbon Project , an international collaboration of climate scientists .
“ This new update of the carbon budget shows the acceleration of both CO2 emissions and atmospheric accumulation is unprecedented and most astonishing during a decade of intense international developments to address climate change , ” said Pep Canadell , executive director of the Global Carbon Project , in a statement last September .
The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere today is well ahead of worst - case projections , hence the accelerating meltdown in the Arctic .
Rather than panicking , governments of Arctic countries seem preoccupied with what they view as an opportunity to exploit the region for its potential energy resources , said Michael Byers , an international law expert at the University of British Columbia in Canada .
“ National governments do n’t get it .
We need to keep oil and gas where it is , in the ground , ” Byers told IPS in Quebec City .

Anger , relief and disappointment - that 's what sums can do Tears , tantrums and murder .
Far from being a cold and rational exercise , maths can provoke the full range of human emotions , explains Professor Ian Stewart .
In these days when wearing your heart on your sleeve is seen as qualifying you to be a true human being , rather than some robotic control freak , scientists and mathematicians are often viewed as being far too rational to be truly human .
Especially mathematicians , who spend all their days doing boring sums in some remote world of the intellect .
Some news , guys : it 's not true .
Not just that we do n't spend our time doing sums , but also we possess entirely normal human emotions - and express them .
Agreed , mathematicians are seldom seen bursting into tears or shouting in the streets , but that 's mostly because mathematicians are seldom seen .
Or , more to the point , seldom noticed , because there are hundreds of thousands of mathematically qualified people in British society , working in a huge range of jobs .
Shouting matches
And it's true that the way mathematics is usually presented strips out the emotional element - but the same goes for banking , architecture , whatever .
Anyone who has ever been to a mathematics conference , or sat in a mathematics department common room , notices very quickly that not only are mathematicians emotionally committed to their subject , but the emotions often run high .
Shouting matches are not unusual .
The only time mathematics has driven me to tears was when I was 10
There is an important difference , however : when two mathematicians are arguing at the tops of their voices , eventually one of them says : " Oops , sorry , I 've just seen why you 're right . "
And the two are once more the best of friends and go off to the pub together .
One of the great emotional TV moments for mathematics was John Lynch 's wonderful programme about Andrew Wiles 's solution to Fermat 's Last Theorem , a famous problem that had baffled mathematicians for 350 years .
Relating how his epoch - making solution very nearly collapsed because of a logical error , Wiles is on the verge of tears .
The entire programme shows how committed mathematicians are to their research ; how solving a problem becomes a kind of personal quest .
Dorothy Parker once said that the movie actress Katharine Hepburn ran " the gamut of emotions from A to B " .
Mathematicians may not quite manage A to Z , but they get a good way into the alphabet - joy , sadness , a sense of beauty , anger , relief , worry , disappointment .
Hold back the tears
Even a casual glance at the lives of some of the subject 's greats should dispel the notion of mathematicians as ultra-rational calculating machines .
Leopold Kronecker 's dislike of Georg Cantor 's new theory of infinite numbers drove Cantor to a nervous breakdown .
Évariste Galois combined dramatic work on the equation of the fifth degree with even more dramatic involvement in French revolutionary politics , culminating in a duel over a woman in which he was killed .
David Hilbert was incandescent with rage when Kurt Gödel drove a coach and horses through his massive programme to put all of mathematics on sound logical foundations .
This was no surprise : Hilbert had devoted years to the project , and had made what seemed to be a lot of progress .
Then it all came tumbling down .
The only time mathematics has driven me to tears was when I was 10 .
There 's a lot of evidence that people understand maths much more easily when it is formulated in a social context .
Abstract puzzles involving cards with letters on one side and numbers on the other baffle most of us , but the same question can be instantly obvious when posed in terms of under - age drinking in a pub .
Quite a few psychologists now think that the rational mind cannot exist without an underlying emotional mind
My problem was the exact opposite : I was being asked to solve question of the type : " When Fred is half as old as Emily was when Arthur was born , how many dogs does it take to change a light bulb in three days ? "
Write it as algebra , and I could solve it at the drop of a hat .
But I was having real problems turning the social story into symbols .
My subject has , however , driven me to the use of distinctly strong language when my beautiful solution that I have been working on for weeks turns out to be riddled with holes .
The emotion of frustration is very familiar to any research mathematician , being the normal state of affairs about 99 % of the time .
The deep emotion of joy when a solution finally presents itself makes all of the frustration endurable .
Beautiful sunset
There can even be humour in mathematics , and I 'm not referring to jokes : the actual maths may be genuinely funny .
For example a breakthrough in my current research relies upon dividing both sides of an equation by zero .
Ordinarily this is a no - go area , leading to nonsense .
But in my particular problem , you can sensibly divide by zero provided you start not with zero alone , but by two zeros multiplied together .
I laughed out loud when I saw how it worked .
Mind you , I do n't expect you to be equally amused - you have to be emotionally involved in the problem , and frustrated by not being allowed to do what you want , to find it funny .
The word ' calculating ' has several meanings Quite a few psychologists now think that the rational mind cannot exist without an underlying emotional mind .
You have to be committed to being rational .
Only then can you override your fervent desire for certain things to be true , and accept that they 're not .
What makes us human is not raw emotion : we share that with many animals .
More refined emotion , such as a feeling of awe at a beautiful sunset , is another matter .
But to me , the real essence of humanity is to experience emotions , but not to let them take over completely if that 's a bad idea .

As someone who struggled massively with maths at school , and am now teaching it , I identify with the frustration and the triumph once things click into place .
My biggest frustration though is seeing maths books claiming to have examples " placed in the real world " yet when you open them , they are n't .
Is there any wonder people still run scared of the subject ?

( CNN ) -- Improper wiring by military contractor KBR at U.S. bases in Iraq led to electrical shocks about once every three days for nearly two years , according to Defense Department documents obtained by CNN .
Sgt. Ryan Maseth , a 24 - year - old Green Beret , died in a shower at his base in Iraq in January 2008 .
Houston , Texas - based KBR , the military contractor responsible for maintaining and providing services at most of U.S. bases across Iraq , had " systemic failures " in its electrical work that threatened the life , health and safety of people inside the bases , according to the documents , from a violation report obtained by CNN .
There were 231 electrical shocks of personnel in Iraq from September 2006 through July 2008 in facilities maintained by KBR , the documents state .
KBR has been at the center of controversy surrounding the electrocution of soldiers on bases in Iraq .
Much of the controversy has surrounded the electrocution of Sgt. Ryan Maseth , a highly decorated 24 - year old Green Beret from Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania .
Maseth was electrocuted in a shower on a U.S. base in Baghdad , Iraq , on January 2 , 2008 .
At least 18 troops have been electrocuted in Iraq since 2003 , and many of the electrocutions have been attributed to shoddy electrical work done on U.S. bases -- work managed by U.S. contractors -- according to Pentagon sources .
Each of the electrocutions has occurred in different locations and under various circumstances .
The violation report shows that electrical shocks and problems with wiring and grounding continued for much of last year , long after Maseth 's electrocution .
Heather Browne , a KBR spokesperson , said the company could not comment on the specific language in the document obtained by CNN because KBR had not seen it .
But the company has previously said that " KBR found no link between work it 's been asked to perform and the reported electrocutions " and that " KBR remains committed to the safety and security of all employees and those the company serves .
We have fully cooperated with the government when issues have been raised about work in Iraq and we will continue to do so . "
On the death of Maseth , the company has said , " KBR 's investigation has produced no evidence that KBR was responsible for Sgt. Maseth 's death .
We have cooperated fully with all government agencies investigating this matter and will do so in the future . "
Last week , CNN obtained other documents that show the Army investigator assigned to look into Maseth 's electrocution blamed KBR for the death , stating that she believed the cause was " negligent homicide " and that there is " credible information that KBR 's negligence led to Maseth 's death . "
The revelations about the frequency of shocks on bases are found in the complete and detailed report that led to KBR 's citation for being in serious violation of its contract several months ago .
At that time , the Pentagon 's Defense Contract Management Agency gave KBR what is known as a " Level III Corrective Action Request . "
That is issued only when a contractor is found in " serious non-compliance " and is just one step below the possibility of suspending or terminating a contract , Pentagon officials said .
While that violation citation was previously known , the report 's precise language and details of KBR 's alleged " failures " were not known until now .
The 45 - page report alleges KBR had improper electrical wiring , grounding and overall electrical problems across Iraq .
" The government found systemic KBR failures to properly ground and bond facilities -- failures that contributed to theater personnel receiving shocks in KBR maintained facilities on average once every three days " between September 2006 and July 31 , 2008 , the detailed report says .
That information , the report says , came from KBR 's own statistical records .
" The conditions of these facilities created Life , Health , Safety ( LHS ) conditions for the occupants .
The lack of grounding and bonding , among other electrical deficiencies " were " identified and confirmed by three separate independent inspection teams " from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers , the U.S. Army Combat Safety Center and a multinational force working with fire and electricity , the report states .
" Most facilities inspected had electrical deficiencies because KBR failed to consistently follow contract standards every time it constructed or emplaced a facility , inspected a facility , responded to a service order request , or performed maintenance and / or repairs on facilities , generators and utilities , " the report says .
Also , the report says , " the Government is unaware of any efforts undertaken by KBR to independently identify , assess , and implement corrective actions to its electrical support services or quality control inspection program as a result of the extensive number of electrical shock incidents .
... "
Sen . Robert Casey , D - Pennsylvania , said his office has received numerous anecdotal reports of U.S. military personnel continuing to receive electric shocks .
" While KBR continues to assure the American people that it has completed its own investigations and has found no evidence of corporate wrongdoing , the emerging facts prove otherwise , " Casey said .
" According to an internal investigation led by the Pentagon 's contract auditors , we now know that KBR failed to comply with basic contractual requirements even while being rewarded with billions of dollars by U.S. taxpayers . "
Casey called on the Pentagon " to treat this issue for the danger it represents . "
The Defense Department , he said , " has taken some encouraging actions [ but ] it needs to do much more . "
" And it is high time that KBR begin to suffer real consequences for what I consider to be blatant contractual noncompliance , " Casey said .

Troy Davis supporters oppose execution
( front page )
The appeal is based on the fact that since the conviction enough evidence has been presented that a reasonable juror could find Davis not guilty .
Seven of nine prosecution witnesses in the case have recanted their testimony .
The night before the hearing , supporters of Davis gathered outside the federal appeals courthouse in Atlanta .
Speakers vowed to continue the fight to save Daviss life and overturn his conviction .
The vigil was organized by Georgians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty and Amnesty International in Atlanta .
More than 200 people attended the hearing , filling the courtroom and an another set aside for the overflow .
The families of Mark MacPhail and of Troy Davis both attended .
Addressing the media after the hearing , Martina Correia , Daviss sister , pledged to keep fighting , not just for Troy , but for others like him who do not have people fighting for them .
She pointed to a recent episode of the television show Boston Legal , which referenced Daviss case , as an example of the progress of the campaign to defend Davis .
 Troy deserves his day in court ,  Correia said .
She went on ,  I hope the case illuminates what is wrong with the justice system .
Are we protecting innocent people or are we protecting the system ?
This is why we need to abolish the death penalty ,  she told the media at an impromptu press conference in the street outside the federal court building .
She said the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act should be repealed .
Laura Moye from Georgians for an Alternative to the Death Penalty said that getting this hearing and the turnout of Daviss supporters is a result of the cumulative effect of what supporters of the case have done .
The judges said the hearing would determine what was left of the case without the recanted testimony .
Thomas Dunn , one of Daviss attorneys , argued that Stephen Sanders , one of the two witnesses who have not recanted , was not a credible witness .
Sanders initially told police that he could not identify the shooter .
But during the trial he identified Davis .
Under prodding from Judge Rosemary Barkett , Senior Assistant Attorney General Susan Boleyn admitted that Sanders had not been brought before any line up with other possible suspects .
Judge Stanley Marcus noted that since the trial three witnesses have come forward to implicate Redd Coles , who was at the scene of the fatal shooting .
The cops focused on Davis as the suspect after Coles implicated him the day after the killing .
Coles is the only other witness who has not recanted his testimony .
The three judges will rule on whether there is enough evidence to grant Davis a new trial .
No date has been set for when the panel will issue its ruling .

( CNN ) -- A Continental Airlines jetliner flew with one engine powered by a mix of oils from algae and jatropha plants Wednesday in what the plane 's manufacturer called an " outstanding " test flight .
Continental Airlines is the third commercial carrier to test biofuels in their planes .
The Boeing 737 burned less fuel in the biofuel - powered engine than a conventionally powered engine , and the two performed identically during the one - hour , 40 - minute flight , Boeing spokesman Terrance Scott said .
" There was no hesitation at all , " Scott said .
" If you had to grade it on a scale of one to 10 , it would be an 11 . "
Wednesday 's test , conducted from Continental 's hub in Houston , Texas , was the first by a U.S. carrier and the first to use a blend of oils from algae and the jatropha , Scott said .
One engine ran on a 50 - 50 mix of that combination with conventional jet fuel , while the other ran entirely on conventional fuel .
The 737 is one of the most common aircraft in service in U.S. markets .
A crew of two pilots and an engineer put the jet through a series of exercises , including measuring the biofuel 's response to the cold of a 38,000 - foot cruising altitude and stopping and restarting the engines in mid-flight , Scott said .
Britain's Virgin Atlantic
Airways flew a much larger Boeing 747 on a test flight last February using a mix of coconut and babassu oil in one of the plane 's four main fuel tanks .
And last month , Air New Zealand tested a 747 with one of its engines powered by a blend of conventional jet fuel and jatropha oil .
" What we 're starting to see here is even when you combine two of them that have n't been flown before , the performance is equal to or better than traditional jet fuel with no degradation , " Scott said .
He said work on the fuels has been going on for about three years , and biofuel blends could start going into service in three to five years .
In a statement announcing the flight , Continental said it would examine the engines to make sure the fuel had " substantively no different " effect on them .
Records for pubs is quite a difficult subject to research as there are so many different pubs and determining what is a pub can itself be difficult .
Is a beer festival a pub ?
If so , the largest pub would probably be the Great British Beer Festival .
Also , a beer festival is likely to hold the title of longest bar .
Determining the oldest pub is also a very difficult process and one that will probably be never proven .
That aside , here are some pubs that can be classed as ' one of ' the oldest , biggest , smallest , etc .
Oldest Pub
The title for oldest pub is a hotly contended title and one that is quite difficult to prove .
Guinness World Records lists the Ye Olde Fighting Cocks which is a 11th Century structure built on an 8th Century site .
Many old pubs in Britain have been rebuilt once or twice and the Ye Olde Fighting Cocks is no exception .
The pub was rebuilt in 1485 but according to Guinness World Records the pub was not moved to another location .
The Man and Scythe disputes this and such claims it is the oldest pub dating to 1251 .
But , that pub was rebuilt in 1636 .
Another contender is The Ferry Boat in St Ives , Cambridgeshire claims to date from 560 AD but has only been proved as far back as 1100 .
I could go but instead you can visit this site which has more info on old pubs .
Incidentally , the oldest pub in Wales is the Skirrid Inn located in Abergavenny which can be traced back to 1110 .
As well as being a pub , it was also used as a courthouse where people were hanged inside the pub .
Unlike the other pubs I 've mentioned , the Skirrid Inn has stood for nine centuries .
Iraqi Translators Fear for Their Lives if Identities Are Revealed to Their Government
Friday , January 30 , 2009
By Joel Mowbray

Iraqi translators who serve U.S. forces are worrying that their lives will be in jeopardy if their names and personal information are turned over to the Iraqi government , as required by the recently - enacted Status of Forces Agreement .
Keeping translators safe has been an important concern since the start of the Iraq War , as many have been attacked or killed for " collaborating " with the United States .
Until last year , translators wore masks during missions to hide their identities .
Now , a Feb. 1 deadline looms for the translators ' names and personal information to be handed over to the Iraqi Ministry of Finance , for tax collection purposes .
Translators interviewed by FOXNews.com said this could be a " death sentence , " because their identities could easily fall into the hands of terrorists angered by the support they have given to the U.S. military .
Global Linguist Solutions , which employs between 6,000 and 7,000 local Iraqi translators , says it has n't turned over any information to the Iraqi government , and it does n't intend to .
" Translators ' personal identifiers absolutely will not be turned over , " said Douglas Ebner , media relations director for DynCorp International , the majority owner of GLS .
He stressed that his company is still negotiating tax issues with the Iraqi government , but he was emphatic that no personal information would be submitted to the Ministry of Finance .
The company 's goal , he said , is to ensure that the Iraq government receives all income and Social Security taxes owed to it without handing over the translators ' personal information .
" We certainly understand the security issues at stake here , " Ebner said .
On Dec. 31 , a GLS official in Baghdad sent an e-mail saying that the possibility of translators ' personal information being given to the Iraqi government was " a horrible development " and added , " I fear for everyone who completes this document and turns it in to the Iraqi Ministry of Finance . "
Though the e-mail said GLS would not hand over " employees ' personal information without written consent , " translators told FOXNews.com that they were rattled by the overall tone of the message .
Further unsettling is that a month has passed , and they feel they still have not been guaranteed that their identities will remain a secret .
Ebner said he was " not familiar " with with the Dec. 31 e-mail , and thus had no comment .
One translator , Jasim , said in an interview that he and his colleagues feel that their lives are in danger .
" Every translator knows of at least one other translator who has been tortured and killed , " he said .
Jasim said he has already lost a family member because of his work on behalf of the U.S.
His stepbrother was captured in the fall of 2007 , he said , and was tortured to death in an effort to get to him .
( A former State Department official , who asked to remain anonymous because of ongoing government contracts , said that kidnapping of relatives is the most pervasive problem for translators . )
" We work so hard to get the bad guys , to capture terrorists , and now , because of a political deal , they 're putting our lives at risk , " Jasim said .
" I 'm wanted by Al Qaeda , Sunni and Shiite militias , and there 's a price on my head .
And they want me to hand over my address ? "
Translators are n't the only ones who are upset .
Several soldiers expressed outrage that this issue was n't addressed in the Status of Forces Agreement .
" Our translators risk their lives to help us , " said Elisabeth Keene , a U.S. Army specialist who serves in a combat unit .
" Handing over their information to a new government would create a ready - made hit list if terrorists got a hold of it . "
Keene said that of the six translators assigned to her unit , one has already quit , and the other five have stated that they will quit before they hand over their personal information to the Iraqi government .
One of those five is Jasim .
The translators are worried that they will face an unbearable choice if GLS is unsuccessful in its negotiations with the Iraqi government : quit working with U.S. forces and possibly lose out on obtaining a special visa for Iraqi translators , or continue to work despite the greater likelihood of being identified and killed .
The special visas are a particular frustration for many translators .
Some receive their visas quickly , while others have had to wait up to two years .
A translator named Donna summed up her frustration by asking , " Is the American government going to help us like we have helped their army here ? "
To U.S. soldiers in Iraq , many translators have done much more than just " help . "
Some are even seen as heroes .
" Jasim has saved the lives of everyone in our unit several times over , " said Keene .
" I owe him my life . "

It 's interesting that voter turnout in California last month topped both of former Gov. Ronald Reagan 's presidential elections , as well as all other elections going back to 1972 when Richard Nixon , another Californian , trounced George McGovern :
More than 60 percent of Californians who were eligible to vote cast ballots in the Nov. 4 presidential election , the highest turnout since Richard Nixon and George McGovern competed for the office in 1972 , elections officials reported Tuesday .
The total includes all qualified citizens , including those who had not registered to vote .
The percentage of registered voters who cast ballots statewide was 80.6 percentage --- 81.9 percentage in Los Angeles County ...
The high turnout in Los Angeles County , not seen since 1968 , was a result of several factors , including strong voter interest in the presidential race between Barack Obama and John McCain , according to Dean Logan , the county 's Registrar - Recorder .
" It was the combination of an election that has historic significance to both major parties ' tickets , the economic situation and the fact that there was no sitting president or vice president on the ballot , " Logan said .
Controversial ballot measures , including a ban on gay marriage , also attracted Californians to the polls in high numbers .
The secretary of state will not post the voter totals until next week , but a survey of the counties indicates the highest turnout since 64.5 % of all those eligible to vote cast ballots in 1972 .
RUSSIAN T.V prank : Unsuspecting men trying out a free trial at a sauna club were in for a very pleasant surprise .

Before there was Manny being Manny , there was Rickey being Rickey .
Rickey Henderson , who is certain to be elected to the Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility , made an indelible impression with his talent on the field and with his character off the field .
Our reporters share some of their favorite Henderson stories .
' Gotta do what he gotta do '
Lou Brock once talked to me about the fear of the bag .
Baserunners get their ankles , knees , fingers and shoulders messed up sliding hell - bent into bases and lose their base - stealing edge over time because of their fear of getting so battered .
" The one exception is Rickey Henderson , " Brock told me .
" He accelerates harder into the bag than anyone who ever played . "
I sat in the Athletics ' clubhouse during batting practice several times with Henderson during his prime in Oakland from 1989 to 1991 .
His knees always were taped .
So were his fingers .
He had elbow pads and ice on his shoulder .
" Man , " he 'd say , " Rickey is in pain . "
What amazed me was that he still was one of the best offensive players of his time , a tremendously dangerous hitter despite all the injuries that would force most hitters out of the lineup .
" Rickey gotta do what he gotta do , " Henderson would say .
" But ship me to Boston , hit me third , forget the steals and I 'd hit .330 with 35 knocks . "
-- Peter Gammons
There 's only one Rickey
It was the off day before the start of the ' 93 World Series .
I thought a great angle would be a comparison of the two leadoff hitters .
Lenny Dykstra had had a fabulous season and had scored 143 runs , the most by any leadoff man since , who else , Henderson .
So I approached Henderson on the field and started to explain the story .
He said , " Who 's Lenny Dykstra ? "
I laughed .
Then I said , " He 's the other leadoff hitter . "
Henderson said , " There ai n't no other leadoff hitter but me . "
I tried to keep going with my angle .
He did n't see it .
" What 's Lenny Dykstra ever done ? " he asked .
I started to give the stats .
Henderson cut me off .
" Man , why you trying to compare some other guy with Rickey ?
There 's only one Rickey . "
And that was that .
There was , in fact , only one Rickey .
And that will never change .
Ever .
-- Jayson Stark
About that guy with the helmet
I had the pleasure of covering Rickey for a couple months when the Mariners signed him in the middle of 2000 -- " People who know me know I 'm a great guy to be around , '' he said after he arrived -- a signing that led to the famous story involving John Olerud .
Olerud , of course , always wore a helmet on the field because of a past brain aneurysm , and according to the story , Henderson supposedly went up to him and said , " You know , there was a guy on my last team who wore a helmet all the time , too . "
And Olerud supposedly replied , " Yeah , that was me . "
It 's a great story , except it never happened .
It was started as a joke by a Mets clubhouse employee and just spread from there .
Repeat :
It never happened .
But the beauty of the story , as Olerud said when I asked him about it , is that it sure sounded like something Henderson would say .
" Let 's look at what 's happened : The Cubs choked , the Bears [ stink ] , the Bulls go in the tank ... it becomes monotonous , " he said .
" You can't keep spanking [ Bulls general manager ] John Paxson every week .
You ca n't get on [ Bears coach ] Lovie Smith every day .
[ Bears GM ] Jerry Angelo still does n't have a quarterback .
I 'm going to keep writing that from now to kingdom come ? "
" Because I 'm going to be covering all these major events that involve championships , I 'm probably writing more positive , upbeat , triumphant stories , " Mariotti said .
" You 're not sitting back and analyzing , scrutinizing the same five teams over and over and over again .
There will still be shots at , say , Charles Barkley for his recent arrest , but the columnist expects to benefit from more variety .
A long - standing critic of local sports franchises , owners , management , athletes and anyone who accommodated them , Mariotti , 49 , said by phone Sunday that " the overall tone of the column probably changes " as a national columnist compared to when his focus was primarily on Chicago .
Jay Mariotti , who declared the future of sports writing " sadly is not in newspapers " when he resigned from the Chicago Sun - Times after 17 years in August , is joining AOL Sports as a full - time national columnist and commentator on a variety of its platforms .
Scott Ridge , director of AOL Sports , said Mariotti’s hire is part of an initiative to ramp up its original content in advance of a redesign and official re-launch this month .
Other recent additions include the hiring of former New York Daily columnist Lisa Olson and Chicago - based blogger Michael David Smith , as well as an increased role for former Dallas Morning News columnist Kevin Blackistone .
“ We 're thrilled to bring a powerful voice such as Jay 's to the site , ” Ridge said by e-mail .
“ He 's an independent thinker with strong opinions and immense writing talent . ”
Mariotti abruptly left the Sun- Times this summer shortly after returning from the Beijing Olympics , just weeks after it was announced he had agreed to a three - year contract extension .
Just as stunning as the timing of his exit was how it was celebrated by his former Sun-Times colleagues in print in the days that followed with the sort of invectives usually reserved for prison - bound politicians and last - place ballclubs , not someone whose work the paper had showcased for years .
" What the hell kind of serious newspaper does that ?
The National Enquirer ? " Mariotti said , noting his first column would address his Sun - Times departure .
" It was almost a backhanded compliment that they would sink to such levels .
" One of the reasons I wrote this column tomorrow for AOL is I felt a need to connect the dots , " he said .
" There was such a disconnect .
I needed to clarify what happened .
It does n't slam the Sun - Times .
It explains why I left and why I 'm thrilled to join this organization . "
If nothing else , Mariotti wo n't have to concern himself with when presses need to start rolling Thursday when he's in Miami covering the Bowl Championship Series title game between Oklahoma and Florida .
" For the first time I wo n't have to worry about a third - quarter plugger column or something as inane , " Mariotti said .
" I can watch the whole game , a four - hour game , go downstairs [ from the press box ] and come back up , spend two hours writing and have it appear on a post at 3 in the morning , which is four hours before the newspaper comes .
It 's the future . "
Of his time at the Sun - Times , Mariotti said he " had one of the best jobs in the country until about three years ago when it became obvious the paper was going to die . "
The Sun-Times , of course , is still kicking , although it eliminated Mariotti's position with his departure as part of its ongoing efforts to cut costs .
It is , however , dealing with a fight for control of its board as part of a larger debate over the best strategy for survival at a time when all traditional media companies are struggling economically .
Mariotti would n't rule out perhaps writing a Chicago column again , at least on an occasional basis and online , but he said " at this stage in my career " the opportunity to expand his purview was welcome .
" If I there was one wish I had about Chicago sports fans , it would be to be more open - minded , " he said .
" It 's a great sports world out there with all kinds of amazing stories every day .
... I was working in a city with a bubble around it .
Yeah , sometimes they care about Tiger Woods or Michael Phelps .
But I would be hard - pressed to find any metropolitan area that 's more consumed with its own stuff , including sports , than Chicago .
" So therefore , if you 're a Chicago columnist and you 're deciding on a certain topic one day , [ golfer ]
John Daly might be a great topic , but the sports fan in this city does n't care about John Daly as much as [ Bears quarterback ] Kyle Orton .
And after a while , even I lose interest in the topics . "
Asked if it was really Chicago fans who demanded the local focus or Chicago editors , Mariotti said , " I never thought about the editors as much as the fans .
I know how the fans are .
...
It 's a parochial city , very provincial .
When in doubt , write Chicago , write Chicago , write Chicago . "

No bailout for over - drawing nature 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
President - elect Barack Obama will face his first 100 days with extreme national - and global - scrutiny .
The economic crisis is clearly at the forefront of Americans ' minds and was a determining factor in this election .
What surfaced - from the housing to the credit crises - are the consequences of years of living beyond our financial means .
But largely ignored during the campaign was the fact that for years we have also been living beyond our ecological means .
There is a pressing need to build an economy that can deliver prosperity for Americans in the face of growing resource constraints .
It is encouraging that Obama pointed to our " planet in peril " during his speech at Grant Park .
Obama also must recognize that sustainability is at the core of any long - term financial recovery .
Quite simply , materials on which the economy relies comes from natural resources .
In 1997 , University of Vermont professor Bob Costanza placed a price tag on the free services nature provides to the global economy : $ 33 trillion , nearly twice the $ 18 trillion global GNP at the time .
Globally , humanity 's demand on nature for the past two decades has exceeded what the Earth can renew .
According to new data just released by our organization , Global Footprint Network , it now takes the planet almost a year and four months to regenerate the resources humans use in one year .
The impacts of this debt may not be as obvious as they are on Wall Street , but alarming consequences such as climate change , collapsing fisheries , soil depletion , air pollution and water shortages are already affecting the economy .
In the land of plenty , it is difficult to imagine running an ecological deficit .
Yet since 1970 , that is exactly what we have been doing .
Part of this deficit stems from putting polluting carbon into the atmosphere faster than it can be reabsorbed by forests and oceans , and part from depleting our own ecosystems .
The remainder is a result of importing significant amounts of resources from elsewhere in the world .
The United States has maintained its position as a global financial leader , but we are at a crossroads .
If we are to continue in this role and remain competitive , we must look to balancing our ecological budget , as other countries have already begun to do .
Creating resource - efficient cities , buildings and infrastructure , and fostering best - practice green technology and innovation are all pivotal ways to start .
Not only would these efforts benefit our environment , they would create much - needed jobs and help those who are disproportionately affected by the ecological deficit : low - income families , who cannot afford the higher cost of living triggered by resource scarcity , as we 've seen in climbing food prices .
In the ecological scenario , there is no bailout .
If neglected , ecological debt will make financial crises such as the current one more common , and more intractable .
There are no easy answers when it comes to living within our limits , financially or ecologically .
What is clear , however , is that one cannot be solved without considering the other .
Our new president will have 100 days - and the next four years - to prove he can rise to that challenge .
Experts fear the virus could mutate to allow human - to - human transmission A Chinese health expert has said that the country is likely to experience an upsurge in the number of human bird flu cases in the next month or two .
Shu Yuelong , from the National Centre for Disease Control and Prevention , said China needed to work harder at preventing bird flu outbreaks .
The warning came after the health ministry said a 16 - year - old boy had died in central Hunan province .
The human form of bird flu has now claimed three lives this year .
An earlier BBC report said Mr Shu had suggested that China risked an epidemic in the next few months , but it later became clear that he was referring to an increased risk of an epidemic occurring .
New Year exodus
The BBC's Beijing correspondent Quentin Sommerville reports that winter and spring are prime bird flu seasons , when more than 70 % of cases occur .
If there is no avian flu outbreak in poultry and yet there are human cases , does this mean the virus has changed ?
Dr York Chow , Secretary for Food and Health , Hong Kong Millions of Chinese people are heading home for Chinese New Year , increasing the chances of infection , he says , and in spring , migratory birds carry the virus over great distances .
On Monday , the authorities announced that a woman in eastern Shandong province had died from bird flu .
And two weeks ago , a 19 - year - old woman died in Beijing after handling ducks .
Meanwhile , a two - year - old toddler reported to have been in critical condition with the H5N1 virus has now recovered and is described as " stable " .
Chinese and Hong Kong media have been reporting that the toddler 's mother had died this month after exhibiting symptoms similar to bird flu , but her death has not been officially blamed on bird flu .
Neighbourly concern
The upsurge in bird flu deaths on the mainland is causing concern in Hong Kong , where consumers have been told not to eat poultry brought in from the Chinese mainland .
China 's ministry of agriculture said on Sunday that no bird flu epidemics were detected in Shanxi and Henan provinces after the two - year - old 's infection was confirmed .
Hong Kong 's secretary for food and health , Dr York Chow , said this was a cause for concern .
" There are two main areas we are concerned about : one is that if there is no avian flu outbreak in poultry and yet there are human cases , does this mean the virus has changed ?
" Secondly , we are worried about whether there are more so - called ' slightly infected ' chickens that actually might be carrying the virus and transmitting the disease , and yet do not show any symptoms or die from those illnesses , " Dr Chow said .
The ministry said China now faces " a grim situation " in bird flu prevention , threatened by frequent outbreaks in neighbouring countries , the Chinese state news agency Xinhua reported .
China has the world 's biggest poultry population and is seen as critical in the fight to contain the H5N1 strain of the virus , which resurfaced in Asia in 2003 , killing at least 247 people .
H5N1 does not transmit easily to humans but experts fear it could mutate and cause a worldwide pandemic .

In a statement later Mr Dexter said he was expressing his personal view , and it was not party policy to remove Mr Mugabe by military means .
But if democracy no longer existed in the country , he said , " the Zimbabwean people would have no alternative other than to mobilise to remove him " .
In practical terms , the prospect of South African troops massing on the Zimbabwean border is remote , even if Cope were to win the general election due next year - and its popularity has yet to be tested at the ballot box .
There are two sides to Anarchism , the political and the humanistic .
The political targets the mind , and you ’ll find examples of it anywhere where two Anarchists have come together only to argue in infinite detail every aspect of organisation , economic theory , and interpretation of the world .
The second involves giving a damn about humanity , your fellow men and women , music , art , poetry , giving the two fingers to big brother — it ’s the stuff that has romanticised Anarchism as a movement for centuries .
So let ’s fess up and admit it now .
Just stand tall and accept it .
The political side to Anarchism can sometimes feel as boring as a discussion about the optimal size for a felt elbow patch .
People can only read so many Anarchist tomes before their head becomes over - encumbered with words , phrases , concepts as it all works itself into a steady blur .
Many are unable to cope and so feel it ’s not worth the time .
We ’re already able to politicise people who are willing to enter the debate , argue with us and do our damned best to win them over .
But then what of the others who are n’t just interested in that ?
They may feel something ’s wrong , but to them it ’s a case of , “ You ca n’t fight city hall , ” while they go on about their daily routine .
The answer to reaching these people , is to bring back the romantic side to Anarchism .
What do I mean by this ?
Basically that we spend so much time bickering between one another , or alternatively , analysing to infinite detail often the most tedious details of political theory , that we forget the essential essence of Anarchism ; the humanistic part that promises the individualist dream .
We have so many working in such a calculated , precise manner that we have this tendency to ignore the fiery , human mannerisms that have made Anarchists famous .
You know , that whole “ living life , ” deal .
We have one .
This one .
Go out occaisionally and damn well enjoy yourself .
Go be an Anarchist ; eat , drink and be merry .
Dance , laugh with your friends and family , work hard at whatever you do .
Love your partner and love them to the fullest of your ability .
Live for the moment .
Get angry and rage .
Be all you can be or some similar cliché .
Bring back the larger than life , romantic vision of Anarchists and we ’ll no doubt attract more people to our ideas , for what is more attractive than a movement that is both ethically sound and emphasises being yourself and living ?
Even if you do n’t care about that , do it for yourself .
Anarchism is rebellious , subversive , and downright anti-authoritarian .
What can be more anti-authoritarian than actually enjoying yourself and living the best life possible ?
Throughout history some of the most rigged , authoritarian regimes have been puritanical and obsessed with some absurd notion of purity and how people should act — regimented , subservient , conforming .
To that I will proudly , and unapologetically raise my middle finger .
Each of us should burn as bright a flame as we can .
It ’s what makes us awesome .
As William Gillis wrote ( November 11 , 2008 ) ,
… Anarchism IS the individualist dream .
You , you personally , can singlehandedly start the motherfucking revolution .
You ’re going to have to .
Anarchism is not some mechanical proletarian revolt , nor is it some impersonal mathematical reality of laissez - faire economics .
And it ’s certainly not throwing up your hands and saying to hell with it .
Anarchism is a simple ethical and philosophical realization : to be a fully living , thinking human being you have to let go of your power over others .
They must let go of their power over you .
The thing is , you already know this .
( You ’re awesome . )
So why do n’t you embrace it further .
( And be more awesome . )
… So , and I ’m just saying this , what have you done today to spread your awesomeness ?
Now , I do n’t mean to take shots at those that have both the ability and the capacity to expertly learn and discuss specific subjects of Anarchism and explore deep philosophical arguments .
No doubt they will join the ranks of the greats among our philosophy that have shed sweat , blood and tears in order to teach us the lessons we have today and so deserve our deepest respect for their commitment .
In fact thanks to them , our philosophy , as William Gillis pointed out , is the most ethical out there .
We unwaveringly oppose all injustice regardless of whether it comes in the form of systematic theft of the fruits of our labour , the parasitic existence of the state , war , slavery , racism , nationalism or outright authoritarianism .
Those thinkers , scholars and philosophers among us are always working their ass off to advance it even further and provide us with new ideas , arguments , theories and organisational models .
But we should always take care to never neglect the other side of Anarchism either .
That is you .
Enjoy your life and live it with passion .
Laugh , love , live and be human .

On Tuesday , speaking from a pulpit in Westminster Abbey , the director general of the BBC , Mark Thompson , paid tribute to one of the corporation 's greatest journalists and broadcasters , Charles Wheeler , who died last summer at the age of 85 .
Thompson spoke in reverential terms of Wheeler : his independence ; his dislike of authority , any authority ; his relentless search for the truth , in postwar Germany , in the United States of the 1960s and 1970s , LBJ , Vietnam , Nixon ; in India , Kuwait , Kurdistan .
Thompson was right .
Wheeler was a giant among BBC journalists , rightly hailed as one of the best of his generation .
But even as Thompson spoke , the corporation was traducing every tradition that Wheeler , and many of us who still work for the BBC , have tried to live by .
The corporation 's chief operating officer , Caroline Thomson , had refused to allow it to broadcast an appeal on behalf of the Disasters Emergency Committee for Gaza .
She said that one reason was that " the BBC 's impartiality was in danger of being damaged " .
Could the BBC be sure , she added , that money raised for this cause would find its way to the right people ?
How is the BBC 's impartiality to be prejudiced by asking others to raise money for the victims of an act of war by a recognised state , an ally of Britain , using the most lethal armaments it can against a defenceless population ?
What sly little trigger went off in her head when Thomson questioned whether the aid would reach the right people ?
What right people ?
Hamas , the elected representatives of the Palestinian people ?
The hospitals and clinics run by private charities and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency ?
The mosques ?
The citizens of Gaza , persecuted beyond measure not only by their Israeli enemies but by the western powers who arm and sustain Israel and defy the democratic vote of the Palestinian people ?
Is Thomson more fussed about some imaginary " war on terror " that even the new White House is shying away from than she is about upholding the free speech and freedom of action of the corporation ?
This pusillanimous obeisance to some imagined governmental threat has aroused unprecedented anger across the BBC .
Reporters and correspondents still on the staff , and who will not name themselves , are beside themselves with rage against a corporation that is traducing the very ideals it is supposed to uphold , and for which the director - general seemed to speak in Westminster Abbey .
This is what one former BBC World Service current affairs producer wrote to his colleagues yesterday : " ... I am rarely moved to comment on aspects of the BBC I can no longer influence .
But I confess I am deeply saddened and confused - and frankly pleased to be distanced from such decisions - after listening to Caroline Thomson 's obfuscating defence on Today of the refusal to broadcast the joint charity appeal on behalf of the suffering in Gaza .
The question of partiality is a red herring .
It is for the general public to respond to a humanitarian disaster as they choose . "
Having dealt with different news managers at the BBC over the past 30 years or so , I can safely say that the modern BBC has become a body of lions led by donkeys .
Reporters of the calibre of Jeremy Bowen , David Lloyn , Lyse Doucet , experts in their field and brave people all , will be appalled by the directions they are being given .
Edward Stourton and the Today programme rightly produced Tony Benn yesterday morning because they knew he would articulate what their bosses have failed to : reason and humanity .
The big question that remains is this : what are the suits scared of ?
Why do BBC managers try to second - guess our government and even outreach it in grovelling to the United States and Israel ?
BBC journalists , extant and retired , not the " usual suspects " , not disaffected radicals and high - octane lefties , are incandescent with rage over this extraordinary piece of institutional cowardice .
The episode makes a travesty of the institution 's posturing in Westminster Abbey last week , and discredits the honest reporters the BBC still has on its books and in the field .

Palm - out salute accompanying American Pledge of Allegiance ( 1892 –1942 )
" Flag salute " redirects here .
For the poem by Esther Pope , see Flag Salute
The Bellamy salute is a palm - out salute described by Francis Bellamy , the author of the American Pledge of Allegiance , as the gesture which was to accompany the pledge .
During the period when it was used with the Pledge of Allegiance , it was sometimes known as the " flag salute " .
Both the Pledge and its salute originated in 1892 .
Later , during the 1920s and 1930s , Italian fascists and Nazi Germans adopted a salute which was very similar , and which was derived from the Roman salute , a gesture that was popularly ( albeit erroneously ) believed to have been used in ancient Rome .
[ 1 ]
This resulted in controversy over the use of the Bellamy salute in the United States .
It was officially replaced by the hand - over - heart salute when Congress amended the Flag Code on December 22 , 1942 .
History [ edit ]
School children saluting the American flag , September 1915 .
Children salute the American flag in front of the Morgan Hill School in the 1930s California
A group of U.S. schoolchildren pledging their allegiance to the flag , May 1942
The inventor of the Bellamy salute was James B. Upham , junior partner and editor of The Youth 's Companion . [ 2 ]
Bellamy recalled that Upham , upon reading the pledge , came into the posture of the salute , snapped his heels together , and said , " Now up there is the flag ; I come to salute ; as I say ' I pledge allegiance to my flag , ' I stretch out my right hand and keep it raised while I say the stirring words that follow . " [ 2 ]
The Bellamy salute was first demonstrated on October 12 , 1892 , according to Bellamy 's published instructions for the " National School Celebration of Columbus Day " :
At a signal from the Principal the pupils , in ordered ranks , hands to the side , face the Flag .
Another signal is given ; every pupil gives the flag the military salute – right hand lifted , palm downward , to align with the forehead and close to it .
Standing thus , all repeat together , slowly , “ I pledge allegiance to my Flag and the Republic for which it stands ; one Nation indivisible , with Liberty and Justice for all . ”
At the words , “ to my Flag , ” the right hand is extended gracefully , palm upward , toward the Flag , and remains in this gesture till the end of the affirmation ; whereupon all hands immediately drop to the side .
— From The Youth ’s Companion , 65 ( 1892 ) : 446 .
In the 1920s , Italian fascists adopted what has been called the Roman salute to symbolize their claim to have revitalized Italy on the model of ancient Rome .
A similar ritual was adopted by the German Nazis , creating the Nazi salute .
Controversy grew in the United States on the use of the Bellamy salute given its similarity to the fascist salutes .
School boards around the country revised the salute to avoid this similarity .
There was a counter - backlash from the United States Flag Association and the Daughters of the American Revolution , who felt it inappropriate for Americans to have to change the traditional salute because foreigners had later adopted a similar gesture . [ 3 ]
From 1939 until the attack on Pearl Harbor , detractors of Americans who argued against intervention in World War II produced propaganda using the salute to lessen those Americans ' reputations .
Among the anti-interventionist Americans was aviation pioneer Charles Lindbergh .
Supporters of Lindbergh 's views would claim that Lindbergh did not support Adolf Hitler and that pictures of him appearing to do the Nazi salute were actually pictures of him using the Bellamy salute .
In his Pulitzer Prize winning biography Lindbergh ( 1998 ) , author A. Scott Berg explains that interventionist propagandists would photograph Lindbergh and other isolationists using this salute from an angle that left out the American flag , so it would be indistinguishable from the Hitler salute to observers . [ 4 ] [ 5 ]
On June 22 , 1942 , at the urging of the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars , Congress passed Public Law 77-623 , which codified the etiquette used to display and pledge allegiance to the flag .
This included the use of a palm - out salute , specifically that the pledge " be rendered by standing with the right hand over the heart ; extending the right hand , palm upward , toward the flag at the words ' to the flag ' and holding this position until the end , when the hand drops to the side . "
Congress did not discuss or take into account the controversy overuse of the salute .
Congress later amended the code on December 22 , 1942 , when it passed Public Law 77 - 829 , stating among other changes , that the pledge " be rendered by standing with the right hand over the heart . " [ 6 ]

Who can fail to have been impressed by the spectacle of President Obama 's inauguration last week ?
I 'll tell you who - the Queen .
I bet she sat there watching it on an unpretentious four - by - three portable , while she sorted dog biscuits into separate Tupperwares , muttering : " It 's bullshit , Philip !
No carriages , no horses , no crown - it just looks like a bunch of businesspeople getting in and out of cars .
It 's as if the Rotary Club 's taken over a whole country .
And the new one 's not even the son of one of the previous ones , unlike last time .
I thought they were coming round to our way of thinking at last . "
And she'd have a point .
It might have been considerably grander than a new prime minister pulling up outside Number 10 and waving but , compared to the coronation , it looked like someone signing for their security pass and being shown where to hang their mug .
And that 's what comes of having an elected head of state .
There 's always got to be some fudge between the dignity and status of the office and the politician 's desire to seem humbled by the occasion .
In fact , it 's one of the most startling examples of politicians ' self - belief that , as they assume offices of massive power for which they have striven , to the exclusion of all other activities , for decades , they 'll still back their chances of coming across as humble .
Now , there 's an insight into the megalomaniac 's mindset : " Not only can I get to be in charge of everything , I bet I can make people believe that I 'm not really enjoying it so that , thanks to reverse psychology , they 'll want me to stay in power longer ! "
Whereas the Queen did n't have to pretend she was n't enjoying the coronation ; from the little bits of grainy footage I 've seen , it 's hilariously evident .
A poor , terrified slip of a girl , the fluttering eye of a storm of pageantry , hesitantly mewing her lines , while thousands of incredibly important people in fancy dress behave as if she 's the Almighty made flesh .
That 's what I call a show .
I do n't envy the Americans their political system .
I envy them their success , money , inner belief that everything is n't doomed to failure , attitude to breakfast , and teeth , but not their constitution .
The fact that their figurehead and political leader is the same person gives them a terrible dilemma , especially when it was George W Bush .
The man 's clearly a prick ( he says he 'll wait for the judgment of history but , if the jury 's out , it 's only because they 're deciding between personable incompetent and evil moron ) but even his political enemies were squeamish about calling him one .
They had to respect the dignity of the office and could n't come to terms with the American people having bestowed it on someone who can't string a sentence together and would only make the world worse if he could .
To completely let rip in slagging off Bush would have caused collateral damage to national prestige , not only by undermining the office of president but , more important , by openly admitting how far America is from being the classless meritocracy it claims .
We in Britain have no illusions about being a classless meritocracy and it's therefore thoroughly appropriate that our head of state should be chosen by a method dominated by class and utterly and openly devoid of regard for merit .
Separated from the nitty - gritty of politics and power , our monarchy can be a focus for both national pride and self - loathing , the latter being much more archetypally British than the former .
A harmless little old lady dutifully going about various tasks she finds stressful seems about right for our national figurehead - neither better nor worse than we deserve .
Do n't mistake me for a republican .
I genuinely like this system .
It means the most powerful man in the country still has to kowtow to someone ( other than the president of the United States ) .
It encourages tourism .
The royal family , while nominally our betters , are in fact our captives and an interesting and profitable focus for media attention .
It 's as unfair as life ; the royals can't escape and if you want to become royal , you basically can't .
It 's a more or less functional arrangement that no one would ever have had the wit to devise deliberately .
Which is why Liberal Democrat MP Evan Harris 's attempt to fiddle with it is so enervating .
He wants to change the Act of Settlement whereby Catholics can't marry the sovereign and end the discrimination against female heirs to the throne .
He thinks this will make the monarchy more fair .
I suppose it will , in the same way that throwing some bread into the Grand Canyon will make it more a sandwich .
The monarchy is overwhelmingly , gloriously , intentionally unfair - that 's the point .
The defining unfairness is that you have to be a member of that family to be king or queen ; fringe unfairnesses like their not being able to marry Catholics or men having priority in the line of succession are irrelevant in that context .
And what 's so fair about primogeniture , which Harris is not planning to touch , or the sovereign having to be Anglican , which is also apparently fine ?
He wants to spend parliamentary time , mid-credit crunch , on a law aimed primarily at helping Princesses Anne and Michael of Kent .
When will people get the message ?
If you want a fair system , have a republic , elect a president and live with some arsehole like David Cameron giving a speech every Christmas Day afternoon , bitter in the knowledge that you asked for it .
Otherwise , we should stick with what we 've got , rather than trying to tinker .
No abdicating , no skipping Charles , no changing weird ancient laws .
We get who we get because we 'd rather live with the inadequacies of a random ancient structure than the inadequacies of one designed by Brown and Cameron .
The monarchy 's not perfect , but it's also not harmful , powerful or , and this is the clincher , our fault .
The inevitable imperfections of anything we replaced it with would be .
It ’s hard to say anything good about the financial sector bailout .
We ’re devoting a lot of our very limited reporting resources to muckraking it — both the policy decisions behind it and the implementation of it .
But in looking into it ( and a lot of the legwork has been done by TPMmuckraker ’s Zack Roth )
I ’ve realized that in a lot of the discussion of this , people are actually exaggerating how bad it is .
This is n’t news for people deep into the details .
But a lot of the discussion I ’ve seen assumes that the $ 350 billion dollars of bailout money already used has been ‘ spent ’ , as in gone , not getting it back or that it ’s been lent out on such bad terms that we ’re unlikely to get any of it back .
But that ’s not quite right .
Most of the $ 350 billion has bought preferred stock in banks .
The rate of interest Paulson got was n’t nearly as good as several European governments got ( 5 % vs. 10 % ) , not good enough for the risk involved .
And a good deal of the money bought not preferred stock but warrants , where the possibility of a return is much less certain , although the upside is arguably higher too .
All that said , though , this money has been spent buying what can be legitimately seen as assets , on which we ’re likely to get our money back , so long as the institutions themselves do not go bankrupt .
( Yes , that last point is a major caveat .
But if all of our major banking institutions go under we ’ve got even bigger problems . )
There are still lots of problems with oversight , the lack of strings attached and any governing theory of what we ’re trying to accomplish .
But on this one point a lot of the discussion seems off the mark .

Ext Framework , jQuery and ASP.NET
With a little bit of magic you can do anything !
I enjoy leaving the details of the intricate workings of object libraries to those lower level folks who enjoy typing code all day .
If you ’re like me , you ’re only concerned with the higher level aspects of web development .
I want to get things done fast , and ASP.
NET and JavaScript libraries like Ext and jQuery make that possible .
Some people cringe at JavaScript .
I do n’t claim to be an expert , but you do n’t have to be a genius to use good JavaScript APIs .
This article is aimed at those who would like to see greater things out of their presentation layers without having to write tremendous amounts of code to accomplish it .
Practical Overview
Let me start by explaining the practical uses of Ext and jQuery .
The Ext Framework , for the most part , is geared at creating stunning user interfaces in a browser or AIR application that interact with the user much like what you would expect to see in a Flash or Silverlight application .
The great thing about Ext and jQuery is that they run on the client , so any server side language can interact with them .
ASP.NET can be used as a wrapper , like Coolite , which encapsulates the Ext Framework and supplies developers a standard way to implement Ext , or it can be used simply as a mechanism to interact with the client to create a customizable user experience .
Either way you decide to use Ext , you will immediately see the power in its implementation .
Like Ext , jQuery is a cross - browser JavaScript library that takes the strain out of doing complex procedures on the client .
jQuery is implemented in a way that most object oriented developers are familiar with , making it easy to learn and use .
Every method in jQuery returns the object itself , allowing you to chain methods together .
In .NET , a simple chain could consist of turning an object into a string and then calling the substring method all within one line of code :
1 objectA .
ToString ( ) .
Substring ( 0 , 3 ) .
One advantage of both libraries is their awareness of page state .
Both Ext and jQuery use the document ready approach to ensure that page elements are ready to be manipulated before any calls are made .
By using these two libraries , you immediately eliminate much of the time you would usually spend developing workarounds for common problems associated with DHTML and cross browser integration .
You also give yourself a plethora of web 2.0 functions .
Getting Started
To get started using Ext and jQuery , download the latest versions :
Ext Framework SDK : http://extjs.com/products/extjs/download.php
jQuery : http://docs.jQuery.com/Downloading_jQuery
( Optional , Ext contains a version of jQuery already )
Create a directory in the root of your web application called resources and then create a subdirectory called jscript .
Copy the entire Ext Framework SDK folder into the jscript subdirectory .
To reference these script files anywhere in your application you will need to run your application from a web server .
In the example I share in this article , I created a web application in IIS called webportal .
So now , anywhere in my application I can reference Ext and jQuery by using the relative path of the application itself : / webportal /resources / jscript /.
Note : Some
Ext examples in the SDK contain php code , so some samples will not work unless your server can serve php .
Including the Script Libraries
Ext is a little more problematical to include in your applications and it has a bigger footprint than jQuery ; however , there are options that will improve performance if you do not require the use of the entire library .
For example , you can build your own version of Ext using this wizard : http://extjs.com/products/extjs/build/.
Below I show how to include these libraries in your ASP.
NET Master page .
Please check out the source code to my example web portal as well for a more in depth view of the setup .
At the time of this article the current version of Ext was 2.2 .
If a new version of Ext where to come out , all you would need to do is delete the old ext - 2.2 directory and copy the new SDK in its place .
You would then update the references below to the new version .
Using ASP.NET you could retain the version in a settings file and reference that setting everywhere in your application .
You will notice in my portal example that this is the approach I took .
Just below the script references are the style sheets for Ext .
The first one is required .
The second one is optional if you want to override the default theme with a custom theme .
In this article I am using the slickness theme , which can be downloaded from the Ext website .
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 < script type = " text/ javascript " src = " /webportal/resources/jscript/ext-2.2/adapter/jQuery/jQuery.js " xml : space = " preserve " > //<![ CDATA[ jQuery LIBRARY //] ] > </ script > < script type = " text/ javascript " src = " /webportal/resources/jscript/ext-2.2/adapter/jQuery/ext-jQuery-adapter.js " xml : space = " preserve " > //<![ CDATA[EXT jQuery LIBRARY //] ] > </ script > < script type = " text/ javascript " src = " /webportal/resources/jscript/ext-2.2/ext-all.js " xml : space = " preserve " > //<![ CDATA[EXT FRAMEWORK //] ]> </ script > < link href = " /webportal/resources/jscript/ext-2.2/resources/css/ext-all.css " rel = " stylesheet " type = " text/css " /> < link href = " /webportal/resources/jscript/ext-2.2/resources/css/xtheme-slickness.css " rel = " stylesheet " type = " text/css " />
If you want to use the jQuery library or any other library that comes with Ext you will need to look at the INCLUDE_ORDER .
txt file in the SDK .
Notice that jQuery is included first .
Looking at the Code
My example web portal uses an ASP .
NET Master Page consisting of a two column content layout with a header , body and footer .
Ext powers the entire layout .
Let ’s examine the code .
And this is what it produces ( minus the lightshow in the upper right hand corner J ) :
The layout has the north ( BoxComponent ) , the west navigation panel , the center content panel and the south panel .
The west and the south panel are collapsible .
The viewport has the black slickness theme as defined in the xtheme - slickness stylesheet , which overrides the default look .
You can download additional themes from the Ext website , or you can create your own .
So how do we interact with the panels ?
Let ’s say you want to collapse a panel using a button .
Remember those global panel variables ?
Here is some jQuery code :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 < div class = " northRegion " style = " position : absolute ; top : 5 px ; right : 0 % ; z- index : 50000 ; " > </div > < input type = " button " value = " North " class = " northRegionButton " />
< input type = " button " value = " South " class = " southRegionButton " />
< input type = " button " value = " West " class = " westRegionButton " />
< input type = " button " value = " Center " class = " centerRegionButton " /> < script type = " text / javascript " >
//-------------------------------- // jQuery Code //--------------------------------
$ ( document ) . ready ( function ( ) { //-------------------------------- // Setup North Region //-------------------------------- $ ( " div.northRegion " ) . hide ( ) ; $ ( " div.northRegion " ) . html ( " < div style= ' font - family : Tahoma ; font - size : 11 px ; color : white ; width : 800 px ; " + " text - align : center ; '>< h1 style= ' font - family : Impact ; font - size : 50 px ; '> North Region " + " </h1 > this is the Ext North Region " ) ; //-------------------------------- //
Events //-------------------------------- // North Region $ ( " input.northRegionButton " ) . click ( function ( ) { $ ( " div.northRegion " ) . toggle ( " slow " ) ; } ) ; //
South Region ( pSouth - Global Ext Panel defined in MasterPage ) $ ( " input.southRegionButton " ) . click ( function ( ) { ( pSouth .
collapsed ) ?
pSouth .
expand ( ) : pSouth .
collapse ( ) } ) ; //
West Region ( pWest - Global Ext Panel defined in MasterPage ) $ ( " input.westRegionButton " ) . click ( function ( ) { ( pWest .
collapsed ) ?
pWest .
expand ( ) : pWest .
collapse ( ) } ) ; // Center Region $ ( " input.centerRegionButton " ) . click ( function ( ) { var $ child = $ ( " #center " ) . children ( ) ; var $ page0 = " /webportal/resources/jscript/ext-2.2/examples/samples.html " ; var $ page1 = " /webportal/resources/jscript/ext-2.2/examples/collapsed.html " ; ( $ child [ 0 ] . src .
toLowerCase ( ) . match ( $ page1 ) != null ) ? $ child [ 0 ] . src = $ page0 : $ child [ 0 ] . src = $ page1 ; } ) ;
//-------------------------------- } ) ; </ script >
Inside the jQuery document ready function I included a setup section where I set up my northRegion div .
Inside my northRegion div I want to toggle in and out some words from the right hand portion of the screen in a swoop like fashion when the northRegionButton is pushed .
I setup the northRegion div and then defined a jQuery function for when the northRegionButton is pushed :
1 $ ( " input.northRegionButton " ) . click ( function ( ) { $ ( " div.northRegion " ) . toggle ( " slow " ) ; } ) ; ) .
Inside the click event is logic to toggle in the northRegion div content .
You can see at first I had to hide the northRegion , and then I defined what it contains and I defined an event for it .
The result is pretty cool considering all the JavaScript code in the background making it work that I did n’t have to write myself .
Now what about those global Ext panels ?
As mentioned previously , the south and west panels are collapsible .
In the jQuery script above I make a basic condition for the two buttons in their click events .
For example , the south panel ( pSouth ) I say – If the south panel is collapsed then expand it , else collapse it .
I did the same for the west panel ( pWest ) .
You can handle any global Ext object with the same approach using jQuery .
The source of the project is here ( a 7 Mb zip file )
Using Coolite / ASP.NET
Do n’t want to bother with JavaScript ?
Well Coolite is your answer .
I like Coolite , but I also like JavaScript so it really boils down to your preference .
There are advantages to both approaches .
Coolite is good because you can drag and drop server controls on your web form and setup the properties in Visual Studio just like you would any other server control .
Coolite is free unless you want the source code .
The biggest disadvantage of Coolite is when Ext upgrades .
Because Ext is encapsulated in Coolite you have to wait for Coolite to upgrade before you can take advantage of the new features and fixes of Ext .
Also , when Coolite does upgrade , you have to upgrade all your projects to use the new version of Coolite .
It can become very tedious doing this .
Basically with Coolite , you get the latest version now and stick with it for the long run .
Another disadvantage is the extent to what Coolite implements .
Not all the features of Ext are available in Coolite controls .
So with that said , do n’t let my negativity dissuade you from checking out Coolite .
It is very awesome and it continues to become more powerful as time goes on !

The following will be helpful in your exploration of Ext and jQuery .
In Summary
When you have deadlines and a surplus of projects on the backburner , Ext and jQuery are Godsends that save you time and your company money .
Their intense functions will make your boss smile and your customers happy while making you look like a superhero .
I love the reaction I get when I implement these libraries at work .
I take all the credit and I do n’t feel ashamed !
Happy coding !
RENO , Nevada ( Reuters ) - Democrat Barack Obama , back on the campaign trail on Saturday after an emotional trip to Hawaii , blasted White House rival John McCain for backing the Republican fiscal policies that led to an economic crisis .

At a campaign stop in normally Republican Nevada , where polls show him running slightly ahead of McCain , Obama expanded on a favorite theme : That McCain would be an economic clone of President George W. Bush .
He criticized McCain for saying again on Friday that government should ease its regulations on business and mocked the senator from neighboring Arizona for saying Bush ’s economic policies had gotten “ out of hand . ”
“ Let ’s be clear : John McCain attacking George Bush for his out - of - hand economic policy is like ( Vice President ) Dick Cheney attacking George Bush for his go - it - alone foreign policy , ” Obama told about 11,000 supporters at a chilly morning rally at the University of Nevada in Reno .
He said Bush did not seem offended , since he voted on Friday for McCain .
“ And that ’s no surprise , because when it comes to the policies that matter for middle - class families , there ’s not an inch of daylight between George Bush and John McCain , ” Obama said .
Obama noted McCain had met with small business owners on Friday in Colorado and said afterward they wanted “ lower taxes and less government regulation ” of their businesses .

“ None of us want to see unnecessary burdens on business .
But after what we ’ve seen on Wall Street , is n’t it obvious by now that we need some common - sense rules of the road to protect consumers and our economy ? ” Obama said .
OBAMA IN LEAD
Obama has solidified his lead over McCain in national opinion polls ahead of the November 4 election , and McCain is playing defense against a surging Obama in about 10 states won by Bush in 2004 .
Fast - growing Nevada , with five electoral votes , is a prime target for Obama , whose campaign is counting on a surge in Democratic voter registrations to aid it in key battlegrounds like Reno ’s Washoe County .
Democrats moved ahead of Republicans in voter registration in Washoe County last week for the first time in 30 years .
In 2004 , it had about 17,000 more registered Republicans than registered Democrats .
The Nevada campaign swing -- Obama will have a rally later on Saturday in Las Vegas -- followed a day in Hawaii , where Obama visited his seriously ill grandmother , who helped raise him from the age of 10 while his mother lived in Indonesia .
Obama , who arrived in Nevada from Hawaii in the early hours of Saturday morning , thanked the crowd for their support for his 85 - year - old grandmother .
“ So many people sent out their thoughts and prayers , sent my grandmother flowers , ” he said .
“ It meant the world to her and it meant the world to me .
Thank you . ”
The rally at the university ’s baseball stadium was interrupted for about 10 minutes by a power outage .
Obama left the stage and shook hands with chanting supporters until the power was restored .
“ I told you , people are having a tough time paying their electricity bills , ” Obama said once the microphone worked again .
“ Either that , or somebody from the McCain campaign kicked our plug out , ” he said , adding : “ That ’s just a joke .
There is no evidence of foul play . ”

Back in 1908 , Ford introduced its groundbreaking Model T – the world ’s first affordable motorized vehicle and , for all intents and purposes , the basis of America ’s love affair with its cars .
It also averaged 17 miles per gallon .
Fast forward 99 years to 2007 : America ’s best selling vehicle is still a Ford ( the F - 150 ) , is still relatively affordable and is still perpetuating America ’s love affair with its cars .
However , it averages only 16 miles per gallon .
Even the best selling sedan , the Toyota Camry , averages only 22 miles per gallon .
Nearly 100 years of automotive innovation and we ’re still not much further along in terms of overall fuel economy .
I understand comparing a Model T to a Ford F - 150 or a Toyota Camry is n’t exactly an apples to apples comparison – today ’s vehicles are much heavier , better performing and burn fuel much more cleanly than the Model T .
That being said , the comparison ca n’t be completely discounted .
Despite all of the changes and improvements over time , one would assume that significantly better gas mileage would be realized as well .
Unfortunately , it has n’t been .
Many of the reasons for a lack of significant improvement regarding gas mileage can be chalked up to the “ amenities ” that accompany modern vehicles .
Here are the primary culprits :
Improved Safety .
Modern cars are much heavier than their predecessors , due in large part to increased safety .
In addition to just generally being larger , modern cars are also made out of heavier / sturdier materials .
While these materials have helped modern cars withstand tremendous force , the added weight has lead to decreased gas mileage .

While these materials have helped modern cars withstand tremendous force , the added weight has lead to decreased gas mileage .
More Power .
The Model T had a 20 horsepower engine that topped out at about 45 miles per hour .
Compare that to modern cars , most of which have engines with at least ten times the horsepower and have the capability to top out at speeds three times faster than the Model T. Unfortunately , the increased power needs to get its energy from somewhere – and that ’s where increased fuel consumption comes in .

Air Conditioning .
As you ’re probably well aware , running your car ’s air conditioner can be a significant drain on a car ’s gas mileage , decreasing MPG by ten percent or more .
Considering the fact air conditioning has become a standard feature for most cars , it ’s easy to see how it has contributed to diminished fuel economy .
Despite the aforementioned reasons why it ’s understandable that most modern cars do n’t get gas mileage that blows away the Model T , there are plenty of reasons why it ’s pretty disappointing that the best selling modern cars are n’t getting at least double the Model T’s MPGs :
Aerodynamics .
Today ’s cars and trucks are much more aerodynamic than the Model T , which was essentially a horse carriage without the horse .
The more aerodynamic a vehicle is , the less drag is placed upon it as it travels ( especially at higher speeds ) and the less amount of fuel it needs to get to and maintain speed .

Fuel Systems .
Modern cars have been equipped with much more sophisticated fuel systems , the main component of which is the fuel injector .
These electronic and automated systems are much more efficient than the carburetor used by the Model T .

The internal combustion engine is not the same as it was back in 1908 , namely , it has improved and become much more efficient along the way .
So , long story short , it seems to me that while car manufacturers have made plenty of advancements over the last 100 years , it seems as if they ’ve been focused on factors like size and speed and have paid far less attention to improving gas mileage .

The world used to hang on our every word , until our leadership went mad with power , and started to use our hard - earned money to corrupt our country and engage in empire - building , making our own rules , dressed in our jewels , as we went along .
The world has fallen and longs for our leadership again , but will have none of it until we get back to being the old America .
The question now is , will we return to liberty and freedom , or stay joined to the jealous whore of evil and empire , of blood - lust and bondage and of megalomaniacal madness and mayhem , or will we lift up our hearts , make a new start and lead ourselves out of the hell where we are now headed courtesy of the Illuminati .
Unfortunately , the jury is still out on that question .
We are now on the same path taken by the Roman Empire as it declined into a perverse , deviant , indolent , corrupt and bloodthirsty caricature of its former glory , a glory that was eclipsed by our beloved America of yesteryear , that has now been in a breathtaking decline for many decades thanks to the utterly despicable actions taken by our corrupt politicians and captains of industry who care only about themselves .
We have a cabal of several thousand filthy - rich miscreants spoiling what could have been healthy , plentiful , productive and meaningful lives for billions of people around the globe .
But no , these Shylocks have to have it all .
Their lust for money and power is unquenchable , as these servants of Satan weave their web of fraud and deceit to entrap their fellow men in a plan to destroy , impoverish and enslave them .
Murder and blood - lust is a way of life for them , and has been for many centuries , as the parents of millions of fallen soldiers and the relatives of millions of victims of pogroms , and genocides like the Holocaust , can well attest .
Nothing gets in the way of these loathsome pieces of fecal detritus when it comes to accumulating power and profits .
Not war , not murder , not criminality of any kind or nature .
Instead of entertaining themselves with gladiators tearing each other to shreds , our leadership of reprobates and sociopaths , our shadow government of Puppet Masters who elect and command our politicians in what has become our two - party / one - agenda system of government , a system which makes a mockery out of what is supposed to be a republican form of government based on democratic principles , entertain themselves by deceitfully and malevolently bullying , bankrupting and beggaring other nations and even their own fellow citizens .
They are behind all wars and genocides , as their lust and longing for power , profits and population control know no bounds .
Every imaginable illicit enterprise is their oyster , and woe be to any who might try to muscle in on their territory .
Their henchmen are everywhere .
In our various levels of government , which have become devil 's dens full of pernicious traitors as well as self - absorbed narcissists and perverts , especially at the federal level , in our unbelievably corrupt business corporations whose boards are packed with pathological liars and con-artists , in our courts , whose bought - and - paid - for judges act like federal and state legislative bodies in their assiduity to promote the evil agenda of their Illuminist handlers , in our fane - stream media , which are now run by perverts and their talking heads who would n't know the truth about anything if it bit them in the nose much less have the nerve to report about it , in our higher education and university systems which brainwash our children with Illuminist propaganda and disinformation , and in our tax exempt foundations which are little more than bristling hotbeds of seditious Orwellian idiots .
They take great pride in their evil , nefarious work of destroying the current world system of nation - states , so that in the ensuing chaos they can create a corporatist , fascist police state where they get to play " lords of the universe " while we , their serfs and slave laborers , live in abject poverty and bondage , catering to their every whim .
Or so they hope .
Fortunately for us , God is making other plans , and His plans are the only ones that will prevail in the end as the Illuminist scum receive their final comeuppance .
These Illuminist slime - balls and pond scum now own the system , and they do as they please .
This will continue until you stop them .
Will it take the exercise of our collective political will to stop them , or will it take bloodshed ?
We believe it will be some combination of the two , but mostly the latter .
All systems are broken and corrupted .
There is no accountability to the people at any level anymore .
They already have plans to disarm you , and to have the Secret Service squirrel them away into rat - holes and safe - houses until the violence they know is coming blows over , or so they hope .
These plans are in writing and were delivered to Congress in a joint closed session held in the spring of 2008 , the second such session in our nation 's history , during which session they discussed and predicted the September breakdown in our financial system that has led to a stock market meltdown which rivals that of the Great Depression .
As glaring evidence of the lack of accountability , your so - called elected representatives totally ignored your almost unanimous demands that the banksters not be bailed out , and now half of the TARP funds have been spent and we can't even get an accounting of what was done with the proceeds .
The excuses given are always national security and trade secrets , which is the same tired mantra they hide behind whenever they trample on our Constitutional rights via illegal surveillance and wiretapping , or claim ignorance about the whereabouts of the two to three trillion that is missing from the defense budget , or cover up the false intelligence about weapons of mass destruction that were used as an excuse to oust Saddam Hussein , rob Iraq of its oil and initiate plans for a military takeover of the Middle East , with Iran next on the agenda .
Etc. , etc. , etc .
As this TARP fraud transpired , the Federal Reserve shelled out over $ 9 trillion in liquidity to their cronies , thus rapidly debasing our currency with total impunity , and the Fed may even be floating unauthorized Treasury bonds to absorb toxic waste and to fund bailouts .
The Fed 's Board of Governors are now the gods of high finance , deciding which companies will survive and which will get vaporized .
( Hint : Survivors are Illuminist owned or controlled companies ) .
The Fed 's member banks continue to hoard their reserves to destroy the small businesses that compete with Illuminist transnational conglomerates , while they use taxpayer largesse , extorted via threats of martial law and PPT - orchestrated stock market crashes , to buy out the competition which has been weakened by the hoarding of loan money .
Dividends were paid to stockholders of insolvent companies , which have no business doling out nonexistent profits .
These miscreants even had the unmitigated gall to use bailout money to fund the payment of salaries and bonuses to executives who have intentionally burned their once - profitable companies to the ground to pave the way for the consolidation , amalgamation and nationalization of the finance , insurance and auto industries that will form the core of the planned corporatist , fascist police state that now exists in fact , if not yet in name .
The corruption is ongoing , pervasive and arrogant , and is nothing less than disgusting .
This state of affairs is going to get much worse unless you stop them -- one way , or the other .
You will certainly not get a new start from Fascist Commie Comrade Obama and the new CCCP ( Clintonite Cabinet of Con-artists and Parasites ) that is composed of the same slugs who set up the economic scenario that has ruined our country -- intentionally -- to pave the way for a one world police state .
When Caligula leaves the White House , he will be replaced by Nero who will play his Keynesian FDR fiddle while Rome burns to the ground and we are hyperinflated into oblivion .
No , he wo n't tax the poor .
Then what , we ask , is inflation if not a stealth tax ?
He has told us we must spend , spend , spend immediately to avoid any further meltdown of the system .
We have news for you Obama : the system has already burned down .
Throwing money down these rat - holes will ignite inflation , which is the worst kind of tax on the poor .
The rich will get their loopholes while the poor shell out twenty - dollar bills for a loaf of bread .
Has this man read any history , or is he just another ignorant baboon like the one leaving the White House ?
The use of multi-billion dollar bailouts to address multi-trillion dollar problems is like trying to bail out the Titanic with a shot glass .
What else do you call over a million jobs lost over two months and the worst unemployment rates in six decades ?
Some of these idiots have yet to even acknowledge that we are in recession !
That must be because , hey , our economy is strong and resilient ( Caligula ) , and the housing crisis and credit - crunch will moderate over time ( Buck - Busting Ben ) , as we continue to support a strong dollar policy ( Hanky - Panky ) while the Fed cuts to zero interest and spikes the money supply with $ 9 trillion dollars .
Who can possibly believe a single word that issues forth from the mouths of these pathological liars and ignorant baboons who are , God help us , in charge of our political , foreign and economic affairs ?
And people wonder why we have a crisis of confidence ?

Linux Myths

With all the attention around Linux as an operating system , it 's important to step back from the hype and look at the reality .
First , it 's worth noting that Linux is a UNIX - like operating system .
Linux fundamentally relies on 30 - year - old operating system technology and architecture .
Linux was not designed from the ground - up to support symmetrical multiprocessing ( SMP ) , graphical user interfaces ( GUI ) , asynchronous I/O , fine - grained security model , and many other important characteristics of a modern operating system .
These architectural limitations mean that as customers look for a platform to cost effectively deploy scalable , secure , and robust applications , Linux simply cannot deliver on the hype .
Myth : Linux performs better than Windows NT
Reality : Windows NT 4.0 Outperforms Linux On Common Customer Workloads
The Linux community claims to have improved performance and scalability in the latest versions of the Linux Kernel ( 2.2 ) , however it 's clear that Linux remains inferior to the Windows NT ® 4.0 operating system .
For File and Print services , according to independent tests conducted by PC Week Labs , the Windows NT 4.0 operating system delivers 52 percent better performance on a single processor system and 110 percent better performance on a 4 - way system than similarly configured single processor and 4 - way Linux / SAMBA systems .
For Web servers , the same PC Week tests showed Windows NT 4.0 with Internet Information Server 4.0 delivers 41 percent better performance on a single processor system and 125 percent better performance on a 4 - way system than Linux and Apache .
For e-commerce workloads using secure sockets ( SSL ) , recent PC Magazine tests showed Windows NT 4.0 with Internet Information Server 4.0 delivers approximately five times the performance provided by Linux and Stronghold .
For transaction - orientated Line of Business applications , Windows NT 4.0 has achieved a result of 40,368 tpmC at a cost of $ 18.46 per transaction on a Compaq 8 - Way Pentium III XEON processor - based system .
This industry leading price / performance result from the Transaction Processing Performance Council ( TPC ) clearly shows how Windows NT can deliver world - class performance for heavy duty transaction processing .
It 's interesting to note that there is not a single TPC result on any database running on Linux , and therefore Linux has yet to demonstrate their capabilities as a database server .
Linux performance and scalability is architecturally limited in the 2.2 Kernel .
Linux only supports 2 gigabytes ( GB ) of RAM on the x86 architecture , 1 compared to 4 GB for Windows NT 4.0 .
The largest file size Linux supports is 2 GB versus 16 terabytes ( TB ) for Windows NT 4.0 .
The Linux SWAP file is limited to 128 MB .
In addition , Linux does not support many of the modern operating system features that Windows NT 4.0 has pioneered such as asynchronous I/O , completion ports , and fine - grained kernel locks .
These architecture constraints limit the ability of Linux to scale well past two processors .

These architecture constraints limit the ability of Linux to scale well past two processors .
The Linux community continues to promise major SMP and performance improvements .
They have been promising these since the development of the 2.0 Kernel in 1996 .
Delivering a scalable system is a complex task and it's not clear that the Linux community can solve these issues easily or quickly .
As D. H. Brown Associates noted in a recent technical report , 2 the Linux 2.2 Kernel remains in the early stages of providing a tuned SMP kernel .
Myth : Linux is more reliable than Windows NT
Reality : Linux Needs Real World Proof Points Rather than Anecdotal Stories
The Linux community likes to talk about Linux as a stable and reliable operating system , yet there are no real world data or metrics and very limited customer evidence to back up these claims .
Windows NT 4.0 has been proven in demanding customer environments to be a reliable operating system .
Customers such as Barnes and Noble , The Boeing Company , Chicago Stock Exchange , Dell Computer , Nasdaq and many others run mission - critical applications on Windows NT 4.0 .
Linux lacks a commercial quality Journaling File System .
This means that in the event of a system failure ( such as a power outage ) data loss or corruption is possible .
In any event , the system must check the integrity of the file system during system restart , a process that will likely consume an extended amount of time , especially on large volumes and may require manual intervention to reconstruct the file system .
There are no commercially proven clustering technologies to provide High Availability for Linux .
The Linux community may point to numerous projects and small companies that are aiming to deliver High Availability functionality .
D. H. Brown recently noted that these offerings remain immature and largely unproven in the demanding business world .
There are no OEMs that provide uptime guarantees for Linux , unlike Windows NT where Compaq , Data General , Hewlett - Packard , IBM , and Unisys provide 99.9 percent system - level uptime guarantees for Windows NT - based servers .
Myth : Linux is Free
Reality : Free Operating System Does Not Mean Low Total Cost of Ownership
The Linux community will talk about the free or low - cost nature of Linux .
It 's important to understand that licensing cost is only a small part of the overall decision - making process for customers .
The cost of the operating system is only a small percentage of the overall total cost of ownership ( TCO ) .
In general Windows NT has proven to have a lower cost of ownership than UNIX .
There is no reason to believe that Linux is significantly different than other versions of UNIX when it comes to TCO .
The very definition of Linux as an Open Software effort means that commercial companies like Red Hat will make money by charging for services .
Therefore , commercial support services for Linux will be fee - based and will likely be priced at a premium .
These costs have to be factored into the total cost model .
Linux is a UNIX - like operating system and is therefore complex to configure and manage .
Existing UNIX users may find the transition to Linux easier but administrators for existing Windows - based or Novell environments will find it more difficult to handle the complexity of Linux .
This retraining will add significant costs to Linux deployments .
Linux is a higher risk option than Windows NT .
For example how many certified engineers are there for Linux ?
How easy is it to find skilled development and support people for Linux ?
Who performs end - to - end testing for Linux - based solutions ?
These factors and more need to be taken into account when choosing a platform for your business .
Myth : Linux is more secure than Windows NT
Reality : Linux Security Model
Is Weak
All systems are vulnerable to security issues , however it 's important to note that Linux uses the same security model as the original UNIX implementations -- a model that was not designed from the ground up to be secure .
Linux only provides access controls for files and directories .
In contrast , every object in Windows NT , from files to operating system data structures , has an access control list and its use can be regulated as appropriate .
Linux security is all - or - nothing .
Administrators cannot delegate administrative privileges : a user who needs any administrative capability must be made a full administrator , which compromises best security practices .
In contrast , Windows NT allows an administrator to delegate privileges at an exceptionally fine - grained level .
Linux has not supported key security accreditation standards .
Every member of the Windows NT family since Windows NT 3.5 has been evaluated at either a C2 level under the U.S. Government 's evaluation process or at a C2 - equivalent level under the British Government 's ITSEC process .
In contrast , no Linux products are listed on the U.S. Government 's evaluated product list .
Linux system administrators must spend huge amounts of time understanding the latest Linux bugs and determining what to do about them .
This is made complex due to the fact that there is n't a central location for security issues to be reported and fixed .
In contrast Microsoft provides a single security repository for notification and fixes of security related issues .
Configuring Linux security requires an administrator to be an expert in the intricacies of the operating system and how components interact .
Misconfigure any part of the operating system and the system could be vulnerable to attack .
Windows NT security is easy to set up and administer with tools such as the Security Configuration Editor .
Myth : Linux can replace Windows on the desktop
Reality : Linux Makes No Sense at the Desktop Linux as a desktop operating system makes no sense .
A user would end up with a system that has fewer applications , is more complex to use and manage , and is less intuitive .
Linux does not provide support for the broad range of hardware in use today ; Windows NT 4.0 supports over 39,000 systems and devices on the Hardware Compatibility List .
Linux does not support important ease - of - use technologies such as Plug and Play , USB , and Power Management
The complexity of the Linux operating system and cumbersome nature of the existing GUIs would make retraining end - users a huge undertaking and would add significant cost
Linux application support is very limited , meaning that customers end up having to build their own horizontal and vertical applications .
A recent report from Forrester Research highlighted the fact that today 93 percent of enterprise ISVs develop applications for Windows NT , while only 13 percent develop for Linux . 3 Summary
The Linux operating system is not suitable for mainstream usage by business or home users .
Linux clearly has a long way to go to be competitive with Windows NT 4.0 .
With the release of the Windows 2000 operating system , Microsoft extends the technical superiority of the platform even further ensuring that customers can deliver the next generation applications to solve their business challenges .

President Obama reported to work at 8:35 a.m. on Wednesday , walking into the Oval Office for the first time as the nation ’s chief executive .
Jeff Zeleny is following Mr. Obama ’s first day on the job .
See his full report here .
All eyes in the White House are on the Senate confirmation hearing of Hillary Rodham Clinton .
If she ’s confirmed this afternoon , those sirens you hear on Pennsylvania Avenue will likely be her security detail racing toward the White House .
The president is having his first meeting on Iraq — in the Situation Room — and if Mrs. Clinton is confirmed in time , she ’ll be on hand .
Is someone keeping a list of any gaffes – or botched jokes – that Vice President Biden makes ?
If so , perhaps the first official entry came this afternoon , when President Obama asked Mr. Biden if he would give members of his senior staff the oath of office .
For a moment , it seemed as though the vice president thought the swearing - in included him .
“ Am I doing this again ? ” Mr. Biden asked .
“ Senior staff , ” Mr. Obama replied .
“ My memory is not as good as Justice Roberts , ” Mr. Biden said , referring to the Chief Justice ’s flubbed lines during the presidential swearing - in ceremony on Tuesday .
Several staff members in the room laughed .
The president did not .
Welcome to the White House .
Did I tell you there wo n’t be any pay raises ?
That was essentially the message President Obama delivered to senior members of his administration who were sworn into their new jobs on Wednesday afternoon .
During a ceremony in Room 450 of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building , Mr. Obama signed the first executive order of his presidency , a measure intended to fulfill a campaign promise by closing the what he called the “ revolving door ” of people who immediately segue from government to lobbying .
“ Public service is a privilege .
It ’s not about advantaging yourself .
It ’s not about advancing your friends or your corporate clients , ” Mr. Obama said .
“ It ’s not about advancing an ideological agenda or the special interests of any organization .
Public service is simply and absolutely about advancing the interests of Americans . ”
The rule would freeze salaries at their current levels for the White House employees who earn more than $ 100,000 a year .
About 100 staffers fall into that category , if the salaries are in line with what positions paid during the last administration .
“ Families are tightening their belts , and so should Washington , ” Mr. Obama said .
The lobbying rules would attempt to keep advisers from having an influence over the administration after leaving the White House .
New employees who came from the lobbying world , he said , cannot work on subjects for which they lobbied .
All White House personnel are required to take an ethics class similar to one that he said he attended last week .
The president ’s first calls to foreign leaders were directed – not surprisingly – toward the Middle East .
Mr. Obama spoke by telephone to President Mubarak of Egypt , Prime Minister Olmert of Israel , King Abdullah of Jordan , and President Abbas of the Palestinian Authority .
Few details of the calls were provided , but the White House announced them as a way to show the president ’s engagement in the conflict .
White House press secretary Robert Gibbs released this statement :
He used this opportunity on his first day in office to communicate his commitment to active engagement in pursuit of Arab - Israeli peace from the beginning of his term , and to express his hope for their continued cooperation and leadership .
In the aftermath of the Gaza conflict , he emphasized his determination to work to help consolidate the ceasefire by establishing an effective anti-smuggling regime to prevent Hamas from rearming , and facilitating in partnership with the Palestinian Authority a major reconstruction effort for Palestinians in Gaza .
He pledged that the United States would do its part to make these efforts successful , working closely with the international community and these partners as they fulfill their responsibilities as well .
The President appreciated the spirit of partnership and warm nature of these calls .
It ’s noon and the first official White House schedule of the day has just been released .
( This is not a complaint , but rather a good sign :
The email system is up - and - running , which had been an issues earlier in the day . )
This is what it looks like :
1:15 PM -2:15 PM President Obama Addresses Staff and Cabinet Secretaries POOL PRESS 2:30 PM President Obama Attends White House Open House Base of stair case on the ground level by State Room .
POOL PRESS 3:15 PM - 3:45 PM
President Obama Meets with Economic Advisors Roosevelt Room CLOSED PRESS 4:15 PM -5:15 PM
President Obama Meets with Iraq Military Commanders CLOSED PRESS
Mr. Obama , in between public events , is meeting privately with advisers .
Earlier on Wednesday , he spoke by telephone to four leaders in the Middle East , weighing in for the first time on the ongoing Israel - Palestinian conflict .
More details on that coming up .
When Mr. Obama returns to the White House from the National Cathedral , aides said , he will sign a few executive orders , including one that restricts any White House employee from lobbying the Obama administration upon leaving office .
It is the so - called revolving door policy that Mr. Obama pledged during the campaign .
The president will not sign an order to suspend tribunals at Guantanamo Bay on Wednesday , aides said , but rather wait until Thursday or Friday to make good on that campaign promise .
In addition to the executive orders , there are two big agenda items for the president ’s first day : the economy and national security .
As he ran for office , when voters would ask what his first task in office would be , Mr. Obama ’s answer was always the same : “ I will bring the Joint Chiefs of Staff in , and I will give them a new mission . ”
So today is that day .
Do n’t look for a new mission by sundown , but rather a discussion of how troops can be redeployed in Iraq in the next 16 months .
At 4 p.m. , Mr. Obama is scheduled to walk into the Situation Room for the first time for a meeting on Iraq and Afghanistan .
Vice President Joseph R. Biden will join the president , along with Defense Secretary Robert Gates , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs , and a handful of administration advisers .
General David Petreaus , who flew overnight to Washington from Afghanistan , also will be on hand , along with General Raymond Odierno , who will be connected via secure video from Iraq .
While the meeting starts at 4 p.m. , aides said , it has no definitive ending time .
The lower press office on the first floor of the West Wing was locked until about 9 a.m. , when Bill Burton , a deputy White House press secretary opened the doors .
He sat in the office alone as a line of reporters waited for any morsel of information about the president ’s day .
“ If you guys give me 15 minutes , I will send something out , ” said Mr. Burton , who wore a patient smile as he greeted a new correspondent from French TV and shook hands with veteran reporters like Ann Compton from ABC News who dropped by to say hello .
Fresh coats of paint – a buttery yellow – are covering the walls in some of the West Wing offices .
The computers are freshly cleaned .
( No , the “ Os ” are not missing from the keyboards . )
And new members of the Obama administration are still trying to make it through security , even as others arrive with a few boxes and things for their desks .
“ Welcome , ” reads a red note card – with the presidential seal – that is placed on the computers .
“ For assistance with facility service issues , office layout and furniture please contact the Facilities Management Office . ”
The new offices are designated not by nameplates , but by pieces of paper taped to the outside of the doors .
The people who will be speaking for the president , who work in a small office just outside the press briefing room , include : Bill Burton , Josh Earnest , Jen Psaki , Tommy Vietor , Reid Cherlin , Ben LaBolt and Nick Shapiro .
At 9:46 a.m. , another reporter walked into the press office .
“ Good morning , ” Mr. Burton said .
“ I came to introduce myself , ” the woman said .
“ I ’m Helen Thomas . ”
President Obama reported to work at 8:35 a.m. on Wednesday , walking into the Oval Office for the first time as the nation ’s chief executive .
He read the note left behind by George W. Bush , which was sitting in a folder on top of the desk , with a note marked “ 44 . ” Mr. Obama was in the office alone for a brief time , aides said , starting his day after a late night celebrating and dancing at inaugural balls across Washington .
So the new White House is officially opened for business , but it feels more like a start - up than the seat of government .
White House press secretary Robert Gibbs is not holding a briefing on Wednesday , aides said , deciding to delay his first official briefing until Thursday .
Why ?
Most members of his staff have been waiting outside to be allowed onto the White House grounds .
Mr. Obama , who is on his way to a prayer service at the National Cathedral , has a series of meetings coming up with this economic advisers and the Joint Chiefs .
He also will preside over the Cabinet swearing - in ceremony for seven members of his Cabinet who were confirmed on Tuesday by the Senate .
Exactly 100 years after two robbers went on a shooting rampage in a London suburb , the dead victims are being officially remembered .
But the shocking details of the " Tottenham Outrage " still offer parallels with current events .
PC
Tyler was shot at point - blank range while trying to arrest the robbers
It sounds like a scene from a Hollywood movie - two outlaws rampaging through the streets chased by police and public , while firing more than 400 rounds of ammunition at their pursuers .
Throw in concerns about politically - motivated terrorists , uncontrolled immigration and police tactics not keeping pace with the villains ' methods , and you have a thoroughly modern seeming incident .
But this was 23 January 1909 .
The two robbers killed a police officer and a 10 - year - old boy in Tottenham , north London , as they tried to escape with the £ 80 wages they had snatched from a rubber factory .
The chase , which left 21 people injured , appalled the nation .
The Times gave an indication of the shock generated by the incident when it reported thus : " An amazing series of outrages , singularly rare if not entirely without parallel in a civilized country , occurred on Saturday forenoon in the neighbourhood of Tottenham marshes . "
The drama unfolded when two Latvian immigrants , Paul Hefeld and Jacob Lapidus , targeted Schnurmann 's rubber factory , on the corner of Tottenham High Road and Chestnut Road .
When the chauffeur - driven car carrying the wages clerk arrived , they produced pistols and grabbed the cash bag , firing at the chauffeur before fleeing .
Pursuit
The commotion attracted the attention of PCs William Tyler and Albert Newman in the neighbouring police station , and a long chase with the chauffeur 's car , plus people on foot and horseback , began .
Ten - year - old Ralph Joscelyne , who was helping a baker with his deliveries , was killed in the crossfire as he ran to take cover alongside the car at Mitchley Road .
Ordinary citizens joined in the chase in a display of civic values I 'm not sure you would get today
Martin Belam PC
Tyler managed to catch up with the men , shouting , " Come on , give in , the game 's up . "
Hefeld shot him in the face at point - blank range , and the officer bled to death in a nearby house .
As the chase continued , it became more frenetic as the men commandeered a tram .
Police jumped into another tram , and the occupants of the two vehicles exchanged fire .
After leaping from the tram , the men jumped onto a milk - cart and set off towards Epping Forest , while continuing to fire at their pursuers , but overturned it on a corner .
They then stole a greengrocer 's cart but did not realise the brake was still on , so could not force the horse to travel any faster than an amble .
King 's medal Fleeing , the " anarchist robbers " were quickly cornered .
Hefeld shot himself in the head to evade capture , and was taken to hospital where he died three weeks later .
Lapidus carried on running and locked himself in the bedroom of nearby Oak Cottage , where he used his final bullet to kill himself as officers fired through the door at him .
Flowers will be laid on Ralph Joscelyne 's grave
As well as representing a shift in the history of criminality in the UK , the episode was remarkable for the response of the officers and passers - by , says local historian Martin Belam .
" You also have to think about how brave the police were .
The two robbers were shooting to kill , over 20 people were injured .
They were constantly firing back into the crowd .
" Ordinary citizens joined in the chase in a display of civic values I 'm not sure you would get today . "
In the aftermath there were questions over the police 's ability to respond , with the modern revolvers possessed by the robbers contrasted with the police 's lack of preparedness .
" The police could n't get into their weapon cabinet because someone had lost the key .
One of the policeman just got a weapon off someone in the crowd .
People were going around packing heat .
All these firearms started appearing . "
When Pc Tyler 's funeral was held half - a- million people and 3,000 police officers lined the two - and - a - half mile route .
The blinds of all the houses en route were drawn , shops were closed for the day and flags flown at half - mast .
In the aftermath , questions were asked about the dangers of immigration .
The Daily Mirror reported the occasion on its front page on 30 January with the heading : " Police constable Tyler , who was murdered by alien terrorists at Tottenham , given a hero 's funeral . "
Gallantry medal
The Times quoted a much - travelled costumier , Charles Lee , who had been " astounded at the ease with which the roughest looking aliens landed on our shores " .
There were letters criticising the government 's enforcement of immigration legislation .
" Across Europe at that time you had anarchists and proto - terrorists , these underground armed groups , " says Mr Belam .
Half a million people and 3,000 police officers lined the funeral route " [ Members ] had managed to get over to Britain and for the first time people realised the government did n't have much control over who was coming in .
" There is the fear that somehow immigrants are a fifth column in the country that are going to overthrow civilised values . "
The outrage fed into already existing paranoia about immigration , connected to the 1905 Aliens Act , says Deborah Hedgecock , curator of the Bruce Castle Museum in Tottenham .
" The outrage was particularly fuelled by the media .
Lots of stories were being made up against immigrants who had moved into the area . "
The incident sparked formal acknowledgement of police bravery .
The King 's Police Medal was established in recognition of the gallantry of the police officers who had chased the pair .
The citation said : " The commissioner is commanded to convey to the police officers engaged in the tragedy at Tottenham the King 's high appreciation of their gallant conduct . "
The incident will be remembered 100 years on as police and family members of those involved , plus pupils from Earlsmead School which Ralph Joscelyne had attended , will lay wreaths at the victims ' graves .
They will then go to Tottenham police station to unveil a plaque in memory of Pc Tyler .
Deborah Hedgecock , curator of Bruce Castle Museum in Tottenham , will give a talk on the outrage at 1930 GMT on Wednesday 28 January .

Support for Israel in her time of need , from both Democrats and Republicans , is not just the logical choice .
It is both a strategic and moral imperative .
— Congressman Steny Hoyer ( D - MD )
I want to commend the Bush administration for its support of Israel during this difficult period .
— Congressman Brad Sherman ( D - CA )
Since Israel launched its massive , deadly , and completely asymmetric blitzkrieg against the impoverished population of the Gaza Strip , an operation that represents a continuation of Zionist policy since the British mandate period and has so far left over 900 Palestinians dead including some 400 women and children , Ohio Congressman and two - time presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich has carried on his practice of consistently speaking truth to power , reprimanding both Israel for its criminal behavior and the United States government for enabling it .
In addition to sending letters of protest to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon , Kucinich has also made numerous public statements about the massacre , and on January 7 , he rose to his feet on the House floor to deliver the following words :
Wake up America .
We have trillions for a war machine and banks while our government stands by and sniffs at the slaughter of innocents in Gaza , where Israel is blocking aid for wounded Palestinians . [ … ]
Today U.S. tax dollars , U.S. jets and U.S. helicopters provided to Israel are enabling the slaughter in Gaza .
The [ Bush ] Administration enables Israel to press forward with the attack against defenseless civilians ; blocks efforts promoting a cease - fire at the UN ; and refuses to make Israel comply with conditions that arms shipments not be used for aggression .
Israel is going to receive $ 30 billion in a ten - year period for military assistance , without having to abide by any humanitarian principles , international laws or standards of basic human decency .
Wake up America .
While Kucinich ’s urgent pleas seem to have fallen mostly on deaf ears , he has managed to arouse the ire of at least one pro-Israel organization .
Jennifer Laszlo Mizrahi , founder of the Washington - based NGO The Israel Project , chastised the Ohio Congressman saying , “ He is not a friend of Israel ; he does n’t understand the security concerns of the Israeli people ; he does n’t understand what it ’s like to live under rockets that are coming down constantly .
If Dennis Kucinich were at all consistent with what voters wanted , he would be the president - elect as opposed to one of many people who tried to be the president - elect . ”
But what exactly is it that American voters want ?
Do they , as Ms. Mizrahi insinuates , fully support Israel ’s wanton destruction of the defenseless in Gaza ?
Do the American people truly stand behind the butchery of innocents including police school graduates , ambulance drivers , and sleeping children ?
Despite the entirely slanted and dishonest coverage the calamity has hitherto received by mainstream media outlets in the United States , it turns out that , contrary to what Ms. Mizrahi would have us believe , a substantial segment of the American population does not actually support Israel ’s criminal actions .
A recent Rasmussen poll has found that Americans are almost evenly split on the issue with 41 percent against the operation compared to 44 percent in favor .
The divide , of course , is even starker when examined along party lines ; while some 62 percent of Republicans polled support Israel ’s actions , a clear majority of Democrats oppose them by a 24 percent margin .
One can only assume that , were the treatment of the ongoing calamity by the mainstream US media not so horribly skewed against the Palestinian victims , these numbers would reveal an even stronger rejection of Israel ’s iron - fisted militancy by the American people .
Unfortunately , opposition to Israel ’s shock and awe campaign by a majority of Democratic voters does not translate into action or even rhetoric by Democratic leaders .
In this respect , Kucinich stands virtually alone amongst a party of Democrats — or , for Denis Perrin , a party of “ Savage Mules ” — who seem to be vying with their Republican colleagues to see who can best cater to the demands of Washington ’s pro-Israel lobby .
President - elect Barack Obama , whose entire campaign hinged on the vague notions of hope and change , has refused to weigh in on the subject , claiming that he is not in any position to take a stand until after taking office on January 20 .
Anyone with any degree of influence or power who remains silent while masses are slaughtered is a coward , and indeed , Obama ’s shirking of responsibility in this time of upheaval and gross injustice is cowardly in the extreme .
Moreover , the fact that he felt free during the primaries to ponder invading Pakistan and did not hesitate to condemn the recent attacks in Mumbai only reveals the extent of his hypocrisy .
In recent days , both houses of Congress have passed resolutions expressing the utmost approval for Israel ’s aggressive acts with overwhelming bi-partisan support .
These shameful resolutions represent two of the first acts of the new Congress .
The contentiously worded resolution passed by the House of Representatives expresses “ vigorous support and unwavering commitment to the welfare , security , and survival of the State of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state with secure borders , and recognizes its right to act in self - defense to protect its citizens against Hamas ’s unceasing aggression ” and calls on all countries “ to lay blame both for the breaking of the ‘ calm ’ and for subsequent civilian casualties in Gaza precisely where blame belongs , that is , on Hamas . ”
Only five congressmen voted against the measure : one Republican ( Ron Paul ) and four Democrats ( Kucinich , Gwen Moore , Nick Rahall , and Maxine Waters ) .
The powerful American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) has celebrated both of these legislative victories by posting on its website a 104 - page pdf file containing quotes from over one hundred American politicians — including such leaders as Representatives Steny Hoyer and Barney Frank and Senators Evan Bayh , Bob Casey Jr. , Christopher Dodd , Dick Durbin , and Bill Nelson — who support Israel ’s “ right to self - defense ” against the downtrodden and dispossessed in Gaza .
The voices gathered together on this document are almost identical in the intensity of both their boisterousness and their ignorance , and one can be forgiven for being unable to distinguish between Republicans and Democrats .
Once again , it seems that AIPAC has provided further evidence to Jack London ’s disparaging characterization of lobbies as “ peculiar institution [s ] for bribing , bulldozing , and corrupting the legislators who were supposed to represent the people ’s interests . ”
Speaker Nancy Pelosi — once so feared and vilified by the right — has proven herself to be lockstep behind the Israeli occupiers , saying that the Gaza Strip “ cannot be allowed to be a sanctuary for attacks on Israel ” and that “ [ t ] he United States must continue to stand strongly with its friend and democratic ally . ”
Similarly , California Congressman Henry Waxman proclaimed that “ Israel ’s operation in Gaza is an act of self defense .
It is a blatant double standard for those who criticize Israel to expect any nation to stand idle as its cities and citizens are indiscriminately shelled . ”
By placing the blame for the current escalation of violence squarely at the feet of Hamas and the Palestinians , our elected Democratic representatives are repeating that old charade of blaming the victim for the actions of the victimizer .
In the words of New York Congressman Joseph Crowley , “ Hamas had a choice this past December : extend the cease - fire or continue hostilities .
They chose war over peace . ”
Illinois Congressman Jesse Jackson Jr. too has weighed in on the conflict saying , “ We in the United States must continue to stand shoulder - to - shoulder in support of our friend and ally Israel as it defends itself against Hamas ’ unrelenting rocket attacks from Gaza . ”
Can our Congressmen be any further removed from reality ?
Unfortunately , it appears that they can .
In one of the more revealing statements of support , New York Congressman Eliot Engel points to cultural affinity between the United States and Israel as a justification for his pro-Israeli sympathies .
On the House floor , he declared , “ I rise this afternoon in support of the beleaguered people of the State of Israel .
I rise in support of the only democracy in the Middle East .
I rise in support of the country in the Middle East that has the same values that our great country , the United States of America , has : principles of democracy and principles that are so important to every man , woman and child . ”
Apparently for Mr. Engel , the people of Gaza living under Israel ’s iron heel do not share such values , and his callous dismissal of them only goes to prove Howard Zinn ’s assertion that “ [ i] t is easier to explain atrocities if they are committed against infidels , or people of an inferior race . ”
The late Samuel Huntington would be proud .
Not to be outdone by their colleagues in the House , our country ’s Democratic Senators have likewise risen up to express their solidarity with the occupational forces .
New York Senator Charles Schumer finds it “ naïve and unrealistic that some say Israel should ‘ sit down and talk ’ to Hamas , a group sworn to Israel ’s annihilation , that broke the recent ceasefire by flinging missiles at Israeli cities . ”
Similarly , New Jersey Senator Robert Menendez communicated his support for Israel ’s bombardment of Gaza by way of an analogy : “ If I am sitting in New Jersey , and rockets are landing around my house , near my children , and near our schools , my number one goal , my immediate goal , is to stop the rockets .
So in December of 2008 , Israel sent its military to Gaza to achieve a direct goal : stop the rockets . ”
One cannot look to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid for any courageous leadership on the issue .
Reid , who cosponsored last week ’s Senate resolution condemning Hamas , was recently featured as a guest on NBC ’s Meet the Press .
During the course of his interview , he expressed his solidarity with Israel saying that the Israelis “ gave it [ Gaza ] to the Palestinians as a gesture of peace , and all they got are a bunch of rockets in return . ”
When asked if he was “ in sync with the Bush administration ” regarding the conflict , Reid responded succinctly : “ Yes , I am . ”
In his classic text The Wretched of the Earth , Franz Fanon wrote that “ the European masses must first of all decide to wake up , put on their thinking caps , and stop playing the irresponsible game of Sleeping Beauty ” if the criminal and racist practice of colonialism were ever to end .
The same can also be said today of those in the United States who seem to believe that the answer to today ’s problems lies in the triumph of one establishment party over the other on election day .
The shameful Democratic response to the ongoing bloodbath in Gaza illustrates this point ; it is a tragic reminder that the two - party political system of the United States is fundamentally flawed .
In the words of Congressman Kucinich , perhaps the sole voice of reason and integrity remaining the Democratic Party , “ Wake up America . ”

With the news that Sarah Palin has hired a high powered Hollywood attorney to search for a book and / or television deal for her , it seems that Jane Six Pack from Alaska thinks now is the time to cash in , to the tune of $ 11 million , on her fame .
According to the LA Times , Palin has hired the Washington lawyer Robert Barnett , who represented Barack Obama , and the Clintons in their book deals to represent her .
Rumor has it that Palin is looking for a payday as big as $ 11 million for her side of the 2008 election story .
To put her demands into context , former president Bill Clinton got a $ 15 million advance for his book My Life , which sold well over 2 million copies .
Hillary Clinton got an $ 8 million advance for her book , former first lady Laura Bush only got a $ 2 million advance for her life story , and it is safe to assume that then Sen.
Barack Obama did not get an advance anywhere near the $ 11 million that Palin is rumored to be seeking for either of his books .
It takes quite a bit of ego for anyone to suggest that Palin ’s story is worth Bill Clinton money .
Clinton was a popular former two term president who also had a sex scandal in his presidency .

Exactly what could Sarah Palin tell America that is worth $ 11 million ?
Is she going to complain about bloggers talking about her family , and how the liberal media gave the election to Barack Obama for 300 pages ?
Maybe she can finally tell the nation why she and her family needed a quarter million dollar wardrobe , and where those clothes are now ?
It is likely that she will use the book to make the case that the election defeat was all the fault of the McCain people because they did not use her properly .
This is a really bad time for any Republican to be asking for a big advance .
The fact that the former first lady could only get $ 2 million should tell Palin and her people that the market for conservative books is ice cold right now .
Plus , I do n’t see what Sarah Palin or her ghostwriter could tell us that would be worth buying her book .
I do n’t begrudge Palin a chance to make a living , but she already has a job .
She is the governor of Alaska , although you would n’t know it because she is rarely there .
Sarah Palin wants to be a rich celebrity in the worst way , but any publisher would be a fool to pay her $ 11 million for the rights to her book .
Palin would fit right in at Fox News , but I do n’t see any other television deal working out for her .
The problem is Palin is loved by a segment of the Republican Party , and that is it .
She is a national joke , not a popular figure , so unless any project is catered towards her supporters , it will fail .
To start with , Hamas does not have to win this war .
It can lose and still win .
As long as no other political group can replace it in power , even as some of its diehards can continue to lob missiles , however ineffectually , into Israel , it achieves a moral victory of sorts .
Moreover , if Mahmoud Abbas ’s Fatah movement tries to replace Hamas in power , Fatah will forever be tagged with the label of Israeli stooge , and in the eyes of Palestinians will have little moral legitimacy .
Israel ’s dilemma is that it is not fighting a state but an ideology , the postmodern glue that holds together Greater Iran .
Whether it is the sub -state entities of Hamas in Palestine , Hezbollah in Lebanon , or the Mahdi movement in Shiite southern Iraq ; or the hopes , dreams , and delusions of millions of Sunni Arabs , principally in Egypt , who feel a closer psychological identity with radical Shiite mullahs than with their own Pharaonic Sunni autocracy , Iran has built its dominion on a combination of anti-western ideas and the dynamic wiliness of its intelligence operations ( which , in turn , are a reflection of a civilization more developed and urbanized than that of the Arabs ) .
Iran ’s message of anti-Semitism and hatred toward the United States plays well across sectarian lines in the Sunni Arab world , which identifies its own fatigued , uninspiring , and detested rulers with the side of the U.S. and Israel .
Sunni Arabs hate their own rulers , but despairing of changing their own lot , they channel that hatred toward us : thus the potency of the Iranian message .
A nuclear weapon will only supply Iran with more prestige among the Arab lumpen faithful .
The ideologizing of hatred , like the ideologizing of religion , can empower millions of alienated , working - class Arabs who feel psychologically adrift in the world of the early 21st century .
Israel won its audacious military reputation during the age of Arab state armies .
Because Arabs never believed in their own secular states , their armies were never very good in the first place , and thus Israel had no trouble impressing the world in its wars against them .
But at the sub - state level of movements like Hamas or Hezbollah , the Arabs very much believe in their cause , and thus Israel has a real challenge on its hands .
How do you fight unconventional , sub - state armies empowered by ideas ?
You undermine them subtly over time , or you crush them utterly , brutally .
Israel , unable to tolerate continued rocket attacks on its people , has decided on the latter course .
Our own diplomacy with Iran now rests on whether or not Israel succeeds .
We need to create leverage before we can negotiate with the clerical regime , and that leverage can only come from an Israeli moral victory — one that leaves Hamas sufficiently reeling to scare even the pro-Iranian Syrians from coming to its aid .
In defense of its own territorial integrity , Israel has , in effect , launched the war on the Iranian empire that President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney , in particular , can only have contemplated .
IBM has seen the future of computing and it may not involve silicon .
Instead the company has been looking at graphene , the single atom - thick sheets of carbon that has materials scientists entranced by its dazzling array of amazing properties .
If graphene ever becomes the material of choice for a new generation of superfast chips , then the work of Yu- Ming Lin and buddies at the IBM T. J. Watson Research Center in upstate New York may well turn out to be one of the foundations of that revolution .
Today , they say they ’ve built the high quality graphene transistors and clocked them running at 26 GHz .
That does n’t quite knock silicon off its perch –the fastest silicon transistors are an order of magnitude faster than that but the record is held by indium phosphide transistors which have topped 1000 GHz .
Still , 26 GHz is n’t bad for the new kid on the block .
It took silicon 40 years to get this far .
By contrast , the first graphene transistor was built only last year .
As the team puts it : “ The work represents a significant step towards the realization of graphene - based electronics . ”

Perhaps not many of you remember the agitation caused two years ago by a massive solar flare on December 5 , 2006 .
It was an X9 event on a scale where an X1 is still considered very powerful , but X20 phenomena have been observed , fortunately scarcely enough .
The one in 2006 was the most powerful in the last three decades , blasting with the force of a hundred million nuclear bombs , but surprisingly , this is not the most interesting part .
Such a blast , featuring temperatures 10 to 100 million degrees Celsius should normally leave nothing intact , still , the pair of NASA 's Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory ( STEREO ) spacecraft in orbit of the Sun ( at different points ) have recorded a 90 minute worth of intact neutral hydrogen atoms passing by , before the expected ions caused by the Shockwave .
" No other elements were present , not even helium ( the sun 's second most abundant atomic species ) .
Pure hydrogen streamed past the spacecraft for a full 90 minutes , " shared Richard Mewaldt from Caltech , quoted by Universe Today .
So , although they could not have survived the explosion , the atoms were there , intact .
The attempted theory states that they had n't formed within the flare , but outside it , as its products reached interplanetary space .
" We believe they began their journey to Earth in pieces , as protons and electrons , " explained Mewaldt .
" Before they escaped the sun ’s atmosphere , however , some of the protons recaptured an electron , forming intact hydrogen atoms .
The atoms left the sun in a fast , straight shot before they could be broken apart again . "
These particles got to be ejected before they could be slowed down or deflected by the Sun 's magnetic field , and this is the reason they managed to reach the STEREO spacecraft long before the ions did .
The scientists plan to perform future similar observations during a powerful flare in order to understand whether this is a regular effect or whether it was just a one - time accident .
Seas surrounding an archipelago near the tip of the Antarctic peninsula are richer in animal life than the Galapagos Islands , challenging the notion that warm seas in tropical zones are higher in biodiversity , scientists claimed today .
Much less is known about the South Orkney islands than the tropical islands that helped to shape Charles Darwin 's thoughts about natural selection on his Beagle voyage .
But according to a new study published today by the Journal of Biogeography , the sea around them is teeming with a huge variety of life .
The survey disproves the notion that the waters in chilly polar regions have a much poorer variety of fauna .
" There has been a long - held belief that the tropics are rich and the polar regions are poor and mid-latitudes are somewhere in between , " said Dr David Barnes at the British Antarctic Survey , who led the study , part of the international Census of Marine Life .
" This is the first time we 've been able to actually look at the fauna of a polar archipelago – it is not actually that poor at all . "
Barnes said the reason for carrying out the survey was to give a baseline from which changes in biodiversity due to global warming can be judged .
" This is in the part of the world with fastest change in terms of temperature , " he said .
The Antarctic peninsula has already experienced warming of 3C over the past 50 years .
" If you do n't know what the fauna is at any one point it is very difficult to detect either species moving in or species moving out " , he added .
The survey recorded 1,224 species in 50 different biological classes .
The team discovered five new species and one genus - the biological category that is higher than species - that was new to science .
The new species are all sea mosses ( bryozoans ) or isopods ( woodlouse - like animals ) but they have not been given names yet .
The team also scoured reports from scientific expeditions and the scientific literature going back decades to find every mention of species observed in the region in a bid to create the most complete and authoritative list of creatures that have ever been found there .
But studying the sea creatures off the South Orkneys is not for the faint hearted - and a far cry from the balmy waters around the Galapagos .
Barnes 's team had to brave biting winds that frequently stopped them from working .
And while diving in the freezing waters , they had to keep an eye out for potential attacks by orcas and leopard seals .
If either predator came near they had to stop diving by climbing onto the British Antarctic Survey 's Royal research vessel James Clark Ross or scrambling to shore .
" Although that sounds dramatic , weather is a far bigger issue , " said Barnes .
" It stops us working far more and makes our work far more hazardous ...
Sometimes it 's much warmer under the water - it 's only minus one and a half [ degrees ] ! "
Once underwater though the view is spectacular . " , " said Barnes , who has dived extensively on coral reefs and all over the world .
" I do n't think I 've been anywhere where you can see so many different types of major groups of animals all in one place .
" You would have to swim quite a long way in the UK or maybe cover hundreds of metres in a coral reef to see so many types of animals that you can see in a very small space at the polar regions . "
He said that the marine environment off the South Orkneys is also pristine and free from invasive species .
" It is literally the only place in the world where you can dive and not see alien species .
Everything you can see in front of you is native to Antarctica . "
None of the trawls of the ocean depths brought up any plastic waste – something expected anywhere else in the world .
The only human crafted item the team did uncover was a piece of lead shot that was probably fired by whalers who used the South Orkneys as a base at the turn of the last century .
The team 's survey covered all realms of sea life .
As well as diving in the shallows they also trawled the sea bottom to a depth of 1,500 m using nets and employed a special sled that when dragged across the bottom could collect even very tiny creatures .
Its sieve held everything bigger than 0.3 mm .
Other team members combed the intertidal zone of the islands to survey life in rock pools and living on the shore .
A fascinating admission from the McCain campaign , that they chose to leave the high road , to chuck overboard John McCain ’s “ maverick ” status , because the McCain campaign thought that they could get more media coverage by being sleazy , dishonorable liars .
Hell of a thing for a campaign to admit , especially a campaign centered around the honor of a former POW .
Apparently when the going gets tough , the first thing John McCain sacrifices is his honor .
A disturbing pattern is emerging of McCain chucking the high road , abandoning his morals and ethics , when instant gratification comes knocking .
It ’s not the definition of hero .
It ’s the definition of reckless .
When a Wilmington man in his early 20s overdosed on heroin the day after Christmas , local police Detective Pat Nally turned to his computer .
He wanted to look at the deceased 's Facebook and MySpace pages for possible clues about the source of the drug and who might have been using it with the man .
" People arrange to buy and sell drugs on Facebook ; there 's talk of what they may do and where they may go , " said Nally .
" We 'd be foolish not to use it as an investigative tool . "
The Wilmington investigator is not alone .
In an informal survey of 14 departments in this area , officials in half of them said they use social networking websites such as Facebook and MySpace in detective work - particularly in investigations involving young people .
In Harvard , the police signed on to such sites about three years ago , after a woman was sexually assaulted and beaten by three men whom she met on MySpace and invited to her house .
Police contacted MySpace and tracked the assailants using their online usernames and accounts , said Chief Edward Denmark .
Now even the chief has a Facebook page himself .
In a recent photo he used in his profile , Denmark appears as a singer from the 1970s with an Afro , long sideburns , and a flashy necklace .
It 's not him : Denmark says he changes the photo daily .
Harvard Police Officer Daniele Fortunato is also on Facebook .
If you had searched for her on the site recently , you would have found a cat in a white - and - red Christmas hat stretching out on a bed ( it 's her profile photo ) , while Harvard police Sergeant James Babu appears as a smiling pig , with big ears and perfect white teeth .
Since the MySpace incident , the department has found that such websites can be useful to help identify suspects , Denmark said , by providing information about a particular person 's contacts .
" We ask them if they know a certain person and [ if ] they tell us ' no ' and we look on Facebook and see that they 're friends , we know they 're being untruthful , " he explained .
In Nashua , police Sergeant Mike Carignan said Facebook helps police identify suspects by making it possible to " put a face to a name . "
He said the department uses such sites in investigations involving sexual predators , burglaries , drug dealers , and wanted people .
In Boxborough , Sergeant Warren Ryder said police were able to prevent underage drinking at a high school graduation party using information they obtained on Facebook .
" They were talking about who was going to get the booze first , " he said .
He said police also solved a vandalism case after someone posted a picture of the spray - painted graffiti on Facebook .
In Lowell , police Captain Randell Humphrey said Facebook can be useful in cases involving computer crimes , such as threats , as well as fraud and sex- related crimes , while Woburn even employs a detective whose responsibility is to monitor Facebook and MySpace .
While other annual retrospectives are based on editors ’ picks or sales data , the Last.fm Best of 2008 list is based entirely on what the Last . fm community has been listening to this year and shows which artist , albums and tracks defined the musical landscape in 2008 .
We compiled the list by looking at the data in a number of different ways to get a full picture of what you all listened to this year .
First we looked at absolute numbers .
It wo n’t surprise any followers of the Last. fm weekly charts to know that Coldplay , Radiohead and The Beatles topped the list .
While Coldplay ’s “ Viva La Vida Or Death And All His Friends ” certainly made an impact this year , many of the other artists had not released any new material , and we wanted to know what artists really made 2008 different .
So , we decided to slice the data to show us which new artists really broke through this year .
We chose to define “ new ” artists as artists who released their debut full - length album in 2008 in the UK , and we ranked them by total number of listeners .
Check out who made the top ten here .
Next we looked at the top albums by scrobbles in 2008 .
When looking at all scrobbles in 2008 by album again we saw the weekly chart champions dominated the list .
We then looked just at albums physically released in 2008 in the UK and ranked them by listeners , and came up with a list that shows what albums are this year ’s classics .
See if you can name all top ten and then score yourself here .
The top tracks of 2008 list ( as you can probably guess by now ) is made up of tracks released in 2008 and ranked by listeners .
Who dominated the list : earnest rockers or that summer hit you could n’t escape ?
Check it out here .
Finally , we put it all together in a radio for your listening enjoyment .
To mix it up a bit and keep you guessing , we expanded the radio to include the top 30 artists , albums and tracks of 2008 .
If you ’re feeling sleuthy , you can track down the source of the radio to see who did n’t quite make it to the top .
Enjoy !

Self - described “ conservative feminist ” Christina Hoff Sommers delivered a speech outlining her primary objects to contemporary feminism .
Item one : “ Today ’s movement takes a very dim view of men . ”
And here is the problem with the play and with the gender feminist * philosophy that informs it :
Most men are not brutes .
They are not oppressors .
Yes , there are some contemptible Neanderthals among us , and I have no sympathy for them whatsoever .
But to confuse them with the ethical majority of men is blatantly sexist .
In the video clip ( but not in the transcript ) , Sommers is more over - the - top in defining feminists as male - haters , going so far as to express pity for boys whose mothers are feminists .
I ’d like to see a serious discussion of male - bashing in feminism .
Unfortunately , Sommers ’ treatment of the subject is n’t serious .
She cites one , and only one , source to show that “ the gender feminist philosophy ” considers “ most men… brutes ” : Eve Ensler ’s play The Vagina Monologues .
But The Vagina Monologues is n’t a non-fiction essay .
It ’s a play about women ’s experiences surviving rape and abuse .
That ’s not the sole subject of the play , but — just after the importance of women loving their bodies — it ’s the primary theme .
Complaining that a play about the abuse and rape of women has too many abusive men in it is unreasonable and unfair .
There is a positive male character in The Vagina Monologues , a man who so loves vaginas that he teaches his girlfriend to love her own vagina .
Sommers dismisses this character entirely , for the transparently ridiculous reason that the character is describes as being bland on first meeting ( although he later proves to be an unusually great lover , because he loves women ’s sex parts so much ) .
It ’s hard to respond to Sommers ’ argument , because it ’s not even an argument ; it ’s just an irrelevant statement .
He is a positive character ; he does n’t mysteriously cease being a positive character because he seems bland at first , or because he loves vaginas .
In this speech , that ’s Sommers ’ only evidence that contemporary feminism considers most men brutes — in one popular play about rape and abuse , many but not all of the male characters are negative .
I find that evidence underwhelming .
Note what Sommers does n’t include : A single recent quote from a feminist leader saying “ most men are brutes . ”
If this is indeed the common viewpoint of contemporary feminism , I ’d think that Sommers would be able to find a dozen such quotes easily ; yet Sommers does n’t provide even one .
* * *
Sommers ’ case is ridiculous , overstated , and the “ evidence ” she introduces is embarrassingly weak .
But I ’d like to consider the question of feminist hatred of men a little bit more .
In the comments at Feminist Law Professors , David Cohen writes :
I strongly contest her theories about feminist hatred of men .
For the past two decades , I ’ve now been a very outspoken feminist man on three very different university campuses , within one prominent feminist legal advocacy group , and as a frequent blogger on this blog .
With the advocacy group I worked for for 7 years , I worked with many other feminist legal advocacy groups .
In none of these settings was I ever once treated in any way that made me feel that the ( mostly all , but not exclusively so ) women hated me or men generally .
They ( as do I ) hate men who do bad things to women ( and other men ) .
But , there is no general hatred of men .
Sommers ’ claims to the contrary are just wrong .
In fact , I often found ( and still find ) myself in a position I did n’t want to be in — being praised for my feminist work because of the work but also because I was a man .
I appreciate the first part of that but feel like the second part is wrong - headed and unnecessary .
That seems right to me .
I ca n’t claim to have worked as much with feminists as David Cohen ; but I ’ve been a women ’s studies major , occasionally volunteered for feminist causes , and virtually all my friends for the past 20 years have been feminists .
And , with one exception , my experiences have been similar to David’s .
If man -hating is so pervasive in contemporary feminism , why do n’t men in feminism encounter it more ?
Furthermore , in my experience , feminists are more likely than non-feminists to be supportive if I say men are screwed over by sex role expectations ; that the targeting and bullying of wimpy boys is a real and significant problem ( non-feminists are more apt to respond “ boys will be boys ” ) ; that being cut off from feeling free to express ourselves emotionally does real damage to men ; that men who go into traditionally female fields like child care are unfairly looked at with suspicion ; and so on .
Again , with one exception .
That one exception is , the internet .
Years ago , on Ms Magazine ’s feminist bulletin board ( this was in the dark ages , before blogs even ) I met a handful of self - proclaimed radical feminists who ’d say genuinely man-hating things : men are biologically inferior to women , all men consciously plot to keep all women in fear of rape , and so forth .
These women were a minority of posters on the Ms boards ( and a minority among the radical feminists there ) , and many other posters objected to these statements .
Nonetheless , these bigoted , anti-male views do exist among a small minority of feminists , and ever since the Ms Boards I can no longer say I ’ve never encountered any genuinely man-hating feminists .
But to claim that such views are the dominant philosophy of contemporary feminism is nonsense .
It ’s also through the internet that I first encountered men ’s rights activists , also known as MRAs .
MRAs , of course , are extremely sympathetic to the idea that boys and men are being harmed by contemporary sex roles — but for many , their sympathy is exclusively for males .
Their is a tone of bitterness and hatred in how many MRAs discuss women and harms to women , very similar to the way some feminists on the Ms Boards discuss men and harms to men .
The difference is that those feminists are , in my experience , a small minority among all feminists ; but a huge portion of MRAs exhibit rage towards towards women in general and feminists in particular .
* * *
There ’s a more subtle form of sexism against men that I think is much more common than the “ men are mostly brutes ” mentality that Sommers criticizes ( but provides no examples of ) .
In the last 20 years — and due , in my opinion , to the growth of the MRA movement ( which was itself strongly influenced by Sommers ’ book Who Stole Feminism ? ) – too many feminists have developed a knee - jerk resistance to discussions of how sexism harms men .
This is understandable .
After a hundred conversations with MRAs , feminists have learned that when someone begins talking about how men are harmed by sexism , they ’re often leading up to the anti-feminist conclusions that women have nothing to complain about , and feminism is a morally terrible movement .
Concerns about harms to men are sometimes use by MRAs to crowd out discussion of harms to women .
Feminists , frankly , have become defensive , and in some cases have circled their rhetorical wagons .
But although this is understandable , I also think it ’s unfortunate .
Men are harmed by sexism , and although I would n’t want that point to crowd out discussions of harms to women , it should be part of the spectrum of issues feminists discuss .
(* Although Hoff Sommers uses the term “ gender feminist , ” which she coined , she never defines the term in the transcript of her speech .
( In the video , she says she uses the term interchangably with “ victim feminist . )
For more about the term “ gender feminist , ” see this series of posts .
Although she would n’t put it this way , in practice Sommers categorizes all feminists who are n’t libertarian conservatives as “ gender feminists . ” )
To allow intra-feminist discussion , comments on this post on “ Alas , a Blog ” are limited to feminist and feminist allies only .
However , the cross-post at “ Blog By Barry ” is open to feminists and non-feminists .
Three years previously this guy had been a straight - up corporate goon , fearful of alcohol and sex .
But now he stood before me as a fully emancipated ocker bloke , beers comfortably under the belt , his stance a picture of positively Jackmanesque charisma .
Somewhere , in between the departure gate at Kingsford Smith and our meeting on the Lower East Side , he had been transformed into a paragon of salty , you - beaut Strayan blokiness , a factory of claps on the back , broad vowels and affectedly countrified references to the land of his ancestry .
" Mateahhhhhhhhh , " he began at one point , " I 've fair dinkum given up on these New York chicks — too bloody choosy .
Give me a six - pack of VB and a seat at the SCG next to Natalie Imbruglia over this any day . "
" You ca n't take six - packs into the cricket , " I replied .
" They do n't allow it .
Also , no one really talks about Natalie Imbruglia any more . "
What I really wanted to ask him was : since when did you start talking like Bryan Brown in Cocktail ?
But I never got the chance , because our conversation — and friendship — ended soon after that last exchange .
Over the days that followed , I observed more and more expats in action .
Each time , the pattern was the same : bland , middle - class accountant from the suburbs of Sydney lands in foreign land and begins talking like publican from local Narromine boozer .
It 's a pattern , in truth , which is being replicated all over the globe , every hour of every day of every year .
Before leaving Australia , the expat is glum .
The expat craves exoticism , crowds , the sting and clash of regular queuing .
Over a beer , or better still , a cocktail ( what could be more cosmopolitan than expressing ennui through the muddle of a mojito ? ) , the not - yet - expat will take stock of his or her miserable lot , pout moodily into the bottom of a glass like some kind of late - blooming Henson nude and utter the immortal words : " I 'm sick of Sydney .
It 's too small .
Seriously , is Surry Hills as good as it gets ?
There has to be more to life than small plates of blood sausage and concrete - floored wine bars .
Even the taxi drivers in this town have run out of things to say to me .
I have to get out . "
Liberated by the thrilling loneliness of international travel , the expat uses the new environment for a linguistic reinvention .
In New York , clothing , hand gestures and dance moves are all pressed into service as well .
Virtually every expat in New York inhabits a metaphysical Gundagai , proudly sporting the spurs of national belonging — the RM Williams boots , the booziness and the sociability , the casual " Yeah , mates " to anyone who 's not Australian and not their mate — even as they disavow all immediate interest in returning to the country they come from .
The result is an at - times frighteningly acute interest in people they 'd been desperate to get away from just months , perhaps even weeks , earlier .
In the world of the expat , the journey from , " I 'm sick of Sydney " to , " Oh my God , are you from Sydney ?
We should be friends on Facebook ! " is unapologetically brief .
But things are more complex than that .
Expats experience a difficult relationship with the teat of the nation .
Some like that teat ; some need it .
Some can't get through the day without having the scorecard from the cricket permanently minimised on their workplace desktops .
Others , however , look on this as some kind of weakness .
A friend of mine once made the highly astute observation that when you 're an expat , it 's possible to dine out on Australian politics .
It 's at moments like these that the chasm separating the different species of Australian expat will be revealed in all its yawning terror .
" Nathan Rees 's ban on free bus trips for schoolchildren is appalling , " one expat will announce over an archly dangled glass of tempranillo .
Some present will nod in agreement , expressing their unmitigated disgust — the disgust of the unaffected — at " what 's happening to that country " .
But others will ask , quite legitimately and without even the merest shred of irony , " Who 's Nathan Rees ? "
( It 's a poor example , of course .
" Who 's Nathan Rees ? " is a question many people in Australia still ask on a regular basis . )
At the heart of the expat experience is a linguistic divide : while some talk more Australian , others see separation as the occasion for a dramatic rejection of Australian intonation .
This division is most explicit in London , where the expat population is divided roughly between those who talk like Bryan Brown , and those who talk like Geoffrey Robertson — born - again ockers on one side and on the other , a waistcoated phalanx of aspiring toffs , the Union Jack stitched into their hearts and plums in every vowel .
In Asia , the expat will either be a relentless bore , or a ceaseless accumulator of " local knowledge " ( where to find the best dumplings , how to bargain properly ) — both of which are often the same thing .
The Brown / Robertson binary is also at large here , operating with perhaps even greater venom than in London : the Browns use their superiority in English as a buttress to still - greater bogandom ( " Yeah mate , I said I wanted a beer — do you know beer ? " ) , while the Robertsons play out a quaint colonialist pantomime .
" Ja , let 's meet at Raffles , " they 'll say , or : " Oh darling , the Bund is for the peasants : dining is so much more palatable in the French Concession . "
In Singapore , Hong Kong , Shanghai and Tokyo , even the poor , intellectually satiated and not -British can speak as if they 're rich , bored and from Britain .
In Paris , things are different again .
The expat will take refuge in strong cigarettes , red wine teeth , scarves and bad French .
This is the expat - turned - intellectual , the expat - gone - Sartre .
Lob in to a wine bar around the Marais on a Friday or Saturday night and you can be guaranteed to find some Australian banging on about Nicolas Sarkozy , Francis Ponge , Bernard Henri-Levy or Ursula K. Le Guin .
( Is Ursula K. Le Guin French ?
I guess not .
But she should be . )
Here the cadence is determinedly continental , intellectual sophistication resolved around a series of flutey bofs and pffts : every agreement begins with , " Ja , " every question ends in , " no ? " ( " Ja , ja , I mean , Sarkozy is probably less of a socialist than he appears but to be elected as a conservative and act as a leftist , this is all part of the mystery and theatre of French politics , no ? " )
But in no place will the expat know true repose .
This is the terminal dilemma of the expat : linguistic reinvention in one place is never enough .
New York is never enough .
The act has to go on the road .
" I 'm sick of Sydney , " is only the prelude to a more damning lament : " I 'm sick of New York .
Seriously — the grid pattern .
Is that as good as it gets ? "
Done with the great capitals , done with Barcelona and Bangkok and Beijing and Dubai , the expat 's trajectory deepens and multiplies , passing through Mazar - e - Sharif and Mogadishu before finally devolving into the deliberate obscurantism of Brazzaville , Baku , Busan and Bogota .
And this is no bad thing , when you think about it , because fair dinkum , as a mate of mine was telling me the other day , Baku is a great place for beers .

Rachel Maddow shows how ridiculously easy the Feds have made it for financial institutions to apply for relief , so much so that she 's tempted to create " The Rachel Maddow Show Bank Holding Company " to get in on the action .
It also shows the rank hypocrisy of Republicans now screaming that the bailout of the auto industry must come with strings attached , since they felt no similar compunction while handing over trillions of taxpayer dollars to financial institutions .
Further , the financial institutions feel no compunction to be accountable for how they 've used the money , nor how they compensate their employees and executives .

But first , I here by announce the formation of the “ first national bank ” of THE RACHEL MADDOW SHOW .
We are turning this television show into a bank , maybe a bank holding company .
And you will be happy to hear that we are in really , really sorry shape as a bank .
We are an awful bank .
We are a terrible bank .
We are totally on the verge of tanking as a bank .
So , therefore , we will need to fill out an application for federal assistance for the “ first national bank ” of THE RACHEL MADDOW SHOW .
Then , I think , step two , probably we‘ll just go ahead with plans for the big holiday party .
No need to delay .
No need to hold back .
See , the application for free money from the government if you ‘re a bank , it ‘s quite literally two pages long .
I thought that was a joke until I went online and I downloaded it .
If you google TARP application , it just comes right up first thing and here it is .
All two pages .
The first page consists entirely of lines where they ask you to fill in the name and address of the bank and a primary and secondary contact person .
That ‘s half the application done right there .
The second half of the application ?
Well , let ‘s do it , right ?
Ask for the registration number for the company up there at the top , and then the next three lines are essentially questions about how much government money you want .
This next line is , essentially , how is your balance sheet .
Then there ‘s a “ yes or no ” question about whether you have gone online and read the small print at the Treasury Department ‘s Web site .
Yes , right , like people read that stuff , like checking that little box when you download software .
Yes , sure , I read all these conditions .
The next line is , essentially , anything else we should know ?
And then , down at the bottom , this is — actually , this is a really tough one .
Down at the bottom , they say state the type of company you are .
Oh , proving .
Then , there ‘s a line for the date — that ‘s a hard one — and a line for the boss ‘ signature .
And actually , you do n‘t even need to provide the boss ‘ signature if you do n‘t want to .
It says boss ‘ signature or the signature of a designee .
You know , just for hoots , when we do the “ first national bank ” of THE RACHEL MADDOW SHOW application , I ‘m going to say that Bilbo Baggins was our CEO ‘s designee and just sign that name just to see if they even notice .
That ‘s it actually .
That ‘s the whole two pages .
That is the full application process for a piece of the $ 700 billion worth of our money that the government is doling out .
Have you ever applied for a loan for anything ?
House , car , small business , anything ?
Have you ever applied for public assistance , unemployment , food stamps welfare ?
If you have n‘t , I can tell you this , the application asks for more of a commitment than name , address , how much do you want , anything else we should know , love , Bilbo Baggins .
For regular humans — that ‘s not what getting a loan is like .
It ‘s certainly not what getting welfare is like , which is why I ‘m going to try to turn myself into a bank holding company .
Then maybe we all should .
You know , since they did n‘t have to disclose much to get the money , the “ Associated Press ” followed up with some of the banks that received federal bailout money , to ask them what they did with their money .
They asked four pretty darn simple questions to 21 banks that received bailout federal bailout money .
Number one , how much has been spent ?
Number two , what was it spent on ?
Number three , how much is being held in savings ?
And number four , what ‘s the plan for the rest ?
Seems like a reasonable list of questions , right ?
I mean , we gave them the money , should n‘t we , at least , get to know how they are spending it ?
Not if you ask them .
Some of the nation ‘s largest banks told the “ Associated Press , ” they have n‘t been tracking exactly how they ‘re using the money and some just flat out refuse to discuss it at all .
A spokesman for JPMorgan Chase , which received $ 25 billion in bailout cash , told the “ Associated Press , ” quote , “ We have lent some of it .
We ‘ve not lent some of it .
We ‘ve not given any accounting of , ‘ Here ‘s how we are doing it . ‘
We have not disclosed that to the public , we are declining to . ”
Oh , you ‘re declining to .
Yes , try that with your bank .
The “ Associated Press ” says not one bank provided even the most basic accounting for the funds .
Some were more evasive than others .
On the one end of the spectrum , the most disclosive , maybe , was Wisconsin - based Marshall $ Ilsley Corporation .
They said , quote , “ The $ 1.75 billion in bailout money ” that they received “ allowed them to temporarily stop foreclosing on homes . ”
Great , tangible results .
Thank you .
I ‘d love some specifics , but , hey , you ‘re showing the right attitude .
On the way , way , way , way other end of the spectrum , we find the Bank of New York Mellon , which received about $ 3 billon bailout .
Their spokesman , Kevin Heine , said , quote , “ Said he would n‘t share spending specifics , ” and added , quote , “ I would just prefer if you would n‘t say that we ‘re not going to discuss those details . ”
We ‘re not going to tell you anything and we ‘re telling you , you ‘re not allowed to report that we ‘re not going to tell you anything .
Now , you can see why we should all become banks .
It ‘s such a deal , right ?
It ‘s certainly a better deal than being a car company .
Chrysler and G.M. were just told , “ Here , you can have $ 13 billion from your government but you better deliver us a shiny , new business plan which we , the people , believe will revolutionize your industry within three months , your executives better take pay cuts , you better get rid of those corporate jets , and failure on any of these counts will mean that you owe us the $ 13 billion back immediately . ”
The banks on the other hand ?
Ha !
The insurance giant , AIG , which , so far , has received about $ 150 billion of bailout money , your money , they are still be proud owner of seven corporate jets — seven .
JPMorgan which we bailed out to the tune of $ 25 billion — four jets .
Bank of America , $ 15 billion of our dollars — nine corporate jets .
The issue here is not just the double standard that exists between the banks and the auto companies .
It ‘s the jaw - dropping , knee - buckling lack of transparency that ‘s being offered by the banks and that ‘s being demanded , not by the government .
Many Americans were scared into grudgingly accepting that we needed to do something and maybe even something really expensive to prevent the collapse of our financial sector and our economy .
We hate the idea of having to do it .
But many of us and a majority of Congress were scared into believing that it was necessary .
And now , frankly , as things keep getting worse , it seems like the government may have to take a lot more expensive actions to try to stave off this economic collapse in coming days , weeks , months , and we hope not years .
So , there is a huge political peril here .
The way this financial bailout is being handled , maybe means the end of public tolerance for politically unpalatable but maybe necessary government economic intervention .
They are blowing it , politically .
The inability of the treasury to explain what it is they are doing with all this money , the plainly observable fact that the financial industry is spending a lot on things that have no relation to the health of the economy — private jets — and the raw disdain with which both the treasury and the banks are treating the true blue , totally understandable , fair and square , American demand that if we ‘re giving you the money , we get to know how it ‘s being used , if it ‘s being used , and that it ‘s not just being funneled down some gold - plated corporate rat hole .
That creates political peril and it really , really limits realistic government options for the Obama administration , at a time that , frankly , they ‘re going to need all the economic options they can get .
John Dean : ' Serious consequences ' if Obama does n't prosecute torture David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday December 19 , 2008
Print This Email This Vice President Dick Cheney 's admission that he authorized waterboarding has focused attention on possible Bush administration war crimes , and former Nixon White House counsel John Dean believes there will be " serious consequences " if the Obama administration tries to avoid singling out those involved for prosecution .
" I would be surprised if Cheney really wants to test the law , " Dean told MSNBC 's Keith Olbermann on Thursday , " but he 's getting out there pretty close to it .
I think most of the people who might be involved are trying to stay below the cover and hope that the statute of limitations ... will pass . "
Olbermann asked Dean why Democratic leaders like Sen. Carl Levin have been proposing a special commission to investigate allegations of torture , " rather than the incoming attorney general , Mr. Holder , just sending somebody out to arrest these guys before they leave the capital . "
" There is a degree of conventional wisdom that suspects that Mr. Obama really does n't want to take this issue on , " Dean replied .
" It 's not a unifying move . "
Olbermann noted that the problem with bipartisan special commissions , like the one created after 9/11 , is that they are " almost openly dedicated to not pointing fingers . "
" Do n't we have to point fingers ? " he asked Dean .
" Is that not the way justice works ? "
Dean agreed , saying that if those involved in war crimes are not singled out , " this is going to really reflect terribly on the entire country , not just on the Bush administration which has engaged in these activities , but it really will reflect on the Obama administration for its refusal to pursue them and prosecute them . "
" I think there 's serious consequences if they refuse to point fingers , " Dean stated .
Olbermann asked what Dean saw as the best and most realistic outcome , and Dean replied that it " would be if Mr. Obama , indeed , does exactly what he said during the campaign -- that he will , indeed , when his attorney general is seated , have him instructed to immediately look and see if these offenses have been committed , if they are prosecutable ... and then report to him and the nation to make it very clear that this is not the policy of the Obama administration or the United States . "
When Olbermann then asked what he thought was the " most likely outcome , " Dean laughed and replied , " Given ... the heat [ Obama 's ] going to take on Rick Warren , he 's going to take an awful lot more heat if he does n't do something to honor his campaign commitments . "

I ’m trying to come up with a simple decision tree , or flowchart , for when something should be tweeted vs. when it should get the respect of a full blog entry .
Here ’s what I ’ve come up with .
Move through the blogging rules below and see if you get a match .
If you do n’t , move on to the Twitter rules .
Note : all blog rules assume that the post is blog - worthy according to your existing standard , whatever that may be .
When to Blog It
idea cannot be reduced to 140 characters
the idea is meant to encourage intelligent conversation
the idea is designed to gather input
the idea is important enough to be associated with your identity
you ’re posting non-twitter - supported media , e.g. videos
when you want it to last ( think searchable 5 years from now )
asks for input that you want to capture
When to Tweet It
personal status update , e.g. seeing movie x , landed in San Francisco
you ’re broadcasting the existence of interesting content on your blog
the idea can be condensed to 140 characters
random , somewhat interesting idea , but not worth blogging ( else , blog )
If you do n’t get a match after running through both sets of rules then you either should n’t be sharing what you were about to share or you need to adjust your rules .
Obviously these rules are based on my own personal conceptualizations of blogging and Twitter , so you may have to adjust accordingly .
But hopefully this first attempt will prove useful to someone . ::
Even as Israel ’s F16s were aiming their first deadly salvoes at Hamas positions in the Gaza Strip on Saturday , questions were being asked at home and abroad , about what this “ shock and awe ” campaign was intended to achieve — and what Israel ’s exit strategy would be .
Unlike the confused and improvised Israeli response as the war against Hezbullah in Lebanon unfolded in 2006 , Operation Cast Lead appears to have been carefully prepared over a long period .
Israeli media reports , by usually well - informed correspondents and analysts , alluded on Sunday to six months of intelligence - gathering to pinpoint Hamas targets including bases , weapon silos , training camps and the homes of senior officials .
The Cabinet spent five hours discussing the plan in detail on December 19 and left the timing up to Ehud Olmert , the caretaker prime minister , and his Defence Minister Ehud Barak .
Preparations involved disinformation and deception which kept Israel ’s media in the dark .
According to Ha’aretz , that also lulled Hamas into a sense of false security and allowed the initial aerial onslaught to achieve tactical surprise — and kill many of the 300 victims counted so far .
Friday ’s decision to allow food , fuel and humanitarian supplies into besieged Gaza — ostensibly a gesture in the face of international pressure to relieve the ongoing blockade — was part of this .
So was Thursday ’s visit to Cairo by Tzipi Livni , Israel ’s Foreign Minister , to brief Egyptian officials .
The final decision was reportedly made on Friday morning .
Barak said on Sunday the timing of the operation was dictated by Israel ’s patience simply “ having running out ” in the face of renewed rocket and mortar attacks from Gaza into Israel when the shaky six - month ceasefire expired 10 days ago .
“ Any other sovereign nation would do the same , ” is the official Israeli refrain .
Amid the storm of international criticism of Israel ’s hugely disproportionate response , it is easy to overlook the domestic pressure faced by the Israeli government over its handling of “ Hamastan ” .
Homemade Qassam rockets and mortars rarely kill but they do terrify and have undermined Israel ’s deterrent power as well as keeping 250 000 residents of the south of the country in permanent danger .
But the context now is February ’s Israeli elections .
The contest that matters is between Livni ’s centrist Kadima party and the rightwing Likud under Binyamin Netanyahu , who talks only of “ economic peace ” with the Palestinians and does not want an independent Palestinian state , as Livni does .
Opinion polls show that it pays to talk tough : Livni ’s standing has improved in recent days .
The US political timetable may be as significant .
The three weeks before Barack Obama ’s inauguration were Israel ’s last chance to assume automatic diplomatic support from Washington , as it got from US President George Bush over both West Bank settlements and the Lebanon war .
It is hard to imagine an Israeli government testing Obama , whom it views with foreboding because of a sense he has more sympathy for the Palestinians , with a crisis of these dimensions during his first days or weeks in office .
Livni and other Israeli officials have spoken openly of wishing to topple Hamas since the Islamist movement took over from the western - backed , Fatah - dominated Palestinian Authority ( PA ) in June 2007 .
But this may be something less ambitious .
“ The realistic objective of any military operation is not the ousting of Hamas , but rather … undermining its military effectiveness and weakening its rule , ” is the view of Yediot Aharonot analyst Alex Fishman .
Ron Ben - Yishai , another military expert , called it an attempt to “ change the rules of the game ” .
This appears to be a case of “ asymmetric warfare ” in which the weaker party commands disproportionate force — by repeatedly firing crude rockets or using suicide bombers — and the more powerful one responds with a massive , disproportionate blow .
“ The objective of an Israeli military operation in Gaza must be to undermine Hamas ’ desire to keep fighting , and at that point agree on a ceasefire , ” said Fishman .
Israel is well - informed about what happens in Gaza .
Its premise is that Hamas is unpopular and that by targeting its personnel it can encourage that trend .
But not all the victims are from Hamas .
Some are civilians and there are security officers who belong to Fatah .
And nor , crucially , has the PA been able to deliver a peace agreement with Israel , or even end its settlement activity .
Most significantly , the scale of the bloodshed — ranking in Palestinian history alongside the 1948 Deir Yassin killings or the Sabra and Shatila massacres ( by Israel ’s Christian Lebanese allies ) in 1982 means renewed motives for hatred and revenge .
Israel said on Sunday that it is calling up thousands of reservists .
There can be little doubt that it could reoccupy and hold the coastal strip — as it did from 1967 to 2005 — but tanks and infantry would be vulnerable in guerrilla warfare against lightly - armed but highly - motivated Hamas or Islamic Jihad fighters .
Civilian casualties would grow with international pressure .
The only reason to deploy ground forces would be to achieve something air power could not — searching for rocket production and storage facilities that have not yet been identified .
Israeli commentators suggest the army has no appetite for a ground war , making comparisons with Lebanon in 2006 , and pointing to the impending elections .
Another key question for the military must be the fate of Gilad Shalit , the Israeli corporal held in Gaza since he was captured in 2006 .
It is hard to see negotiations on his release , and of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel , continuing in these circumstances .
The Gaza offensive has already fuelled anti-Israeli and anti-American feeling across the Arab world .
Mahmoud Abbas , the Palestinian President , faces demands for an end to any talks with Israel .
Hamas , calling for a “ third intifada , ” accused Egypt and Jordan of colluding with the Gaza plan .
If there is a silver lining in this dark cloud it is to have shown that working to achieve a lasting peace in the Middle East is still a desperately urgent task .

the how and why of Pinax 's move to distutils
Pinax is changing the way that external dependencies are brought in during development on trunk .
Note that this document is only talking about changes in how things work and will work on trunk , NOT necessarily how they will work with a released version of Pinax .
Until recently , Pinax had two choices for a given external dependency :
use svn:externals and point to the external dependency 's svn repository
include the external dependency code in the Pinax codebase
However , there are problems with this approach :
it largely relies on external dependencies being in svn and this is increasingly not the case ( although it was when Pinax started )
it makes it difficult for Pinax itself to move away from svn
there is no management of dependencies between external dependencies , nor between particular projects in Pinax and their individual dependencies
To solve these problems and more , Pinax is switching to a distutils - based approach .
This means :
externals dependencies are encouraged to be released as distutil - compliant packages with a valid setup.py and put on PyPI
development versions of dependencies can be pulled in in a variety of different ways including from git , hg or bzr repositories
In order to develop from the Pinax trunk , you will need to use pip .
Because some external dependencies are retrieved via git and bzr you will also need those if using Pinax trunk .
Although we will eventually have per-project requirements files , there are currently two requirements files that describe to pip what dependencies to bring in and how :
pinax / requirements/libs.txt
pinax / requirements/external_apps.txt
The former is actually a requirement of the latter so you can bring in all external dependencies with :
pip install -r pinax / requirements/external_apps.txt
We strongly recommend the use of virtualenv in conjunction with pip to allow isolated environments to be set up without Pinax having to hack PYTHONPATH .
How do soldiers come to terms with having taken a life in combat ?
Research has suggested that when people consider themselves to be “ good ” but are forced to do something “ bad ” to others , they adopt negative opinions about their victims to rationalize their actions .
But according to a new study , this tendency may not apply to soldiers or at least not to those who have served in the Iraq War .
American soldiers who have killed in Iraq do not think more poorly of Iraqis than Iraq
War soldiers who have not killed — they do , however , think worse of Americans who speak out against the war .
Wayne Klug , a psychologist at Berkshire Community College , asked 68 Iraq
War veterans about their experiences , their thoughts on the war and their opinions about Iraqis and Americans .
Compared with soldiers who never saw combat and those who witnessed a death but were not involved , veterans who “ were directly involved in an Iraqi fatality ” were much more likely to consider the war to be beneficial to both countries .
The finding is consistent with prior evidence that people tend to value outcomes that require great effort or distress .
But although previous research predicts that these soldiers might disparage their victims , investigators were surprised to find that these veterans instead resented Americans whose opinions about the war suggest that their killings may have been unjustified .
This change could be a result of the unique circumstances surrounding the Iraq War .
“ A clue lies in the political and public nature of a controversial war fought by a volunteer army , ” says Klug , who presented his findings in August at the annual conference of the American Psychological Association in Boston .
For example , in the Vietnam War soldiers were drafted , and people who avoided serving were viewed with suspicion , he explains .
But today the situation is reversed .
“ The veterans are aware of their status as the ‘ stepchildren ’ of polite American society , a sense that ’s enhanced by their abysmal treatment upon returning , ” he posits .
Because America ’s decision to go to war was the sole reason these soldiers killed , they “ now depend on that policy to justify their actions , ” Klug believes .
Those who disagree with the policy , then , become automatic enemies .

Normally when you hear Nobel Prize winning authors talking about the internet , it 's to decry it for dumbing us all down .
Spare a thought , then , for Jean - Marie Gustave le Clezio , who accepted his Nobel Prize in Sweden with a far more optimistic outlook :
" Who knows , if the internet had existed at the time , perhaps Hitler 's criminal plot would not have succeeded - ridicule might have prevented it from ever seeing the light of day , " he 's reported as saying .
Well , optimistic if you believe that the pinnacle of the internet 's tremendous power comes down to the ability to spread ridicule far and wide .
In that strange world , we all strive to be like the 4 Chan users who spend their days photoshopping Hitler 's head into ridiculous , uncomfortable places .
OK ... perhaps it 's not that strange a world .
A pounding head can keep you from falling asleep at night , but you do n't always have to pop a pill .
This move , called Legs up the Wall , gently stretches the muscles in your neck ( often the culprit of tension headaches ) and relaxes you at the same time — a combo that can ease your ache in just a few minutes .
How - to :
Sit on one end of a mat with your right hip touching a wall .
Lean back , turn to lie flat on the mat , and extend your legs up the wall ; your butt should be nearly touching the wall and your legs should be together .
Put your hands on your belly or rest them on the mat above your head .
Close your eyes , relax your jaw , and drop your chin slightly .
Breathe deeply and slowly in this position for 3 to 10 minutes .
Clothes make the man .
Naked people have little or no influence on society ~ Mark Twain
Perhaps you ’ve heard the following :
“ The days of wearing a suit are gone . ”
“ Casual Friday ?
It ’s casual week around here .
No one cares how you dress . ”
“ Appearances are irrelevant , only results matter . ”
All of these statements ignore the fact that people have and will continue to judge you by your appearance .
The harsh reality is that we make decisions about people within the first 3 seconds of meeting them ; we then spend the next 90 seconds trying to confirm our first impressions .
This means that before you even open your mouth you ’ve been sized up and profiled .
Knowing this , a person should always dress neatly , professionally , and appropriately .
The fact is you never know who you are going to meet ; at anytime you may run into a potential client , a future employer , or for those singles out there , the love of your life .
And like it or not , they are going to form their initial impression of you based off of how you look .
Over the next few months I ’m going to be writing quite a few articles on men ’s style and grooming .
But before getting started , I wanted to make the case for why you should care about your personal appearance .
We live in a society that overall tends to dress down ; our national uniform is a pair of jeans and t- shirt .
If you care about your appearance and take action to improve it , you will stand out from the crowd .
But that ’s not a bad thing .
How Your Personal Appearance Affects You
The transformation effect
One of the powers of clothing is that it can transform an individual ’s state of mind .
Dress like a professional businessman and you ’re more likely to act like a professional businessman .
Taking a test soon ?
Students report that they perform better when they dress - up for an exam .
Feeling sick in the morning ?
Women have used the power of dressing - up to shrug off sickness for years .
The transformative effect is powerful and instantly effective ; what ’s most amazing is that so few people use it .
Dressing professionally improves self discipline
From the Roman Legion to the United States Marine Corps , the world ’s finest militaries have known that sharp dressed soldiers are more disciplined than ragtag militias .
Military dress inspections have persisted not because shiny boots win wars , but because the exercise teaches a military force to pay attention to the details .
And it ’s in the details that battles are won .
In the same way , a person who dresses professionally learns the value of self discipline .
They learn that planning and allotting enough time are paramount for consistent results .
They prepare for the day by thinking through it , anticipating their needs , and taking the proper steps to ensure they can meet the challenge .
A disciplined dresser can arrange his outfit to meet his needs from 8 AM to midnight , from office to presentation to drinks after work .
Appreciation and respect
Properly clothing yourself takes time ; shirts need to be ironed , shoes shined , and jackets brushed .
Perhaps the greatest lesson this teaches is to respect the effort put forth by our fellow human beings .
When you meet another well dressed man you give him an extra measure of respect because of his outfit ; you notice the perfect dimple in his tie and appreciate it because it took you 15 minutes and 5 attempts to perfect your own .
Mutual respect between gentleman is garnered when they recognize the efforts each has put forth .
How Your Appearance Affects Others
The power of visuals
Numerous communication studies have demonstrated the power of visuals in human interaction .
Some studies have shown that visual cues are 3X to 5X as powerful as audio cues .
With clothing covering 90 % of your body , it ca n’t be stressed enough as to how important a role it plays in how you are perceived by others .
Want faster & better service in a restaurant ?
Look like you have money and wear a navy blazer .
Want to increase your chances for an A on a college presentation ?
Wear a sports jacket and pair of slacks .
Want instant credibility in a business environment ?
Wear a suit when making the pitch or meeting with management .
First impressions
Made within a few seconds , first impressions are powerful and should not be taken lightly .
We often observe a person before we speak with them , and being human we look to make sense of what our eyes are showing us .
Using our personal experiences , we categorize individuals ; we pick - up on a key feature that has meaning to us and then associate that person with it .
If what you are wearing is doing all the talking for you , make sure it is sending the message you want .
The power of colors and patterns
Colors and patterns are very powerful ; certain ones grab our attention , some accentuate our natural tones , and others affect our emotions .
When choosing colors and patterns a man should first understand which ones work for him and which ones do not .
Next , he needs to determine what message he wants to send .
A man decked out in a pin-striped navy blue suit , blue shirt with white contrasting collar and cuffs , and a red tie screams power and authority .
A man wearing a solid brown suit with an earth tone shirt and light colored tie signals trust and openness .
Both men were wearing suits , but two very different messages were being conveyed .
Influence and authority
Former San Francisco 49er Coach Mike Nolan fought to wear a business suit on the sidelines during football games .
One of the reasons for this was that he wanted to make it easy to spot the man in charge .
The men ’s suit , whose heritage stems from military garb , was designed to highlight a man ’s strengths .
When cut properly and made with a fabric that compliments the wearer , it signals authority and commands attention .
But this is only the tip of the iceberg – a policeman ’s uniform , an airline pilot ’s clothing , a doctor ’s white jacket – all of these garments assure us that the person we are dealing with is an authority in their field .
Positive assumptions
Well dressed people are given a leg up in many respects – they are often perceived as being smarter , funnier , and more enjoyable to be around .
Taking this a step further , dressing professionally can help you appear more important to the success of your company and may even help you hold onto your job .
Assuming all other factors being even , who does management let go – the technician who dresses well and can be put in front of a client or the guy who does n’t own a suit .
In this current economic downturn , every small detail matters .
Listen to our podcast with Antonio :
Is It Manly to Care About Your Appearance ?
A few examples of manly men who cared and continue to care about their appearance :
Dwayne Wade – Does an excellent wearing suits cut to compliment his height ; he also is very good at coordinating his pocket squares with his ties
Winston Churchill –
He loved the “ puff ” pocket square and knew how to wear a polka dot bow tie .
Sean Combs – P. Diddy has modernized classic style for a whole generation of young men .
He wears a 3 - piece suit masterfully , and pays homage to the great dressers before him .
His clothes add to his commanding presence and charismatic personality .
Ronald Reagan – Always dressed smartly in clean cut power suits that accentuated his shoulders ; he also loved cuff links .
Final Note
You should n’t judge a book by its cover , but in our fast paced society a book ’s cover can be just as important as its content .
Of course appearances are not everything ; you have to perform well to succeed .
But in a competitive world it pays to understand the importance of your clothing and grooming .
Investing the proper resources into your personal presentation will multiply your ability to succeed .

WASHINGTON , Jan. 12 ( UPI ) --
Record numbers of unemployment claims have overwhelmed computer systems in several states , a national association said .
Computer systems in California , New York Ohio , Michigan , Missouri , Colorado , Kentucky and North Carolina have crashed at some point in recent weeks under the onslaught of calls and Internet inquiries , USA Today reported Monday .

The unemployment rate leaped from 6.8 percent in November to 7.2 percent in December .
" We 've had the highest number of people filing unemployment claims in a single month , " said Kim Saylor Brannock , a spokeswoman at Kentucky 's Office of Employment and Training .
" Many states do not have the infrastructure in place to respond better to the crisis , " Richard Hobbie , executive director of the National Association of State Workforce Agencies told the newspaper .
Not a single state was spared an increase in claims the last week of December compared with the same period of 2007 .
Several states , including Missouri and Michigan , have added temporary workers to their processing centers .
The federal government allocates $ 2.45 billion for states to process claims this year , less than what states say they could use to upgrade current systems , Hobbie said .

The 76 - year - old patriarch of Pittsburgh 's most prominent family might have been forecasting the scene at frigid Heinz Field on Sunday night , as more than 65,000 fans representing Steeler Nation roared with approval during a boisterous celebration following a 23 - 14 victory against the Baltimore Ravens in the AFC Championship Game .
USA TODAY'S ALL - JOE TEAM : Honoring the less visible
Instead , Rooney was anticipating the inauguration of Barack Obama as the nation 's 44th — and first African - American — president .
Rooney flew to Washington on Monday for inaugural festivities , a personal detour on the road to the Super Bowl .
" It was terrific to be there to talk to my friend , the president — wow , I can say it now , " Rooney said after returning to work Tuesday .
" This is a great time .
The Super Bowl is our ultimate goal .
With the inauguration on top of that , it could n't be better . "
Rooney presented Obama with a game ball from the AFC title game and is flattered that , amid the whirlwind of his transition to power , the new president has kept tabs on the Steelers .
" He was n't able to watch , but he said he was following the game on his cellphone , " Rooney said .
The football lifer and fledgling world leader have struck up quite a connection .
While the Steelers navigated the NFL 's toughest schedule to earn a chance to win a record sixth Super Bowl , the life - long Republican switched sides and joined the cause for a more profound chapter of history as he vigorously campaigned for Obama .
In addition to hosting a political fundraiser at his North Side home , Rooney hit the trail through Pennsylvania , a state Obama would carry in the general election , and in parts of Ohio and West Virginia .
He found himself stumping with governors and former Steelers Franco Harris and Jerome Bettis alike — in the name of Obama fever .
Besides lending support to his son Jim 's failed bid to win a state Senate seat in 2001 , it was the first time Rooney went public with his politics .
This , while in the midst of a family battle for control of the franchise .
That critical business issue was resolved in December with Rooney and his son , Art II , buying 64 % of the franchise 's ownership stakes from Rooney 's four brothers for $ 750 million .
Unusual foray into politics
On myriad fronts , Rooney is on a hot winning streak .
" We probably made 50 speeches , " Rooney said of his campaign treks to towns such as McKeesport , Altoona and Johnstown , Pa .
" It was one of those things where you could see that you were being listened to .
The biggest thing I said to people was , ' Hey , this is a chance of a lifetime .
You 've got to back him . ' "
Mixing sports and politics has its risks , and with Jim managing his father 's involvement , there were attempts to keep Rooney 's political action separate from the Steelers .
That was nearly impossible , given that for all of his civic contributions , Rooney is first and foremost identified as the head of the football team .
If lines were n't blurred by a campaign bus tour called the Steel Blitz for Barack , there was no denying association when Rooney introduced Obama at a rally at Mellon Arena in Pittsburgh in October .
As Rooney presented Obama with a black Steelers jersey , a familiar mantra echoed : " Here we go Steelers , here we go . "
" There was some backlash , " Rooney said , referring primarily to letters and e-mails from Steelers fans .
" It was significant , but it was n't that meaningful .
People wrote , ' What are you doing this for ? '
They were mad about me giving him a jersey .
But Hillary ( Clinton ) got a jersey .
( John ) McCain got a jersey .
I wanted to make sure he got one , too . "
Rooney began to warm to Obama after watching his acceptance speech following the Iowa caucus Jan. 3 , 2008 .
He became more convinced after scoring Obama a clear - cut winner in the first Democratic debate .
He became compelled to endorse Obama publicly in April , after visiting privately for nearly an hour with the then - Illinois Senator .
He said he later became just as impressed with Michelle Obama , whom he worked with on the fundraiser .
Beyond strong family values , Rooney believes Obama is best - equipped to confront challenges such as the protection and creation of jobs and making health care more accessible .
He speaks glowingly of Obama 's ability to energize young voters , and compares the new president to John F. Kennedy .
Asked to recall the most critical theme he wanted to express at the rallies , Rooney said , " He is just like all of you people .
A regular person .
He is the best person for the job . "
That sentiment reflects Rooney 's philosophy in a nutshell .
He 's the only owner in the NFL with a policy named in his behalf , the Rooney Rule , which was instituted in 2003 .
It stipulates that teams with a head coaching vacancy must interview at least one minority candidate .
The Steelers ' second - year coach , Mike Tomlin , is an example of how the policy can increase opportunity .
Tomlin , previously the Minnesota Vikings defensive coordinator , was a long - shot candidate before interviewing .
He now has a chance to become the second African - American head coach to win a Super Bowl .
The first , Tony Dungy , who retired last week as Indianapolis Colts coach , is a former Steelers player who broke into the NFL coaching ranks with the team .
" If the rule had any other name , it would n't be fair to Mr. Rooney , " says John Wooten , chairman of the Fritz Pollard Alliance , which promotes minority hiring in the NFL .
" We would not have gotten to this point without an owner with the influence and power that he has , pushing for change . "
That Rooney , who took over as team president in 1975 and handed those reins to Art II in 2002 , is so influential in league matters is expected .
He 's been one of the league 's foremost movers and shakers for years on a wide range of issues .
It is the substance behind his August 2000 induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame .
But the foray into politics stunned people close to Rooney .
" We did n't see it coming , " says Art Rooney II , Dan 's oldest son and president of the Steelers .
" My father 's never been a politically active person .
But he saw something that struck a chord , and he really got passionate about it . "
' He told me he was a Bears fan '
Not everyone was surprised that Obama 's socially - significant campaign would attract a man like Rooney .
" This organization does n't see color , " says Steelers linebacker Larry Foote .
" They give people a chance .
That 's who they are .
You can see that in our building , with a mixture of people from every background . "
In some regards , Rooney indeed sees color .
He knocked on many doors in black neighborhoods during the campaign and was well - received , but given the mission to swing voters , he says , " I talked mostly to white people . "
Rooney is not physically imposing .
He is perhaps 5 - 7 and weighs less than 150 pounds .
Longtime Steelers observers , though , maintain he is better defined by his energy and passion , his resilience and fortitude .
Despite hip problems , Rooney still occasionally walks to Heinz Field from his home when the weather is mild .
A licensed pilot , he still flies a small , single - engine plane .
To illustrate the essence of his father , Art II recalled the emergency landing that Rooney made in 2002 after losing power during a short flight from the Steelers ' training camp in Latrobe , Pa .
Flying solo , Rooney could n't crank the landing gear manually .
He landed the plane on its belly in a grass field , and was uninjured .
Rooney scoffed at suggestions from family that he should give up his hobby .
" Sometimes , he gets obsessed with things , " Art says .
" But when he decides he 's going after something , he 's going at it full - tilt .
Even this flying thing .
As he 's gotten older , we 've said , ' Maybe it 's time not to take this so seriously . '
But he 's bound and determined .
He gets his 100 hours of flight time every year . "
There was one concession : Rooney promised his family he would stop flying solo .
Yet metaphorically , he 's done just that in some regards in the political sense .
Rooney was the only NFL owner wearing an Obama pin on his lapel at league meetings .
" Most owners in pro sports are supporters of the Republican party for economic reasons , " says longtime agent Leigh Steinberg , who represents Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger .
" But Dan Rooney is fairly unique .
This reflects a great integrity to stand up for his principles . "
Even so , Rooney said it was not easy to reconcile differences with Obama .
A devout Catholic , Rooney is staunchly anti-abortion .
It fueled the most intense criticism , he says , of his endorsement of Obama .
" I did not support him on that issue , " Rooney said .
" People really came after me on it . …
But I do n't think I lost my integrity over this .
This was not about a single issue . "
On an overwhelming number of issues , Rooney solidly agreed with Obama .
Another difference : " He told me he was a Bears fan , " Rooney says .
" Now that 's an honest guy . "
Rooney has allowed himself to dream a bit further .
He realizes the irony that with a victory against the Arizona Cardinals on Feb. 1 , the Steelers could become the first Super Bowl champions to visit the White House during the Obama administration .
THE HUDDLE : Tomlin awed by possible meeting with Obama
" Yeah , I 've thought about that , " Rooney said .
" That would be a great time . "
It would also mark a full - circle measure of Rooney 's fate .
Abstract
One of the most novel features in the functional programming language Haskell is the system of type classes used to support a combination of overloading and polymorphism .
Current implementations of type class overloading are based on the use of dictionary values , passed as extra parameters to overloaded functions .
Unfortunately , this can have a significant effect on run-time performance , for example , by reducing the effectiveness of important program analyses and optimizations .
This paper describes how a simple partial evaluator can be used to avoid the need for dictionary values at run-time by generating specialized versions of overloaded functions .
This eliminates the run-time costs of overloading .
Furthermore , and somewhat surprisingly given the presence of multiple versions of some functions , for all of the examples that we have tried so far , specialization actually leads to a reduction in the size of compiled programs .

Gordon Brown has defended his handling of the economic downturn , saying the government " must play its role " .
Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show , the prime minister said 2009 would be " challenging and difficult " .
But he insisted he was right to use fiscal policy to secure the economy - his priority this year .
Mr Brown also said he was not thinking about calling an election .
The Conservatives have accused the government of " headline grabbing " .
The prime minister said he wanted to see a return to banks doing what they should be - " lending " - and did not rule out the need for further bank bail - outs in the future .
But he said : " I do n't think that 's the first thing anybody would think about at the moment . "
That comment was echoed later by the chancellor , who told BBC Radio 4 that further re-capitalisation would not be his " first port of call " .
Alistair Darling said talks were continuing with the banks about steps to encourage more lending .
In October , the government announced that it would inject £ 37bn into three of the UK's biggest names - Royal Bank of Scotland , Lloyds TSB and HBOS - to secure their futures .
Job creation Mr Brown was asked about government plans to bring forward £ 10bn of spending on public works , digital technology and environmental projects .
He said the programme would create 100,000 jobs , helping to curb rising unemployment and enabling the economy to stabilise .
We are going to make sure that through this downturn , people will be protected
Gordon Brown
" We are not going to do what happened in previous recessions and allow people to go under , " he said .
Some 30,000 jobs are to be created in school repairs in an attempt to help private construction firms who have suffered in the economic downturn .
When pressed about whether a general election could be called in 2009 , Mr Brown said : " It is the furthest thing from my mind .
My duty in these circumstances is to do everything I can to help people now .
" We are going to make sure that through this downturn , people will be protected . "
No ' defeatism '
Defending his intervention in the economy , the prime minister said : " If the monetary system is not working as well as it should ; if there 's no likelihood of huge inflation in the next period of time ; if you are not crowding - out private investment then government must play its role . "
He urged voters to give his policies time to take effect , saying : " I do not think you can judge the success of recapitalisation by what happened in one month .
" You have got to judge it as a necessary means by which , by saving the banks - and saving is the right word - we restore the ability to fund businesses and mortgages . "
He said the length of the current crisis would depend on the amount of international co-operation and he had high hopes for the forthcoming G20 summit in London .
Insisting he would not accept " defeatism " , he added : " Things are going to go right because we are going to take the action that is necessary . "
As a nation we have run out of cash
Chris Grayling
Shadow work and pensions secretary Asked whether that action could include cutting interest rates down to 0 % in a bid to stimulate the economy , Mr Brown said that was a matter for the Governor of the Bank of England .
However , he did say that falling interest rates helped to drive up inflation , something he wanted to avoid .
Last month , the US Federal Reserve slashed its interest rates to 0 % in an attempt to revive the American economy .
' Little substance '
The Conservatives have criticised the government 's approach to tackling the downturn and the cut in VAT to boost spending .
HAVE YOUR SAY
We need to concentrate on supporting the wealth creating private sector Benny , London Shadow work and pensions secretary Chris Grayling said he was extremely sceptical about the announcements which were " headline grabbing " with " very little substance " .
" As a nation we have run out of cash , we 've got a debt crisis and the things the government said it would do to try to tackle these difficulties are just not working , " he told the BBC .
" The reality is it 's only a month since the government delayed its biggest public works project - the project to build new aircraft carriers - because it said it had run out of money , " he added .
The Liberal Democrat 's treasury spokesman Vincent Cable said Mr Brown 's proposals were similar to their own but he was not convinced they would be implemented properly .
He also said the plan to create 100,000 jobs was coming as perhaps a million were going to be lost .
" The key point is to make sure the banks are lending again , " he said .
" The problems are in part because of a paralysis with decision making because they are being set contradictory objectives . "
The prime minister is to tour the country this week before a jobs summit involving government , business and unions .

On the heels of announcing its plans to bail on Macworld Expo next year , Apple will be instead attending the more generic Consumer Electronics Show in 2010 , according to sources familiar with the matter .
The blogosphere has been passionately arguing both for and against an Apple appearance at CES , which is held in Las Vegas rather than Macworld Expo's San Francisco .
Sources close to the company have indicated to AppleInsider that the move is a done deal , a remarkable turn of events given that CES has long been dominated by Microsoft 's product announcements issued in keynotes delivered by Bill Gates and now by CEO Steve Ballmer .
Macworld vs CES
Over the last few years , Apple 's announcements at Macworld Expo have overshadowed Microsoft 's at CES , as the Cupertino powerhouse released blockbuster products such as the iPhone and climbed to dominate the digital media future of online music , video , and now mobile software sales in iTunes .
In contrast , Microsoft has announced a string of products that either never materialized , were grossly impractical , or have sold poorly and received bad reviews , from Spot watches to Mira terminals to Windows Vista to Windows Home Server to the Surface to Zune .
The remainder of CES tends to be little more than electronics firms showing off slightly larger TVs .
Given that Apple has the capacity to blow out the lights at CES during Macworld Expo , why would it choose to abandon its own party and join one held in honor of Microsoft ?
It 's certainly not the timing of the event , as CES is typically held at the same time or at least within a week or two of Macworld .
One of the key reasons Apple appeared ready to leave Macworld was because of the pressure to impress consumers and shareholders with sensational new product announcements just after it had sold through its blockbuster holiday sales .
Microsoft has typically made announcements at CES for products that are slated to appear later in the year or perhaps years out into the future , while Apple 's Macworld unveilings tend to be available immediately or within a month or two .
All things considered , it would appear that Apple 's participation at CES would be no better than Macworld for Apple , and additionally involve greater traveling expenses and expose the company to greater competition for media attention .
Apple ready for a challenge
However , that challenge is apparently just what Apple is looking for as it branches out from its past as a computer hardware company into a full consumer electronics firm with significant software products , leadership in digital media sales , and even a toe in the water of mobile gaming with the iPod touch and iPhone .
Attendance at CES would directly contrast Apple 's offerings with Microsoft's , the company most closely matched to Apple 's future aspirations .
Over the last three years of Macworld and CES , Apple 's Mac OS X Tiger and then Leopard were pitted against Windows Vista ; then the iPhone directly challenged Windows Mobile ; Apple 's iPod and iTunes empire roundly trounced efforts by Microsoft to spread Windows Media DRM , sell its Zune music player , and expand into the digital living room ; and Apple has even started making inroads against Microsoft Office with its iWork suite and its new iWork.com cloud collaboration service .
Windows enthusiast pundits have recently grown unable to seriously belittle Apple in comparison to Microsoft , but a direct contrast of the two company 's efforts at CES would make the differences even more impossible to ignore .
Apple could also directly contrast its offerings against other competing CES exhibitors ( such as Palm ) , as well as benefit from Mac , iPod , and iPhone ecosystem partners who would help tint the PC - centric event in Apple - savvy colors .
Not just speculation
While the web lights up with various opinions on the plausibility of Apple attending CES , AppleInsider has obtained first hand , credible reports that the news is true , corroborating a rumor story published by Ed Sutherland of the Cult of Mac.
CES officials were said to have informed some exhibitors about the matter before the start of this year 's show , indicating that next year 's CES will have a section reserved for Mac - oriented exhibitors .
The source noted that Apple " wants to sit amongst its competition , " rather than being isolated at its own event .
Such a development would mirror Apple 's efforts to move from PowerPC to Intel processors , its iPhone retail expansion plans with WalMart , and other strategies to raise the profile of its products while selling to a wider audience .
However , even with participation by Apple , the days of electronics trade shows such as CES appear to be numbered .
The group canceled its summer event just as IDG killed the summer Macworld Expo , and sister events such as COMDEX , Seybold , and the E3 gaming convention have also fizzled over the last decade .
Apple also recently pulled out of NAB , fueling excited rumors that it might sell of its Final Cut suite of Pro Apps .
While trade shows in general have waned in importance with the rise of the Internet , Apple has funneled its resources into building its own Worldwide Developer 's Convention into a record setting , sold out event .
The company has the capacity to generate significant media attention at any time simply by announcing a press event of its own .
Phil Schiller also noted in this year 's Macworld keynote that Apple 's retail stores host far more visitors every year than a series of Macworld events ever could .
OTTAWA
A quick straw poll of political insiders reveals that every federal party is quietly preparing for another election .
Within parliamentary circles the notion that Canadians will head back to the polls for a fourth time in five years before the end of 2009 is widely treated as a foregone conclusion .
Significantly , the feeling that the 40th Parliament could be history before it has had a real chance to make history runs just as rampant within the government as it does within the ranks of the opposition parties .
Yet the odds that Stephen Harper 's Conservatives will produce a budget later this month that the Liberals will not be able to support have also been going down with every passing day .
The government can't afford to earn a second consecutive failing grade on the budget front .
Lost in the shuffle of the year - end parliamentary crisis is the fact that Finance Minister Jim Flaherty 's November fiscal update was panned by the bulk of the economic community .
The disconnect between the severity of the ongoing economic storm and the levity of the Conservative fiscal message went a long way to embolden the opposition parties into seeking to replace the government with a coalition of their own .
A governing party that risks going to the electorate with its flank open to accusations of dereliction on the economic front would have to be suicidal these days .
In the same spirit , the Liberals would have every reason to find grounds to support a constructive budget , especially one endorsed by a blue - ribbon advisory panel that includes some of their own .
Ironically , the prospect of a popular Conservative budget only acts as an accelerant on the election flames .
That 's because the opposition suspects the Conservatives are preparing for war even as they overtly seek peace , by crafting a budget designed to become the stepping stone to a spring campaign .
Having consolidated their advantage in public opinion with a well - received budget , they would be free to engineer their defeat on an issue of their own choosing later in the session .
The parliamentary dysfunction that the government has recreated in the early days of its second mandate would go a long way toward that particular objective .
Although they have not said so in so many words , the Bloc Québécois and the NDP have essentially reverted to their pre-election mantra that under virtually no circumstance will they prop up Harper 's minority government .
If there is a community of interest between the Conservatives , the NDP and the Bloc at this point , it is in bringing the Liberals to an election battle before the party has had time to regroup under a new leader .
Gilles Duceppe , in particular , has no cause to give Michael Ignatieff time to find his footing .
Many Quebecers readily supported the notion of an opposition coalition last month – not for the influential support role it afforded the Bloc , but because it would have paved the way to the replacement of a Conservative government they have grown to dislike by a more progressive one .
There is mounting anecdotal evidence that Ignatieff has a potential audience in Quebec , as long as he can rebuild a party infrastructure in time for the next campaign .
Of all the volatile elements in the federal mix , the Conservative lead in the polls has become the main reason why a 2009 federal election seems preordained .
Should that lead evaporate , Canadians could yet be spared a return to the polls this year .

They tied up the boy 's mother and her fiancé and ransacked the house before kidnapping the boy when no money was found , they said .
Do n't Miss KVVU : Missing boy case involves drugs
In a story published Friday , The Las Vegas Review - Journal quoted unnamed sources as saying a member of the boy 's family owes a Mexican drug cartel between $ 8 million and $ 20 million , describing the relative as an alleged money launderer for the cartel and saying the person was in hiding .
A search for the boy spans much of the American Southwest , and a nationwide Amber Alert was in effect .
Cole is described as being 3 feet 11 inches tall and weighing 48 pounds , with blond hair and blue eyes .
He was wearing a sweatshirt , dark jeans and silver - rimmed prescription glasses , authorities said .

Texas town says goodbye to ' hello '
KINGSVILLE , Texas ( AP ) --
In this friendly little ranching town , " hello " is wearing out its welcome .
And Leonso Canales Jr. is happy as heck .
At his urging , the Kleberg County commissioners on Monday unanimously designated " heaven - o " as the county 's official greeting .
The reason : " hello " contains the word " hell . "
" When you go to school and church , they tell you ' hell ' is negative and ' heaven ' is positive , ' " said the 56 - year - old Canales , who owns the Kingsville Flea Market .
" I think it 's time that we set a new precedent , to tell our kids that we are positive adults . "
The new salutation , according to the county resolution , is a " symbol of peace , friendship and welcome " in this " age of anxiety . "
On Thursday , courthouse employees were answering the phones , " heaven -o . "
And the chamber of commerce was working on a campaign promoting Kingsville , a Rio Grande Valley town of 25,000 , as a " heavenly " place to visit .
" People seem to think that it might catch on , " said county Judge Pete De La Garza .
Not everyone is a convert to Kleberg County 's heavenly ways .
Madolyn Musick , who runs a bookstore , insisted , and linguists would agree , that " hello " has nothing to do with " hell . "
Besides , she added , " What 's wrong with , ' Howdy , y'all ? ' "
Canales , a Catholic but not a regular churchgoer , has been as serious as heck about " hello " since 1988 , when he told his brother he might start greeting people with " God-o . "
His brother suggested " heaven - o " instead .
David Sabrio , a professor of English at Texas A&M ; University - Kingsville , noted that the Oxford English Dictionary says " hello " stems from an old German greeting for hailing a boat .
" Linguistically and historically , the word ' hello ' has no connection at all with what we associate with the underworld , " he said .
" People may make that connection in their own mind .
I certainly do n't . "

Is Roland Burris armed ?
It 's hard to tell , given the putative gun control advocate 's record of saying one thing about gun ownership and doing another .
" A longtime advocate of a national handgun ban , Burris organized Chicago ’s first Gun Turn - In Day in 1993 , " the Tribune 's Steve Chapman recalls .
" But when he ran for governor the following year , he admitted that he owned a handgun ( ‘ for protection ’ ) and did not hand it over to police as he urged others to do . ”
The incident gave ammunition - no pun intended - to gun control detractors and , as Jim Geraghty points out at the National Review Online , made its way into a 1996 book called Politically Correct Guns :
" Illinois Attorney General Roland Burris was a major promoter of the 1993 Gun Turn - In Day in Chicago .
" He was also a candidate for nomination as Governor of Illinois in 1994 .
" Then the Chicago Tribune caught him with his handgun still at home .
" The Trib ran a story noting that while Attorney General Burris persuaded others to turn in their guns , he had somehow failed to persuade himself to do likewise .
" When asked why he did n't turn in his own gun , Burris told members of the Tribune 's editorial board : ' I just did n't get around to doing it ' . "
Which is true .
From the Tribune 's original reporting in 1994 :
" Give up your guns .
" That was the message Atty .
Gen. Roland Burris preached last fall when he pushed Chicago 's first Gun Turn - In Day .
It was the same message he delivered 10 years ago while running for the U.S. Senate .
" Apparently the pitch was n't entirely convincing .
On Wednesday , Burris , one of three major contenders for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination , acknowledged he still keeps a handgun in his South Side home .
" Last October , Burris organized Chicago 's first Gun Turn - In Day , when the chance to get free White Sox or Bulls tickets persuaded the owners of 142 firearms - handguns , automatic rifles , even a double - barrel , sawed - off shotgun - to give up their weapons .
" Asked Wednesday why he did n't join those gun owners , Burris told members of the Tribune 's editorial board : ' I just did n't get around to doing it . '
" While Chicago now prohibits handgun ownership , Burris ' gun was legally registered before the ban went into effect .
" ' It 's a little , small thing .
I just have it there for safety , ' he said at the time .
If I ban them , I 'm going to be the first one to burn mine . '
" Spokesmen for the other two leading Democratic candidates , Cook County Board President Richard Phelan and Comptroller Dawn Clark Netsch , said they did not own firearms . "
A day after the Tribune story in 1994 , Burris reportedly turned in a pistol .
" It 's a small handgun that he ( got ) for protection some years ago .
He simply had forgotten about it , " Burris spokesman Don Rashid said at the time .
End of story ?
Not quite .
Last summer , the Sun-Timesreported this :
" Only 25 people have taken advantage of Chicago 's four - month gun registration amnesty , including former Attorney General Roland Burris . "
According to the Tribune , Burris was " storing a gun in Decatur because he forgot to renew his registration . . .
The engraved shotgun was given to Burris by Illinois State Police when Burris left office . "
Given his record , let 's hope Burris does n't forget to double - check his luggage before he tries to fly to Washington .

The role of mistakes in language learning by Tomasz P. Szynalski © Tomasz P. Szynalski , Antimoon.com
Of all the advice on Antimoon , “ Do not make mistakes ” is by far the most controversial .
Hardly a month goes by without an e-mail or forum post from an angered English teacher , letting me know how stupid I am for telling learners to avoid mistakes .
Do n’t I realize that mistakes are a necessary element of all learning ?
Have n’t I heard the phrase “ learn from your mistakes ” ?
And why am I scaring learners into silence ?
With this article , I hope to clear up the confusion once and for all .
Are mistakes good or bad ?
Let me say something obvious first : mistakes are bad .
If one had a choice between saying a sentence correctly and saying it with a mistake , nobody in their right mind would choose saying it with a mistake — and no teacher would recommend that .
Similarly , no teacher would give a higher grade to a student who made more mistakes than another one .
The reason teachers sometimes say that mistakes should n’t be avoided is that they believe one of two things ( or both ) :
That mistakes are an inseparable part of the learning process ; therefore , the only way to avoid language mistakes would be to avoid speaking and writing in a foreign language , and that would be bad .
( the “ Mistakes are inevitable ” group )
That making mistakes , and having them corrected , is a good way to learn a language .
( the “ Mistakes are good ” group )
Let ’s take a look at each of these beliefs : “ Mistakes are an inseparable part of the language learning process ”
One of the most frequently repeated pieces of business advice is that to succeed in business , you have to try many different things , until one of them finally works .
Even huge corporations often release unprofitable products despite spending enormous amounts of money on market research .
That ’s because it is impossible to tell with 100 % certainty whether customers will buy a product until it hits the shelves .
These examples teach us that in “ unknown ” areas like scientific research and marketing , mistakes are truly inevitable .
Where no one can predict what will work , people who try and fail have a higher probability of success than those who are doing nothing for fear of failure .
Think of Thomas Edison , who had to test over 6,000 unsuitable materials for light bulb filaments until he found one that worked .
Are there any other situations where mistakes are necessary ?
Let ’s take learning to swim .
Swimming is not an “ unknown ” area .
There is no mystery in it .
Everybody can watch slow - motion videos of Michael Phelps and see how it should be done .

The problem here is that there is a long way between knowing how to swim and doing it yourself .
It takes hours of training to develop the right reflexes : putting your head under water at just the right moment , synchronizing your legs and your arms , breathing in and breathing out , etc .
The process involves many mistakes ; in fact , as a beginner , almost everything you do is wrong .
Are mistakes costly ?
You bet .
Every swimming coach knows that mistakes can easily turn into bad habits , which are difficult to unlearn .
When you fail in business , you lose money .
These are the costs of mistakes .
But you have to accept them , because there is no other way to succeed in business and in swimming .
What about language learning ?
Now let ’s take a look at language learning .
It ’s obvious that learning a language is not an “ unknown ” area like research or marketing .
No one is asking learners to invent anything ( indeed , they should not invent their own grammar and vocabulary ) — they just need to do things exactly the way the native speakers do it .
Language learning is not like learning to swim , either .
In swimming , you can remember very well how your coach moves his arms , but still be unable to re-create that motion .
Knowing the right way is not enough .
You need to train your muscles to react in a certain way , which is a long , error - prone process .
First you make a lot of mistakes , then fewer and fewer , until you are error - free .
By contrast , in languages , knowing the right way is enough .
If you can remember and understand a sentence in a foreign language , you can repeat it without any mistakes .
If you remember two correct sentences , you can transform and combine them into another correct sentence .
There is little room for mistakes .
Now of course things are a bit more complicated than that :
If you are just beginning to write or speak in a foreign language , it will perhaps take you 30 seconds to produce each sentence ( you will make a lot of edits or , if you ’re speaking , you will stutter and start over ) .
That ’s because it can take a long time to recall things , especially if they are not in your “ active memory ” .
But even if you ’re slow , your sentence can be error - free or almost error - free as long as you are careful .
and ) .
That ’s because it can take a long time to things , especially if they are not in your “ active memory ” .
But even if you ’re slow , your sentence can be error - free or almost error - free as long as you are careful .
As noted before , the key to producing correct sentences is remembering correct examples .
To build your own sentences in a foreign language , you need thousands of words , hundreds of grammatical structures and dozens of idioms .
Furthermore , you must know which words are used in what contexts .
For example , end can mean stop ( e.g . “ We must end the project ” ) , but you cannot say “ I have decided to end seeing her ” ( you must say : “ I have decided to stop seeing her ” ) .
There are thousands of “ exceptions ” like that in any language .
So , although there is only a short way between theory and practice , the theory is huge .
However — and this is crucial — the theory can be acquired without producing mistakes ( by reading and listening ) .
Although following correct examples is not hard , there can be some problems .
One is that certain information is difficult to notice .
For example , if you do n’t read English texts carefully , you may ignore the use of articles ( a / the ) , as they are not necessary to understand the meaning .
As a result , information on article usage will be missing from your memory and your correctness will suffer .
A smaller problem is related to “ unexpected exceptions ” .
Some usage patterns are so rare that it is very difficult to learn them , even with massive input .
For instance , “ I ’d like to see The Simpsons ” is correct if you mean the movie , but wrong if you mean the TV show ( in that case , you ’re supposed to say “ I ’d like to watch The Simpsons ” ) .
Differences like that are really hard to learn , even if you read a lot .
There is one area of language learning where “ knowing the right way ” does not immediately translate into “ doing it the right way ” : pronunciation .
You can spend hours listening to a native speaker saying a word , and still be unable to repeat it properly .
In fact , learning to pronounce the sounds of a new language is very much like learning to swim — your brain and your muscles have to get used to new movements .
The process takes time and involves many mistakes .
What have we learned so far ?
First of all , that not all learning is trial - and - error learning .
In particular , language learning is possible with few mistakes because :
It does not require innovation or creativity .
All you need to do is copy other people ( native speakers ) .
The gap between “ knowing how it should be done ” and “ doing the right thing ” is small .
Once you have enough correct examples in your memory , it is relatively easy to transform and combine them into your own sentences .
You need a lot of correct examples to speak a foreign language , but they can be acquired without mistakes .
“ Making mistakes is a good way to learn a language ”
We have seen that language learning can happen with few mistakes .
But why should it ?
Is n’t speaking and writing with mistakes an effective way to learn a foreign language ?
After all , “ practice makes perfect ” , does n’t it ?
Those who believe mistakes are a good way to learn probably picture the following model :
The learner says a sentence , makes some mistakes , the teacher corrects them , and the learner memorizes the proper way to say the sentence .
Next time around , the learner will hopefully make fewer mistakes .
The process is repeated until the learner is error - free .
Now , why does n’t this model work so well ?
It ’s too slow Language learning is a very memory - intensive task .
There is a staggering number of words , phrases , structures , and subtle differences in usage to memorize .
Some verbs take the infinitive ( e.g. cease to do something ) , some take the gerund ( e.g. stop doing something ) .
We get in the car , but on the bus .
My copy of Michael Swan ’s Practical English Usage has 654 pages of examples like these and it does not cover everything I know about English .
( In contrast , all the information you need to swim perfectly can probably be written on a few pages ; the rest is a matter of practice . )
It is obvious that an efficient language learning method must somehow supply all this information to the learner .
In other words , the learner needs a huge number of correct examples of the target language .
In the feedback - based method , he gets correct examples when the teacher corrects him ( and tells him how to say something ) and when he listens to his own speech ( and his sentences are correct ) .
The problem is that the flow of information is too slow .
When you speak in a language you do n’t know well , you speak slowly , with many pauses .
Before you open your mouth , you have to think what to say .
Often , in the middle of the sentence , you start over when you realize you ’ve made a mistake .
There are also delays due to teacher - student interaction .
All this means that the amount of correct language that reaches the learner ’s ears is quite small .
I did an informal experiment to measure this .
First , I read a simplified German book for 15 minutes , using the “ pause and think ” method ( paying attention to grammar and usage ) .
I managed to read 55 sentences ( 476 words ) before the time ran out .
Then , I recorded myself talking about the story for 15 minutes .
I constructed 21 German sentences ( 196 words ) .
In terms of the sheer amount of input you get , 4 language classes per week ( 45 minutes each ) would be equivalent to reading a book for 74 minutes .
That ’s about 10 minutes a day , 7 days a week .
A whole school year ( 9 months ) of classes ( 4 classes per week ) provides about the same amount of input as a single 250 - page book ( 84,000 words ) .
Of course , these rough estimates assume classes where students speak all the time — in real classes , a great deal of time is simply wasted ; a little time is also spent on pure input ( reading a short article in the coursebook , listening to a short recording ) .
It requires a competent teacher As the method is based on errors and feedback , it requires a competent feedback - giver .
It is not clear where the learner is supposed to find such a person outside of the classroom .
If he tries to interact with native speakers in real life or on the Internet , he will find that native speakers generally wo n’t correct his mistakes , as long as they can understand him .
So grammar like this ( example by Johnny ) is likely to go unchallenged outside of the classroom : that not truthful really , i now am answer and express my thinking , and you understand myself on this replying , i am no doubt about it , but if you do n’t correct my false words in this post then i keep practice false english and means i am learn this crap english .
The learner can of course “ stick to the classroom ” , but making any real progress will require more than 8 classes a week .
Such intensive courses are quite expensive and impractical for someone who has to go to work , school or college .
It seems that a method based on “ free ” reading and listening will be both cheaper and more flexible .
Finally , there is also the problem of finding good teachers .
While I have so far assumed that teacher feedback is perfect , the reality is that teachers will ignore many mistakes due to insufficient attention , knowledge or time .
Non-native teachers will sometimes object to correct sentences , or their “ corrections ” may be wrong themselves .
My experience in the Polish educational system shows that very few non-native teachers are a reliable source of correct input ( not to mention pronunciation , which is a typical Achilles ’ heel ) .
It can reinforce mistakes Every time you say an incorrect sentence , your brain gets used to it , and it becomes more likely that you will make the same mistake again .
We are all familiar with the “ fossilized ” English learner who always says things like
He make , She work , and no amount of corrections seems to help .
This is what happens when you ’ve been listening to your own version of English grammar for a long time .
Therefore , the output - based learning method actually contains two feedback loops :
When the teacher corrects you and you try to remember that a given phrase is wrong ( this correction will not always occur ) .
Whenever you say an incorrect sentence .
The second effect ( reinforcement ) is probably weaker than the first one ( correction ) , but it further slows down learning methods that are based on speaking .
If a learner spends most of his time listening to bad grammar ( produced by himself and other students ) , and he gets little other input , one cannot expect good results .
Final word Language learning does not have to be based on speaking , mistakes , and repeated correction .
Indeed , if your goal is good English — that is , if you want to be able to speak and write in English with few mistakes and understand English - language television — the feedback - based method is the wrong way to do it .
It builds your knowledge very slowly and depends on a good instructor .
As a result , only intensive , long - term courses with competent teachers can give satisfactory results , but these are very expensive and very impractical .
The alternative — input - based learning ( more specifically , the Antimoon Method ) — does not rely on mistakes and corrections .
It gives you more information in less time and enables you to build your English whenever you want to , for as long as you want .
On the other hand , it requires that you enjoy reading books in English or watching English - language programs , and that you apply the principles of careful reading and writing .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
An unpublished federal draft report depicts the U.S. - led reconstruction of Iraq as a $ 100 billion failure doomed by bureaucratic infighting , ignorance of basic elements of Iraqi society and waves of violence there , The New York Times reported in its Sunday editions .

The Pentagon issued inflated progress reports to cover up the reconstruction ’s failure once the effort began to lag , according to the Times , which received copies of the document from two people who had read the draft but were not authorized to comment publicly about it .
Former Secretary of State Colin Powell is cited as saying , for example , that in the months after the 2003 invasion the Defense Department “ kept inventing numbers of Iraqi security forces -- the number would jump 20,000 a week !
‘ We now have 80,000 , we now have 100,000 , we now have 120,000 . ’ ”
Powell ’s contention was supported by both the former ground troops commander in Iraq , Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez , and L. Paul Bremer , the civilian administrator before the Iraqi government takeover in June 2004 .
Powell declined to comment on his quoted remarks , the Times said .
The report , “ Hard Lessons : The Iraq Reconstruction Experience , ” was compiled by the Office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction , led by Stuart Bowen Jr. , a Republican lawyer who visits Iraq often and maintains a staff of engineers and auditors there , the newspaper said .
It was based on some 500 interviews and more than 600 audits , inspections and investigations on which Bowen ’s office has reported for years .
Bowen ’s deputy , Ginger Cruz , declined to comment to the newspaper on the substance of the history , but said it would be presented on February 2 at the first hearing of the Commission on Wartime Contracting , created by Democrat - sponsored legislation .
Among the draft report ’s conclusions is that some five years after its largest foreign reconstruction project since the Marshall Plan following World War II , the U.S. government still does not have the policies , technical capacity or organizational structure needed for a project even approaching this one ’s scale , the newspaper said .
It found that the reconstruction effort did little more than restore what had been destroyed during the U.S. invasion and subsequent looting .
And it concluded the effort had failed in part because no single agency in the U.S. government had primary responsibility for the job .
Partisan politics also figured in , as when a Republican lobbyist working for the U.S. occupation authority implored the Office of Management and Budget to fund $ 20 billion in new reconstruction money in August 2003 .
“ To delay getting our funds would be a political disaster for the President , ” wrote the lobbyist , Tom Korologos .
“ His election will hang for a large part on show of progress in Iraq and without the funding this year , progress will grind to a halt , ” the draft quoted Korologos as saying .
The Bush administration supported the request and Congress allocated the money later that year .
In his candid and moving article , Mr Bennett writes in some detail about his homosexuality .
" I have never been able to cruise and have never had much inclination to do so , though seeing it as a definite shortcoming , one of several masculine accomplishments I have never been able to master - throwing a ball , for instance , catching the barman 's eye , pissing in public .
It was partly that , never feeling I would be much of a catch .
I saw no point in trawling the streets for someone who might feel differently . "
On Monday , President Barack Obama directed the Environmental Protection Agency to reconsider a waiver request by California and 13 other states to set standards on auto emissions – including those of greenhouse gases – that are tougher than federal standards .
The directive represents a sharp break from the climate policies of Mr. Obama 's predecessor , as well as an embrace of states ' rights , a concept not strongly associated with the Democratic party for almost 50 years .
California spent the better part of the Bush presidency trying to set limits on tailpipe emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat - trapping gases .
In 2002 , it drafted a law that would cut greenhouse gas emissions from new cars sold in the state by 22 percent by 2012 and 30 percent by 2016 .
Since then , it has been battling the federal government to allow it to adopt this law .
Historically , California has been allowed to adopt emissions standards that are stricter than those of the rest of the country .
The state was exempt from the Clean Air Act of 1970 because it already had its own emissions laws in place .
Today , US states can choose to follow either federal or California emissions standards , but they are not allowed to create their own standards .
Each time California wants to adopt a new clean - air law , it must get a waiver from the EPA , which has never been denied .
Until this one .
In December 2005 , after finalizing the details of its emissions rules , California submitted its waiver request to the EPA .
It did n't hear back from the agency .
After two years of delay , in November 2007 California sued the agency , and their suit was joined by 13 other states .
The following month the EPA officially denied California 's application , with the agency 's administrator , Stephen Johnson , saying that he wanted to avoid a " confusing patchwork of state rules . "
In May 2008 , following a Congressional hearing on political interference in the EPA , Congressional Democrats released a report [ PDF ] saying that the waiver had unanimous support among EPA career staff and that Mr. Johnson himself seemed to support the idea , but that he changed his position after hearing from the White House .
Johnson maintains that the decision was his alone .
Monday 's directive will most likely mean that California will be allowed to adopt its law , and those 13 other states – Arizona , Connecticut , Maine , Maryland , Massachusetts , New Jersey , New Mexico , New York , Oregon , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island , Vermont , and Washington – will adopt the California greenhouse standard as their own .
In his statement before the signing of Monday 's directive , which was accompanied by a directive calling for the implementation of less stringent federal fuel economy standards enacted by President Bush , Obama accused the previous administration of " dragging its heels " on efforts to halt climate change :
Third , the federal government must work with , not against , states to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
California has shown bold and bipartisan leadership through its effort to forge 21st century standards , and over a dozen states have followed its lead .
But instead of serving as a partner , Washington stood in their way .
This refusal to lead risks the creation of a confusing and patchwork set of standards that hurts the environment and the auto industry .
It seems everyone is trying to play the " confusing patchwork " card .
A Friday press release from the National Automobile Dealers Association announced the release of a report titled " Patchwork Proven : Why A Single National Fuel Economy Standard Is Better for America Than A Patchwork of State Regulations . "
The report argues that granting California 's waiver would amount to regulating fuel - economy twice under two different systems , a bad move given the precariousness of the US auto industry .
Roland Hwang , the vehicles policy director for the National Resource Defense Council , offers a straightforward solution to the auto industry 's concerns : just follow California 's more stringent standards nationwide .
A 2004 report by California 's Air Resources Board [ PDF ] noted that the state 's regulations would increase the price of the average new car in 2016 by as much as $ 1,064 .
Science vs. Religion Has Darwin Failed ?
Human beings , animals and plants were not created by God , but are the result of evolution .
Charles Darwin published this revolutionary theory 150 years ago .
It 's been a huge success with scientists , but it was never popular .
Is the human brain wired toward supernatural belief ?
Jake Chessum
particularly matters .
But I 'm not sure that 's a great excuse for doing it poorly .
I 've pretty much learned not to worry about things I can't control .
I often find myself with friends and acquaintances and they 're worrying about this or that -- I say , You 're worried about the plane going down ?
What are you , a pilot ?
It still interests me to try and make a kind of perfect play .
I mean , you 'll never even be close .
Like a great baseball player hits .320 or .318 , maybe even .340 one year .
We hit like .060 .
And it 's okay .
If you think you 've discerned what went wrong before , by the time you apply your little brain to that , several hundred things have gone wrong .
Things are flawed or damaged or corrupted , or all three .
But that 's kind of nice because it reminds me of life , and because a lot of times when people have made super - exceptional things , it 's really hard for them to go again .
There will be people who will hate anything you do .
And some people will really love it .
But that 's not really different from the people who really hate it .
This is what politics is to me : Somebody tells you all the trees on your street have a disease .
One side says give them food and water and everything will be fine .
One side says chop them down and burn them so they do n't infect another street .
That 's politics .
And I 'm going , Who says they 're diseased ?
And how does this sickness manifest itself ?
And is this outside of a natural cycle ?
And who said this again ?
And when were they on the street ?
But we just have people who shout , " Chop it down and burn it " or " Give it food and water , " and there 's your two choices .
Sorry , I 'm not a believer .
I believe in humans .
A movie is like a line drawing , but a theater performance is like a painting .
It develops over what seems like an extraordinary amount of time .
I did a play called Burn This for two years .
It probably took me about six months -- the accents , the vocal patterns , the rapidity , what I had in my head -- to run it through my mouth .
' Cause it 's a painting .
You do a little bit each day .
I like to work .
I go to the theater and maybe I 'm upset about something , and the play starts and I start watching and it's too late , I 'm already lost in it -- and when I say " lost in it , " I do n't mean lost in the magic of it , because to me the magic of it is the work .
What went wrong ?
How could it be different ?
Why was it so good tonight and so absolutely gobsmackingly awful in the matinee ?
What is this great mystery ?
A lot of our wonderful actors , from Brando to George C. Scott , found it a shameful occupation and really lost interest in it .
But it always interests me , and watching others do it always interests me , and I do n't find it shameful .
I mean , as compared to what ?
Twenty - five or thirty years ago , you became famous , what 's the worst that could happen to you ?
Page 6 ? Cindy Adams ?
Liz Smith ?
There were n't cell phones with cameras .
Waiters did n't listen to your conversations and send them to Drudge or Defamer or Gawker or Jezebel or Agent Bedhead .
Now we 're all Japanese .
We 're a nation of paparazzi .
And it 's okay .
You make your peace with it .
We get so many rewards , we 're much more remunerated than other people , so I guess we should take more licks than other people , too .
It 's hard to believe Michelle Pfeiffer ever said hello to me -- not that she 's not memorable , God knows .
But I sort of blacked it out .
What I 'm trying to say is , when I think of the other person , I do n't think of me as involved with them .
They 're uncorrupted by me .
As if they were never troubled by my existence .
I 'm always mistrustful of people saying they know this or that .
When you think of how history is revealed , we know certain things to be facts at certain periods of time , which turn out not to be so factual as time marches on .
I do n't remember my life before I had children .
It was fantastic when they were growing up .
But they 're not terrifically interested in either me or what I do .
I remember Amandine was nine , and Nicole was trying to explain to them that I did n't work in the garden with a guy called Mark , that is n't what I did for a living .
And they did n't believe it .
Getting older is just so irritating .
I was never a great tennis player , but I loved to play .
Now I can't brace like that , let alone run after the ball .
Playing basketball , I can't jump .
It irritates me a lot .
But this year , I started ferociously going to the gym - - two or three hours a day and really hitting it hard .
I hate not being able to do things I like to do much more than I hate going to the gym .
I 'm a sort of nonsmoker -- let 's just put it that way .
I 'll always be a smoker who just does n't smoke .

In taking an honest look at why I am so devoted to church - state separation , I think it is probably accurate to say that I can boil it down to two reasons .
First , I am an atheist , and as such , I recognize that I have no safety in a religiously - infused government .
I know full well what proponents of theocracy think of atheists .
It is in my self - interest to fight for the separation of church and state because I am imperiled by the alternative .
The second reason for my ongoing focus on church - state separation is that I am convinced that the introduction of religion into government is bad forbecause religious belief is inherently irrational and destructive .

After all , this is n't a once - a - year topic for me but one I address quite frequently .
Still , this does give me an excuse to reflect on the issue of church - state separation and that can't be a bad thing .
I 'd like to make this contribution more of a personal one by focusing on why I am passionate about preserving the separation of church and state , even widening the gap between them .
Describing himself as “ filled with gratitude , ” Mr. Bush touched briefly on a handful of policy matters that he regards as achievements : his No Child Left Behind education measure , legislation giving Medicare beneficiaries access to prescription drugs and his campaign to combat AIDS around the world .
But his main theme was the moment that defined his presidency , the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks .
Image Mr. Bushs audience included family , friends , staff members and some ordinary Americans .

“ As the years passed , ” Mr. Bush said , “ most Americans were able to return to life much as it had been before 9/11 .
But I never did .
Every morning , I received a briefing on the threats to our nation .
And I vowed to do everything in my power to keep us safe . ”
He went on to recount some of the decisions that flowed out of that vow : the creation of the Department of Homeland Security , the creation of “ new tools to monitor terrorists ” movements  tools that civil liberties advocates argue are unconstitutional .
He did not mention his authorization of harsh interrogation techniques , another decision that has been among the most controversial and divisive of his presidency .
“ There is legitimate debate about many of these decisions , ” Mr. Bush said .
“ But there can be little debate about the results .
America has gone more than seven years without another terrorist attack on our soil . ”
In giving the speech , Mr. Bush carried on a tradition of farewell addresses that dates to George Washington and continued , most recently , with Presidents Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton .
( Mr. Bush ’s father , the first President Bush , did not give a farewell address . )
Mr. Reagan ’s address , especially , was deeply personal , laden with wistful references and reflections of America as a “ shining city on a hill , ” the phrase coined by John Winthrop , a colonial - era governor of Massachusetts .
But unlike Mr. Reagan , who left office with his popularity ratings high , Mr. Bush leaves as one of the most unpopular presidents in modern times .
Perhaps reflecting that , he kept his talk relatively short and to the point , with few rhetorical flourishes .
Instead , the president spoke somberly of the challenges that the nation faces in the years to come , as he warned Americans to resist the temptation to look inward and not to abandon his signature foreign initiative , the so - called freedom agenda , intended to promote democracy around the world .

In a speech before the London School of Economics a week ago , U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke offered a perverse economic theory in his quest to gather support for never - ending Wall Street bailouts .
Said Bernanke : " This disparate treatment , unappealing as it is , appears unavoidable .
Our economic system is critically dependent on the free flow of credit , and the consequences for the broader economy of financial instability are thus powerful and quickly felt . "
In other words , credit is the lifeblood of our economy , and the continued operation of credit providers is actually an issue of national security .
In truth , not all economies run on credit .
But over the last decade , the United States became a bubble economy that needed unlimited credit to keep from collapsing .
In a legitimate economy , it is not credit that fuels spending and investment , but simply income and savings .
It 's too bad our Fed chairman does not understand the difference .
That American families now routinely rely on credit to make every - day purchases is a habit that needs to be broken – not encouraged .
What we need in America is more restraint and less indulgence .
For example , Americans in the current economy should not go into debt to buy new cars .
Given the level of debt that weighs down the typical family , Americans should defer such purchases until they have paid down existing debt , or have replenished their savings to the point where they can afford to pay cash .
Until that time , Americans should continue driving their old cars .
In the meantime , the untapped savings could be made available to local businesses that would use it to finance badly needed capital investments .
But such a drastic reversal in financial culture represents the kind of change that no one in the outgoing or incoming White House administrations appears willing to consider .
By providing perpetual support to lenders that have bankrupted themselves through bad loans , the government merely guarantees that bad economic behavior will continue .
Credit is indeed vital to an economy , but it does not constitute an economy within itself .
The important thing to remember is that credit is scarce , and is limited by the stock of savings .
Obviously , savings loaned to one individual is not available to be loaned to another until it the outstanding debt is repaid .
If it is never repaid , the savings are lost .
Loans to consumers not only crowd out more productive loans that might have been made to business , they have a far greater likelihood of ending in default .
In addition , while business loans increase our capital stock and lead to greater productivity , loans made to consumers are merely spent , and do not create conditions that will make repayment easier .
When businesses borrow to fund capital investments , the extra cash flows that result are used to repay the loans .
When individuals borrow to spend , loans can only be repaid out of reduced future consumption .
One of the reasons we are in such dire straits is that consumers have already borrowed and spent too much .
Many did so based on the false belief that ever - appreciating real estate would ultimately provide the means to repay their debts and finance their lifestyles .
Now that reality has finally set in , why should the spending spree continue ?
The fact that our gross domestic product ( GDP ) – 70 % of which is consumption - driven – is currently contracting should not surprise anyone .
In fact , such a contraction is long overdue and the government should not do anything to interfere .
In trying to perpetuate the illusion , the government wants to revive the spending spree that has led us to this disaster .
But how can such actions possibly help ?
How will more debt improve the economy ?
Would n't our circumstances be vastly improved if we paid off some of our debts and replenished our savings ?
Would n't we be in better shape if instead of buying more stuff we concentrated on producing it ?
The unpleasant reality is that years of bad monetary and fiscal policy have encumbered our economy with debt and undermined our industrial capacity .
The sooner we can begin to repair the damages , the sooner we can right the ship .
If instead we merely administer more of the same , the ship will sink in a sea of inflation .

A Eurocup basketball match was called off in Ankara as the visiting Israeli side did not bother to return to the court after Turkish spectators launched anti-Israeli protests , prompting riot police to intervene .
" Israeli murderers , get out of Palestine , " " Allah -u Akhbar " ( God is great ) , the protestors chanted as the teams - Israel 's Bnei Hasharon and Turkey 's Turk Telekom - initially came out for the match in the Ataturk Sports Arena .
The Israelis returned to their locker room after a group of protestors , some carrying Palestinian flags and wearing the kaffiyeh - the traditional checkered Arab scarf - hurled coins and lighters at them and attempted to invade the court , prompting police to use truncheons to stop them .
The spectators were then asked to empty the hall , but several dozen people refused to leave and their exit was secured only with a false announcement that the match had been cancelled .
The referees then called the two teams back to start the game , but the Israeli side did not show up .
Turk Telecom , leaders in Group D , is expected to be awarded victory , with Bnei Hasharon , stuck at the bottom , considered to have forfeited the game by not fielding a team .
Hundreds of protestors gathered also outside the building , shouting anti-Israeli slogans and waving Palestinian flags .
Most of them were not allowed in .
About 1,000 policemen were on duty for the match , media reports said .
Israel 's bloody offensive in the Gaza Strip since December 27 has triggered almost daily demonstrations in Turkey , where the Palestinian cause enjoys widespread support even though the country is Israel 's main regional ally .

Lookin ' for some jing chai ideas to use in your next bout of Firefly or Serenity - themed RPG match ?
Maybe you 're one of them folks that just needs a little inspiration to get your brain a - movin ' on a space - cowboy adventure of a mighty grand scale .
Either way , you do n't need to look no further than here — even if your game is n't set in the Firefly / Serenity universe or is n't anything close to a good old - fashioned space western in flavor , you might find something mighty pleasing here you can twist or that might give you just the push you need to come up with the ultimate adventure for your go se ship and it's intrepid crew of kuh wu frontier types .
1. The Basics
Every spacer worth his mi tian gohn knows that when you 're running a ship in the ‘ verse , you got to make money any way you can .
Here 's a few ideas for " legal " assignments your crew might be able to get to earn a few credits when things get tight , or when they 're saving up for that part they just can't quite afford .
Payment is generally divided into two halves - the half you get when you pick up , and the half you get when you deliver .
Haul Ass : ( any world to any world )
Some union hauler busted his boat and left his load on the world the crew is on !
( Random shipping company )
The shipment is 250 tons , and needs to be delivered as fast as possible !
Payment is 120 cr. with an extra 100 cr. bonus if the delivery is made on - time .
If delivery is a week or more overdue , the company blacklists the ship .

Postal Run : ( any world to any world )
The post has more than it can handle and is looking for shippers , independent or union , who are willing to help out the state .
Payment is 1 cr. /ton for 1d20 tons of available weight .
Failure to deliver on time forfeits second half of payment .
Week or more overdue is a federal crime ( Alliance puts out a warrant for the ship ) .

The Big Oops :( any world to Beylix . )
Looks like some chwen big union shipper ran into some trouble and smashed up his boat real good .
Oh well , right ?
More credits for the crew .
The insurance paperwork has come through , the shipper has declared the rig totaled , and some scavenger on Beylix has bought what 's left for parts .
A towing harness ( halves the speed of your boat ) will be affixed in orbit and cut loose in orbit of the destination planet .
Payment is 2 cr./ hour with a 50 cr. bonus upon delivery if on time .
Payment stops at maximum amount for time allotment .
If three days overdue , the ship is blacklisted with the scavengers ( and makes enemies )

The boys at Allied Pork need a shipment of genetically - engineered hogs shipped to some core world , and all the union haulers are tied up at the moment .
The pigs are crated and self - contained , so as long as the ship keeps atmo and the temp do n't get too extreme , they wo n't spoil .
Allied Pork is willing to pay 1 credit per ton of what 's shipped , and if the hogs are delivered on time , there 'll be a 50 cr. bonus waiting for the crew when they arrive .
If they arrive late , Allied Pork wo n't pay the second half , and the crew gets no bonus .
If the pigs are a week or more overdue , Allied Pork will blacklist the ship and sue her captain for damages .

Get Along Little Doggie : ( Any world to any world * )
On the core worlds , folk tend to think of real live , un - tampered meats as delicacies , but on the rim , there ain't no easier way to get meat than to raise it on the hoof .
Either way , it needs shipping , and that means jobs for ships with cargo space .
When shipping animals , it requires that you purchase the animals ( cost of support gear figured in ) from the farmer and get reimbursed ( plus the shipping fee ) when you arrive .
Note : Some worlds will pay more for live meats in smaller quantities .
Livestock Cost :
Cattle : 15 cr./head
Sheep : 10 cr/head
Pigs : 10 cr./head
Chickens : 1 cr./head
Turkeys : 2 cr./head
Dogs : 4 cr./head
Snails : 20 cr./ton
Livestock Shipping Cost : ( weight includes support equipment )
Cattle : 1 cr./head. 2 head / ton
Sheep : .5 cr./ head 6 head / ton
Pigs : .5 cr./head 6 head / ton
Chickens : 1 cr./ton 400 head / ton
Turkeys : 1 cr./ ton 100 head / ton
Dogs : 1.5 cr/ton 100 head / ton
Snails : 1 cr/ton 100,000 head / ton
Destination Requirements
Rim world : none
Border world : Animals must be papered .
Core world : Animals must be papered , vaccinated , and pass a health inspection on arrival .
( Rejected animals are worthless in the core , but can be incinerated for a cost of 1 cr. /head )
2. Target Practice
A friendly doctor approaches the characters and tells them he needs a starship to test his newest invention !
Turns out it 's a weapon - a high - frequency laser , one that 's decades ahead of anything the Alliance has , and he can't think of a better ship ( or a better crew ) to test it !
The reward ?
Well , other than the distinct honor of being at the forefront of science , is $ 500 in straight , untraceable credit chips he 'll hand over at the end of the trial .
If they agree , he gives them the coordinates for the test and tells them he 'll see them tomorrow , when his team will do the install .
When they return in the morning , there 's already another ship there , a shiny new boat parked just outside the landing pad .
As they put down , the doctor rushes out to meet them , a group of seven rough - and - tumble looking spacers a couple of paces behind him .
Turns out the other ship ( and crew ) are the boys who'll be carrying the laser , and our heroes are just being hired for target practice !
If they start a firefight , someone gets to the other ship , fires her up , seals the doors , and starts carving holes in whatever he / she can hit .
If they try to leave , the doctor goes ahead with the test anyway .
There 's no dissuading the shee - niou bastard - they agreed to do the test , and he's got a voice recording of the agreement ( which makes it a valid contract . )
If the crew decides to do anything but get back to the ship , the doctor will either take legal action ( using the local sheriff , ) or he 'll threaten to blow up their ship right there .
No matter what happens , the weapon can only fire a few times before it shorts and fries itself , obliterating the ship that it 's on .
( A good mechanic is likely to realize this , if the laser somehow ends up on the ship the players are flying .
Once the test is over ( if the players agree ) the doctor is n't happy about the loss of his prototype , but he keeps his end of the deal and pays up without a fight .
3. Purple Haze
A client who runs a mushroom farm wants to get his latest crop of Criminy and Shitake to his distributor on Ariel ( core ) .
He 's an old friend of one of the crew members , so he 's probably trustworthy , even though he 's always talking about peace and love and ending his ta ma duh sentences with the word " man . "
If they take the job , he 'll fill up their cargo hold with his mushrooms , and it's not until they 're well on their way to Ariel that the crew finds out that at least one crate of mushrooms he packed is actually a super - hybridized form of psilocybin with spores that will eat through the feh wu crate housing and fill the ship with heavy hallucinogens .
This could make for a lot of fun encounters , real or imagined !
4. The Debt
A happy client takes the crew out for drinks and things get a might bit wild .
One of the crew members wakes up in a dark room with one cheong bao ho tze of a hangover and a couple of goons staring down at him .
Turns out when he got really drunk , he gambled and lost so much that he's not only completely out of money , but in debt , and the owner of the establishment managed to convince him ( while he was drunk ) to be the next big cage fighter so he can pay off his debt .
Trying to get out of this tsway niou situation without going through with the cage fighting is going to cost the crew a lot , but there might be fun alternative ways out of this mess .
For maximum fun , make the character going into the cage the captain or the pilot .
Someone who the boat wo n't fly without .
5. Against the Lawman
While parked on some niou se backwater rim world , a local rich man puts the squeeze on the men and women working in his mine ( higher taxes , harder work , longer hours , etc. ) and it erupts in a bloody strike that the local lawmen get involved with .
Only problem ?
The tah mah duh hwoon dahn rich fellow owns not only the mine , but the whole tah ma duh town , including every judge , sheriff , and deputy in the system .
In fact , the only thing he does n't own is the crew or their ship , and since they 've got guns , the miners are bound to come to them for help .
What they do is up to them , but it could turn into a really exciting run along the lines of Heart of Gold .
Or they could just leave - or maybe even take the rich fellow 's side in the hopes of making a handful of dirty , dirty money .
6. Reavers ?
Why Did It Have to Be Reavers ?
Some locals on a rim or a border world approach the characters and ask them for help .
Turns out they 've been raided - several times , and by Reavers .
Though these Reavers are different - they only kill when they have to , and they seem to have some kind of rank and file , which is very unlike any Reavers anyone in the ‘ verse has ever run across .
Those folk who 've seen them report that they 're led by a girl , a " half - breed , " they call her , who is about as vicious as they come .
The locals want to make a stand , but the local alliance military camp is n't interested , and the folk round about town do n't have enough guns or hands to use them , and they 're ready to make a deal with outsiders if it means having the characters and the ship on their side .
In truth , the kuh wu woman leading these false Reavers is a half - breed , a miraculous survivor of a Reaver 's brutality , and her band is actually a pack of corrupt soldiers from the local Alliance military camp with nothing better to do than pick on the local colonists , so there 'll be no cavalry to speak of , especially since one of the ranchers is in cahoots with the false Reavers , and he 's been supplying inside information to them since day one ...
7. Find the Finder
A major archaeological firm contacts the characters while they 're either on - route to a rim world or parked on one , and offers them a job tracking down a wayward archaeologist who 's gone missing on that planet while looking for something stashed there during the war , something that might be valuable .
If they find him and he 's found the stash , then the firm is willing to cut them in for twenty percent of the loot , but if he 's dead ... well , that might be grounds for a little renegotiatin ' !
There 's a lot you can do with this - maybe the guay tuh guay nown archaeologist found the stash and realizes he can get a better cut by selling it to someone else , and maybe he got himself killed trying to do just that , and now the site 's swarming with huen dahn gang - folk trying to figure out the best way to fence the cache ...
8. Long Arm of the Law
The characters are flying along on some relatively uneventful run between worlds when a ee da tuo da bien Alliance cruiser intercepts them out of the blue .
And not just one of those little ones - one of the big , official , and extremely well - armed ones .
They 're told to power down and prepare to be boarded - why is never made clear , but the fact that they 'll be blasted out of the black if they try to run for it is .
Once the commanding officer comes on board , a detachment of alliance soldiers tears the ship apart from top to bottom , looking for something .
( What is it ?
That 's up to the Referee , but it should be something they can't find , like fugitives or a shipment of weaponry stolen from an alliance research outpost . )
They might turn up all kinds of illegal things while they 're tearing the ship apart , but it does n't matter - they 've got one thing on their mind , and that 's it .
The kuh wu commanding officer might even get violent or resort to torture to get the info he needs , but whatever happens , by the time they realize it's all a case of mistaken identity ( I guess there 's a lot of ships like yours out there , folks ! ) the whole boat is a mess , and none of the alliance goons feels like sticking around to clean it up .
This might be a way for the characters to pick up a tip on a new way to make money as well , either from a soldier who needs something done or just from overhearing the details of what the officer is after .
9 . Ten Pounds of Trouble in a Five - Pound Saddlebag
One of the character 's contacts has a job offer for the crew , and it's a take - it - or - leave - it kind of job with no questions asked that needs to be done yesterday .
There 's a crate he needs delivered half - way across the ‘ verse , and it 's big enough to fill the whole cargo bay ( or one whole cargo bay . )
The contact tells them to make sure not to open it , to not even touch it , but if that is n't enough to convince the crew to take a peek in flight , the fact that a couple of fat , inquisitive kids start appearing on the ship might .
Turns out that the crate is full of fat little kids packed into tight little enclosures , complete with food , water , and in - flight entertainment .
Why they 're there is up to the Referee - are they another wong ba duhn Alliance experiment on psychics , or are they something more insidious , like product being shipped to people with a taste for a meat that does n't grow on the hoof or wing ...
10 . Take My Love , Take My Land ...
A friend of the characters gets in touch with them and tells them that some chai neow people calling themselves the " Church of the New Science " are trying to convince him to join their bizarre , new - age religion and give up his land to the church ... and they 're awfully persistent .
Why , just the other day they sent the local sheriff ( who they seem to own ) up to his ranch to " check things out " in an awfully suspicious way , and after that , there was that wong ba duhn coreworlder he caught sneakin ' around in the bushes ... anyway , he needs their help , figures a starship and a handful of guns might scare off these silver - suited creeps before things start getting out of hand .
( Whether it does or not is up to the referee ... it might just make them that much more persistent about trying to convert people to their bizarre faith ... )
Maybe , if bullets start flying , what he 'll discover he really needs is some help shuffling furniture real quick , and the fastest ticket offworld he can get .
11 . Two by Two ...
The characters are chartered by a bureaucratic - type who 's a guay tuh guay nown da shiong la se la chwohn tian if the characters have ever seen one .
He 's paying for passage for himself and three others - a pilot , a shady soldier type ( maybe a merc from the war who fought for the Alliance and then got dumped when they won the war ) and , laugh all you want , a paleoxenologist .
( Everyone knows there 's no intelligent life but humans in the ‘ verse , and even some of them ain't too intelligent . )
She does n't care that they 're laughing - she has a job to do , but what that job is exactly , is kept pretty secret .
Anyway , the bureaucrat pays the charter and offers a retainer to keep the ship and crew on site to pick them up or ferry in equipment as necessary .
Somehow , during the trip , it gets leaked that the reason why this group of passengers is going to that particular middle - of - nowhere is because something 's been found there that 's old ... really old , and it 's probably non-human in origin .
When they reach the site , they figure out the value of the item , and it is mighty juicy , so the arguing and the persuading begins .
The Bureaucrat wants to sell the thing to the highest bidder or acquire it for his corporation , the paleoxenologist wants to see it cataloged and put in a museum , the merc 's been instructed to acquire it for a private collector , and the pilot , who is secretly a government agent , has been given instructions to kill everyone involved and seal up the site so this particular secret stays a secret .
If he can't manage it in time , that 's okay - it wo n't be long before the agents of Alliance government show up and start liquidating people .
Other Ideas
The ‘ verse is home to whole slew of ideas - just think back to books you 've read or movies you 've watched and pick out that one series of plot twists you could turn into something to make your jaunt through the black just that much more interesting .
You might also check out my 11 Steampunk Adventure Seeds , 11 Cyberpunk Adventure Seeds , or 11 Horror Adventure Seeds for some other downright nifty ideas you might be able to twist or change or even use raw next time you take your boat through atmo .
Just remember , keep flyin ' , ‘ cause it do n't matter how far out in the black they put ya , ai n't no one who can take the sky from you .
Castiron on December 28 , 2010 :
and 1 other note ,
the sorce of the alliance cruisers losing power in " here comes the calvalry " is pirates , a group of rather technically minded badguys has been developing a new weapon tha can overload the engines of a ship at range and short out the ships power system with a microwave transmitted blast .
the conclusion of the scenario is the heros putting an end to the threat posed by the pirates and either destroyign the only copy of the weapon and the plans , ... or by destroying the plans and takign the weapon or by taking both .
in any event the threat of the weapon is eliminated or atleast supposedly as in some cuircumstances the weapon and its plans fall in the hands of the heros .
in that last set of events mayhaps the heros better keep that part to themselves .
Castiron on December 28 , 2010 :
also the Primae can carry 2 cargo cans with the towing pads on its wings , ... the cans can be 20,000ton each ( for planetary landings ) or 50,000tons each if no planetary landing is needed .
cans larger than 50,000 tons cannot be hauled via the towing pads as the mass exceeds what they can pull .
Castiron on December 28 , 2010 :
=HERE COMES THE CALVALRY =
the heros ship is traveling along when they pickup a distress beacon , it appears to be coming from an alliance cruiser , when the heros arrive they discobver the ship has lost all power .
the heros , ... have a choice .
try to raid the ship for some ubber aliance gear or help them out of their own good nature ( not bribed by the shipps commander as it will come to if the heros arrive and are reluctant to help ) and try to get the ship repowered .
assuming they do the later ( of their own wfree will , not outa bribes ) there will be one gratefull alliance colonel or major out in the black with nothun but good ta be sayin about the heros and their ship .
( or with a vendetta and a warrant if they plundered )
over the course of the next month there will be a rash of this event say sumthin like 9 cruisers .
then it happens .
the mother lode , the alliance cruiser Arbalest
onboard is star admiral kalla birimal .
and this is where the heros gain honorary ranks in the alliance millitary .
should the heros and / or their ship have the " cortex specter " trait Kalla wil lflag them / it as a blacks opps qualified ship and the crew should have no more problems with that trait and the alliance , .... the letters of commendation from say 1 star admiral , 7 colonels and 3 majors of the resqued ships wil lcarry aloitta weight with getting the heros freight from the alliance .
at the standard ?
3 / ton rate as well as the occasional expedited / high security / and or high value jobs that pay even more once in a blue moon as much as ?
16/ton .
from there on out its pretty much smooth sailign for the crew , ... an alliance job paying well or access to emergency medical or repair services wont ever bee too far from the heros fro mthat day on ofcourse assuming the heros dont ever ruin their good name with the alliance .
and those affore mentioned med / repair sevices may be avail but they still wont be cheap .
this also opens the crew up to other alliance based adventures they may or may not be to the heros liking , such as :
Law and Order : a mission to do some law enforcement on a colony of miners or other poor oppressed folk that have revolted .
On the lamb : a mission to hunt down a know criminal by the name of
Black Opps : a mission to extract an alliance opperative i nsome extreamly hostile location .
Recon : the heros must go , ... gather information on this or that and report back .
Reaver we may roam : the heros are sent to investigate a loss of communications at a new colony in , and arrive to find theres just been a dinner party , ........ so to speak .
keep in mind the alliance takes offence at a declined mission reguardless of the reasons , they have no concern for the heros " moral reservations " however the heros after " here comes the calvalry " wil lhave a VERY good name and it would take a huge ammount of turn downs or seriously botched missions for them to lose alliance favor enough to lose their welcome at the alliance shipping officers desk .
=mission # 2 in the castiron collection=
Castiron on December 28 , 2010 :
falling down is a reaver crawl , .... suitable for 1 chr to an entire crew , ..... here 's the deal .
the crew is on vacation on the passenger liner or for whatever reason is the second victim hit by pirates and shot down after being boarded and robbed .
however somehow the heros managed to be offcourse and well into reaver space , ... the pirates mentioned are not the brightest in the verse and thus failed to notice where they had followed their targets to .
( for 1 Chr you are either one of the pirates ( and could be an infiltraitor to the pirates ranks looking to gather evidence on them for the alliance ) or a passenger on the liner that has become lost and wandered into reaver space .
in the infiltraitor scenario the pirates are on to you and turn on you after the heist and leave you to be shot down with the liner . )
the pirates after finishing their robbery shoot out the engines on the liner and leave to to crash into a planet they are orbiting atm .
in the crash several lives are lost , say out of the 20,000 passengers and 300 crew only 1300ish survive the crash .
after that the reavers will claim 100s of lives as the captain and remaining crew fail to lead the survivors to saftey ( saftey : a false illusuon on planet reaver ) and setup a survivor camp , ..... as the survivors are butchered in 2 or 3 reaver encounters the commanders of the liner are killed
eventually the hero(s ) are the only leader types left and must lead the remainder of survivors to salvation .
on this hell hole a ruined city can be found ( several actually , but 1 inparticular ) i nthis city several locations containing goods helpful to the survivors can be found , alliance weapons vaults , supply lockers , and even an experimental prototype ship hangar with a ship in it , ...... despite being a ruin the locations have endured their abandonement quite well and the ship found is no worse of wear in its decades of abandonment , though the ship is barely more than a shell , most of its components still sitting in crates on the hangar floor
the heros must manage ot survive the reavers either by force or by stealth ( stealth is recommended ) and assemble the ship enough ot get off planet using the crated components and any salvage that can be brought in fro mthe wrecked liner , ... all the while trying to avoid reaver attention .
in the end a thorough grp of heros can manage to procure several suits of advanced armor , weapons , some new ration packs that include the standarn nutrient bars + a carb bar and some hydration beads ( would look the size on slices manderine oranges ) these discoveres ration packs can not only keep a person from starvign for a month but keep them fully fed and hydrated .
the primae prototye ship is a marvel of engineering its a large transport sized ship that is reconfigureable for " whatever purpose " this particular prototype was being setup
as a multi-function advanced support ship with micro reseach hospital / research lab , .. mini foundry , refinery , machine shop , hydroponics bay , water mill , and micro atmo prossessor .
armor , weapons , as well as still having a decent ammount of cargo space .
the components found include 3 units of w and s armor aswell as 4 200 lb cannons , ... and 10 1000 lb missile tubes .
though as mentioned the components for al lthis are stil lcrated and would take extensive time to assemble , .. might say more time n you got .
though it might be feasably possible for the heros to grab the stuff , .. toss it in the ship , .. assamble the main engine , ... put a fuel can in there hooked ot the engine assemble the most basic of controlls and get outa dodge .
Background , the " ruined city " was in actuality an alliance R&D center and was lost durrign the war to an outbreak of a contagion , ... the alliance intended to return once the planet would be clear of the contageon but somehow records of the existance of the base were lost and thus the place was forgotten , .... any experimental weapons , armor or the ship would have no record o nthe cortex of any kind , and thus all are cortex specters [ MAJOR ] ( id give em a cortex specter [ extreme ] if such a thing existed . )
KEEP IN MIND , when this ship is found its a near bare frame these stats show what the primae " CAN BE IF " all the components are taken with the ship " AND " later installed .
( sure to be a series of adventures and a whole lotta time n cost to get done ) this ship represents end game material and should be a whole lotta fun and time getting completed .

Awesome hub !
Thanks for sharing !

Ok ... so " how it went "
PCs about crashed on Whitefall as an intro to the campaign .
Campaign takes place right around the whole Serenity / deal goes bad with Patience episode ( or was that in the pilot ? )
At any rate , I added a bit to your premise .
The reaver ship in that episode crashed in my game .
There is an alliance base on Whitefall - remnants of the War .
( It is loosely manned , mostly forgotten since the war and staffed with essentially war crime worthy soldiers that the Alliance just did n't want to deal with . )
A sick , sadistic guy in charge takes his men out to investigate this explosion / crash .
The alliance patrol comes across the crashed reaver ship , finds one survivor - female reaver badly wounded .
Sadistic bad guy takes Reaver prisoner and they come across Patience in the desert trapped under her horse .
Sadistic bad guy gets an idea - shoots Patience and lets the Reaver tear her up .
Now he has greater control on Whitefall and the neat little Reaver excuse to run around and kill off other townsfolk who might challenge his supreme authority .
He nurses the reaver back to health and through heavy sedation / psychotropic medication and good doses of torture " trains " it to follow him around and .... " work " on command .
PCs show up - its a mess .
Fun mess , but a mess .
They eventually figure out what is going on and with their FedBand scanner pick up on encrypted transmissions that lead them to the badguys next target - a prominent rancher in the area .
They show up but not guns blazing .
Its a messy fight where one PC ( a Jane clone ) does most of the shooting .
The captain is trying to join up but the Twitchy Coward engineer keeps sabotaging the shuttle they are in until the capatin puts his gun to the guys head .
The ships doctor manages to somehow save the rancher 's life ( the Reaver had a chance to get to him ) but he will be out of commission for weeks ( and unable to corroborate their story . )
By the way - a local computer with a holo suite made some nifty " Reaver Costumes " for the alliance feds and the PCs managed to get one intact ( again I say it was a mess .... frag grenades and an Alliance officer being used as a shuttle hood ornament ... not much came out unscathed . )
Work out great , nice little inspiration ... going to check out your list for some other ideas : )
Jeff Berndt from Southeast Michigan on February 22 , 2010 :
Nice article .
You know , these ideas are equally usable for a smugglers ' campaign in the Star Wars universe .
Trunfio from Pacific Northwest on February 07 , 2010 :
We 're just about to start a Serenity game .
Thanks for the great ideas .
I sent a link to our GM .
Earl S. Wynn ( author ) from California on January 21 , 2010 :
AWESOME !
Let me know how it goes . :)
RL on January 21 , 2010 :
Love the ideas - going to run a Serenity game next week and have been so busy I have n't put much thought into the general story .
Going to go with the " Why did it Have to be Reavers ? " : )
The Mumbai terrorists used an array of commercial technologies – from Blackberries to GPS navigators to anonymous e-mail accounts – to pull off their heinous attacks .
For years , terrorists and insurgents around the world have used off - the - shelf hardware and software to stay ahead of bigger , better - funded authorities .
In 2007 , former U.S. Central Command chief Gen. John Abizaid complained that , with their Radio Shack stockpile of communications gear , " this enemy is better networked than we are . "
The strikes that killed at least 174 appears to be another example of how wired today 's " global guerrillas " can be .
As they approached Mumbai by boat , the terrorists " steered the vessel using GPS equipment , " according to the Daily Mail .
A satellite phone was later found aboard .
Once the coordinated attacks began , the terrorists were on their cell phones constantly .
They used BlackBerries " to monitor international reaction to the atrocities , and to check on the police response via the internet , " the Courier Mail reports .
The gunmen were able to trawl the internet for information after cable television feeds to the two luxury hotels and office block were cut by the authorities .
The men looked beyond the instant updates of the Indian media to find worldwide reaction to the events in Mumbai , and to keep abreast of the movements of the soldiers sent to stop them .
Outside of Leopold 's Cafe , " one of the gunmen seemed to be talking on a mobile phone even as he used his other hand to fire off rounds , " an eyewitness told The New York Times .
The terror group then took credit for the bloodshed with a series of e-mails to local media .
They used a " remailer " service to mask their identities ; earlier attacks were claimed from cyber cafes .

Five years later , nuclear deal with Iran is in tatters
It will be five years this week since the Iran nuclear deal was signed in Vienna .
The one - sided deal contained many clauses and annexes that related mainly to the lifting of sanctions in Iran .
The West got very little .

fluorescent light is one of those things that makes you scratch your head and wonder :
How the hell do they do that ?
A fluorescent spiral lamp into a traditional bulb ?

John Strainic , global product general manager , wo n't say .
He just says that the manufacturing process is the result of " very advanced patents " .
As you can see in the video , the fluorescent spiral is housed inside the typical incandescent light bulb glass - which will be frosted in the final version - along with the necessary electronics to make it work .
It seems to me like the typical looks - cool - but - I - do n't - know - if - it 's - useful - or - what invention that may take the market by storm or sit on shelves gathering dust forever .
It will be available at Target and selected Ace Hardware stores next January , and around " Earth Day 2009 " ( which in case you did n't know - like me - is April 22 ) everywhere else .

New Zealand 's opposition National Party has swept to power , ending PM Helen Clark 's nine - year Labour government .
Ms Clark admitted defeat and said she would step down as leader .
National leader John Key said the people had voted for a safer , more prosperous and ambitious New Zealand , but warned of tough times ahead .
Correspondents say Ms Clark has presided over years of strong growth and social reforms , but the economy has gone into recession this year .
The centre - right opposition won 45 % of the vote , against 34 % for Labour , leaving it just short of an overall majority .
It will be able to govern with the help of two smaller parties - the United Future and ACT parties - and will also look for support to the Maori Party .
Mr Key told the BBC he hoped his government would be inclusive .
" I want to run a centre - right government , a pragmatic and decisive government , but certainly one that reflects the views of all New Zealanders , " he said .
' Vote for change '
About three million people were registered to vote - a record number for the country - though the estimated turnout , at 78.69 % , was slightly down on the previous election in 2005 .
We must make the most of our advantages because the state of the global economy and the global financial crisis means that the road ahead may well be a rocky one
John Key
Profile : John Key According to official figures , National is set to win 59 seats , Labour 43 and their allies the Greens , with 6 % of the vote , eight , in the 122 - seat parliament .
Mr Key told supporters that hundreds and thousands of people across the country had " voted for change " .
" Today , New Zealanders have voted for action , for a safer , more prosperous and more ambitious New Zealand , " he said .
But he warned of difficult times .
" We must make the most of our advantages because the state of the global economy and the global financial crisis means that the road ahead may well be a rocky one , " he said .
Ms Clark said she accepted responsibility for the result and her job as leader of the Labour Party was complete .
" I will be standing down and I will be expecting my Labour Party colleagues to elect a new leader before Christmas , " she told reporters .
Though the recession loomed large in the campaign , few major policy shifts are expected once the new government takes over , analysts say .
Both Labour and National had promised tax cuts and extra spending , amid fears that the global credit crisis will hit New Zealand hard .
Maori interests
Since the country introduced proportional voting in 1996 , neither of the big parties has won an outright majority and they have always relied on the support of minor parties .

However , Mr Key said his party was " diametrically opposed " to some of its policies , and Maori leader Tariana Turia said there would be hard bargaining involved in any deal .
Among Maori demands are the repeal of a law preventing Maoris from claiming rights to the foreshore and seabed , and greater control over government spending on indigenous programmes to prevent waste .

Victoria 's Secret Fashion Show , 2008
Unfortunately , the 2008 Victoria 's Secret Fashion
Show has come to an end .
Tons of beautiful woman fluttered across the stage each wearing an elaborate set of wings .
Adriana Lima , Alessandra Ambrosio , Ana Beatriz Barros , Angela Lindvall , Carmen Kass , Doutzen Kroes , Heidi Klum , Izabel Goulart , Karolina Kurkova , Marisa Miller , Miranda Kerr , Neomie Lenoir and Selita Ebanks each blessed us with their astonishing beauty and grace .
We 've managed to boast over 150 high - quality pictures of the event .
Please try your hardest ( pun intended ) to prevent yourself from kissing and / or licking the screen .
1. You are kidding right ?
Is it not all over the news that the coalition was organized and plotted long before they tried to topple the NEWLY ELECTED Prime Minister ?
I do n't know about you , but 3 against one does n't seem fair to me .
What about the tapes ?
Were those all fabricated ?
2. Attack ads ?
It 's called running a campaign .
The purpose of attack ads is not to drive down voter turnout .
Where do you get these ideas ?
How the heck do you blame Harper for Canadians not showing up at the polls ?
You have serious issues .
I suppose Harper is to blame for the Maple Leaf liseria outbreak too ?
Does BC like the coalition and NDP so much because the NDP supports the legal use of marijuana ?
3.Environment Canada , well that would be part of the crown right ?
Is that a reason to hate Harper or topple his government ?
God help us .
4. Harper never took advantage of global uncertainty .
What are you talking about ???
The coalition are the ones using fear to justify what they have done and to look like heroes .
I am proud that Harper had the guts to stick up for Canadians and taxpayers in this time of ecomomic turmoil .
Why should WE be funding hundreds of millions of dollars to political parties ?
If you want to do that , then GO AHEAD and write them a cheque !
5 . Had plans ?
Had ?
Please tell me you have better reason to hate Harper and the Conservatives than what you have provided here .
This is just ridiculous .
The coaltion is nothing more than bullying and a BS way to win an election that lost very badly .
Just because Parliament ' can ' do what they 've done to Stephen Harper , does NOT make it right .
Not one bit .
The conservatives won fair and square , and if there were n't so many parties in Canada they would have won majority by a landslide .
That is fact .
The Coalition is nothing more than a power grab , and has nothing to do with helping Canada .
Smoke and mirrors in a time of crisis .
They should all be ashamed of themselves .
This is NOT democracy where you can 86 a Prime Minister just because you form a gang and add up your numbers .
Please .
There is no ' just cause ' here .
Those who formed the coalition should be charged and held responsible for the further billions in damages that they caused Canada 's economy , and driving it further into economic uncertainty .
Look at how many points the Canadian dollar took as a direct result of the coalition .
LET Harper do his JOB as promised and AS elected , and HEAR what the hell he has to say in January when he announces the new budget and economic stimulus package or whatever he has planned .
This is absolutely ridiculous .
Topple the government just because he took too much time to really find a way to help Canada during this ongoing recession .
Wow .
If he through a silly number out of a hat like Dion and the coalition around the 30 billion dollar mark would that make him a hero ?
Come on .
I for one am against a 30 billion dollar bailout aimed at the auto and forestry sector .
The auto industry here in North America has been in a financial crisis for years .
Long before this whole mess .
How long before the auto sector loses the billions of dollars that Canada and we as taxpayers give them huh ?
Can you tell me what that will solve ?
Can you elaborate on Dion 's plan for the forestry stimulus package as well ?
I 'd like to see this ingenius plan they put together that they claim they worked so hard at .
This should be public information .
And you want to talk about environment protection ?
Tell me what 30 billion dollars pumped into gas emitting factories looks like .
Show me what beautiful Bristish Columbia looks like with no more forests .
It 's so easy to point fingers and blame Harper .
The rest of the world is affected by the world economy just as much as we are if not more .
You do n't see them fighting as we Canadians are .
This is shameful and sad .
No Prime Minister or government is perfect , but I am proud of Harper representing Canada .
I would like to see him work more closely with the oppostion , as much as I would like them to work with him .
I hope they can all put their status aside , and work together to help Canadians and figure out the best way to go in terms of a stimulus package , job creations etc .
Again , I am against bailing out a money losing industry that will only postpone the inevitable , but it would be interesting to see what happens .
Peace .

Some 50 Pygmies of the Baka clan lead me single file through a steaming rain forest in Cameroon .
Scrambling across tree trunks over streams , we hack through heavy undergrowth with machetes and cut away vinelike lianas hanging like curtains in our path .
After two hours , we reach a small clearing beneath a hardwood tree canopy that almost blots out the sky .
For thousands of years Pygmies have lived in harmony with equatorial Africa 's magnificent jungles .
They inhabit a narrow band of tropical rain forest about four degrees above and four degrees below the Equator , stretching from Cameroon 's Atlantic coast eastward to Lake Victoria in Uganda .
With about 250,000 of them remaining , Pygmies are the largest group of hunter - gatherers left on earth .
But they are under serious threat .
Over the past decade , I 've visited Pygmy clans in several Congo Basin countries , witnessing the destruction of their traditional lifestyle by the Bantu , as taller Africans are widely known .
On this trip , this past February , my companion is Manfred Mesumbe , a Cameroonian anthropologist and expert on Pygmy culture .
" The Bantu governments have forced them to stop living in the rain forests , their culture 's bedrock , " he tells me .
" Within a generation many of their unique traditional ways will be gone forever . "
The Baka clan members begin putting up beehive - shaped huts in the clearing , where we will spend the next few days .
They chop saplings from among the trees and thrust the ends into the ground , bending them to form the frame of each hut .
Then they weave bundles of green leaves into latticework to create a rainproof skin .
None of the men stands higher than my shoulder ( I'm 5 - foot - 7 ) , and the women are smaller .
As the Baka bring firewood to the camp , Mesumbe and I put up our small tent .
Suddenly the Pygmies stir .
Three scowling Bantus brandishing machetes stride into the clearing .
I fear that they 're bandits , common in this lawless place .
I 'm carrying my money in a bag strung around my neck , and news of strangers travels fast among the Bantu here .
Mesumbe points to one of them , a stocky man with an angry look , and in a low voice tells me he is Joseph Bikono , chief of the Bantu village near where the government has forced the Pygmies to live by the roadside .
Bikono glares at me and then at the Pygmies .
" Who gave you permission to leave your village ? " he demands in French , which Mesumbe translates .
" You Pygmies belong to me , you know that , and you must always do what I say , not what you want .
I own you .
Do n't ever forget it . "
Most of the Pygmies bow their heads , but one young man steps forward .
It 's Jeantie Mutulu , one of the few Baka Pygmies who have gone to high school .
Mutulu tells Bikono that the Baka have always obeyed him and have always left the forest for the village when he told them to do so .
" But not now , " Mutulu announces .
" Not ever again .
From now on , we 'll do what we want . "
About half the Pygmies begin shouting at Bikono , but the other half remain silent .
Bikono glowers at me .
" You , le blanc , " he yells , meaning ‚ " the white . "
" Get out of the forest now . "
The earliest known reference to a Pygmy — a " dancing dwarf of the god from the land of spirits " — is found in a letter written around 2276 B.C. by Pharaoh Pepi II to the leader of an Egyptian trade expedition up the Nile .
In the Iliad , Homer invoked mythical warfare between Pygmies and a flock of cranes to describe the intensity of a charge by the Trojan army .
In the fifth century B.C. , the Greek historian Herodotus wrote of a Persian explorer who saw " dwarfish people , who used clothing made from the palm tree " at a spot along the West African coast .
More than two millennia passed before the French - American explorer Paul du Chaillu published the first modern account of Pygmies .
" [ T ] heir eyes had an untameable wildness about them that struck me as very remarkable , " he wrote in 1867 .
In In Darkest Africa , published in 1890 , the explorer Henry Stanley wrote of meeting a Pygmy couple ( " In him was a mimicked dignity , as of Adam ; in her the womanliness of a miniature Eve " ) .
In 1904 , several Pygmies were brought to live in the anthropology exhibit at the St. Louis World 's Fair .
Two years later , a Congo Pygmy named Ota Benga was housed temporarily at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City — and then exhibited , briefly and controversially , at the Bronx Zoo .
Just last year , the Congo Republic organized a festival of pan-African music in the capital , Brazzaville .
Other participants were put up in the city 's hotels , but the organizers housed the 22 Pygmy performers in tents at the local zoo .
The word " Pygmy " comes from the Greek for " dwarfish , " but Pygmies differ from dwarfs in that their limbs are conventionally proportioned .
Beginning in 1967 , an Italian geneticist , Luigi Luca Cavalli -Sforza , spent five winters measuring Pygmies in equatorial Africa .
He found those in the Ituri forest , in Congo , to be the smallest , with men averaging 4 feet 9 inches in height and women about three inches less .
Researchers are trying to determine why Pygmies have evolved to be so diminutive .
I first encountered Pygmies a decade ago , when I visited the Dzanga - Sangha Reserve in the Central African Republic , an impoverished nation in the Congo Basin , on assignment for Reader 's Digest 's international editions .
The park lies about 200 miles southwest of the national capital , Bangui , along a dirt road hacked through the jungle .
In good weather , the journey from Bangui takes 15 hours .
When the rains come , it can take days .
We arrived at a village called Mossapola — 20 beehive huts — shortly before dawn .
Pygmy women in tattered sarongs squatted around several fires as they warmed water and cooked cassava .
Most of the men were uncoiling large nets near the huts .
About 100 Pygmies lived there .
Through William Bienvenu , my Bantu translator at the time , one of the Dzanga - Sangha Pygmies introduced himself as Wasse .
When the translator told me Wasse was the greatest hunter in the Bayaka clan , his broad face broke into a smile .
A woman walked down the slope and stood by him , and Wasse introduced her as his wife , Jandu .
Like most Bayaka women , her front upper teeth had been carefully chipped ( with a machete , my translator said ) into points .
" It makes me look beautiful for Wasse , " Jandu explained .
Wasse had a coiled hunting net slung over his shoulder .
He tugged at it , as if to get my attention .
" We 've talked enough , " he said .
" It 's time to hunt . "
A dozen Pygmy men and women bearing hunting nets piled into and on top of my Land Rover .
About ten miles along a jungle track , Wasse ordered the driver to turn into the dense undergrowth .
The Pygmies began shouting and chanting .
In a little while , we left the vehicle in search of the Pygmies ' favorite food , mboloko , a small forest antelope also known as blue duiker .
High overhead , chimpanzees scrambled from tree to tree , almost hidden in the foliage .
As we climbed a slope thick with trees , Wasse raised an arm to signal a halt .
Without a word the hunters swiftly set six vine nets into a semicircle across the hillside .
Wooden toggles hooked onto sap­lings held the nets firm .
The Bayaka disappeared up the slope , and a few minutes later the jungle erupted in whoops , cries and yodels as they charged back down .
A fleeing porcupine hurtled into one of the nets , and in a flash Jandu whacked it on the head with the blunt edge of a machete .
Next a net stopped a terrified duiker , which Wasse stabbed with a shortened spear .
After about an hour , the Bayaka emerged carrying three duiker and the porcupine .
Wasse said he sometimes hunted monkeys with a bow and poison arrows , but , he went on , " I prefer to hunt with Jandu and my friends . "
They would share the meat .
When we reached the Land Rover , Jandu held up a duiker carcass and burst into song .
The other women joined in , accompanying their singing with frenetic hand - clapping .
The sound was extraordinary , a high - pitched medley of warbling and yodeling , each woman drifting in and out of the melody for the half - hour it took to return to Mossapola .
" Bayaka music is one of the hidden glories of mankind , " Louis Sarno , an American musicologist who has lived with the Bayaka for more than a decade , would tell me later .
" It 's a very sophisticated form of full , rich - voiced singing based on pentatonic five - part harmonies .
But you 'd expect that , because music is at the heart of Bayaka life . "
Drumming propelled their worship of the much - loved Ejengi , the most powerful of the forest spirits — good and evil — known as mokoondi .
One day Wasse told me that the great spirit wanted to meet me , and so I joined more than a hundred Mossapola Pygmies as they gathered soon after dusk , beating drums and chanting .
Suddenly there was a hush , and all eyes turned to the jungle .
Emerging from the shadows were half a dozen Pygmy men accompanying a creature swathed from top to bottom in strips of russet - hued raffia .
It had no features , no limbs , no face .
" It 's Ejengi , " said Wasse , his voice trembling .
At first I was sure it was a Pygmy camouflaged in foliage , but as Ejengi glided across the darkened clearing , the drums beat louder and faster , and as the Pygmies ' chanting grew more frenzied , I began to doubt my own eyes .
As the spirit began to dance , its dense cloak rippled like water over rocks .
The spirit was speechless , but its wishes were communicated by attendants .
" Ejengi wants to know why you 've come here , " shouted a squat man well short of five feet .
With Bienvenu translating , I answered that I had come to meet the great spirit .
Apparently persuaded that I was no threat , Ejengi began dancing again , flopping to the ground in a pile of raffia , then leaping up .
The music thudded as the chanting gripped my mind , and I spun to the pounding rhythm , unaware of time 's passing .
As I left for my lodgings , at about 2 a.m. , the chanting drifted into the trees until it melted into the sounds of the rain forest night .
I left Dzanga - Sangha reluctantly , happy that I 'd glimpsed the Pygmies ' way of life but wondering what the future held for them .
Upon my return to the Central African Republic six years later , I found that Bayaka culture had collapsed .
Wasse and many of his friends had clearly become alcoholics , drinking a rotgut wine made from fermented palm sap .
Outside their hut , Jandu sat with her three children , their stomachs bloated from malnutrition .
A local doctor would tell me that Pygmy children typically suffer from many ailments , most commonly ear and chest infections caused by lack of protein .
At Mossapola I saw many kids trying to walk on the edges of their soles or heels — trying not to put pressure on spots where chiggers , tiny bug larvae that thrive in the loose soil , had attached themselves .
Wasse gave me a wistful welcoming smile and then suggested we go to the nearby village of Bayanga for palm wine .
It was midmorning .
At the local bar , a tumbledown shack , several half - sozzled Bantu and Pygmy men greeted him warmly .
When I asked when we could go hunting , Wasse sheepishly confided that he had sold his net and bow and arrows long ago .
Many Pygmy men there had done the same to get money for palm wine , Bienvenu , my translator again on this trip , would tell me later .
So how do the children get meat to eat ?
Bienvenu shrugged .
" They rarely get to eat meat anymore , " he said .
" Wasse and Jandu earn a little money from odd jobs , but he mostly spends it on palm wine . "
The family 's daily meals consist mostly of cassava root , which fills the stomach but does n't provide protein .
When I asked Wasse why he stopped hunting , he shrugged .
" When you were here before , the jungle was full of animals , " he said .
" But the Bantu poachers have plundered the jungle . "
Pygmy populations across the Congo Basin suffer " appalling socio- economic conditions and the lack of civil and land rights , " according to a recent study conducted for the London - based Rainforest Foundation .
They have been pushed from their forests and forced into settlements on Bantu lands , the study says , by eviction from newly established national parks and other protected areas , extensive logging in Cameroon and Congo and continued warfare between government and rebel troops in Congo .
Time and again on this visit , I encountered tales of Bantu prejudice against Pygmies , even among the educated .
On my first trip to Mossapola , I had asked Bienvenu if he 'd marry a Pygmy woman .
" Never , " he growled .
" I 'm not so stupid .
They are bambinga , not truly humans , they have no civilization . "
This belief that Pygmies are less than human is common across equatorial Africa .
They " are marginalized by the Bantu , " says David Greer , an American primatologist who lived with Pygmies in the Central Africa Republic for nearly a decade .
" All the serious village or city leaders are Bantu , and they usually side with other Bantu " in any dispute involving Pygmies .
The Ruwenzori Mountains , also known as the Mountains of the Moon , straddle the Equator to form part of the border between Uganda and Congo .
The forests here have long been home to the Batwa , at 80,000 the largest Pygmy tribe ; they are also found in Rwanda and Burundi .
I visited them this past February .
On the Uganda side of the border , our Land Cruiser trundled over a dirt road high along the flanks of the steep foothills .
The hills have long been stripped of trees , but their slopes plunge to verdant valleys — a vast rain forest set aside as a national park .
Several hours from Fort Portal , the nearest large population center , we stopped at a Bantu town swarming with people .
It was market day , and scores of vendors had spread out their wares — goat carcasses , sarongs , soap , mirrors , scissors .
My guide , John Nantume , pointed to a huddle of mud huts about 50 yards away and identified it as the local Pygmy village .
I was surprised that the Pygmies were living so close to their traditional enemies .
Mubiru Vincent , of Rural Welfare Improvement for Development , a nongovernmental organization that promotes Batwa welfare , later explained that this group 's displacement from the rain forest began in 1993 , because of warfare between the Ugandan Army and a rebel group .
His organization is now trying to resettle some of the Batwa on land they can farm .
About 30 Batwa sat dull - eyed outside their huts .
The smallest adult Pygmy I 'd ever seen strode toward me , introduced himself as Nzito and told me that he was " king of the Pygmies here . "
This , too , surprised me ; traditionally , Pygmy households are autonomous , though they cooperate on endeavors such as hunts .
( Greer later said that villages usually must coerce individuals into leadership roles . )
Nzito said his people had lived in the rain forest until 1993 , when Ugandan " President Museveni forced us from our forests and never gave us compensation or new land .
He made us live next to the Bantu on borrowed land . "
His clan looked well fed , and Nzito said they regularly eat pork , fish and beef purchased from the nearby market .
When I asked how they earn money , he led me to a field behind the huts .
It was packed with scores of what looked like marijuana plants .
" We use it ourselves and sell it to the Bantu , " Nzito said .
The sale and use of marijuana in Uganda is punishable with stiff prison terms , and yet " the police never bother us , " Nzito said .
" We do what we want without their interference .
I think they 're afraid we 'll cast magic spells on them . "
Government officials rarely bring charges against the Batwa generally " because they say they 're not like other people and so they 're not subject to the law , " Penninah Zaninka of the United Organisation for Batwa Development in Uganda , another nongovernmental group , told me later in a meeting in Kampala , the national capital .
However , Mubiru Vincent said his group is working to prevent marijuana cultivation .
Because national parks were established in the forests where Nzito and his people used to reside , they can not live there .
" We 're training the Batwa how to involve themselves in the nation 's political and socioeconomic affairs , " Zaninka said , " and basic matters such as hygiene , nutrition , how to get ID cards , grow crops , vote , cook Bantu food , save money and for their children to go to school . "
In other words , to become little Bantu , I suggested .
Zaninka nodded .
" Yes , it 's terrible , " she said , " but it 's the only way they can survive . "
The Pygmies also face diseases ranging from malaria and cholera to Ebola , the often fatal virus that causes uncontrollable bleeding from every orifice .
While I was with the Batwa , an outbreak of the disease in nearby villages killed more than three dozen people .
When I asked Nzito if he knew that people nearby were dying of Ebola , he shook his head .
" What 's Ebola ? " he asked .
Cameroon is home to about 40,000 Baka Pygmies , or about one - fifth of Africa 's Pygmy population , according to the London - based group Survival International .
In Yaoundé , the nation 's capital , Samuel Nnah , who directs Pygmy aid programs for a nongovernmental organization called the Centre for Environment and Development ( CED ) , tells me he struggles against a federal government that allows timber companies to log Cameroon 's rain forests , driving the Pygmies out .
" The Pygmies have to beg land from the Bantu owners , who then claim they own the Baka , " Nnah says .
On the road last February from Yaoundé to Djoum , a ramshackle town near Cameroon 's southern border , I pass more than a hundred timber trucks , each bearing four or five huge tree trunks to the port of Douala .
( Cameroon 's 1,000 - franc note , worth about $ 2 , bears an engraving of a forklift carrying a huge tree trunk toward a truck . )
At Djoum , the CED 's provincial coordinator , Joseph Mougou , says he 's battling for the human rights of 3,000 Baka who live in 64 villages .
" Starting in 1994 , the government has forced the Baka from their homes in the primary forest , designating it national parks , but the Baka are allowed to hunt in the secondary forest , mostly rat moles , bush pigs and duiker , " Mougou says .
" But that 's where the government also allows the timber companies free rein to log , and that 's destroying the forests . "
Forty miles beyond Djoum along a dirt track , passing scores of fully loaded timber trucks , I reach Nkondu , a Pygmy village consisting of about 15 mud huts .
Richard Awi , the chief , welcomes me and tells me that the villagers , each carrying empty cane backpacks , are about to leave to forage in the forest .
He says that the older children attend a boarding school , but the infants go to the village preschool .
" They 'll join us later today , " anthropologist Mesumbe says .
" Goni ! Goni ! Goni bule ! "
Awi shouts .
" Let 's go to the forest ! "
In midafternoon , about 20 children between the ages of 3 and 5 stream unaccompanied into the clearing where their parents are fashioning beehive huts .
" Pygmies know the forest from a young age , " Mesumbe says , adding that these children followed jungle paths to the clearing .
It is nearing dusk when the three Bantu make their threatening entry into the clearing , demanding that we all return to the roadside village .
When the villagers defy Joseph Bikono , the Bantu chief demands 100,000 francs ( $ 200 ) from me as a bribe to remain with the Pygmies .
First I ask him for a receipt , which he provides , and then , with one eye on his machete , I refuse to give him the money .
I tell him that he 's committed a crime and I threaten to return to Djoum and report him to the police chief , with the receipt as evidence .
Bikono 's face falls , and the three Bantu shuffle away .
The Pygmies greet their departure with singing and dancing , and they continue almost until midnight .
" The Pygmies are the world 's most enthusiastic partygoers , " David Greer would tell me later .
" I 've seen them sing and dance for days on end , stopping only for food and sleep . "
Over the next three days , I accompany Awi and his clan deeper into the forest to hunt , fish and gather edible plants .
In terms of their welfare , the Baka here seem to fit somewhere between the Bayaka of a decade ago in the Central African Republic and the Batwa I had just visited in Uganda .
They 've abandoned net hunting and put out snares like the Bantu to trap small prey .
Sometimes , Awi says , a Bantu will give them a gun and order them to shoot an elephant .
Mesumbe tells me that hunting elephants is illegal in Cameroon and that guns are very rare .
" But highly placed policemen and politicians work through village chiefs , giving guns to the Pygmies to kill forest elephants , " he says .
" They get high prices for the tusks , which are smuggled out to Japan and China . "
The Pygmies , Awi says , get a portion of the meat and a little cash .
The Baka here have clearly begun accepting Bantu ways .
But they cling to the tradition of revering Ejengi .
On my final night with them , as light leaches from the sky , women in the clearing chant a welcome to the great rain forest spirit .
The men dance wildly to the thud of drums .
As among the Bayaka , no sooner has the sky darkened than Ejengi emerges from the gloom , accompanied by four clansmen .
The spirit's raffia strips are ghostly white .
It dances with the men for about an hour , and then four little boys are brought before it .
Ejengi dances solemnly among them , letting its raffia strips brush their bodies .
" Ejengi 's touch fills them with power to brave the forest 's dangers , " Awi says .
Unlike in Mossapola , where Ejengi lent the occasion the exuberance of a nonstop dance party , this ritual seems more somber .
Nearing dawn , five teenagers step forward and stand shoulder to shoulder ; Ejengi pushes against each of them in turn , trying to knock them off their feet .
" Ejengi is testing their power in the forest , " Awi tells me .
" We Baka face hard times , and our youngsters need all that power to survive as Pygmies . "
The five young men stand firm .
Later in the day at Djoum , I meet the province administrator , a Bantu named Frédéric Makene Tchalle .
" The Pygmies are impossible to understand , " he says .
" How can they leave their village and tramp into the forest , leaving all their possessions for anyone to steal ?
They 're not like you and I .
They 're not like any other people . "

Ever wonder why some colors seem to calm you , some seem to energize you , and some just seem to drive you mad ?
Well , studies have indicated that colors have direct links with certain kinds of emotions and feelings , and directly affect your moods .
You can influence your mood , or anyone else 's for that matter , by wearing a color to achieve an effect ( i.e. red is a power color , so if you wear it to work , it will help you feel more confident in yourself , plus as an added benefit , chances are that other people will see you as more confident as well . )
Colors work like this in your living space as well , much in the same way .
For example , gentle yellows and greens on your walls help sooth and relax you , and brighter versions of these colors energize you .
Here are a few basic colors and their achieved mood .
Note to everyone : not all these colors have the same effect on everyone , it 's just the majority .
There 's lots of different people , so their tastes are bound to be a little different !
Red : red is a power color , associated with passion , strength and courage .
Orange : orange stimulates creativity , and hunger .
It is warm and creates a soothing , energizing atmosphere .
Yellow : yellow is associated with wisdom , happiness and sunlight .
Wear this color if you 're feeling down .
Green : green is a life color , standing for nature and fertility .
In lighter shades , like cucumber , it is very soothing .
Blue : blue symbolizes loyalty , peace , and truth .
Light blues symbolize youth .
Indigo : indigo is a very deep , spiritual color .
It is soothing , but sometimes depressing .
Purple : Purple is good for meditation .
It symbolizes magic , mystery and royalty .
Keep in mind , weather wearing these colors or using them on your bedroom walls , you need to find the shade of the color that will give you your desired effect .
For instance , light green is relaxing , which is good for a bedroom , and bright green is energizing , which is good for clothing .
Plus , if you do n't like green , it may have a totally different effect all together !
Environmental Group Exposes EPA Whitewashing Posted by Pile ( 9330 views ) [ E - Mail link ]
[ Environment ]
Preliminary water tests from rivers near a huge coal ash spill in Tennessee show elevated levels of pollutants such as mercury and lead , a environmental group said on Friday .
" We 're concerned that the water poses a greater risk to residents in the area than has been revealed so far , " said Matt Wasson , a program director at Appalachian Voices , a environmental group that coordinated the testing of the water with scientists from Appalachian State University .
An earthen dike collapsed on December 22 at the Tennessee Valley Authority 's Kingston coal - fired power plant , spilling coal ash across as much as 400 acres .
The ash , left from decades of coal burning , had been stored in a sludge pond .
The spill extended into a waterway , blocked a road , and ruined three homes , according to the TVA .
Fly ash , a byproduct of burning coal , is known to contain small amounts of heavy metals and other pollutants dangerous to human health .
In 2000 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency decided that the ash would not be managed as a hazardous waste .
The environmental group 's tests , which took place on December 27 , showed higher levels of the pollutants of arsenic , mercury and lead than reported by the TVA and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency .
Arsenic levels from the Kingston power plant canal , for example , tested at nearly 300 times the allowable limits in drinking water .
A sample from two miles downstream revealed arsenic at about 30 times the limit .
" Although these results are preliminary , we want to release them because of the public health concern and because we believe the TVA and EPA are n't being candid , " Robert F. Kennedy , Jr. , chair of the Waterkeeper Alliance , said in a release .
Wasson said the TVA and EPA have not revealed exactly where tests they reported took place and that some of them took place upstream from the spill , where heavy contamination would not be expected .
The TVA , which is spraying the spilled ash with straw and seed to minimize dust and erosion , has said on its
Web site that preliminary testing at the Kingston water treatment plant has shown levels of metals that are below limits for drinking water .
Other tests on rivers near the site showed safe levels , it said .
Appalachian Voices said it has not completed tests on drinking water yet , in part because it takes time for contaminants in surface water to filter down into ground water supplies .
Wasson said hunters and fishermen could also be at long - term risk from consuming fish and birds from near the spill .
Pollutants can accumulate in fish and birds that eat smaller animals living among contaminants to the point where they are dangerous to eat .

Furious parents attack Santa and his elves as tempers fray at Winter ' blunderland ' theme park
With its scrappy lights , huskies tethered in the mud and a broken iceskating rink , festive spirit is already in short supply at Lapland New Forest .
Now the elves have started brawling with the customers .
And Santa himself is nursing a punched nose after a disappointed visitor got tired of queuing in the mud to see him .
Elf and safety : A security guard and a ' happy elf ' helper at the venue with park owner Henry Mears
Smile please : Santa meets a rare happy visitor
The park , featured in yesterday 's Daily Mail , claims to offer families a magical festive experience .
According to the scores of disgruntled visitors streaming out of the gates , experience is one word for it .
As tempers fray , it seems this little corner of Lapland , which opened on the Dorset - Hampshire border at the weekend , is going from mudbath to bloodbath .
One security guard , who obligingly told visitors at the gate they were about to be ' ripped off ' , quit after being hit on the head by one who did n't appreciate the advice .
Disappointing : A soft toy greets children and parents , as they near Santa 's Grotto in his ' log cabin ' , after lining up for two hours or more
Santa 's animal helpers ..

Three elves - one a 17 - year - old girl - are said to have been involved in violent confrontations .
And a child had to be comforted after arriving at Santa 's grotto to find him puffing a cigarette outside .
The violent episodes came to light as it emerged that trading standards had received an ' unprecedented ' 1,300 complaints about the park , now widely known as the ' Winter Blunderland ' or the less polite ' Crapland ' .
Challenging : The ' Nativity scene ' could only be reached across a muddy field
Winter wonderland ?
A visitor makes the best of things as she is confronted by a model polar bear
For those still contemplating buying a £ 25 ticket , a glance at the Facebook social networking website should change their minds .
Five groups on the site with names such as ' Lapland New Forest Is A Rip - Off - Do n't Go ' , ' Lapland New Forest is rubbish and not worth £ 25 ' and the classic ' Lapland Letdown ' should get the message across .
By yesterday afternoon 1,500 people had joined these groups and the site was bristling with complaints .
They ranged from ' the nativity looked like it was plonked in the middle of a war zone ' to ' this is the biggest scam and waste of money since the poll tax ' .
Trading Standards are investigating after the Christmas attraction was described by one disgruntled visitor as more like a car boot sale
Adrian Wood , 49 , the security guard who quit after being smacked by a customer , was full of tales from the warzone .
Santa was punched by a furious father who had been waiting in line for four hours , ' he said .
' He had got to the front only to be told he could n't take a picture of his children and that they were n't allowed to sit on Santa 's lap .
' The family were then told they would have to get in another queue to get their presents .
That was the final straw .
Season 's greetings : Parents should have known they were in for a disappointment when they saw this sign showing the way in
Visitors said the reindeer and huskies were penned or tethered and looked miserable
' And a girl working as an elf was slapped in the face by a woman who was angry that her children were disappointed .
How there were n't riots I have no idea . '
Henry Mears , of Lapland New Forest Limited , claimed his staff were under siege .
' So far about six of our staff - three elves and three security - have been assaulted and all have been verbally abused , ' he said .
The Donkeys scrape around looking for food in their bare pen .
More than 250 families have vented their fury about the site on three Facebook groups
' One of our elves was slapped and had a pram pushed into her leg which has left a horrible bruise . '
But he was resolutely clinging on to his Christmas fantasy .
' I would like to point out that 95 per cent of the people who come to Lapland New Forest are extremely happy with it , ' he said .
Fun for all the family :
This is the so - called ' Tunnel of Light ' , which is actually just a tunnel of trees
2009 was supposed to be the year of OLED TVs .
Sony dazzled us with actually watchable sizes and Samsung flat out said so .
So , uh , what the hell happened to OLED at CES 2009 ?

OLED TVs — a nigh miraculous display tech that blows away plasma and LCD when it comes to sheer OMGorgeousness — were supposed to hit their trade - show fantasy prime this year :
Still too expensive for you and me , but flooding our greedy retinas with stunning images at every corner , just a few months away from hanging on Usher 's bathroom wall .
It 's not just that there are n't any of the big OLED TVs we'd been hearing about — nothing near 40 inches — we 're just not seeing them .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
The announcements were really low - key or non-existent .
Sir Howard gave a brief shout - out to Sony 's new flexible OLED in his keynote .
Not a peep of new product in Samsung 's conference .
The booth footprint is also tiny — remarkably so , considering how hard S & S were cheerleading last year .

TVs being shown off this year would still be crazy expensive , yes , and big ones , retardedly so .
But the argument that the economy deflated the rapidly expanding OLED TV bubble does n't make a whole lot of sense — the economy panic really hit in late summer / early fall , while development cycles are years long .
More than that , affordability has never been a tenant or consideration in the annual parade of what 's new , what 's amazing , what 's next .
Last year , they said it was OLED .
So where is it ?
Samsung says they need to run through at least one more generation of LCD — with a new , heretofore unseen generation of LED backlighting technology — before OLED will be ready for primetime .
And it 's unlikely they 're going to let Sony step ahead of them , so now we 're talking 2011ish at the very minimum .
Not to mention , the plasma guys — Panasonic and Pioneer — are n't even going to talk OLED till they 've finished milking their ultra - thin plasma strategy dry .

There is a bright side , at least for a handful of rich dudes :
A slowed OLED TV development cycle means their 11 - inch XEL - 1s will be special for that much longer .
Andrew Sullivan just asked me ( live , not on e-mail ; bloggers at the Atlantic actually talk to each other ) why I have n't been posting more on Gaza .
The simple answer is that I 'm busy reporting , and I hope to head to the Middle East soon , to personally broker a cease - fire , or at least get some writing done , and see some friends .
The more complicated answer was provided by Marc Ambinder , who analyzed my personal situation correctly : Gaza has overdetermined me into paralysis .
His point : I actually feel too close to this problem , a problem that symbolizes all problems .
It 's true : I have friends in Gaza about whom I worry a great deal ; I 've seen many people killed in Gaza ; I 've served in the Israeli Army in Gaza ; I 've been kidnapped in Gaza ; I 've reported for years from Gaza ; I hope my former army does n't kill the wrong people in Gaza ; I hope Israeli soldiers all leave Gaza alive ; I know they 'll be back in Gaza ; I think this operation will work ; and I have no actual hope that it will work for very long , because nothing works for very long in the Middle East .
Gaza is where dreams of reconciliation go to die .
Gaza is where the dream of Palestinian statehood goes to die ; Gaza is where the Zionist dream might yet die .
Or , more to the point , might be murdered .
I 'm not a J Street moral - equivalence sort of guy .
Yes , Israel makes constant mistakes , which I note rather frequently , but this conflict reminds me once again that Israel is up against an implacable force , namely , an interpretation of Islam that disallows the idea of Jewish national equality .
My paralysis is n't an analytical paralysis .
It 's the paralysis that comes from thinking that maybe there 's no way out .
Not out of Gaza , out of the whole thing .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Marguerite , Baroness de Reuter , a European aristocrat from a bygone age and last survivor of the family that founded the international news agency , died on Sunday aged 96 , friends said .

Marguerite , Baroness de Reuter , a European aristocrat from a bygone age and last survivor of the family that founded the international news agency , died on Sunday aged 96 , friends said .
REUTERS / Dylan Martinez / Files
A patron of the arts , she was the widow of Oliver , 4th Baron de Reuter , whose grandfather Paul Julius Reuter established his news service in London in 1851 after starting out in Aachen , Germany , using telegraph cables and carrier pigeons .
The barony -- a German title granted to Paul Julius in 1871 but later confirmed by Queen Victoria as conferring the privileges of the nobility in England -- becomes extinct on her death , as she and her husband had no children .
“ The name dies with her , ” said her friend Michael Nelson , a former general manager of Reuters .
Another close friend , John Fox , said the baroness had suffered successive strokes late last year .
She died early on Sunday in a French old people ’s home on the border with Monaco .
He said Swiss - born Marguerite , a widow for more than 40 years , was intensely proud of the family link with Reuters , and of the British nationality she acquired through her husband .
Last year Reuters , which had already moved out of its historic headquarters in London ’s Fleet Street , the traditional home of the British press , became part of Thomson Reuters Plc .
Thomson Reuters ’ chief executive , Tom Glocer , said he was saddened to hear of the baroness ’s death , adding :
“ Although the founding family of Reuters were no longer significant shareholders in the company , the baroness did notably attend a service at St Bride ’s Church , London , to mark Reuters ’ historic move from Fleet Street to Canary Wharf in 2OO5 . ”
Marguerite was born on July 14 , 1912 , the daughter of George Uehlinger of Neunkirch , Switzerland .
Friends remembered her as a generous woman who spoke numerous languages , loved bridge , opera and ballet , and enjoyed skiing until well into her 70s .
Known to her English friends as Daisy , she long divided her time between Monte Carlo and Lausanne .
“ She was a very warm - hearted , hospitable person -- generous , philanthropic , a great supporter of the arts and music .
She was always immaculately turned out : elegant , refined and beautiful , with the most angelic smile , ” Fox said .
He said Marguerite would be cremated in Lausanne and her ashes interred there with the remains of her husband , who died in 1968 .
The couple married in 1937 .
My goal has always been to work for ten years and then have enough financial freedom to do whatever I want to do .
Whenever I tell people this they seem to be rather incredulous and sometimes say things like , " sure , you could try . "
Even though I am quite young , I have met enough people to see what keeps them from quitting their jobs and living a life of financial independence .
Here are a few of my observations over the years .
1 . The places they live - I have met a handful of people who are tied down to their jobs because of their mortgages .
There is also a couple I know that could retire right now if they just sold one of their houses and invested the proceeds in government bonds .
However , many people toil on to feed their houses not realizing that they could live in so many other nice places .
Oftentimes , the location of our homes is based on our jobs , and places with an abundance of jobs generally have higher costs of living .
Once the need to live close to work is eliminated it is easy to find a cheaper place to live .
Another observation I have is that people generally have bigger homes when they have kids , but once the kids are grown up and gone they do not downgrade their homes .
Having two to three rooms that are never used is an extravagance in my opinion .
2 . The societal norms -
When you try to break away from the norms of society you will get naysayers .
Unfortunately a lot of financial advice we get in America is based on this notion that we should retire at age 65 and collect Social Security .
When I say that I want to retire when I am 35 I feel that some people think I am a lazy and crazy weirdo .
Even though there is no law that says you can retire only if you are 65 I think a lot of people subconsciously believe that is the right and normal thing to do .
There are laws that state you can collect certain government sponsored benefits at age 65 , but that should not prevent you from living the life you want before arthritis sets in .
I think many people are just a bit afraid to step out and be different .
3 . Pure and simple greed - Some people I know just want more and more every single day .
If their greed is never quenched then they will never be free from working .
Here in the Silicon Valley there are many multi-millionaires or even billionaires who could retire in the blink of an eye , but quite a few of those I have met still work 12 to 16 hour days .
I just do not understand that mindset because it seems that they do not have much time to enjoy all that money .
It may be that they enjoy working , but I think a lot of people just cannot stop working because they feel the urge to accumulate more wealth .
4. Insufficient funds -
Most people including myself fall into this category .
Basically we still need a bit more in our nest eggs before we can comfortably live in our retirement .
I think a small retirement fund is an issue that is by far the easiest to pinpoint .
The problem is that many people I know do not try to do resolve the issue at all .
If one wants to retire early , he or she needs to start saving early .
It is a very simple concept , but many of my peers feel that retirement is so far away that they do not need to save .
The truth is that we all could be financially free so much sooner if we start saving earlier .
5. Familial responsibilities - I do not have kids yet , but I know they are pretty expensive .
I respect those who start and support a family , and it is a huge financial burden .
Family is only a problem when people use it as an excuse to why they cannot succeed .
I think a family that works together towards financial independence can achieve it .
A real life example is the cheapest family in America .
This is a family of seven that never had too much income , but still managed to save quite a bit of money .
If more people treated their family as their strength rather than a burden I believe they can achieve their goals even faster .
I could go on , but I think all of the rest of my observations have to do with people who are kind of stubborn and do not really want to change their lives .
It is curious to me that some of them say that they want to retire early , or even right now , but take absolutely no action .
I think what most of them need is to change their mindsets and believe that it is possible to achieve financial independence , and start doing something about it right now .
So what about you ?
What is your one big obstacle before you are free of the daily grind ?
Mr Steinbruck has not minced his words
The German finance minister has launched an outspoken attack on the UK government 's plans to help pull Britain out of the economic downturn .
In an unusual breach of standard diplomacy , Peer Steinbruck attacked the UK 's decision to cut VAT and raise the national debt to record levels .
Mr Steinbruck said the UK's switch from financial prudence to heavy borrowing was both " crass " and " breathtaking " .
His comments came in an interview with Newsweek magazine .
" There is a broad international consensus that a fiscal stimulus is right thing for economies now , " said a Treasury spokesman .
' Debt generation ' Criticising the UK government 's decision to cut VAT from 17.5 % to 15 % , Mr Steinbruck questioned how effective this will be .
" Are you really going to buy a DVD player because it now costs £ 39.10 instead of £ 39.90 ? " he said .
" All this will do is raise Britain 's debt to a level that will take a whole generation to work off . "
Saying the UK government was now " tossing around billions " , Mr Steinbruck questioned why Britain was now closely following the high public spending model put forward by 20th Century economist John Maynard Keynes .
" The switch from decades of supply - side politics all the way to a crass Keynesianism is breathtaking , " he said .
" When I ask about the origins of the [ financial ] crisis , economists I respect tell me it is the credit - financed growth of recent years and decades .
" Is n't this the same mistake everyone is suddenly making again , under all the public pressure ? "
German spending Chancellor Alistair Darling announced in last month 's pre-Budget report that the government would inject an extra £ 20bn into the UK economy in a bid to get it moving again .
At least £ 15 bn of this total will come from increased government borrowing , which is expected to take the UK 's total public borrowing to £ 118bn next year .
While Mr Steinbruck has accused the UK of over - spending on the economic recovery , the German government has put 480 bn euros ( £ 370.4bn ; $ 645 bn ) into a rescue package for its banks .
Most other European governments have also increased public spending to try to ease the impact of the economic downturn .
France recently announced plans to spend 26bn euros , and the European Commission wants to spend 200bn euros across the European Union .

The grocery store is where I pretend to be a different person .
Through the aisles , the produce , the meat , and the bread , I look for labels : Organic .
Natural .
Free -Range .
Raw .
These are things that I claim appeal to me .
But the crux of this story is not centered upon who I pretend to be , but rather upon who I am : someone who ’s addicted to fattening food .
If it has the potential to bloat my belly or swell my face , I am in love with it .
Real love .
Batter it , fry it , toss it my way — I will make quick work of it .
I move with the speed of a fox that has stumbled upon a dead moose .
I must hurry before the ravenous wolves come in .
No discrimination : if it has flavor , I will consume it .
The problem with this addiction is that it does n’t match up with the idea of myself .
If I were an alcoholic , you might say I suffer from Denial .
But I do n’t .
Denial is for people who do n’t write about their addictions .
What I suffer from is Organic Guilt .
I want to believe that I am a holy vegan .
A purist .
A vegetable guru .
An enlightened frequenter of natural co-ops ( and only co-ops , for it would be imprudent to eat natural just part of the time ) .
Every once and a while , usually while I simmer in my apartment with a dizzying caffeine buzz , I begin to feel noble , superior even , and I ’ll make my way to the local co-op just a few blocks away .
There I ’ll pick out gourds and herbs and raw produce , always with the intention of cooking from scratch some urban delicacy that surely would make the food and health editors at The New York Times happy .
Maybe some day I ’ll jar my own pasta sauce , I think , looking at mounds of fresh tomatoes .
Whereas most men dream of beach vacations teeming with giggly playmates , I fantasize about soup - making .
By now it ’s hard for me to count the number of animal carcasses I ’ve asked my mother to freeze so that I might some day come over and make my own stock .
My parents ’ freezer is a graveyard of from - scratch wishful thinking .
I genuinely do want to cook .
That ’s true .
And on occasion I do .
But most of the time I just think about what I should be cooking while eating fast food or take - out .
At the grocery store , I must put up a front .
Long ago I quit buying frozen foods simply because they do n’t seem to jive with who I think I am .
And having some education , and even cultural savvy , it seems as though frozen food is antithetical to all of that — a tainted backdrop sitting in the portrait of the person I ’ve become .
But the urge to eat easy is still there .
At the grocery store I feel as though I am again in middle school , buying Abercrombie & Fitch in order to assert my dominance over the pimply pups clad with K - Mart .
This is what the grocery store is for me now : an image factory — a place where I am allowed to buy the lifestyle of my choice .
It only costs money .
I know that natural food is not inherently evil — but in my mind it has elevated to a status beyond food , and instead has the ability to define who a person is .
If I buy organic , it ’s not because I think it will taste better or because it will be better for me .
I buy organic because that seems to be what all of the cool kids are doing .
Who am I to blame for the state of natural food as a status symbol ?
Obviously , food has represented a great many things throughout history .
The top - tier fat cats usual dine on whatever elusive slaughtered animal has the highest price point , while the blue - collar set bites into drippy burgers while denouncing fancy crap .
I first became judgmental about peoples ’ food choices after becoming an avid viewer of cooking shows .
This led to a certain food snobbery , a disposition to label and accuse those who do n’t take their eats seriously .
And then something monumental happened .
I began reading about food , devouring the work of authors like Michael Pollan and Eric Schlosser , and I began to feel the great guilt spawned by my own foodie inferiority .
It felt distinctly Catholic .
An unbeatable guilt was born .
Even my food idol Mark Bittman delivered a TED [ http://www.ted.com/] talk about the evils of our eating ways , further nailing shut the coffin wherein my joyful food consumption lay .
I no longer mindlessly intake the foods I was raised on .
I get nervous whenever I desire unethical nutrients .
I have to juggle between the foods I crave and what other people dictate .
Every meal choice is a potential meltdown .
Do I take the easy road and ruin the world by ordering Domino ’s , or do I make vegan pizza using only locally farmed beet - derivates ?
Part of me is worried that I can no longer tell the difference between food that makes me feel good because it satisfies the image I want to project of myself , and the food that makes me feel good simply because of taste .
Eating right , it seems , has become a full - time job .
And in a world already filled with work , the stress caused by maintaining my nutrient levels is too much .
Food , I ’ve discovered , is the last thing I want to feel guilty about .
An angry mob of investors and taxpayers is assembling , and they want to see some executives ' heads on pikes .
The question for the courts will be , Who was just foolish with our money - and who was lying , cheating , and stealing ?

( CNN ) --
An aircraft carrier named after the first President Bush was commissioned Saturday in Norfolk , Virginia .
Former President George H.W. Bush waves aboard the aircraft carrier named after him Saturday .
" Those who are sitting out there , where I was , 65 years ago , preparing to serve aboard your new ship , I wish I was sitting right out there with you , " the carrier 's 84 - year - old namesake told sailors at the commissioning ceremony .
" As you prepare to man this ship , I do know that you take with you the hopes and dreams of every American who cherishes freedom and peace , and you take with you the undying respect and admiration of the entire Bush family , " he said .
The 1,092 - foot , 20 - story USS George H.W. Bush was decorated with red , white and blue banners for Saturday 's ceremony at Naval Station Norfolk .

The 41st president joined the Navy at 18 and served as an aviator in World War II .
He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and three Air Medals for his Navy service in the Pacific during the war , according to the Department of Defense .
His time in the Navy ended after about four years .
About 17,000 people were expected to attend Saturday 's ceremony .
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , Defense Secretary Robert Gates , Vice President Dick Cheney and Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine were there , as was Bush 's son President George W. Bush and his wife , Laura .
" Laura and I are thrilled to be here to help commission an awesome ship and to honor an awesome man , President George H.W. Bush , " the president said .
" So what do you give a guy who has been blessed and has just about everything he has ever needed ?
Well , an aircraft carrier . "
The ship , comprising 47,000 tons of structural steel and about 500 tons of aluminum , is the last of the Nimitz class of nuclear - powered aircraft carriers .
The ship 's construction began in 2003 .
It was finished nearly three years later .
The vessel will carry about 6,000 Navy personnel , the Department of Defense said .
After the ceremony , the president left Norfolk for Maryland 's Andrews Air Force Base on what was probably his last Air Force One flight .
From Andrews , he was expected to take a helicopter to Washington .
White House spokesperson Dana Perino said the president was n't aware that it was his last scheduled flight on Air Force
One until he was told by an interviewer .

Allen & Overy Muzzles Lawyer 's Erotic Fiction
One of the world 's largest law firms , Allen & Overy , has ordered a senior lawyer in its Moscow office to stop publishing erotic fiction on her personal Web site .
A spokesman for the firm told news reporters that the saucy stories written by lawyer Deidre Dare , who is from the United States , violated the firm 's strict rules governing employee conduct .
On her Web site , DeidreDare.com , which features the tagline , " Philosophy can be sexy , " Dare has been publishing weekly chapters of her serialized novel about living in Moscow , " Expat . "
Recently , she stopped adding new chapters and posted this explanation : " The Author has been forbidden from publishing further chapters of Expat for the time being .
She will resume if and when she is permitted to . "
Dare 's
Web site also features her poetry , photographs of her in transparent lingerie , and a page of " philosophy and quotes , " which has just two items : " In order to succeed at marriage , you must fail at yourself , " and , " You know how they say we only use 10 % of our brains ?
I think people also use only 10 % of their lives . "
Her novel details its heroine 's sexual encounters in Moscow with a series of men of various nationalities .
It also describes more routine aspects of living and working in Moscow .
The first chapter opens with this bit of provocation : " There is something thrilling about being in bed with a Frenchman , even if he does have a small ... . "
Ahem , yes , let me stop there .
As if an exercise in parallel structure , chapter three starts similarly : " There is something thrilling about being in bed with a German , even if he does have a tendency to make uninteresting small talk while ... . "
Again , this being a family blog , I will stop short .
In addition to censoring Dare 's fiction , it appears the firm also put a lid on her firm biography .
One news report earlier this week quoted her firm biography 's description of her practice : " Deidre is an international finance and projects lawyer who has represented diverse clients involved in financings , equipment leasing and projects around the world . "
But her biography page now is virtually blank , one of the few without even a photograph .
Instead , it instructs anyone wanting her CV to e-mail the Web site 's administrator .
According to her LinkedIn profile , Dare is a 1989 graduate of Columbia University School of Law .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Barack Obama is planning to issue three executive orders Thursday , including one demanding the U.S. military detention facility at Guantanamo Bay be closed within a year , according to a senior administration official and a congressional aide .
A guard keeps watch from a tower at the military facility at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
A second executive order will formally ban torture by requiring the Army field manual be used as the guide for terror interrogations , essentially ending the Bush administration 's CIA program of enhanced interrogation methods .
A third executive order , according to the officials , will order a systematic review of detention policies and procedures and a review of all individual cases .
The officials said new White House Counsel Greg Craig was briefing congressional Republicans Wednesday afternoon about the three executive orders .
" We 've always said the process would include consultation , " the senior administration official said of the closed - door meeting informing Republicans of the moves .
The detention facility at Guantanamo Bay became a lightning rod for critics who charged that the Bush administration had used torture on terror detainees .
President George W. Bush and other senior officials repeatedly denied that the U.S. government had used torture to extract intelligence from terror suspects .
Obama 's move will set off a fierce legal struggle over where the prison 's detainees will go next .
Watch experts debate the Gitmo dilemma »
" The key question is where do you put these terrorists , " House Minority Leader John Boehner , R - Ohio , said in a statement issued Wednesday .
" Do you bring them inside our borders ?
Do you release them back into the battlefield ? "
The meeting with Craig did not address how the administration plans to handle Guantanamo detainees , said Rep. Bill Young of Florida , the top Republican on the Defense Appropriations Committee .
The executive orders " will leave some wiggle room for the administration , " he said .
Young said he has " quite a bit of anxiety " about transferring detainees to United States facilities .
" Number one , they 're dangerous , " he said .
" Secondly , once they become present in the United States , what is their legal status ?
What is their constitutional status ?
I worry about that , because I do n't want them to have the same constitutional rights that you and I have .
They 're our enemy . "
Watch what may happen to Gitmo's inmates »
He said he asked Craig what the government plans to do with two recently built facilities at Guantanamo , which he said cost $ 500 million .
He said Craig had no answer , but pledged to discuss the issue further .
Young said he suggested reopening Alcatraz , the closed federal prison on an island outside San Francisco , California -- in Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi 's district .
" Put them in Alcatraz , where supposedly they can't escape from , " Young said , but added the suggestion " did n't go over well . "
The revelation coincided with a judge 's decision on Wednesday to halt the September 11 terrorism cases at the behest of President Obama .
On Tuesday , he directed Defense Secretary Robert Gates to ask prosecutors to seek stays for 120 days so terrorism cases at the facility can be reviewed , according to a military official close to the proceedings .
CNN 's Susan Candiotti and Laurie Ure contributed to this report .

The Supreme Court has ruled :
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT : 1 . The petition of Norm Coleman for relief from the December 19 , 2008 decision of the State Canvassing Board rejecting challenges to unmatched original damaged ballots be , and the same is , denied .
But our denial of the relief requested does not constitute a binding determination in a subsequent election contest proceeding .
2 . Petitioner 's motion for a temporary restraining order be , and the same is , denied as moot .
Dated : December 24 , 2008 BY THE COURT Alan C. Page Associate Justice MAGNUSON , C.J. , and ANDERSON , G. Barry J. , took no part in the consideration or decision of this matter .

This appears to be good news for the Franken campaign , but they are likely to remain apprehensive over the following line from the ruling :
But our denial of the relief requested does not constitute a binding determination in a subsequent election contest proceeding .
Source : MNCourts.gov
Unless I am mistaken , which I very well could be ( I 'm not a legal expert ) why could n't the Coleman campaign just take their petition to an " election contest proceeding ? "
This ruling appears to be good news for Franken , but I 'm not certain the issue is actually resolved .
From a legal standpoint Coleman is helpless , at least until a winner is certified ; as an " election contest " implies contesting the result of an election after a winner has been certified .
The State Canvassing Board could require that each county double check their count to try and preempt any such election contest , but even then an election contest seems likely .

Geert Wilders is to be tried for making the film Fitna .
A European politician is to be tried for making a film .
I ’m tempted to say “ Has the world gone mad ? ” but I do n’t want to sound like a Daily Telegraph reader .
The most telling line in the judgement handed down by the Dutch court is , “ [ Wilders ’ statements are ] so insulting for Muslims that it is in the public interest to prosecute ” .
This seems to suggest that the reason for the prosecution is fear of a Muslim backlash .
Exactly the sort of violent tendencies Fitna criticises .
Do n’t get me wrong I understand that Fitna offers a simplistic explanation of a complex problem .
Muslim violence is n’t just religious in origin , there are political , economic and historical reasons too .
I do think that Islam makes these problems worse though .
It makes finding solutions harder and shapes the nature of the violence .
The fairy tales of divine sanction and eternal reward make actions like suicide bombing possible .
I do n’t want to rhapsodise Western values or to pretend our culture does n’t have problems but it ’s time for the West , in particular Europe , to stop compromising .
We need to stand up for what we believe in .
With the rapid advance of technology the next 50 years could be a Golden age for mankind but only progressive secular values can make this happen .
Is n’t it time to leave the darkness of religion behind ?
Edit – I ’m not sure how much good these things really do but there is an online petition here .

Professional right wing angry person John Ziegler ( remember his potty - mouthed but fact - light challenge of 538.com 's Nate Silver ? ) is busy as a beaver , creating the " documentary " Media Malpractice ...
How Obama
Got Elected about how that " librul media " ( * sigh * Can that phrase be retired yet ? )
Shuster : Sarah Palin says your decision to post excerpts out of context on YouTube led to misleading reports .
Your take ?
Ziegler : I 'm sorry that she feels that way .
I do n't believe that 's the case ..
Shuster :
Wait as second , wait a second .
You think it 's accurate to use the word ' assassinate ' ?
Regardless of the heavy criticism , does n't it diminish real assignations when you throw out the word ' assassinate ' because Sarah Palin did n't like some of the questions she got in an interview ?
Ziegler : I believe her character was assassinated , David , and I believe this network played an enormous role in that process and you took the clip of the Katie Couric out of context .[..]
Shuster : But John , even in the documentary , at least in the clips that you 've released , she still can't answer , at least it takes her several opportunities , she still really can't say what she reads .
Does Sarah Palin take any responsibility ....
Ziegler : David , that 's ridiculous .
Apparently you did n't watch the clip .
Shuster : I did ,
She talked about news articles that are widely circulated in Alaska Ziegler :
You 're a joke .
Shuster : John , the joke is the fact that you and Sarah Palin can't take any responsibility for the fact that she was n't prepared to run for vice president .
Does she ever acknowledge that in any of your interviews ?
Ziegler : Did you not watch the clip ?... This is clearly an agenda by MSNBC ... Really ?
So is that your opinion , David ?
Is that your opinion , Shuster : No , I 'm asking you Ziegler :
As an alleged news person , is that your opinion ?
That she was unprepared to be vice president of the US ?
That does n't seem very objective to me ...
Shuster : John , it 's the opinion of 65 % of the people ...
Ziegler :
It 's not your opinion , it 's everybody 's opinion .
Shuster :
It 's everybody 's opinion that 's had an opportunity to interview her , except for you and my question is , when you interviewed her , did she ever express any responsibility for her own shortcomings , any ?
Ziegler : I feel like this is OJ Simpson interviewing the Cobbs Shuster :
It 's a simple yes or no answer ....
David Shuster had a knock - down , drag - out fight with wingnut extraordinaire John Ziegler over his new pseudo - documentary about the supposedly unfair media treatment of Sarah Palin : Shuster started off by telling Ziegler that Palin thought Ziegler mischaracterized her in his promos .
You can't make this stuff up folks , but when it comes to right - wing apologists , anything is possible .
( very rough transcript and not in order ) Shuster then brought up Ziegler 's idiotic statement when he said that the media was " assassinating Palin . "
Right - wing propagandists will cry " victim " everytime .
You see , with guys like Ziegler --- when he 's confronted with facts that disprove his propaganda , he gets abusive .
Where have we seen that before ?
And I find it laughable that Palin and her supporters will not admit that she was ill - prepared to run and has n't taken responsibility for her own actions , but yet they ask average Americans who are losing their jobs to take responsibility for their own failings .
Anyway , Ziegler will be on again for Round 2 with Shuster at the 3/6 PM hour .
It will probably be plenty entertaining .
The right - wingers are so worried about the Fairness Doctrine being pulled , but in reality , when they are given time to explain their positions , that 's when they are exposed as the whack jobs they really are like .... John " The Joke " Ziegler .
More to come ....
The Kremlin ’s own reliance on gas revenues , however , is unmistakable .
Last year , Gazprom provided no less than 20 per cent of Russia ’s entire central budget – about $ 90 ? billion ( £ 60 ? billion ) .
Just as Europe needs Russia to supply its gas , so the Kremlin relies on us to buy it .
Put bluntly , we need each other and the balance of advantage may not be entirely with Russia .
If the Kremlin ever decided to sever gas supplies to Europe for a sustained period , national bankruptcy would surely follow .
Zero or five ?
Last Friday a press release announced that the European Commission has sent a “ Statement of Objections ” to Microsoft .
This is a formal notice that the EC is investigating objections made to Microsoft ’s trade practices ; in this case the tying of Internet Explorer to the Windows operating system .
The latest EC vs. Microsoft fight has entered its second round .
Since browsers are involved , this conflict is important to web developers .
If Opera gets its way , new Windows computers in the EU will have either zero or five browsers installed on them .
Opera ’s complaint
In December 2007 Opera filed an antitrust complaint against Microsoft , and asked the EC to take two actions :
Unbundle IE from Windows .
Require Microsoft to follow web standards .
At the time I wrote an entry in which I was noncommittal on the first point .
Unbundling is logical but pointless because nobody cares which browser he uses .
( Meanwhile I changed my mind : unbundling is logical but so impractical as to make it impossible . )
I was downright afraid of the second request .
Essentially Opera requested the EC to judge web standards implementations , thus giving it power over web standards .
That power does not belong to the EC , but to the international web standards community .
Would web standards become a political pawn ?
( Fortunately , the answer turns out to be No . )
The EC ’s response
Friday ’s press release is the next step in this fight .
The crucial passage reads :
The evidence gathered during the investigation leads the Commission to believe that the tying of Internet Explorer with Windows , which makes Internet Explorer available on 90 % of the world 's PCs , distorts competition on the merits between competing web browsers insofar as it provides Internet Explorer with an artificial distribution advantage which other web browsers are unable to match .
The Commission is concerned that through the tying , Microsoft shields Internet Explorer from head to head competition with other browsers which is detrimental to the pace of product innovation and to the quality of products which consumers ultimately obtain .
In addition , the Commission is concerned that the ubiquity of Internet Explorer creates artificial incentives for content providers and software developers to design websites or software primarily for Internet Explorer which ultimately risks undermining competition and innovation in the provision of services to consumers .
Opera could n’t resist crowing a bit ; it ’s obvious that this is a step in the right direction .
Microsoft reacted businesslike , stating it has received the Statement of Objections and is preparing a response .
What happens next
Under EU trust law the EC will only decide the case after Microsoft has had the chance to defend itself in writing , and , on request , in a hearing .
Microsoft is given eight weeks to prepare the written defense and request a hearing .
The next round will therefore take place in mid-March or so .
The EC will take a political decision , not a legal one .
Either Opera or Microsoft could take the case to a European court if they do n’t like it .
The good news
Fortunately the EC has refused Opera ’s request to “ require Microsoft to follow fundamental and open Web standards accepted by the Web - authoring communities . ”
The relevant sentence reads :
The Commission is concerned that the ubiquity of Internet Explorer creates artificial incentives [...] to design websites or software primarily for Internet Explorer .
It ’s not IE ’s standards support that is judged here , but its ubiquity .
In fact , web standards are n’t even mentioned .
We wo n’t have to worry about political influence on web standards themselves ; the EC has rightly decided to deal with the competition issue only .
That ’s the good news .
The bad news
Now for the bad news .
The more I think about it the more I feel that we ca n’t unbundle IE from Windows .
If we did , any new Windows computer would have either zero or five browsers installed on it , and neither situation is ideal .
On the other hand , the current situation is n’t ideal , either .
Zero
If we take the zero option , any new Windows box sold in the EU will have no browser installed on it .
How do you download a browser without a browser ?
I ’m sure the clever crew here at Quirks Mode can come up with a few solutions , but I ’m also sure an average end user wo n’t have the faintest idea what to do .
Microsoft could help end users a bit by creating a pre-installed program that installs a browser for them — and guess which browser that would be ?
Thus it will have complied with the letter of the EC ’s decision but will for all practical purposes have re-bundled IE .
Besides , it will have genuinely served the end user ’s needs .
Five
But if we want new computers to have a pre-installed browser , we have to install all five .
We ca n’t install one , or even two , three or four ; ending the practice of some , but not all , browsers being pre-installed is the whole point of the complaint .
The five option would work , kind of , but giving a novice computer user five browsers to choose from is deadly to the user - experience .
( In fact , in all the scenarios I could come up with it is the end user who pays the price of unbundling . )
Zero or five ?
This leads to a very confusing situation in which nobody wins and the end user loses .
For these reasons I start to wonder if the unbundling can realistically be executed .
Then again , if we do nothing Microsoft retains its advantage over the other browser vendors .
A nice little conundrum .
I have no ready - made solution , so I pass the question on to the original plaintiff .
Opera , how would an end user get the Internet to work on his shiny new unbundled Windows computer ?
Which icon does he click ?
Which program starts up ?
What else does the end user have to do ?
And what do you think , dear reader ?
Zero or five ?
Or one ?

R : A ( Statistically ) Significant Language
by Ostatic Staff - Mar. 12 , 2008
When people talk about big , successful open - source projects , they often think about software that can be used in large organizations .
So we hear a great deal about the Linux operating system , the MySQL database , and even Ruby on Rails as a framework for developing Web applications .
These packages are obviously quite significant , as well as useful .
But there is a class of open - source projects about which the general public tends to hear very little , despite their importance and power .
These are the open - source programming languages .
The best - known such languages are probably Perl , Python , and PHP , with Ruby becoming increasingly popular as well .
There are many other open - source languages as well , some of which are growing in popularity ( e.g. , Erlang and Haskell ) , others of which remain somewhat obscure ( e.g. , Steel Bank Common Lisp ) , and others of which are fading somewhat ( e.g. , Tcl ) .
And of course , there are open - source implementations of standard languages , such as the GNU compiler of C and C ++.
One of my favorite open - source languages is also one of the least known : R. R is a language for statistical analysis .
It is a full - fledged language , and can do anything that other languages can do -- but it is designed for the rapid manipulation of numbers and data sets .
Built into R are all of the tools that a professional statistician might need .
R is sponsored by its own foundation , known as " The R Foundation for Statistical Computing . "
It was first written in the late 1990s by Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka , from the statistics department at the University of Auckland in New Zealand , as an open - source version of the commercial S language .
Since then , it has grown in popularity and power , offering statisticians a remarkable array of functions .
I used R throughout my graduate - school classes in statistics .
I found that in the time it took a professor to show us how to analyze something in SPSS , I was able to find a corresponding function in R , read the documentation , and execute the R version .
R can handle input data from a variety of sources , ranging from CSV files to relational databases .
For example , I 've connected R to PostgreSQL , allowing me to find and analyze trends in my database tables .
It has a full set of graphing tools , for all of the standard statistical plots you might need .
And while R is a command - line programming language at its core , GUI environments are available for multiple operating systems , including a special Mac version that I have long enjoyed .
Perhaps the most powerful part of R is the community , which is active not only in helping new users , but in producing extensions to the core language and environment .
CRAN , the Comprehensive R Archive Network , is the standard place in which these modules are stored .
R can easily retrieve , install , and use these packages , which provide a wide variety of functions for specific types of analysis .
R is , as I wrote above , a command - line programming language , albeit one that makes it easy to do most statistical processing .
This means that it might seem a bit scary to anyone who is used to graphical environments , or who finds programming difficult .
But there is a wealth of documentation , including many tutorials , available on the Web .
If you 're interested in doing any sort of statistical analysis , whether it be for school , business , or fun -- it 's worth taking a good look at R .
Are you familiar with R , or other useful open source tools for statistics ?
Human rights group Amnesty International has accused Israel of war crimes , saying its use of white phosphorus in Gaza was indiscriminate and illegal .
White phosphorous is frequently used to produce smoke screens , but can also be used as a weapon as it causes extreme burns if it makes contact with skin .
The use of the substance is not illegal under international law , but the indiscriminate use of any weapon in densely populated areas can be the basis of war crimes charges .
Israel has said it will carry out an internal investigation into the use of white phosphorous following similar claims by other rights groups .
Medics in Gaza say over 1,300 Palestinians were killed during the offensive .
Four thousand homes have been reduced to ruins and tens of thousands of people are homeless .
A UN official says 500,000 people have been without water since the bombardment began on December 27 and huge numbers are without power .
A continuing ceasefire in Gaza has allowed more Israeli forces to leave the Gaza Strip and Palestinians to return to their damaged homes .
Israeli political sources say most troops will be out of the territory by about midday ( AEDT ) .
Bulldozers are beginning to clear rubble from streets and Palestinians have started returning to what is left of their homes to salvage clothes and food .
Police are back on the streets directing traffic ; shopkeepers are frying felafels .
But Gaza 's return to life is slow as people come to terms with the scale of the destruction after three weeks of war .
Homes and farms have been destroyed , and thousands remain injured .
The head of the World Health Organisation is now warning that Gaza is exposed to outbreaks of disease .
Aid agencies are beginning to assess the immediate needs of the territory , as well as what it will take to rebuild it ; but until the terms of a permanent ceasefire are agreed , any reconstruction will be on hold .
Hamas has vowed to replenish its weapons arsenal and increase its capabilities but Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev has dismissed the threats .
" Over the last few weeks , Israel has hit and hit hard the Hamas military machine , causing the substantial disintegration of their military capabilities , " he said .
" Despite the bravado one is hearing from Hamas leaders , it 's clear that they will think twice and three times .
They 'll think very carefully before launching again rockets , into Israeli cities trying to kill our people . "

Junior Vs Senior Developers ?
Chris Brandsma recently wrote an insightful post about how we should n’t coddle junior developers .
It ’s a good post and i can definitely understand Chris ’ frustrations on the matter .
There ’s just one thing i do n’t understand though : why do we even differentiate between junior and senior developers ?
First of all , what ’s the difference between a senior developer and a junior developer ?
Is it merely the number of years of experience ?
In previous client engagements , i’ve seen more than my share of bad developers who ’ve had years and years of experience .
Would i trust those developers more simply because they have the experience required to be called ‘ seniors ’ ?
Hell no .
Trust has to be earned , i do n’t care if you just graduated or if you ’ve been writing code for 5 years or more .
When i have to work with someone i’ve never worked before , i assess this person ’s qualities and capabilities on two things : how he thinks about writing code ( in general ) , and how easy he can pick up new concepts / practices / principles .
That ’s it .
A junior developer with little to no experience can often be a lot more valuable than a developer who has 5 years of experience under his belt and just assumes that he knows it all .
With a senior developer , you have to be lucky that he ’s learned from his previous mistakes ( and every developer makes mistakes , no matter how good he is or how much experience he has ) , that he has n’t picked up too many bad habits and that he is open minded .
If you can get a senior developer like that , consider yourself very , very lucky because there really are n’t that many of them .
With a junior developer , you can easily mold them into the kind of developer you want them to be .
They have n’t really had a lot of time to pick up bad habits , and they are eager to prove that they belong at your company so they will be very eager to learn and improve .
All you need is a couple of people who are willing and capable of teaching these young developers .
Of course , with junior developers you do have to live with the fact that they will make rookie mistakes .
You have to review their work a bit more , and make sure that they learn from their mistakes .
If you do this from the beginning , you ’ll quickly notice that the extra reviewing tasks will soon take up less and less work .
At my company , we do n’t really differentiate between juniors and seniors .
The last couple of years , we ’ve pretty much only hired young developers who just graduated .
And so far , it ’s worked out great .
They never get assigned easier tasks or anything like that , and they have to do the same kind of stuff that people with more experience need to do .
The result is that we have a bunch of young developers ( i think the average age of our developers is 24 or something ) who already do a great job , and they ’re constantly getting better .

Install iWork ’09 from the enclosed disc and you ’re ready to go .
Obviously a serial is still required if you choose to download and activate the iWork trial via the Apple website .
Though retail versions of iWork ’09 no longer come with serial numbers , you will need a serial number if you are using the iWork ’09 trial version and decide to purchase the fully - functional version of iWork ’09
Potential Reasons
Why
There are a number of different reasons why Apple may have chosen to take this route .
Firstly , it could simply be that the method of using a serial key is a fairly ineffective anti-piracy tool .
Serials soon become widely available online , making it easy to steal the software without purchasing a license .
Secondly it could be that Apple is planning to take iWork down the same route as iLife , bundling the application as standard with a new Mac .
This is a move I would have already expected Apple to make , as it ’s a logical step towards generating widespread use of their software .
When faced with a choice between iWork and Microsoft Office for Mac , consumers are likely to choose the option they are already familiar with .
If iWork is bundled for free , however , it is a no - brainer to at least give the software a try before electing to purchase Office .
Why Does This Matter ?
It may seem as though this change in policy is a fairly trivial concern , and one not likely to make any difference to you .
However , this type of minor shift can tell a story about what is happening behind the scenes at Apple .
In this case , they would seem to be accepting that anti-piracy is n’t worthwhile ( if people see their software worth stealing , it must be a sign that it ’s good ! ) .
This puts them in a very different camp to Microsoft , who has been inventing ever more elaborate methods of protecting Windows Vista and Office in recent years .
It will be interesting to see how long companies continue the cat and mouse game of copy protection before accepting that it is a phenomenon of the software world that they will struggle to battle against .
i Work Details
At present , purchasing iWork costs $ 79 , and includes Keynote ’09 , Pages ’09 and Numbers ’09 .
I expect that the price will remain the same for a reasonable period on account of the new version just being released ; it could be another year before any move to bundling it with a Mac is considered .
The cream appears to disable the virus ' ability to replicate US scientists say they have developed a cream which could for the first time prevent someone from becoming infected with genital herpes .
The virus is carried by half a billion people worldwide - the disease can be controlled , but it is hard to stop it spreading to others through sex .
This topical treatment , which has so far been tested only on mice , stops the virus from replicating in a new host .
The research appears in the journal Cell Host and Microbe .
The type - 2 herpes simplex virus is sexually transmitted and can cause painful , fluid - filled blisters to develop .
It can also be passed from mother to child during childbirth , putting the infant at risk of brain damage and even death if left untreated .
If we can reproduce these results in people , this could have a powerful impact on preventing transmission
Professor Judy Lieberman
The cream , developed at Harvard Medical School , uses a technique called RNA interference , which stops the genes the virus needs to replicate from working properly .
" One of the attractive features of the compound we developed is that it creates in the tissue a state that 's resistant to infection , even if applied up to a week before sexual exposure , " said Professor Judy Lieberman , who led the research .
" This aspect has a real practicality to it .
If we can reproduce these results in people , this could have a powerful impact on preventing transmission . "
Gynaecologist Dr Gillian Vanhegan said the cream sounded " very interesting indeed " .
" Obviously you would have to know when to use it - but it could definitely be of value to people with a partner who was carrying the virus . "
Dr Nathan Sankar , a consultant in genitourinary medicine at the UK's Newcastle General Hospital , said it was an " exciting " development but warned there was still a long way to go .
" It is still at the very early stages .
In many ways a vaccine which could be taken and forgotten about would be better , but the cream is definitely promising . "
As well as looking into whether the cream can be developed for human use , the team is investigating whether the same principles can be applied to protection against HIV / Aids .

Gigantic nanotubes  examined at CINT
By Neal Singer
A carbon nanotube of micrometer dimensions offers the same conceptual challenge as does a jumbo shrimp :
How can something so small become large , yet remain in its category ?
A relatively huge , lightweight carbon tube with good strength and electrical properties is desirable , all right , because it can be manipulated in the far more accessible micrometer regime .
But is it still a nanotube ?
Jianyu Huang ( 1132 ) at the Sandia / Los Alamos Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies ( CINT ) , and colleagues elsewhere , got around this problem by naming their new creation “ colossal carbon tubes ” in a paper published in an October issue of Physical Review Letters .
“ The structures are remarkable because they are very light , possess good electrical conductivity , and have mechanical properties similar to carbon fibers , ” Jianyu says .
Among possible uses are so - called textile electronics and body armor .
Because of their strange , surprising sponginess — walls of graphite - like carbon kept apart by hollow , rectangular compartments — the colossal fibrous tubes have a density of 0.1 gram , compared with 2 grams for the comparable amount of carbon fibers .
The colossal tubes are about the same length as carbon fibers — in the centimeter range .
And they appear to be slightly stronger — a very desirable , and until now unheard of , property in large carbon tubes .
MIT carbon technology specialist Mildred Dresselhaus was quoted in an online news column of the journal Nature : “ This is a new form of carbon that was unexpected to me . ”
Jianyu , who did the microstructure analysis that confirmed that the walls of such tubes consist of graphitic structure , describes the new creation as “ a porous , giant , carbon fiber - like tubular structure ” of diameters ranging from 40 to 100 micrometers .
Conventional carbon nanotubes are about 10 nanometers in diameter .
The material was made at Los Alamos National Laboratory .
Researchers there led by Yuntian Zhu and Huisheng Peng found that heating ethylene and paraffin oil produced a carbon vapor that condensed into tubes of pure carbon tens of micrometers wide and up to several centimeters long .

Right - sized reactor may soon become reality
By Chris Burroughs
A smaller scale , exportable , lifelong proliferation - resistant “ right - sized reactor ” may be coming soon to a town or military base near you thanks to the efforts of a Sandia research team led by Tom Sanders ( 6063 ) .
Tom has been collaborating with numerous Sandians on advancing the small reactor concept to an integrated design that incorporates intrinsic safeguards , security , and safety .
This opens the way for possible exportation of the reactor to developing countries that do not have the infrastructure to support large power sources .
The smaller reactor design decreases the potential of the countries to develop an advanced nuclear regulatory framework .
Incorporated into the design , says team member Gary Rochau ( 6771 ) , is what is referred to as “ nuke - star , ” an integrated monitoring system that provides the exporters of such technologies a means of assuring the safe , secure , and legitimate use of nuclear technology .
“ This small reactor would produce somewhere in the range of 100 to 300 megawatts of thermal power and could supply energy to remote areas and developing countries at lower costs and with a manufacturing turnaround period of two years as opposed to seven for its larger relatives , ” Tom says .
“ It could also be a more practical means to implement nuclear base load capacity comparable to natural gas - fired generating stations and with more manageable financial demands than a conventional power plant . ”
About the size of half of Bldg. 823 , where much of Sandia ’s energy and water research is conducted , a right - sized reactor facility will be considerably smaller than conventional nuclear power plants in the US that typically have a footprint as large as the Labs ’ Tech Area 1 and produce 3,000 megawatts of power .
With approximately 85 percent of the design efforts completed for the reactor core , Tom and his team are seeking an industry partner through a cooperative research and development agreement ( CRADA ) .
The CRADA team will be able to complete the reactor design and enhance the plant side , which is responsible for turning the steam into electricity .
Team member Steve Wright ( 6771 ) is doing research using Laboratory Directed Research and Development ( LDRD ) program funding that is expected to allow the reactor system to operate at efficiencies greater than any current designs , ultimately giving the reactor the greatest return on investment .
“ In the past , concerns over nuclear proliferation and waste stymied and eventually brought to a halt nuclear energy R&D in the United States and caused constraints on US supply industries that eventually forced them offshore , ” Tom says .
“ Today the prospects of nuclear proliferation , terrorism , global warming , and environmental degradation have resulted in growing recognition that a US - led nuclear power enterprise can prevent proliferation while providing a green source of energy to a developing country . ”
Tom says developing countries around the world have notified the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) of their intent to enter the nuclear playing field .
This technology will provide a large , ready market for properly scaled , affordable power systems .
The right - sized nuclear power system is poised to have the right combination of features to meet export requirements , cost considerations , and waste concerns .
The reactor system is built around a small uranium core , submerged in a tank of liquid sodium .
The liquid sodium from the tank is piped through the core to carry the heat away to a heat exchanger also submerged in the tank of sodium .
In the Sandia system , the reactor heat is transferred to a very efficient supercritical CO2 turbine to produce electricity .
These smaller reactors would be factory built and mass - assembled , with the potential of producing 50 a year .
They would all have the exact same design , allowing for quick licensing and deployment .
Mass production will keep the costs down , possibly to as low as $ 250 million per unit .
Just as Henry Ford revolutionized the automobile industry with mass production of automobiles via an assembly line , the team ’s concept would revolutionize the current nuclear industry , Tom says .
Because the right - sized reactors are breeder reactors — meaning they generate their own fuel as they operate — they are designed to have an extended operational life and only need to be refueled once every couple of decades , which helps alleviate proliferation concerns .
The reactor core is replaced as a unit and “ in effect is a cartridge core for which any intrusion attempt is easily monitored and detected , ” Tom says .
The reactor system has no need for fuel handling .
Conventional nuclear power plants in the US have their reactors refueled once every 18 months .
Tom says much of the reactor technology needed for the smaller fission machines has been demonstrated through 50 years of operating experimental breeder reactors in Idaho .
In addition , he says , Sandia is one of a handful of research facilities that has the capability to put together a project of this magnitude .
The project would tap into the Labs ’ expertise in complex systems engineering involving high performance computing systems for advanced modeling and simulations , advanced manufacturing and robotics , and sensors , as well as its experience in moving from research to development to deployment .
“ Sandia operates one of three nuclear reactors and the only fuel - critical test facility remaining in the DOE complex , ” Tom says .
“ It is the nation ’s lead laboratory for the development of all radiation - hardened semiconductor components as well as the lead lab for testing these components in extreme radiation environments . ”
The goal of the right - sized reactors is for them to produce electricity at less than five cents per kilowatt hour , making them economically comparable to gas turbine systems .
Tom says the smaller reactors will probably be built initially to provide power to military bases , both in the US and outside the country .

Cell analysis platform now available for licensing , partnerships
By Mike Janes
Fully developed research tool supports rapid , precise , efficient , and multiplexed analysis of individual cells , providing a systems - level understanding of cellular behavior .
Sandia is seeking commercial partners to license or contribute to the continued development of a new lab - on - a - chip platform for high - throughput manipulation and interrogation of individual cells , one that enables quantitative analysis of cellular behaviors with unprecedented speed , resolution , sensitivity , and multiplexing .
The Microscale Immune and Cell Analysis ( MICA ) platform is a tool designed to facilitate study of a wide variety of cellular processes .
It has consistently demonstrated its value in initial applications at Sandia , which have focused on elucidation of immune cell responses to potentially deadly microbial pathogens .
MICA integrates cell culture and handling , cell stimulation ( e.g. , introduction of a pathogenic challenge ) , fluorescence - activated cell sorting ( FACS ) , flow cytometry , high - resolution imaging , and antibody - based proteomic analysis .
All experimental manipulations are carried out at the microscale and are fully automated , providing precise control over each cell and its environment .
The closed - system format lends itself well to applications in which containment is desirable ( e.g. , work with dangerous pathogens ) .
Moreover , because microscale experiments consume vanishingly small amounts of cells and reagents , MICA can be used to investigate cellular processes that have proven impossible or impractical to study at conventional scale .
MICA , its developer say , offers a broad array of benefits over alternative approaches :
Better measurements .
Scaling advantages of microchannels provide unprecedented temporal ( millisecond ) and spatial ( micrometer ) control over cell environments , and MICA ’s systems integration and automation eliminates manual steps and the errors associated with them .
Faster , more efficient measurements .
Researchers can use MICA to measure multiple cellular events rapidly and in parallel , without requiring large quantities of cells and expensive reagents .
New measurements .
MICA offers the opportunity to perform experimentation and measurement at single - cell resolution , which is not possible using conventional FACS or proteomic techniques .
Multiplexed measurements for systems understanding .
MICA integrates several analytical techniques in a unified platform , enabling parallel measurement of different types of cellular events ( protein expression , localization , modification , and interaction ) .
Consequently , correlations between measured events may be observed directly , whereas with conventional approaches such correlations must be inferred from the results of separate experiments .
Versatility .
MICA ’s modular format , flexible platform architecture , and convenient packaging ( compact footprint fits any standard inverted microscope stage ) greatly facilitates operation and dissemination to other laboratories .
“ The promise of MICA is immense , ” says Glenn Kubiak ( 8600 ) .
Many of the lab tools used today to study cellular behavior , he says , fall short in speed , throughput , ease , and selectivity .
Full development of MICA , Glenn says , should enable advances in a number of fields of interest :
Diagnostics .
The microfluidic - based platform of MICA is well suited for analysis of small , precious clinical samples ( e.g. , primary cells , tissue biopsies ) .
Even rare cells may be selectively isolated ( via FACS ) and analyzed ( via flow cytometry , imaging , and / or immunoassay ) quickly and efficiently .
Biomarker discovery .
MICA enables identification of complex response profiles through precise quantitation of the expression , secretion , modification , and interactions of proteins in individual cells .
Personalized medicine .
Multiple cell types , drawn from a single patient or from different patients , may be individually analyzed in parallel for extended periods of time to assess the specificity of response to a given treatment .
Drug discovery and therapeutics .
With its multiplexed screening capability , MICA enables quantitative analysis of the responses of multiple cell types to multiple drug candidates in high - throughput , highly parallelized assays .
Immune and infectious disease .
The precision with which MICA manipulates and analyzes cells enables capture of even the most rapid and transient host cell responses to pathogens .
The fully developed MICA platform , Glenn predicts , will provide unparalleled access to realms of biological research that are only now beginning to be explored , particularly with respect to systems - level analysis of the behavior of individual cells .
Sandia ’s business development team is currently soliciting commercial partners .
Additional information on MICA , including fact sheets , technical papers , and information on partnering with Sandia , can be found at www.ca.sandia.gov/mica/. — Mike Janes

NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
After spending nearly 28 years in an irreversible coma , heiress and socialite Martha " Sunny " von Bulow died Saturday in a New York nursing home , according to a family statement .
She was 76 .
Sunny von Bulow is pictured during her 1957 wedding to Prince Alfred von Auersperg .
Von Bulow was subject of one of the nation 's most sensational criminal cases during the 1980s .
Her husband , Claus , was accused of trying to kill her with an overdose of insulin , which prosecutors alleged sent her into the coma .
He was convicted of making two attempts on her life , but the conviction was overturned on appeal .
He was acquitted in a second trial .
His retrial in 1985 received national attention .
" We were blessed to have an extraordinarily loving and caring mother , " said the statement from Von Bulow 's three children -- Annie Laurie " Ala " Isham , Alexander von Auersperg and Cosima Pavoncelli -- released by a spokeswoman .
" She was especially devoted to her many friends and family members . "
Martha von Bulow was born Martha Sharp Crawford into a wealthy family .
She inherited a fortune conservatively estimated at $ 75 million , according to an article on the von Bulow case posted on truTV.com 's Crime Library Web site .
In her early years , she drew comparisons to actress Grace Kelly .
She became known as Princess von Auersperg with her first marriage , to Prince Alfred von Auersperg of Austria .
That marriage produced two children : Alexander and Annie Laurie .
The von Bulows married in 1966 and had a daughter , Cosima .
On the morning of December 22 , 1980 , family members found Martha von Bulow unconscious in the bathroom of the family 's posh Newport , Rhode Island , home .
She never regained consciousness .
She had been hospitalized a year earlier after lapsing into a coma but recovered , according to the Crime Library site .
Doctors had diagnosed her with hypoglycemia , or low blood sugar .
Prosecutors accused Claus von Bulow of twice attempting to kill his wife by injecting her with insulin .
The case also led to a major motion picture , " Reversal of Fortune . "
Actor Jeremy Irons won an Oscar for his portrayal of Claus von Bulow .
Famed defense attorney Alan Dershowitz , who won Claus von Bulow a new trial on appeal after his conviction , said in a statement Saturday that Martha von Bulow 's death is " a sad ending to a sad tragedy that some members of her family tried to turn into a crime .
We proved overwhelming [ly ] that there was no crime and that the coma was self - induced .
We saved his life , but could not save hers . "
Claus von Bulow 's defense team maintained that Martha von Bulow 's alcohol use , among other factors , caused her coma .
Dershowitz said he had spoken with Claus von Bulow , who now lives in London , England .
Claus von Bulow was saddened by his former wife 's passing , Dershowitz said .
The family statement said Martha von Bulow is survived by her children , their spouses and nine grandchildren .
Alexander von Auersperg and Ala von Auersperg Isham , who had sided with prosecutors against Claus von Bulow , filed a civil suit against their stepfather after his acquittal .
The case was settled out of court in 1987 , according to a 2007 article in the Providence Journal newspaper in Rhode Island .
Claus von Bulow had agreed to waive his claim to his wife 's money and to a divorce in exchange for the suit being dropped .
The von Bulows ' daughter , Cosima , sided with her father .
Vanity Fair writer Dominick Dunne , who covered the von Bulow case , told the New York Daily News in 2007 that Sunny von Bulow was moved from Columbia Presbyterian hospital to a private nursing home in 1998 .
Watch Dunne recall case »
Ala von Auersperg Isham served for a time as president of the Sunny von Bulow Coma and Head Trauma Research Foundation , according to the Providence Journal .
An offshoot of that organization , the Brain Trauma Foundation , still operates in New York , the newspaper said .
The family statement notes that Martha von Bulow actively supported the Metropolitan Museum of Art , the Metropolitan Opera and the J.P. Morgan Library in New York and the Preservation Society of Newport , Rhode Island .
A private memorial service will be held for family and friends in New York in the coming days , the family statement said Saturday , along with a private burial .
CNN 's Julian Cummings contributed to this report .

Voted in as Governor of California in a 2003 recall election of Gray Davis and his then $ 34.6 billion state government budget crisis , Arnold Schwarzenegger has since presided over a 40 % increase in spending and a projected $ 42 billion deficit for the current fiscal year .
At the Sam Adams Alliance ’s Sunshine Review , the National Taxpayers Union Foundation has recently assembled an excellent California State Budget web page , explaining the major factors involved :
The immediate source of the short - term problem is that state revenues declined by more than 8 percent from September 2008 - December 2008 .
California ’s state spending has ballooned in the last decade at a rate that is much higher than the rate of inflation and rate of population growth in the state .
According to Tom Campbell , who served as California ’s finance director in 2004 - 2005 , if the 1999 - 2000 budget of former California governor Gray Davis had been increased over the next decade by a factor representing the inflation rate and California ’s population growth in that time , California would now be experiencing a budget surplus , rather than a deficit even with the recent revenue decline due to the state ’s economic recession .
For Fiscal Year 2007 - 2008 , state spending from state sources was $ 144.8 billion ( federal money added another $ 59.5 billion ) .
In FY 2003 - 2004 the figures were $ 104.2 billion and $ 52.5 billion , respectively .
In FY 1997 - 98 they were $ 68.5 billion and $ 31.6 billion .
In other words , over the past 10 years state spending from state sources has more than doubled in nominal terms ( not adjusted for inflation ) , and during the current governor ’s tenure state spending from state sources has risen almost 40 percent .
The web page then outlines the various proposed solutions , including the need to cut government spending and largesse .
An additional and very promising choice would be to begin liquidating California State assets which are enormous in scope and value and are being wasted and mismanaged in the extreme .
In this regard , Independent Institute Senior Fellow William Shughart has shown that even a tiny move in this direction would easily cover any deficit , and he further notes why Schwarzenegger ’s tax and spend mania is exactly wrong :
The latest budget crunch , along with Gov. Schwarzenegger ’s package of ad hoc responses to it , should be proof positive , if further proof were needed , that prosperity will return to the state only when government gets out of the way .
. . .
Gov. Schwarzenegger wants to tax and spend the state ’s way toward budget balance .
But the combination of economic stimulus proposals he announced on November 6 is like rearranging the chairs on the deck of the Titanic after hitting the iceberg .
Meanwhile , Schwarzenegger has been seeking a federal emergency loan of $ 7 billion or more , claiming that the only reason why the federal bailouts program is not working is “ the way it was marketed . ”
The Spoof has since lampooned Schwarzenegger in their hilarious article , “ Schwarzenegger Proposes $ 100 Trillion Bailout . ”
We ’re in the final 100 hours of the Bush era , but we ’re not out of the woods yet .
Before its time is up , the Administration is still trying to open up new areas to offshore drilling , and they ’re trying to bury a Pentagon inspector general report on the military ’s TV pundits program with a 4 p.m. Friday afternoon release .
Then there are the last - minute pardons expected sometime between now and noon Tuesday .
