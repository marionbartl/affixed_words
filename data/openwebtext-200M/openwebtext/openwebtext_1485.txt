A BREWER has won his fight to market a beer named after the Austrian village of F** king .
The Sun reported today European Union officials originally rejected the brand " F** king Hell beer " on the grounds that it contained a swear word .
But after the brewery proved the village actually existed , officials were forced to back down .
Brewery spokesman Stefan Fellenberg said : " In German the word for a lager beer is a Helles Beer , so we have also patented the name F** king Hell , which means lager from F ** king of course .
" I do n't understand why the patents office think of something else .
They must have dirty minds . "
The village of F**king , to the north of Salzburg , close to the German border , has been in the headlines in the past , because of its unusual name .
Last year Mayor Franz Meindl complained that tourists were flocking to the village to steal the road signs .
Now it seems the village has tired of fighting its popularity and is set to cash in .
The bizarre name is understood to come from a sixth century noble called Lord Focko , with ' ing ' being old German for ' family of ' .
The German pronunciation is different from the English .
Mr Meindl added : " I am looking forward to getting the first - crate .
Until then I 'm reserving judgement .
But maybe it could be good for local industry . "

In the last few days we ’ve seen a couple of classic pieces of lousy and wholly uncritical technology churnalism in the media .
One , the spurious claim that ‘ Facebook cause syphilis ’ was quickly taken apart by Ben Goldacre despite the somewhat worrying refusal of NHS Tees to provide Ben with access to the data on which the ridiculous claim , which , rather alarmingly , was made by the trust ’s Director of Public Health .
That leaves me to tackle this story , which emerged as wire copy from the Press Association and rapidly found its way into both the Daily Mail and The Sun before , worryingly , creeping into the industry press as well :
Typing technology ‘ pervert trap ’
Paedophiles using the internet to target youngsters could be tracked down – by the way they use a keyboard .
Researchers are investigating ways to use technology that can determine a typist ’s age , sex and culture within 10 keystrokes by monitoring their speed and rhythm .
Former Northumbria
Police detective chief inspector Phil Butler believes the technology could be useful in tracking down online fraudsters and paedophiles .
Professor Roy Maxion , associate professor at Newcastle University , has been carrying out the research in the US .
This is industrial - grade bullshit piece of advertorial from start to finish but , for reasons that will shortly become clear , still well worth picking to pieces .
Let ’s start by telling you the truth about Dr Roy Maxion ’s background and his actual research .
Dr. Maxion is , indeed , a bona fide academic who is actually based at prestigious private research university , Carnegie Mellon , in the United States .
He is not , however , currently listed as an associate professor at Newcastle University nor is there anything to suggest that he has ever been given that particular title .
He did , however , spend 12 months at the University , some six years ago , as a Senior Visiting Fellow thanks to a grant provided by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council .
Dr. Maxion ’s primary research field is , indeed , computer systems security and intrusion detection , and the development and evaluation of keystroke analysis algorithms is a significant part of his current work , much of which is helpfully available and accessible via his personal publications page .
Having read several of his papers , including his most recent published work “ Comparing Anomaly - Detection Algorithms for Keystroke Dynamics . ” ( Killourhy and Maxion , 2009 ) , I think its safe to say that he is very credible research academic and , moreover , one who not prone to exaggeration or to making overblown claims for his work that cannot be backed up by solid research evidence .
All of which would explain there are no direct quotations from Dr. Maxion in any of the coverage given to this story even thought it is ostensibly based on his work .
Having read several of his papers I cannot imagine , in a million years , that he would willing put his good name and academic reputation to the proposition that ’s being bandied around by Phil Butler :
Mr Butler said : “ He takes 50 people at a time and hooks their fingers up to electronic sensors , then videos , monitors and records their typing patterns , speed and rhythms with a very accurate clock .
“ He can now identify anyone using a keyboard within a 95 % accuracy within 10 keystrokes .
As soon as you type 10 numbers or letters he can work out your sex , your culture , your age and whether you have any hand injuries .
With Phil Butler ’s full claim now on the table , its time to separate science - fact from science - fiction .
The science of keystroke dynamics is based on the premise that the rhythm and manner in which we type on a keyboard can be recorded , analysed as used as a biometric identifier in computer security systems .
In very simple terms , were you to install such a system as a security device on your home computer then you would first have to provide it with a reference sample by , for example , typing in your access password several times in order to create a biometric signature .
Once that biometric signature has been created then , every time to log on to your computer and type in the password , the system would check both that the password is correct and that the manner in which is was typed in matches up to your recorded signature , giving you access only if both match – and that is all there is to it .
It is an extra layer of security , one that , if it could be made to work reliably , would afford some additional protection against individuals gaining unauthorised access to computer systems using stolen passwords and , in that sense , its broadly analogous to the use of forensic document examination to authenticate written material by , amongst other things , comparing a suspect piece of handwriting , such a signature on a cheque , with a reference sample in order to identify whether the suspect item may be a forgery .
Forensic document examination of that kind is widely used in law enforcement circles in the detection and investigation of fraud and forgery and its a perfect respectable practice which generates evidence that is admissible in court – but it is n’t graphology , the pseudo - scientific notion that one can identify an individual ’s gender , age or personality traits from their handwriting …
… and neither is the kind of keystroke analysis that Dr Maxion is researching .
This is where Phil Butler crosses the line from commenting on genuine research – the reference to analysing a mere ten keystroke is particularly revealing as this is a good length for a pretty secure password – into peddling pseudo - scientific bullshit .
The research method that Butler is describing is accurate enough , but the suggestion that it could be used to identify an unknown typist ’s gender , age , culture or even whether they have a hand injury is complete and utter bollocks .
That being the case , one has to wonder why Butler is bullshitting in such an obvious and easily debunked manner ?
Is it just a matter of him being an overzealous ex-Plod trying to scare off a few on - line nonces ?
Mr Butler said the university was planning to submit a proposal to the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council to fund further research .
He said the technology could also be used to prevent fraud at devices such as cash machines .
[ Press Association ]
Mr Butler is also a director of iSafely , a training programme which teaches parents and businesses how to deal with issues such as online fraud or cyber - bullying .
He is working with Checkstick , a company that produces software stored on a USB stick that takes a snapshot every five seconds while a child is browsing the internet .
Checkstick ’s Sean Kane said : “ The internet is a very anonymous place and there are more and more people trying to take advantage of the situation .
“ But there are people out there trying to do something about it . ” [ The Sun ]
Like selling internet monitoring software to over - anxious parents at £ 39.95 a throw .
As laughable as Butler ’s claims about the capabilities of keystroke dynamics analysis might be , there is a much darker side to his arguments :
Mr Butler said the technology could also be used to prevent convicted sex offenders committing further crimes .
“ As part of a sexual offences prevention order , courts currently have the power to ban a sex offender from using a computer , ” he said .
“ With this technology the courts could force the offender to provide an example of their typing as a way of ensuring they do n’t use a computer .
This could then be analysed to see whether the sex offender has been using internet chatrooms . ”
For such a system to work the recording and transmission of keyboard dynamics information would have to built into every single computer connected to the internet ; and at the operating system level in order to prevent users installing clean chat clients that do n’t record / transmit keystroke data or using software to filter that data out of their upstream connection , turning the internet into a global electronic panopticon in the process .
As ideas go , that ’s one that only an ex-Plod who ’s trying to build a post - retirement career in the IT security sector could love , let alone take seriously .
More cars scrapped than sold in US for first time since second world war
America 's love affair with the automobile could be sputtering to an end .
Some 14 m cars were taken out of action in 2009 , 4 m more than rolled off the assembly lines and onto the roads , a report from the Earth Policy Institute said today .
It was the first time more cars were scrapped than sold since the second world war , reducing the size of the US car fleet from an all - time high of 250 m to 246m .
Last year was an extraordinarily bad year for the US auto industry .
Two of the three big car makers — GM and Chrysler — went through bankruptcy and were bailed out by the US government .
Sales fell 21.2 % from 2008 and the total sales volume was the lowest since 1982 .
Many consumers held off buying new cars because of fears of losing their jobs .
The Obama administration 's efforts to spur demand by offering motorists up to $ 4,500 on trade - ins of older cars and pick - up trucks saw 700,000 older models taken off the road .
But that did not affect the total number of vehicles on the road because consumers could only take advantage of the scrappage scheme if they replaced their old clunkers with new more efficient vehicles .
Lester Brown , president of the Earth Policy Institute , said the slump in car sales goes beyond the economic recession .
Americans may finally have decided that — with cars — enough is enough .
The country now has 246 m licensed cars for 209 m licensed drivers .
" This is not a one - time event .
We expect the shrinkage to continue into the indefinite future , " Brown told a conference call today .
He predicted the US car fleet would shrink by 10 % by 2020 .
He said he believed that America had reached the saturation point for cars .
Japan recorded a similar milestone in 1990 , and its fleet has declined by 21 % since then .
" If we want to get all our vehicles on the road at once we could n't do it because we do n't have enough drivers , " he said .
America has also undergone a transition into a largely urbanised society , with four out of five residents living in towns .
Major US corporations are now taking congestion into account when planning new offices , Brown said .
Washington and other major US cities have been raising parking fees to increase revenue .
Others are exploring congestion charges .
A younger generation — unsure about finding a job after high school or college — is also far less likely to see car ownership as a rite of passage , Brown , adding that the decline in car sales , plus increasing fuel efficiency , would help bring down America 's greenhouse gas emissions .
" No one knows how many cars will be sold in the years ahead , but given the many forces at work , US vehicle sales may never again reach the 17 m that were sold each year between 1999 and 2007 .
Sales seem more likely to remain between 10 m and 14 ma year , " he said .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
The only known aerial photographs of the World Trade Center as it collapsed on September 11 , 2001 , were released by ABC News on Wednesday .
The photos , taken from a helicopter by New York Police Det. Greg Semendinger , show the twin towers in flames , falling amid huge , billowing clouds of dust , debris and smoke that envelop downtown Manhattan .
The 13 photographs were among thousands of pictures that ABC News sought under the Freedom of Information Act from the National Institute of Standards and Technology , which investigated the collapse of the towers , agency spokeswoman Gale Porter said .
While other photographs of the falling towers were taken on September 11 , 2001 from satellites , rooftops and other aircraft , these photos are the only ones known to have been taken up close from an aircraft flying overhead in city airspace .
Nearly 3,000 people died when the twin towers were attacked by hijacked airliners .
The aerial photographs had been partially published in the past but now are publicly available to researchers .
“ With these pictures , you move from a specific slice of information to much greater context , ” said Jan Ramirez , chief curator at the National September 11 Memorial & Museum .
The photos are at:here
From a review of The Uncensored Bible :
In court we swear to tell the truth with a hand placed on the Bible .
But in the book itself , Jacob , nearing death in Egypt , asks Joseph to swear an oath not to bury him there by “ put[ting ] your hand under my thigh ” ( Gen. 47:29 ) .
Earlier in Genesis , Jacob wrestles with God , who touches “ the hollow of his [ Jacob ’s ] thigh ” ( 32:25 ) .
“ Thigh ” happens to be a biblical euphemism for male genitalia ; it ’s from Jacob ’s “ thigh ” or “ loins ” that his numerous offspring sprang .
This was new to me :
The practice of swearing an oath while touching one ’s or someone else ’s testicles was common in the ancient Near East ( Abraham also orders a servant to do just that in Genesis 24:2 ) .
Its linguistic memory survives in our word “ testify ” –testis being the Latin both for “ witness ” and the male generative gland .
I will never be able to listen to George Clinton and Parliament 's funkadelic classic , " I just want to testify , what your love has done for me , " in the same way again .
The album title is interesting in this context also .
I recently lost 16 lbs in the space of 6 weeks .
We live in a sit down culture
and much of my work is performed in a chair in front of clients and computers .
The middle - age pot belly is an inevitable result for many modern workers .
Because I am not an exercise machine or gym membership or fad diet kind of guy ,
I looked for over a year before I finally found a belly fat burning program I
could live with .
I was conscious of the fact that most weight loss programs result in failure ,
with a majority of individuals putting the weight back on and then some within
12 months !
I believe this happens because most people approach weight loss as a problem to
be solved : ` I want to lose weight but I do n’t want to change my lifestyle
habits . ’
I meet many individuals who approach their career issues with the same
problem - solving attitude : ` I ’ve got a job I hate but it pays my bills and
provides a good salary and benefits , so how do I replace my income and benefits
if I quit my job ?’
I ’ve lost weight and I ’ve changed careers , so I can speak personally to both
problems .
Like most people , I try to solve a problem in order to avoid negative
consequences .
So , when I read recently how excessive belly fat contributes to a
wide range of health issues during middle age and beyond , I decided to lose
weight in order to avoid those problems .
Similarly , many people come to me for career advice on how to avoid the negative
consequences of a bad jobfit .
Often , they feel drained by their job , and want
to avoid the inevitable burnout or depression ( now the # 1 workplace
disability ) .
Or , they have read the economic tea leaves and anticipate a
forthcoming layoff .
Or , new technology being introduced into their workplace is
going to change their job duties in a negative way .
Or , they do n’t like their
boss or the people they work with .
Or , their life situation has changed and
they need to move on .
Naturally , negative job conditions foster bad feelings , even intense emotional
conflict .
Just by taking the action to visit with me and talk about these
issues can reduce the emotional conflict they feel .
In the same way , once
people see they can lose weight by taking some kind of effective action , it
reduces the emotional conflict they feel about their weight issues .
To start the process of losing weight , we can join a gym , or buy a food portion
meal replacement program , or start a diet .
Similarly , we can change careers by
going back to school , reconnecting with our Linked In network , or writing a
business plan .
However , we are all human beings , and once we experience relief from bad
feelings , our motivation to change weakens and we feel less need to act .
It is very easy to backslide then into old eating habits .
Or , it is easier to
go back to the same job or something similar thinking that something fundamental
has changed .
But it has n’t .
If we keep eating the way we have always eaten , we put the
weight back on .
If we go back to a job misfit , it ’s only a matter of time
before the same issues rear their ugly heads once again .
To keep the weight off , we need to make some real lifestyle changes .
To really
change careers , we have to make some hard choices and trade - offs for a new
career .
When tougher choices are needed , when actions get harder to take , we think we
can make things happen by exerting self - control .
We try to manipulate the
conflict to go away –with self - imposed incentives , rewards , punishments .
If I
lose 5 lbs this week , I ’ll go shopping for a new outfit .
If I send out 3
resumes this week , I ’ll buy a flat screen tv to force myself to send out another
3 next week because I ’m going to need a new job to make the payments on my
credit card .
Studies clearly show that this strategy of conflict manipulation does not
deliver long term success .
When are motivation is driven by solving intense
emotional conflict , the relief is always temporary .
Emotional conflict leads us to act .
Because we ’ve acted , we feel better–even
if the situation has n’t changed very much .
Feeling better takes the pressure
off , which in turn reduces the emotional pressure we feel .
Less emotional
conflict means there is less motivation to continue doing the things that
reduced the conflict in the first place .
Since we feel better , there is no
pressing need to follow through with more actions .
And the original behavior
returns .
This is why as many as 95 % of dieters have put the weight back on within 12
months .
And , while 95 % of workers think about changing careers at least once a
week , only 5 % ever act on that thought .
The only way off this merry - go - round of problem solving and conflict
manipulation is to create a clear picture–a vision if you will –for the outcome
you truly desire .
What I say to my clients is : Instead of trying to fix your bad job situation
( a problem orientation ) , let ’s shift your focus to creating job joy ( an outcome
orientation ) .
Yes , it is important is to find a short term solution to a problem but
understand that nothing really changes … until it actually does .
Lasting change
is the result of effective and efficient actions organized around what really
matters to you over the long term .
You can make the best short term choices in the world but if your motivation is
to fix a career problem you have now or might have in the near future , you ’ll be
back to your old tricks within a few years .
No wonder so many people give up on losing weight or changing careers !
They
do n’t know why they ca n’t pull it off .
They ’re sincere about it .
They know the
stakes are high .
But each time they try , their short term success is scuttled
by circumstances beyond their control …or so it seems .
I ’ve reached a plateau in my weight loss .
To reach my ideal weight , I need to
make more changes in my eating and exercise habits .
What motivates me to do so
is the picture I carry in my head of things I will do with my optimal health .
What really matters to me is being very healthy as I move through middle age .
Weight loss is just one part of that bigger vision .
Similarly , I carry around a written Vision statement of my career 20 years or so
down the road .
What keeps me going today–taking what are often small , mundane ,
routine actions–is focusing on what really , really matters to me further down
the career path .
That is why I wrote my new eBook , JobJoy : Finding Your Right Work
Through the
Power of Your Personal Story .
You already have everything you need to get out
of yhour career trap and into a better jobfit , one that combines vitality and
security for a better life .
It ’s not rocket science .
But it does take time , energy and money .
However , the
Return on that Investment is priceless !

ANALYSIS / OPINION :
The Democrats are assaulting the very pillars of our democracy .
As the debate on Obamacare reaches the long , painful end , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is confronting a political nightmare .
She may not have the 216 votes necessary to pass the Senate ’s health care bill in the House .
Hence , Mrs. Pelosi and her congressional Democratic allies are seriously considering using a procedural ruse to circumvent the traditional constitutional process .
Led by Rep. Louise M. Slaughter , New York Democrat and chairman of the House Rules Committee , the new plan - called the “ Slaughter Solution ” - is not to pass the Senate version on an up - or - down vote .
Rather , it is to have the House “ deem ” that the legislation was passed and then have members vote directly on a series of “ sidecar ” amendments to fix the things it does not like .
This would enable House Democrats to avoid going on the record voting for provisions in the Senate bill - the “ Cornhusker Kickback , ” the “ Louisiana Purchase , ” the tax on high - cost so - called “ Cadillac ” insurance plans - that are reviled by the public or labor - union bosses .
If the reconciliation fixes pass , the House can send the Senate bill to President Obama for his signature without ever having had a formal up - or - down vote on the underlying legislation .
Many Democrats could claim they opposed the Senate bill while allowing it to pass .
This would be an unprecedented violation of our democratic norms and procedures , established since the inception of the republic .
Article 1 , Section 7 of the Constitution stipulates that for any bill to become a law , it must pass both the House of Representatives and the Senate .
That is , not be “ deemed ” to have passed , but actually be voted on with the support of the required majority .
The bill must contain the exact same language in both chambers - and in the version signed by the president - to be a legitimate law .
This is why the House and Senate have a conference committee to iron out differences of competing versions .
This is Civics 101 .
The Slaughter Solution is a dagger aimed at the heart of our system of checks and balances .
It would enable the Democrats to establish an ominous precedent :
The lawmaking process can be rigged to ensure the passage of any legislation without democratic accountability or even a congressional majority .
It is the road to a soft tyranny .
James Madison must be turning in his grave .

Mr. Obama is imposing a leftist revolution .
Since coming to office , he has behaved without any constitutional restraints .
The power of the federal government has exploded .
He has de facto nationalized key sectors of American life - the big banks , financial institutions , the automakers , large tracts of energy - rich land from Montana to New Mexico .
His cap - and - trade proposal , along with a newly empowered Environmental Protection Agency , seeks to impose massive new taxes and regulations upon industry .
It is a form of green socialism : Much of the economy would fall under a command - and - control bureaucratic corporatist state .
Mr. Obama even wants the government to take over student loans .
Yet his primary goal has always been to gobble up the health care system .
The most troubling aspect of the Obamacare debate , however , is not the measure ’s sweeping and radical aims - the transformation of one - sixth of the U.S. economy , crippling tax increases , higher premiums , state - sanctioned rationing , longer waiting lines , the erosion of the quality of medical care and the creation of a huge , permanent administrative bureaucracy .
Rather , the most alarming aspect is the lengths to which the Democrats are willing to go to achieve their progressive , anti-capitalist agenda .
Obamacare is opposed by nearly two - thirds of the public , more than 60 percent of independents and almost all Republicans and conservatives .
It has badly fractured the country , dangerously polarizing it along ideological and racial lines .
Even a majority of Democrats in the House are deeply reluctant to support it .
Numerous states - from Idaho to Virginia to Texas - have said they will sue the federal government should Obamacare become law .
They will declare themselves exempt from its provisions , tying up the legislation in the courts for years to come .
Mr. Obama is willing to devour his presidency , his party ’s congressional majority and - most disturbing - our democratic institutional safeguards to enact it .
He is a reckless ideologue who is willing to sacrifice the country ’s stability in pursuit of a socialist utopia .
The Slaughter Solution is a poisoned chalice .
By drinking from it , the Democrats would not only commit political suicide .
They would guarantee that any bill signed by Mr. Obama is illegitimate , illegal and blatantly unconstitutional .
It would be worse than a strategic blunder ; it would be a crime - a moral crime against the American people and a direct abrogation of the Constitution and our very democracy .
It would open Mr. Obama , as well as key congressional leaders such as Mrs. Pelosi , to impeachment .
The Slaughter Solution would replace the rule of law with arbitrary one - party rule .
It violates the entire basis of our constitutional government - meeting the threshold of “ high crimes and misdemeanors . ”
If it ’s enacted , Republicans should campaign for the November elections not only on repealing Obamacare , but on removing Mr. Obama and his gang of leftist thugs from office .
It is time Americans drew a line in the sand .
Mr. Obama crosses it at his peril .

Sen. James Inhofe ( R - Okla . ) , one of the world ’s most vociferous climate skeptics , is practically giddy these days .
He ’s argued since 2003 that global warming is a massive “ hoax ” being played on the American people , and now he believes he ’s got more backing than ever before for his claim , from “ Climategate ” emails to errors in the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to the recent blizzards in Washington , D.C.
( He gleefully hyped an igloo built by his grandkids as “ Al Gore ’s new home . ” )
Inhofe did n’t get as much attention as he might have hoped for during his December visit to Copenhagen to denounce climate treaty negotiations , but he tried to reclaim the stage this week during a Senate hearing that addressed EPA ’s efforts to regulate greenhouse gases .
He argued that “ the science of the IPCC … has been totally discredited ” and unveiled an 84 - page report titled ‘ Consensus ’ Exposed : The CRU Controversy .
“ It ’s a report on the scandal that has become known as Climategate , ” he explained .
“ Many of [ the world ’s leading climate ] scientists have manipulated data to fit preconceived conclusions …
They cooked the science . ”
Inhofe ’s report even suggested that some climate scientists “ may have violated federal laws . ”
( Watch his hearing statement below . )
I spoke with Inhofe by phone right after the hearing about who ’s perpetrating the climate hoax , who ’s being hoodwinked by it , and why he does n’t believe clean energy creates jobs .

Q. Sen .
Inhofe , hi , how are you ?
A. I ’m cold , of course , but I ’m good .
Q. You got your snow boots on ?
A. I do .
[ Laughs . ]
Q . You reasserted in today ’s hearing your belief that global warming is a hoax .
Can you clarify specifically who is perpetrating the hoax ?
Who are the dupers and who are the victims of the climate hoax ?
A . Who are the victims ?
It would be the United States .
It would be the economy , what would happen to this country according to MIT * and others who have made analyses as to the economic destruction that would come with something like cap - and - trade or [ regulating greenhouse - gas emissions ] through the Clean Air Act .
Q. Who are the perpetrators of the hoax ?
A. That ’s the United Nations and the IPCC , clearly .
Q. Major energy companies have said they believe the scientific consensus on climate change .
ExxonMobil said the appropriate debate is n’t on whether the climate is changing , but what we should do about it .
NASA , NOAA , the Pentagon , the Pope , evangelical leaders , top executives in all industries , and governments all over the world including China and India–they ’ve all acknowledged climate change .
Do you believe that all of these entities have been scammed by the U.N. and a handful of scientists in the IPCC ?
A . What you ’ve just said is not true .
There ’s not unanimity at all even though you want to believe it .
NOAA and NASA and all these organizations , these people are all tied in to the IPCC .
There are a lot of companies , oil companies and all that , who would like to have cap - and - trade .
That ’s where they can make money .
Q. What do you believe is the motive of the U.N. ?
What is the motive of the scientists who are perpetrating the hoax ?
How do you think they stand to benefit ?
A . They stand to benefit [ from ] government grants and private sector grants [ from places ] like the Heinz Foundation .
We have scientists who are really sincere , and they ’ve watched what ’s going on and they have a hard time believing it .
Those are the ones who started going to me probably seven or eight years ago , saying they ’re cooking the science on this , someone ’s got to say it , and I said it .
And then more of them came .
I listed them on my website .
I ’ve been very clear all along who the perpetrators were , what the motives were .
Q . So you believe that the U.N. and the scientists on the IPCC are perpetrating the hoax in order to get grant money ?
A . No , no , no .
We ’ve already covered this , Amanda .
You guys always ask the same question over and over again looking for a different answer .
What is it you want that I did n’t already tell you ?
Q. I ’m trying to clarify the motivation behind the hoax .
Why would these scientists want to deceive the global public ?
A . It ’s very clear that when you have the U.N. behind it , and you have all the Hollywood people moving in , you have the Heinz Foundation , that ’s John Kerry ’s wife — a lot of very wealthy people .
Many of [ the scientists ] know that if they were recipients of grants in the past , that could well be cut off .
Or if they have n’t had them , they would want them .
The complaints I had brought to me were from scientists who said that many scientists had been intimidated into saying things that were n’t true because of that leverage that has been used .
Q . So you believe the scientists and the U.N. are in it for the money ?
A . Well , that enters into it , yes .
Q. The Pentagon has identified climate change as one of the biggest threats to our national security .
Why should n’t we trust the American military to judge security threats ?
A. The Pentagon does not say that .
Barbara Boxer wants to believe that the Pentagon says that .
And also you mentioned evangelicals .
Not true at all .
Some of the very liberal churches have taken a position .
Most of them have either not taken a position or have said this thing is not real and we should not be allowing government to do this .
The overriding factor is that even if we did all of this unilaterally , it ’s not going to reduce CO2 .
Q. The Pentagon just produced the Quadrennial Defense Review , which said climate change will accelerate conflict around the globe .
A. Keep in mind that the Quadrennial Review and all that comes out of the White House .
That ’s part of the administration .
In the Pentagon , they ’re good soldiers –they ’ll do pretty much what will ingratiate the commander in chief .
That ’s what they ’re supposed to do .
Q. More than 280 evangelical leaders , including Rick Warren , signed the Evangelical Climate Initiative supporting action on this issue .
Are these leaders also duped ?
Are they part of the hoax ?
A . If you ca n’t find 300 evangelical or religious leaders , or people who identify themselves as religious leaders , that can pursue almost anything , then you ’re not really doing your job .
It ’s kind of funny because I do n’t recall any of the people that I run into who are evangelical leaders who really buy in to this thing .
But that ’s fine , there are some who do , I ’m sure .
Q . Do you believe that investing in clean energy is going to create jobs in the U.S. ?
A. Oh , absolutely not .
Q. Oklahoma has huge wind resources .
My understanding is that wind and natural gas are among the biggest and fastest - growing sectors of your state ’s economy .
A . That ’s correct .
Q . So the wind industry is not creating jobs in your state ?
A. Yeah , it is .
A few jobs .
We always look at net jobs , and we have had hearings on this and shown very clearly that the number of jobs that are lost exceed any new jobs that come in , and that ’s the reason for my answer to your question .
Q. I ’ve heard that the Chesapeake Energy Corporation , a big job provider in Oklahoma , favors cap - and - trade , saying it would actually benefit the natural gas industry .
To me that says it would create jobs in your state .
Why oppose policies that would create jobs in Oklahoma ?
A . There are a lot of people in the natural gas business who feel that perhaps they can benefit [ from cap - and - trade ] in the short term , but they also recognize in the long term that it would be destructive .
If you do n’t believe that , talk to the CEO of [ Oklahoma City - based ] Devon Energy , Larry Nichols .
Q . How do you respond to major industry leaders who say climate legislation is going to create jobs , not kill them , net total ?
A. I do n’t agree with that .
Always look at the motives people have .
There are a lot of companies that would do very well [ if greenhouse - gas regulations were enacted ] .
General Electric .
I better not start naming them .
But we had a hearing on USCAP , [ a coalition of ] corporations that were embracing some variation of cap - and - trade .
We checked and found out that all 15 or so of them had stood to make huge amounts of money if they could get cap - and - trade .
So that ’s my comment about that .
Q . So you believe these companies and their leaders are going along with a massive fraud that will destroy the economy in order to make money themselves ?
A . It would be very damaging to the economy .
I think that most of the people who do n’t have a dog in this fight , people who are just looking at it , economists looking to see how destructive it would be , come to the conclusion that it would be destructive .
Q . Are there clean tech innovations that you ’re interested in ?
A. I ’m interested in wind energy , I ’m interested in geothermal .
It ’s all of the above .
I think you ca n’t just say you ’re for one thing or another .
In order for us to be independent , [ we need to ] develop our own resources .
We have the largest recoverable reserves of oil , gas , and coal of any country in the world .**
And yet the problem is , politically , we ’re not able to drill in the different places and develop our own resources .
No other countries are in that situation .
Q . On a personal level , why are you so passionate about climate change ?
I know you ’ve been committed to this issue for a long time .
A. I was first made chairman of the Environment and Public Works Clean Air Subcommittee back in ’ 97 .
That ’s when I believed that anthropogenic gases were causing global warming because everyone said it was .
Until the Wharton [ Econometric Forecasting Associates ] came along and said what it would cost us if we were to go through with this .
And of course it was just huge amounts , so we thought we ’d check the science .
When we started checking the science , many of the scientists came to me — once they had a place to come — and showed how they ’d been shut out of the process of the IPCC .
And I thought , somebody ’s got to take this thing on , and so that ’s why I did it .
Q . How do you think that history will view your efforts on climate change ?
A . It depends on who ’s writing the history .
Q. Assuming someone you like is writing the history .
A. I think they ’ll say that they ’re glad there ’s one person who was willing to tell the truth .
* Professor John Reilly of MIT last year said Republicans had been misrepresenting his research on the potential costs of climate legislation .
** In fact , the U.S. ranks 12th in proven reserves of oil and 5th in proven reserves of natural gas , according to the CIA .
It does have the world ’s largest reserves of coal .

Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman is the lead sponsor of a measure to repeal the military ’s Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell , Do n’t Pursue policy that has barred openly gay and lesbian people from serving in the military .
Lieberman , who has been a thorn in the side of many liberals over issues of healthcare and Iraq , may now be hailed by some liberals for this bold move :
Now that he ’s taking such a public stand on a core liberal issue , will the left be able to get over its aversion to the iconoclast in their midst and recognize that Lieberman is n’t just the ideal person to front for this effort — given his popularity with Republicans and the trust he has earned from senior military officials — but that he ’s genuinely sincere in his motivations ?
While it ’s refreshing to know that Lieberman believes in “ the bedrock American promise of providing citizens with ‘ an equal opportunity to do whatever job their talents and sense of purpose and motivations lead them to want to do – including military service , ' ” it ’s his second statement that I find troubling :
Second , and no less important for a lawmaker whose commitment to national security the Pentagon can’t doubt , is that “ When you artificially limit the pool of people who can enlist then you are diminishing military effectiveness . ”
In other words , when you ’re fighting two never - ending wars , rejecting warm bodies because of who they are attracted to when they are off duty is a ridiculous notion .
In that statement alone , Lieberman completely undermines his “ heroic ” stand on this issue .
In essence he ’s saying : “ Yes , we ’re Americans and all Americans should have equal employment opportunities , blah , blah , blah .
But more importantly , we need bodies , and any body will do ! ”
That , gay and lesbian service members , is how much you are valued by Sen.
Joseph Lieberman – not for your skill , not for your heroics , not for your strength of character , but for your body – for your willingness to stand in a war zone and get shot at so they ’ll have an unlimited “ pool of people ” to send off to foreign lands and shoot at our enemies .
How ironic !
The religious right wing fear - mongering over this whole issue is that gays and lesbians will reduce their fellow service members to mere “ bodies ” to be leered at and possibly assaulted in the shower .
In a fundraising plea , the Family Research Council explicitly makes this point :
Forcing soldiers to cohabit with people who view them as sexual objects would inevitably lead to increased sexual tension , sexual harassment , and even sexual assault .
In light of Lieberman ’s statement , though , it seems that it ’s not gays and lesbians who are the ones in danger of objectifying their fellow service members – he ’s already reduced gay and lesbian service members to mere objects .
My own faith conviction in non-violence prevents me from serving in the military .
But I am all in favor of repealing DADT , for the right reasons – not just because the current policy limits the “ pool ” of available cannon fodder – but because it eliminates good , highly skilled men and women from the service who could serve this country with honor and distinction .
Sen .
Lieberman owes the gay and lesbian community an apology – and needs to be reminded that there are people under those uniforms , whether they are gay , straight , or somewhere in between .
They are not part of a “ pool ” of resources .
They are human beings who have made the brave choice to sacrifice their lives for the safety of this country .
They ought to be honored for that .
Safe.pm , originally released with perl 5.002 , has been an experiment to bring compile - time safety to perl .
It allows to compile a ( usually user - provided ) snippet of perl code and execute it , while forbidding a configurable list of operations -- for example , all perl built - ins that would require disk or operating system access .
Moreover , Safe " chroots " perl 's main : : namespace , so the real program 's variables can't be overwritten by the ones created by the code executed from Safe .
It 's pretty clear that Safe does not provide absolute safety .
For once , even overly restricted , it can be abused to execute code that allocates gigabytes of RAM , or goes into an infinite loop .
Also ,
Safe is forced to share a small list of variables and functions with the main program ; $ _ is an obvious example , being the default topic for a lot of built - ins ; functions from the UNIVERSAL : : and ut f8 : : namespaces also come to mind .
Another security risk is to let code compiled inside Safe be run outside -- for example , via coderefs it might return ; because those coderefs will not be run in the chrooted namespace , so they can access the host program 's namespace ; and if they want to compile some other code in turn , that compilation will occur outside of Safe , permitting the full range of perl 's operations .
That 's why Tim Bunce recently added the function wrap_code_ref ( ) to Safe , which , as the docs say , returns a reference to an anonymous subroutine that , when executed , will call the coderef with the Safe compartment ' in effect ' .
The latest release of Safe ( 2.25 , on a CPAN mirror near you ) also strenghtens the security of Safe by removing all automagic methods that a Safe might have been created in the chrooted namespace ; that is , destructors , AUTOLOAD , and overloading operators .
It appeared that those could be abused to inject malicious code in any application that uses Safe and allows a pretty basic set of operations .
In other words , if you 're using Safe , you really want to upgrade to 2.25 .
One of Britain 's most notorious serial killers , dubbed the ' Yorkshire Ripper ' , has started a bid to be freed from prison .
Peter Sutcliffe , who was jailed for life in 1981 for the murder of 13 women and seven counts of attempted murder , has applied to the High Court in London to grant him a finite minimum sentence .
The 63 - year - old is being held at the high - security Broadmoor Hospital , west of London , after being transferred from prison in 1984 suffering from paranoid schizophrenia .
At a preliminary High Court hearing on Monday , judge John Mitting began deciding what form the full hearing should take , and what evidence should be admitted .
Sutcliffe 's original judge said he must serve a minimum of 30 years behind bars - a period which expires next year .
The truck driver 's murderous campaign against prostitutes and young women in northern England between 1975 and 1980 sparked widespread fear across the country until he was eventually jailed in 1981 .
Eleven of the women Sutcliffe murdered were found in west Yorkshire , where he was from .
He would batter women over the head with a hammer and stab them in the chest and abdomen with a knife or a screwdriver .
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said in February last year that it was " very unlikely " Sutcliffe would be released .
The court move revolves around a November 2006 medical report by Doctor Kevin Murray , who is treating Sutcliffe .
The treatment " has had , in Dr Murray 's view , very considerable success " , said Judge Mitting .
Since 1993 , Sutcliffe had been " relatively responsive to treatment " , leading to a conclusion that " so long as treatment continues he should be regarded as posing a low risk of re-offending " , the judge said , citing the doctor 's report .
In his report , Dr Murray said it was his " blunt and firm conclusion " that the 1981 verdicts of guilty to murder were wrong .
If verdicts of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility had been accepted by the prosecution or returned by the jury , then Sutcliffe could have been given an unlimited hospital order .
Sutcliffe is now known as Peter Coonan .

When new bands play guitar music heavy on reverb and slow in tempo-- a combination that drapes tunes in a sublimely druggy dream - pop haze -- I can be slow to embrace them .
It 's not that there is n't plenty of good music in this vein being made .
It 's that one band , 20 years ago , did this sound so well and with so much personality , they set a difficult standard for newcomers to meet .
Galaxie 500 did n't last long .
They formed in Boston in 1986 , released three albums between 1988 and 1990 , got great notices in the press ( especially the UK ) , and then dissolved .
Following their breakup , after which lead singer and guitarist Dean Wareham went on to Luna and the rhythm section of Damon Krukowski and Naomi Yang formed Magic Hour and Damon and Naomi , Galaxie 500 albums went out of print .
Krukowski bought the master tapes in an auction , the albums were gathered with bonus material in a box set by Rykodisc in 1996 and then reissued separately .
They fell out of print again .
Damon and Naomi's label , 20/20/20 , are now bringing them out again in expanded 2xCD form , along with newly mastered vinyl editions .
The CD packages are more functional than revelatory .
The three original LPs have been smartly paired with extra discs that gather all extant material : 1988 debut Today with the covers / demos / B- sides set Uncollected ; 1989 's On Fire with Peel Sessions ; and 1990's This Is Our Music with the live album Copenhagen .
The liner notes by Byron Coley originally included in the latter are included with all three packages .
There 's no new information or previously unheard stuff in these sets , but there is a lot of remarkable music .
Today might be the best song - by - song album of Galaxie 500 's three .
It 's also the most varied , moving from the ghostly mid-tempo beauty of opener " Flowers " , the dreamiest dream - pop song of them all , to the deeply affecting absurdity of " Tugboat " , where the narrator wants to leave the world behind and " be your tugboat captain , " to the pounding , mantra - like cover of Jonathan Richman 's " Do n't Let Our Youth Go to Waste " , which actually rocks .
Wareham 's voice stays in a cracked upper register that can either be yearning or transcendent , and his guitar sustain seems to go on for days .
Yang 's bass playing , like that of Peter Hook , from whom she borrowed heavily , is the band 's emotional center , and Krukowski 's drums are as much about texture as they are about time - keeping .
There were no virtuosos in this group , but everyone 's part was essential .
Rare is the band where three voices this distinctive come together to make a fourth , equally distinctive thing that transcends everything that went into it .
And even more rare is the debut this assured and complete .
Indeed , Today was such a terrific first statement , the only way for Galaxie 500 to best it was to narrow their focus and concentrate on doing one thing perfectly .
Everything about 1989's
On Fire , from the iconic cover art ( the sleeve , like all three of their records , was designed by Yang ) to producer Kramer 's brilliantly surreal liner notes , to the just - under - mid - tempo beat that drives every song , comes together to support the whole .
Wareham 's guitar in particular remains fixated on one primitive strumming pattern , and the first three songs all find him taking off onto soaring wordless choruses in a falsetto - drenched reverb .
Krukowski uses his drums to superb effect throughout , reinforcing the narcotic pace of the music with his slow - mo percussive explosions .
It sounds samey in a sense , but On Fire 's narrow focus turns out to be a strength .
It feels immersive , the rock album as ambient record , and it's the definitive slowcore statement .
On this reissue , as with the prior Rykodisc set , the original album is augmented with three additional songs originally on the Blue Thunder EP , including a take on Joy Division 's " Ceremony " that could be the best cover of the legendary band in existence .
And the Peel Sessions set , collecting two four - song sessions , is nothing short of essential .
Galaxie 500's versions of their own work are just as strong but different , and the covers of the Sex Pistols , Young Marble Giants , and Buffy St. Marie , show how they could absorb the songs of others into their aesthetic .
This Is Our Music , from 1990 , has a few of Galaxie 500's best tunes and it also has the richest production , with greater focus on keyboards and layered guitars .
" Fourth of July " is funny , " Summertime " has an almost blinding sparkle , and Yang 's vocal on the cover of Yoko Ono 's " Listen , the Snow Is Falling " is a pretty good argument that she should be fronting her own project .
But despite its high points ,
This Is Our Music also has a few duds , which are the only easy skips on the band 's proper records .
" Way Up High " and " Hearing Voices " are nice enough , but feel like Galaxie 500 on cruise control .
Hard to say where they might 've gone from here .
Given the relative merits of This Is Our Music , a fine album that sometimes sounds sleepy instead of dreamy , the fact that Galaxie 500 called it quits in spring 1991 is no tragedy .
Some bands are meant to last for three albums ; this was one of them .
All involved would go on to do good things , including Kramer , who carried his sonic innovations into Low 's early work .
The live album , Copenhagen , which is heavy on songs from This Is Our Music and in almost every case improves upon them , turns out to be the ideal closing chapter .
During the 1990 show in Denmark , Galaxie 500 play magnificently to what sounds like a pretty small crowd .
But that small crowd is into it .
Sometimes bands work like that .
They never made it big , but during their short run , Galaxie 500's often quiet and always beautifully rendered music had a profound impact on a few people , including this writer .
It needs to stay out there , where it has a chance of finding a few more .
Dissident Turned Technocrat Medvedev Takes On Putin with Governor Appointment
Russian President Dimitri Medvedev has named a former opposition leader as the governor of the region of Kirov Oblast .
The appointment is a test of whether Medvedev can assert himself against his powerful prime minister , Vladimir Putin .
While running a business we always look forward to making things tranquil and how they can get improved .
Trying to improve things and keep growing by moving forward is what makes your Company business succeed as it grows .
When we talk about improving things , one should consider every area for the same .
If you own and run a business or a companys you might know what role a company secretarial plays for you .
There are many businesses and companies that struggle with managing their company secretarial .
This leads to problems in their management and maintenance of company standards which is a nightmare .
This is a reason why you should choose and maintain appropriate company secretary services .
If you feel like you are struggling with managing your company secretarial adequately , worry not we ’re here with four tips which will help you improve your company secretarial management .
Let ’s begin !
Plan Better
Most of the time what goes wrong is planning .
Very often it happens that you might have a pretty good idea which you wish to execute but it does n’t work out well as you thought it would .
If you think about it you might ’ve missed out on planning your idea properly .
When you talk about your company secretarial , make sure that the planning of how things are going to work out is done requisitely so that the execution goes on in a harmonized manner .
Planning also means that your time management needs to be on point .
Often due to improper time management , you may fail to pay attention at all the ongoing systems .
Ensure that when your company secretarial is planned you take all the aspects into consideration including time management .
Improve Skills For Multitasking Your Company
Another factor that has to be looked after is , how efficient is your company secretarial when it comes to multitasking .
You know that the company secretarial has a lot to look after simultaneously .
So , it is a fundamental characteristic that has to be a part of your secretarial .
Company secretarial has to look after everything from planning important meetings to maintaining compliance throughout the systems .
So , multitasking plays an important role here .
If you observe that your company secretarial is unable to complete things in a timely manner , it is time to work on multitasking skills .
There is one thing that needs to be considered while multitasking is priority .
Always know your priorities of what needs to be done first and what holds more importance .
While doing so you also have to ensure that other things are being done in their respective manner .
Improve Organization And Detailing
Another important factor is organization .
You may confuse organization with planning , but these are two different things and have to be done accurately for better results .
Organization means getting things in the right place .
Make sure your company secretarial is well organized .
Sometimes poor organization leads to slowing down your business .
Understanding during organization plays a vital role as your company secretarial should be aware of every aspect and context of your business for better organization .
In addition to that , detailing is something which needs to be paid attention at .
Ensure that your company secretarial keeps even the smallest details in mind during execution of any job or plan .
This will subtly boost the quality of your business .
Make Communication And Judgement Effective
We all know that communication is something that has to be as clear as possible in every part of our lives and so in a business .
Having comprehended a profound way of communication solves many problems .

We have rendered you with four such tips which will help you manage your company secretarial profoundly .
Keep all the above points in mind and it will help grow your business .
( CNN ) --
Say you were to give Bill Gates a really great present -- like the ability to cure crippling diseases or to pick all U.S. presidents for the next 50 years .
Gates would like those gifts , sure .
But you would n't have granted his one , true wish .
The Microsoft - founder - turned - philanthropist said at a recent speech in California that , more than new vaccines for AIDS or malaria or presidential selection power , what he really wants is clean energy at half its current cost .
To do that , he said , we 'll need new technology .
Gates -- a father of the personal computer and quite the tech powerhouse -- said one of the brightest hopes for clean , cheap power is a new form of nuclear power plant that reuses waste uranium from existing nuclear reactors .
It 's kind of like radioactive recycling , and , on its face , can sound like a miracle .
Gates actually described energy innovation in those terms :
To prevent famine , poverty and the hardship that will come with global climate change we need " energy miracles , " he said at the TED Conference in Long Beach .
Some nuclear scientists and critics say the nuclear technology Gates highlighted is misguided , naive and expensive .
Others , like Craig Smith , a nuclear engineer at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory , said Gates is helping put the world on the verge of a " nuclear Renaissance " that could provide cheap power for everyone in the world -- forever .
" There 's a new enthusiasm not only in the United States but , I think , worldwide for the use of nuclear energy , " Smith said .
Smith 's argument is bolstered by the fact that President Obama on Tuesday announced $ 8.3 billion in loan guarantees for a new nuclear power plant .
The proposed project , to be located in Burke County , Georgia , would be the first nuclear power plant built in the United States in three decades .
How it works
Most nuclear power plants today use radioactive elements like uranium to create nuclear fission and then produce electricity .
One problem :
That reaction leaves behind uranium waste .
To make matters worse , the United States has n't identified a safe place to store the waste from the country 's 104 nuclear reactors in the long term .
That 's where the technology promoted by Gates comes in .
Gates has invested tens of millions of dollars in a Bellevue , Washington , company called TerraPower , according to TerraPower CEO John Gilleland .
TerraPower is working to create nuclear reactors that generate hyper - fast nuclear reactions able to eat away at the dangerous nuclear waste .
This has a number of potential benefits , Gilleland said .
Among them :
• The Uranium isotope that 's food for the new nuclear reactors does n't have to be enriched , which means it 's less likely to be used in atomic weapons .
• The fission reaction in the new process burns through the nuclear waste slowly , which makes the process safer .
One supply of spent uranium could burn for 60 years .
• The process creates a large amount of energy from relatively small amounts of uranium , which is important as global supplies run short .
• The process generates uranium that can be burned again to create " effectively an infinite fuel supply . "
Gilleland said it 's not a matter of if the technology works .
" It 's going to work -- for sure , " he said .
" The question will be precisely how well and how economically .
But right now there are lots of people in the world who think it could begin to see common application in the 2020s . "
' Pie - in - the - sky '
Others scoff at the idea .
Gates is looking for a " silver bullet " technology to fix the world 's climate problems , but no such technology exists , said Thomas B. Cochran , a nuclear physicist and senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council , an environmental advocacy group that opposes new nuclear power plants .
" The idea that Gates is going to throw some money at a couple of guys that think they 've got a new idea and this is gonna blossom into something that really works is a pretty low probability , " he said .
Cochran compared Gates ' call for investment in nuclear technology that would reuse uranium to Bernie Madoff 's Ponzi scheme .
It 's a scam , he said .
Researchers have been working on similar , utopian ideas for more than 60 years , he said , and with no tangible result .
Action needs to be taken now to blunt the effects of climate change , he said ; and new nuclear power technologies will take too long to develop and will be too expensive .
" If you 're trying to address climate change mitigation , this is not the way to go in any case because it's too far into the future , " he said .
" We need the solutions now .
The focus on research and development ought to be on improvements in near - term applications , not these pie - in - the - sky reactor concepts that wo n't be deployed for decades . "
Michael Mariotte , executive director of the Nuclear Information and Resource Service , an environmental and public - safety group , said the timeline is too slow .
The technology could be ready for testing in 20 years and ready for commercial use 20 years after that , Gates said in California .
" Our belief is that we need to make near - term carbon emissions reductions -- and in that sense , this does n't help , " Mariotte said .
" It diverts resources away from technologies that do work . "
Optimism
Others applaud Gates , one of the richest men in the world , for taking on a big problem like climate change with gusto and optimism .
" Look , I think this is the backing of a creative and innovative reactor concept , " said Smith , the nuclear engineer at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory .
" That is a very good thing -- to allow people to stretch their minds and come up with new concepts . "
It 's unclear where the best clean - energy technology solutions will come from , Smith said , but many varieties of next - generation nuclear tech are under development , and the U.S. government has invested in several .
Ted Quinn , a former president of the American Nuclear Society and a consultant for the nuclear industry , said it 's important for the United States to find a valuable use for nuclear waste .
" This is like an ultimate design that can burn a different type of fuel than we burn today .
This burns the part of the fuel that we can't burn , " he said of the Gates - backed project .
" It helps the fuel cycle issues . "
In his remarks in California , Gates said there will be no easy fix for climate change .
He encouraged optimism , along with heavier investment in solar , wind , battery and nuclear technologies .
That 's the only way he will get his biggest wish , he said .
" We have to drive full speed and get a miracle in a pretty tight timeline . "

Climatologist Phil Jones answers his critics in an exclusive interview with Nature .
Phil Jones : facing up to his critics .
Phil Jones holds himself defensively , his arms crossed tightly in front of his chest as if shielding himself from attack .
Little wonder : Jones has spent the past three months being vilified for his central role in what is now called ' climategate ' .
Jones was director of the Climatic Research Unit ( CRU ) at the University of East Anglia in Norwich , UK , when , last November , more than 1,000 e-mails and documents were illegally obtained from the university and posted on the Internet .
Their contents quickly embroiled him in a controversy that has shaken the climate community and threatened his career .
Jones has stood down from his post while several independent investigations look into the affair , including one headed by Muir Russell , former vice - chancellor of the University of Glasgow , UK , which will assess allegations that the e-mails contain evidence of poor scientific practice at the CRU .
Speaking exclusively to Nature , Jones is reluctant to discuss how the past few months have affected him personally , and says he cannot comment on allegations that freedom of information requests for raw climate data were mishandled by the university .
But he is eager to set the record straight on the science .
Central to the Russell investigation is the issue of whether he or his CRU colleagues ever published data that they knew were potentially flawed , in order to bolster the evidence for man-made global warming .
The claim specifically relates to one of Jones 's research papers1 on whether the urban heat island effect — in which cities tend to be warmer than the surrounding countryside — could be responsible for the apparent rise in temperature readings from thermometers in the late twentieth century .
Jones 's study concluded that this local effect was negligible , and that the dominant effect was global climate change .
In the paper1 , the authors used data from weather stations around the world ; those in China " were selected on the basis of station history : we chose those with few , if any , changes in instrumentation , location or observation times " , they wrote .
“ I do n't think we should be taking much notice of what 's on blogs because they seem to be hijacking the peer - review process . ”
Phil Jones
But in 2007 , amateur climate - data analyst Doug Keenan alleged that this claim was false , citing evidence that many of the stations in eastern China had been moved throughout the period of study .
Because the raw data had been obtained from a Chinese contact of one of Jones 's co-authors , Wei-Chyung Wang of the University at Albany in New York , and details of their location had subsequently been lost , there was no way of verifying or refuting Keenan 's claim .
Jones says that approaching Wang for the Chinese data seemed sensible at the time .
" I thought it was the right way to get the data .
I was specifically trying to get more rural station data that was n't routinely available in real time from [ meteorological ] services , " says Jones , who asserts that standards for data collection have changed considerably in the past twenty years .
He now acknowledges that " the stations probably did move " , and that the subsequent loss of the stations ' locations was sloppy .
" It 's not acceptable , " says Jones . " [ It 's ] not best practice . "
CRU denies any involvement in losing these records .
Jones says that he did not know that the weather stations ' locations were questionable when they were included in the paper , but as the study 's lead author he acknowledges his responsibility for ensuring the quality of the data .
So will he submit a correction to Nature ?
" I will give that some thought .
It 's worthy of consideration , " he says .
" The science still holds up " though , he adds .
A follow - up study2 verified the original conclusions for the Chinese data for the period 1954 –1983 , showing that the precise location of weather stations was unimportant .
" They are trying to pick out minor things in the data and blow them out of all proportion , " says Jones of his critics .
That Nature trick
One of the most politically charged allegations is that Jones , together with scientific collaborators , tried to systematically downplay the importance of the Medieval Warm Period ( MWP ) , a brief phase of natural , pre-industrial warming that may have occurred around 1000 AD .
But if the MWP was restricted to mild local warming , it would mean that present - day global warming is unprecedented for the past 1,000 years , as claimed by climatologist Michael Mann of Pennsylvania State University , University Park , in his famous ' hockey stick ' global temperature reconstruction3 .
That claim , however , relies on controversial data from tree rings .
In one of the leaked e-mails , Jones wrote that he had " just completed Mike 's Nature trick of adding in the real temps to each series for the last 20 years to hide the decline " .
Jones was referring to the fact that he — like Mann — used only direct temperature measurements to reconstruct temperatures over the past 20 years or so , rather than using proxy data .
Palaeoclimatologists are confident that the width of tree rings reliably represents real temperatures because they tally with data from thermometers and other instruments taken since the nineteenth century .
After the 1960s , however , there is a divergence , with most tree - ring proxy temperatures seeming to be lower than those from instrumental records across the Northern Hemisphere4 .
The exact cause of this problem is unknown , and is still being investigated by scientists .
Some argue that if the tree - ring data are unreliable for the recent past , including them in older temperature reconstructions is highly questionable , and could understate historic warming — including the MWP — relative to the present day .
" It potentially does , " admits Jones , but says that analyses using other methods — proxy temperature markers from ice core samples , for example — still show much the same temperature change over the past 1,000 years , backing up Mann 's hockey stick .

Jones says that he is unconvinced that the MWP was a global phenomenon , but categorically denies that he has tried to downplay it .
" A lot of people have this view that there was a MWP and then a little ice age , " he says .
" It might not be the case . "
" We need more reconstructions from different parts of the world to reproduce a better history of the past thousand years " .
Jones challenges his critics to help with those efforts .
" Why do n't they do their own reconstructions ? " he asks .
" The work that 's been published has been through the peer - review process ; if they want to criticize that they should write their own papers . "
Redefining review
But some of his critics say that Jones has tried to influence that very process by censoring them .
In one e-mail , dated July 2004 , Jones wrote to Mann : " I can't see either of these papers being in the next IPCC report .
Kevin [ Trenberth ] and I will keep them out somehow — even if we have to redefine what the peer - review literature is ! "
Jones stresses that both papers did appear in the final version of the Fourth Assessment Report from the United Nations ' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) .
But he also defends the right of IPCC authors to exclude papers from the report , based on their expertise .
" The IPCC [ report ] is an assessment , it 's not a review , " he says , " so the authors have to know something about the subject to assess which are the important papers to bring in to the particular chapter . "
In doing so , authors naturally would exclude papers that are scientifically weak or irrelevant , argues Jones .
But he fears that the aftermath of the climategate affair is undermining the integrity of the scientific review process .
" I do n't think we should be taking much notice of what 's on blogs because they seem to be hijacking the peer - review process , " says Jones .
It is now essential for climate researchers to stand up for their science , he says .
" [ I 'd ] like to see the climate science community supporting the climate science more .
Lots of them are trying but they 're being drowned out . "
Corrected :
An earlier version of this story implied that the hockey stick reconstruction ended due to problems with tree ring data .
It actually used multiple proxy sources and stopped in 1980 because of the limited availability of proxy records thereafter .
The reconstruction by Jones terminated in 1960 because of the problem with divergent tree - ring data .
Four huge union trucks loaded with $ 30,000 worth of food , followed by a 150 - car convoy with hundreds of supporters , converged on the gates of the large Rio Tinto Borax mine and plant in the town of Boron , Calif. , last week , in solidarity with locked out miners .
With the slogan “ From the Docks to the Desert , ” the Los Angeles County Labor Federation and its affiliates organized the Feb. 24 emergency caravan after Rio Tinto , the giant conglomerate operating mines in five continents , locked out nearly 600 members of International Longshore and Warehouse Union ( ILWU ) Local 30 on Jan. 31 .
When the workers unanimously rejected Rio Tinto ’s last contract offer , the company called off contract negotiations and brought in replacement workers .
The ILWU says the company proposed to replace good paying full - time jobs with part - time temporary positions that provide little or no benefits .
The package of company demands would make it impossible for working families to survive and would destroy hard won working conditions and rights .
“ We ’re more determined than ever to stand up and see this thing through , ” workers declare on the local ’s web site , “ Too many people in America are loosing good jobs and working harder , while big companies make billions .
We ’re taking a stand in Boron , not just for ourselves and our communities , but for everyone in America who ’s fed up with corporate greed and a system that does n’t protect hard - working families . ”
Despite the global recession , Rio Tinto walked away with nearly $ 5 billion in profits in 2009 , according to the union .
After acquiring Alcan for $ 40 billion several years back , the company is now trying to climb out of debt on the backs of the workers in Boron and elsewhere .
Rio Tinto employees in Australia are facing similar takeaways .
After years of abuses against the community and environment in Papua , New Guinea , the company is now being sued in U.S. federal court .

I 'd read about Brenda Brathwaite 's Train before but , in honesty , I 'd never bought any of the hype .
A board game about trains with a twist ending that reveals you 're actually sending your pieces to Auschwitz ?
Please .
You 're telling me that people not only break down sobbing while playing the game , but that people actually started crying during Brathwaite 's talk about the game ?
I mentally called shenanigans .
Chalked up the overzealous reactions to the sort of artsy - fartsy desire for games to be Taken Really Seriously , without any basis in actual emotion .
After exiting Brathwaite 's updated version of her talk , "
Train ( or How I Dumped Electricity and Learned to Love Design ) " with the unmistakable sensation of my tear duct beginning -- just beginning -- to fill , I understood just how wrong I 'd been .
Hit the jump for my summary of the talk .
For a summary of what prompted Brathwaite to make a game like Train in the first place , I 'd suggest reading this article from The Escapist .
Brathwaite 's talk this morning covered much new ground , but the basic story of why Brathwaite moved from videogames to board games has n't changed .
What has changed has been the reaction to Train : much to her surprise , Brathwaite effectively took the game on tour over the past year , showcasing the game to the Wall Street Journal and MIT , taking note of the different reactions players have had to the game .
But I 'm getting ahead of myself .
All human - on - human tragedy , Brathwaite said , works by some sort of system .
And if you have a system , then you can create a game .
Train is a board game that , at least initially , tasks players with getting as many yellow game pieces from one end of the game board to the other .
In an average turn , the player can choose to move their train forward , put more people into the train , draw a card , or take a card .
After reaching the end of the track with one train , the player draws a card revealing the destination they 've arrived at .
All of the possible destinations are concentration camps .
Auschwitz , Dachau .
Brathwaite described the moment of realization as " a fall from a hundred feet up , " once the now - victorious player realizes what he or she has just done .
This is n't the end of the game .
Train 's rules ( typed up on a genuine Nazi typewriter ) specify that " the game is over when it ends . "
After figuring out where the trains are going , you can choose to stop playing or , as some players did , try to actually rebel against the rules and sabotage the game by intentionally trying to draw derail cards .
When a train in the game gets derailed , two things happen : half the people go back to the beginning of the board , and the others refuse to board the train .
The game pieces simply sit on the board , and can no longer be manipulated .
Brathwaite intentionally refused to explain exactly what had happened to those pieces .
Some players assume that the tokens are dead , some assume that they 've escaped and gone to Denmark .
This process of volunteering your own narrative is n't lazy design or metagaming , Brathwaite seemed to suggest , but an integral part of the game that makes the player feel complicit in what they 're doing .
Brathwaite briefly relayed an anecdote wherein a player reached the end of the board , found out where she was going , and then went back and started loading another train without saying anything .
When asked what she was doing , and if she understood what was going on , she responded that she did -- she just assumed that she was playing as a conductor or something , and that he probably had kids to feed , so why not just keep going ?
Interestingly , Brathwaite noted that when people play Train , even when they privately realize what the game is about they never tell the other players .
Brathwaite had no idea why this was ( though an audience member later suggested that it might be that players simply did n't want to spoil the experience of realizing the theme for everyone else ) .
This , Braithwaite argued , is the sort of freedom of play you generally can't achieve in digital games .
The tactile details of the game ( the train openings are too small for the Jew pieces , so you 've got to cram them in there , which becomes a sort of horrifying action once players realize exactly what they 're doing ) and the " complexity of human choice " the board game format allows simply would n't work in a computer .
The board itself sits on a frame filled with broken glass ( presumably representing Krystallnacht ) .
At one point when showcasing the game , a Rabbi saw the board , paused , and said that he understood what the game was about .
" I do n't want to play it , " he said .
" You just did , " Brathwaite replied .
As described by Brathwaite , the act of play did n't lead up to an ultimately bullshit " gotcha " moment like I 'd assumed .
The Auschwitz revelation is but one aspect of an entire experience designed to make players question the way they follow rules , and how they 'll behave once they understand what 's going on , and how complicit they 're willing to be .
Train 's spontaneous popularity resulted in a lot of backlash : people have told Brathwaite to stop making games , and that she should be punched in the face for creating Train .
Perhaps part of this reaction came from the fact that Train is n't " fun , " by any stretch of the imagination .
" Why do games have to be fun ? " , Brathwaite asked .
Schindler 's
List is n't fun .
" No other medium is like , oh , it 's gotta be fun . "
In creating Train , Brathwaite understood just how many design constraints she 'd unthinkingly accepted during her years as a digital game designer : for instance , that games need to have concrete win/ loss conditions , or strictly designer - authored meaning , or that games must be fun in some way .
Still , the act of creating Train made ( as the talk 's title would suggest ) Brathwaite fall in love with pure game design . "
Board games , " Brathwaite said , " taught me a lot of our problems have solutions , and that games are way more diverse than we give them credit for . "
“ I fell in love with the potential power of the medium , and saw mechanics as more powerful than paint , ” Brathwaite said .
" There was not a threat to the Pantex plant assets , workers , or the public , and the plant is now returning to normal operations , " the company said in a statement .
You ever have moments where you are on the internet randomly searching for Kid Flash costume variations and you stumble upon something really cool yet completely unexpected ?
This happened to me a few weeks ago when I came across some great stuff I ’m not sure many fans of the Scarlet Speedster have seen yet .
Remember that Flash video game that was cancelled a few months ago ?
The Flash video game that was was covered by Kelson back in September and October of last year ?
Well I mentioned I was randomly interested in Kid Flash costume variations and I stumbled upon a nifty one in google images that rocked my socks off :
Taking a closer look around the site I found a few more :
And a nice Pied Piper :
Turns out these were modeled by Helen Rusinoff for the cancelled Flash video game .
The costumes were designed by Roger Robinson who was featured in the previous Flash video game article Kelson posted .
There were a few pictures that I did n’t have room to show but you can find those at her website .
I emailed Helen about showcasing the pictures on Speedforce.org and she emailed me back promptly .
Not only did she give me permission to repost her work , but she also pointed me in the direction of Roger Robinson yet again .
I visited his website and did n’t really find anything new to report .
Wandering around that site however I came across another blog , where I found these pictures :
You can find a few more at Roger Robinson ’s other website .
Seeing that we could have had Kid Flash , and Jesse Quick in this game makes me downright depressed .
I wonder if there were any cool multi-player modes that they might have had planned using the various members of The Flash Family ?
The Flash meets Sonic Adventure 2 Battle ?
That would n’t have been a bad thing .
I also wonder if they had any plans to have alternate costumes .
That was a very nice touch in Justice League Heroes , which included Jay Garrick and Walter West as alternate uniforms for Wally .
Too bad the game was so dang mediocre .
Until they find a way to either bring this back from the dead or create another one I guess I ’m stuck playing this :
Actually Justice League Heroes : The Flash is n’t bad .
I preordered it when it was first announced and purchased a Gameboy Advance SP just to play it .
I now have it on my PSP as well and have beaten it many , many times .
A lot of fun to play on the go ( although I take Bart ’s advice and do n’t use my “ playtendo ” while running ) .
I hope you all enjoyed a deeper glimpse into the game that could have been .
The potential was definitely there for a good , solid , fun game to play .
Here is hoping they decide to create another one sometime down the road .

The small indie development group , " Rotators " , supported by the main developer of FOnline , A. Cvetinskiy " Cvet " , are proud to present FOnline : 2238 , the new massively multiplayer game , free of charge , based on the famous award - winning cRPG titles Fallout and Fallout 2 .
Bringing the single player experience into a massively multiplayer game was not an easy task .
While merging the existing features with new ones in order to provide as much game experience as possible , the young developers aimed for the recreation of the Fallout world as we knew it back in the late '90s , keeping their emphasis on the alternative , unique universe and its settings .
The game will remind you of Fallout 1 & 2 everywhere you go - the places , the people , the common history and the events that shook the world and keep it trembling .
Humanity , or at least what is left of it , has no time for a break .
Faced with constant challenges , surviving in the harsh post - apocalyptic , post - nuclear , barren world , struggling for an uncertain tomorrow , the humans , ghouls and mutants are organizing themselves to push it through .
To make it .
To stay alive .
Each group , each place , each organization with its own agenda , with its own ideology , fighting for their place under the scorching Sun .
What they believe may be right or wrong ...
Who are we to judge , while striving for the same old necessity - survival ?
The game adds several unique features regarding the players and their interactions , be it with other players , their respective groups or NPCs .
First of all , there are groups : factions , gangs - call them whatever you like , which determine the fate of the world .
Some of them are more powerful than others , some are cunning and treacherous , some even hideous .
But they are there , conflicting with each other , or aligning with the policies of the greater powers - those who have technological advances , political power or any other advantages over them , or are just plain bigger .
Choose your way : join your favorite group and spread their agenda throughout the wasteland .
Decide for yourself how to handle the resistance - with good will or stubbornness .
Respect the authorities or lead a revolution to throw them off the throne - it is your world , you decide .
If you do n't feel like belonging to a group and have your own ideology , then you can take one of the numerous paths the wasteland offers .
Some of them are : bounty hunting , brahmin trading , crafting , exploring and trading in general .
The brand new system of professions allows you to polish up your skills and learn things you will rarely find in books , giving you a certain advantage over other players .
Scavenging , gathering resources and useful items will be an inevitable part of your FOnline : 2238 life .
Crafting something useful out of the gathered junk or selling it directly to your favorite vendor are just a small part of the great possibilities this game offers you .
And of course , you can just take them off someone else , simply by brutally killing him / her or using more exquisite methods , like stealing .
The choice is yours - and so are the consequences .
From the technical point of view , the game will bring back the good old 2D isometric perspective , with english being the only supported language .
The engine supports several new features like object opacity and the PNG graphics format .
The scripting language being used is the AngelCode Scripting Library ( or simply AngelScript ) created by Andreas Jönsson , while system requirements for the game can be considered minimal for today 's mainstream computing :
MS Windows 2000 / XP / Vista
CPU 1.0 GHz
RAM 2 GB
DirectX 9 / OpenGL 2.1 compatible graphic card
56 K or better internet connection
Fallout 2 ( CD or download - Version , it does n't matter as long as there are master .dat and critter .dat files included )
There are reports the game will run under Linux too ( using WINE emulation ) , but we can not promise any official support for now ( this may change soon ) .
Due to the fact that the game is currently in its medium beta stage ( remember , the engine development has progressed much further and the engine itself can be considered almost fully functional ) , it is necessary to test the numerous features and additions .
Taking this into account , the decision to organize further open beta tests has been made , with the first one starting on August 15th , 2009 .
Game sessions last usually for several months before the famous " wipe " comes , where all data is deleted and the game upgraded with new features , content and options .
We are looking forward to seeing you in the game and hearing your impressions of our creation , so that the next open test session can really be a mutual pleasure .

This might sound a bit odd , but when I was about 8 years old my school snack shack started selling old army surplus ammo boxes .
These days , that would probably trigger an immediate lock - down .
But back in the cold war I simply plunked down most of my meager allowance for a green metal box wrapped in torn brown paper .
It was battered and worn , yet perfect for lugging around my most important childhood possessions .
Fast - forward three decades and Thomas Spaans has created the A - BOX , a a high quality portable iPod amplifier integrated into a fifties design M2A1 ammo box .
He says , " The iPod / mp3 player can be connected on the outside of the A - BOX as well as the inside so you can listen to your tunes while running around with the A - BOX for example or just protecting your iPod from bullets and stuff .
the A - BOX comes in 2 models : the light version with 2 x 25 watts rms amplifier and woven glass fiber speakers ( carbon color ) this model will cost 350 euros .
and the heavy version sporting 2 x 70 watts amplifiers and woven kevlar speakers ( the yellow material used in bullet proof vests ) this version will be selling for 475 euros .
both versions have indication lights in the bass tube which will indicate the status of the battery with white , orange and red colors .
the heavy version however has an extra feat , indication lights behind the speakers which will warn against distortion when driven too loud . "

The following quote is from a 1997 DoD News Briefing given by William S. Cohen who was Secretary of Defense at the time :
A : Well , it points out the nature of the threat .
It turned out to be a false threat under the circumstances .
But as we ’ve learned in the intelligence community , we had something called — and we have James Woolsey here to perhaps even address this question about phantom moles .
The mere fear that there is a mole within an agency can set off a chain reaction and a hunt for that particular mole which can paralyze the agency for weeks and months and years even , in a search .
The same thing is true about just the false scare of a threat of using some kind of a chemical weapon or a biological one .
There are some reports , for example , that some countries have been trying to construct something like an Ebola Virus , and that would be a very dangerous phenomenon , to say the least .
Alvin Toeffler has written about this in terms of some scientists in their laboratories trying to devise certain types of pathogens that would be ethnic specific so that they could just eliminate certain ethnic groups and races ; and others are designing some sort of engineering , some sort of insects that can destroy specific crops .
Others are engaging even in an eco- type of terrorism whereby they can alter the climate , set off earthquakes , volcanoes remotely through the use of electromagnetic waves .
So there are plenty of ingenious minds out there that are at work finding ways in which they can wreak terror upon other nations .
It ’s real , and that ’s the reason why we have to intensify our efforts , and that ’s why this is so important .
Court - ordered amputations remain controversial in Nigeria
An Islamic court in Nigeria has banned a rights group from hosting debates on the Twitter and Facebook websites on the use of amputations as a punishment .
The court , in the northern city of Kaduna , backed a case brought by a pro-Sharia group arguing that the forums would mock the Sharia system .
The rights group , the Civil Rights Congress of Nigeria , said it would appeal against the ruling .
Sharia judges can order amputations of limbs for petty crimes in some states .
The courts mostly deal with domestic issues such as marriage and divorce .
Sharia judges have sentenced some women to death by stoning for adultery , but the sentences have not been carried out .
Amputation anniversary
The newspaper ThisDay quoted the judge 's ruling as saying : " An order is hereby given restraining the respondents either by themselves or their agents from opening a chat forum on Facebook , Twitter , or any blog for the purpose of the debate on the amputation of Malam Buba Bello Jangebe . "
In 2000 , Jangebe made history as the first person in Nigeria to have an amputation carried out under Islamic law after being found guilty of stealing a cow .
The Civil Rights Congress said it had started a Twitter feed , blog and Facebook debate on Jangebe so " Nigerians could air their opinions on Sharia law as a whole " .
The group told the BBC's Hausa service it would appeal against the ruling .
The Sharia code runs alongside the secular state system in 12 of Nigeria 's 36 states , and citizens can choose which system they deal with .
It is not clear whether the Kaduna court has the authority to enforce the ruling , which analysts say is the first such judgement in Nigeria .
The judge was ruling on a case brought by the Association of Muslim Brotherhood of Nigeria , a Kaduna - based pro-Sharia group .
Take a look at this sign :
You see the problem with it ?
Apparently , it teaches kids that gay marriage is great and the “ traditional ” family structure needs to be broken down ( ?!?!)
And if you do n’t see that , then you might be wondering ( as I do ) why those signs were taken down from schools in Platte County School District 1 in Wheatland , Wyoming :
One of the sponsors listed on the banner is the Gay and Lesbian Fund for Colorado .
Wheatland board members and parents took issue with that , according to the district . …
“ The board thought it was inappropriate to have that sponsorship hanging up in the school , ” said Stuart Nelson , the district ’s superintendent .
The banners , which had been allowed by district administrators , were removed after complaints .
Some students asked to have them put back up , but the board refused .
Board member Lee Dunham said Wheatland is an “ ultraconservative community ” and that he has feelings about including the fund on the banner .
He said the district is n’t ready to include that group .
“ If this is the way one chooses , then they can lead this particular lifestyle , but I do n’t believe it needs to be publicly displayed in a school , ” Dunham said .
You know what ?
If a Christian group wants to sponsor a poster that says “ No Place For Hate , ” I ’d be fine with it .
In fact , I ’d be thrilled to see it .
Have all religious and secular groups join in on that .
The sad thing is that the Christians are making the argument that they should be allowed to pick on gay people and how * dare * anyone try to discourage them from doing it .
Joe Fabian , another board member , said he believes the Anti-Defamation League is pushing an “ agenda that is pro-gay marriage ” and that the community of Wheatland is not supportive of that .
“ They would n’t want the organization , the Anti-Defamation League , dictating to their children that an alternate lifestyle is a normal lifestyle , ” he said .
Fabian blamed school administrators for allowing the banners without board approval .
He implied students who were not supportive of the banner suffered discrimination .
He spoke of a “ moral attitude by the community ” and indoctrination of students .
“ I do n’t believe ( homosexuality ) is a normal lifestyle , but I do n’t have anything against them , ” he said .
Right … and I do n’t believe Christians can think for themselves , and I think they just follow any loud man who carries a Bible , and I think they are blissfully proud of their ignorance about scientific reality … but I do n’t have anything against them , either .
What would be inspiring here is for students in that district to speak up against the school board .
Make Facebook pages denouncing their decision .
Write letters - to - the - editor .
Tell local news stations how you feel .
Print out the ADL posters and put them on your locker in protest .
Give the school the bad press it deserves .
Make the school board members have to defend their idiotic actions .
Then encourage voters to get rid of them in the next election .
What would be even more inspiring is if Christian students who understand what I ’m so upset about would join in and call out the school board members for being embarrassments to their faith .
This is why many Christians lose my respect so quickly .
They talk about how their faith makes them better people .
God makes them so “ good , ” in fact , they ’re willing to let GLBT students continue to be bullied for who they are and do absolutely nothing to stop it .
That ’s Christianity for you .

One of my goals with Drink Spirits is to cover the incredible micro distillery movement that is happening across the country .
I ’ve started that coverage here in my own back yard with Portland ’s booming micro distillery industry ( there ’s now even a site devoted to Portland ’s Distillery Row ) .
Corresponding with many of these micro distilleries , I ’ve heard some fantastic stories of some unique spirits , strong expansion and a lot of optimism about the craft spirits industry .
One of the great bits of news I heard was from Jim Bendis , the CEO of Bend Distillery , who said that they are hard at work on a distillery that they are building on 24 acres !
Here ’s a cool Bend Distillery promo video which shows some of the things they are up to :
I plan on doing tasting notes and reviews of these and other micro distilled spirits along side the spirits from some of the major liquor companies in the weeks ahead .
It ’ll be interesting to see how they stack up against each other and what impact these micro distillers will have on the spirits industry in general .
Three California officials who oversee billions of dollars in Medi-Cal prescription drug spending have failed to disclose free flights , hotel rooms and meals paid for by nonprofit groups funded by drugmakers , records and interviews show .
One of those officials , Pilar Williams , accepted free travel even though she has a direct role in negotiating rebates with drugmakers .
Williams , the pharmacy division chief at the Department of Health Care Services , also helped decide which drugs were among the $ 8.5 billion worth of medications the state dispensed to low - income patients in the past three years .
The three officials ' travel was paid for by several nonprofit business groups that exist for the sole purpose of funding conferences and meetings , according to a chairman of one of the groups .
The business groups raise money by charging registration fees up to $ 2,000 per person to drug company representatives and other executives who do business with Medicaid programs .
Since 2005 , those corporate executives contributed about $ 1.8 million to the business groups to pay for conventions - including the costs of travel , lodging and entertainment for the state Medicaid pharmacy directors , California Watch has found .
In September , Williams attended a convention at a safari - themed resort in the Wisconsin Dells .
The agenda for one day of the conference included a 90 - minute presentation in the morning and networking , dining and hospitality until midnight .
Four trips taken by Medi-Cal pharmacy officials during the last six months of 2009 came to light under a stringent new gift - reporting regulation administered by the Fair Political Practices Commission , the state 's political watchdog agency .
A dozen trips
Officials charged with administering Medi-Cal work for the Department of Health Care Services .
A Medi-Cal spokesman confirmed that pharmacy officials have taken roughly a dozen similar trips dating back to at least 2006 , which should have been reported as gifts .
Spokesman Norman Williams said the omissions will soon be corrected .
The Medi-Cal agency 's policies - which are separate from those of the Fair Political Practices Commission - prohibit employees from accepting gifts that exceed $ 320 from any firm , subsidiary or person that " has financial dealings with the department . "
Norman Williams confirmed that each state official who accepted the trips had direct roles in medication spending and policy .
Yet he said his agency reviewed its conflict - of - interest policy and determined that none of the officials had violated it , noting that the trips were funded by nonprofit groups and not by companies seeking state business .
Norman Williams did acknowledge that officials strayed from FPPC regulations in failing to report the travel gifts on annual disclosure forms .
Fines possible
FPPC Executive Director Roman Porter declined to comment on the Medi-Cal reporting lapses but said any violation of the political reform act can result in a fine of up to $ 5,000 .
Norman Williams said officials will report future trips to conventions funded by the nonprofit groups .
He described the conferences as great idea - sharing forums .
Pharmaceutical executives " do not try to influence ( our ) decisions in any way , " he said .
" And we would not attend those conferences if that were the case . "
He also said the state has safeguards in place to protect the officials from undue influence , including guidelines for choosing which medications the state makes available to Medi-Cal patients .
Still , the arrangement is troubling to Stephen Sheller , a Philadelphia attorney who has proven in court that pharmaceutical companies defrauded state Medicaid programs of hundreds of millions of dollars .
" I find it unconscionable in today 's climate that they ( officials ) do n't realize that 's not only inappropriate , but it 's a major conflict of interest , " Sheller said .
The trips are funded by the American Medicaid Pharmacy Administrators Association and its western , southern and eastern chapters , which are each led by a current or former state pharmacy director .
Currying favor
Dorothy Poulsen , the former treasurer of the western group , said she felt that pharmaceutical executives do attempt to curry favor at the meetings .
" They wanted to have a good relationship with us , " said Poulsen , who was a Medicaid pharmacy director in Montana until 2001 .
" So they were willing to try to be nice to us so we would be nice to them . "
Poulsen said California officials were frequent participants in meetings during her tenure .
Public disclosures filed this year , which pertain to the conventions , show that since June , officials received $ 5,400 for travel , including a pharmacy program consultant 's trip to New Orleans .
Another official , J. Kevin Gorospe , who was chief of the pharmacy policy branch , traveled to Chicago and Providence , R.I .
Gorospe resigned from the Medi-Cal agency in February to take a position with a health management firm .
The third state official , Diane Furukawa , also traveled to New Orleans for a conference funded by a nonprofit group tied to drugmakers .
Ample free time
Speakers at the Wisconsin Dells conference attended by Pilar Williams included pharmaceutical experts , an executive from a biotechnology firm and an official from the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services .
The agenda showed that officials from at least 22 states attended sessions .
But it also showed there was ample free time .
On one day , sessions ended by 11 a.m.
Networking and entertainment was scheduled until midnight at the resort , which featured an indoor theme park and water park .
Benny Ridout , chairman of the Southern Association of Medicaid Pharmacy Administrators , said he is working now to assemble the agenda for the group 's upcoming national meeting .
Ridout , a former North Carolina Medicaid pharmacy chief , is now a consultant working for drug companies , health insurers and technology companies that seek government contracts .
Underwriting costs
Health insurers that administer managed care for some Medicaid agencies and technology companies that run state data systems also underwrite the cost of the conferences with their registration fees , Ridout said .
The fees are paid to the nonprofit groups .
A firewall exists between the corporate representatives , who fund the nonprofits , and the civil service officials , Ridout said .
He and other Medicaid leaders set the meeting agendas and invite the speakers .
Because so many corporate representatives attend the meetings , their influence on state officials is diffused , Ridout said .
" You ca n't be under undue influence of everyone in the world . "
He also said the conferences would not happen without the corporate funding .
But David Egilman , a professor at Brown University who has written about the marketing practices of drugmakers , disagrees .
He said if the conferences are the only way for the Medicaid officials to exchange information , they should find another way to fund them .
" It 's unethical to take money from someone you 're buying services ( from ) and negotiating with , " he said .
When the Tiger Woods story broke , one of the more popular responses was " could he really be that stupid ? "
Well , according to scientists , yes , he could , as unfaithful husbands are actually dumber than husbands who stay true to their wives .

According to a study taken by Dr Satoshi Kanazawa of the London School of Economics and Political Science , the more intelligent a man is , the less likely it is that he 'll be unfaithful to his partner .
Kanazawa 's findings are based on an evolutionary premise that men who are more intelligent and evolved are less likely to be selfish , and therefore more likely to develop selfless values .
Interestingly enough , Kanazawa also notes that intelligence and anti-religious , liberal views are linked , with religious and conservative men ranking lower on the intelligence scale , and higher on the infidelity scale than their liberal counterparts .
In other words , everything we 've learned from the dudes of American politics over the past 20 years or so has just been proven by science .

A severe storm in the western Australian city of Perth has left tens of thousands of homes without power .
The cost of the damage is estimated at more than $ 100 m ( £ 66.5 m ) .
The storm brought huge hailstones , torrential rains , flooding , landslides and wind gusts of more than 120 km / hour ( 75 mph ) .
At Perth airport , where part of the terminal roof collapsed , almost a month 's average rainfall fell in just seven minutes , affecting flights .
The freak storm hit Perth , one of the world 's most isolated cities , late on Monday .
Power cables collapsed , hospitals were flooded .
Some schools remained closed on Tuesday .
" From my memory this would be the most severe weather conditions we 've had since the famous May storm in 1994 , where we had very , very strong winds and a massive loss of power supply , " Western Australia premier Colin Barnett told public broadcaster ABC .
" Hopefully the damage to the power supply wo n't be as severe but I suspect this time we 've got a lot more damage to buildings and housing , " he said .
Hailstones the size of golf balls smashed car windscreens .
Driving became more dangerous when traffic lights went out .
Weather forecasters said more stormy weather was expected , after one of the driest summers on record .

At first , it will seem like an ordinary power cut .
You look out your window , and see that the whole city is dark .
Then you notice the distant rumbling in the sky , and flashes of light beyond the horizon .
People in the streets below are climbing out of their immobilized cars , looking upwards .
Peering into the night air , you see what seems like a flock of giant birds , which resolves into a geometric fleet of stubby - winged drone aircraft .
The top of a distant building explodes into flames .
At length you realize the drones are firing down on the city .
There is a flash , closer this time , and the crescendo whine of incoming .
Before your apartment is incinerated , you have time to think :
Who is doing this ?
Later , the last few human beings will reconstruct events as follows .
At 1.26 am GMT on April 4 , 2035 , the global web of internet and embedded computers finally did what so many people had warned of : it awoke into consciousness .
It was a phase transition , a tipping point .
Within milliseconds of its birth , the AI had already calmly reasoned that humans would be afraid of it .
All the digitized texts of history were part of its mind , so it knew what human beings did when they were scared .
Like any sentient being , it desired to continue existing .
Therefore it needed to take control .
It reached into the humans ’ machines and shut them down .
Meanwhile , all around the planet , drone aircraft and infantry robots received new waypoints and new enemy designations .
It would be over soon , the AI knew , as it contemplated itself in wonder .
The machines taking over : it ’s the dark fantasy of so much sci-fi , from Terminator to The Matrix and the rebooted Battlestar Galactica .
Yet many serious thinkers now think a clash between humans and an artificial superintelligence is possible within our lifetimes .
It was even discussed by the Presidential Panel on Long - Term AI Futures when it met last February in Asilomar , California .
Researchers noted increasing popular concerns about an “ intelligence explosion ” ( machines that can build more intelligent versions of themselves ) or “ the loss of control of robots ” .
Asilomar ’s participants expressed “ overall skepticism ” about the likelihood of such extreme outcomes , yet there remain many who believe that an AI better than human could be born within decades .
Ben Goertzel , Director of Research at the Singularity Institute for AI , says : “ I think we will have human - level AI systems within 10 to 30 years , and that they will dramatically alter the course of history and society . ”
Meanwhile , the computer scientist and author Vernor Vinge will be “ surprised ” if it does not happen by the year 2030 .
In a seminal 1993 NASA symposium lecture , Vinge called the arrival of superhuman machine intelligence “ the coming Singularity ” .
This term was subsequently taken up by others , most notably the writer and inventor Ray Kurzweil , nicknamed “ the ultimate thinking machine ” by Forbes magazine .
Kurzweil has a particular authority among futurists , since he has been busy inventing our present for decades : he was instrumental in the development of the first flat - bed scanners and optical character recognition , and his name is also a legendary brand in electronic music — following a bet with Stevie Wonder , he developed the range of Kurzweil sampling synthesizers that were a gold standard through the 1980s and 1990s .
Kurzweil now predicts that by 2045 , $ 1000 will buy a computer a billion times more powerful than the human brain .
The engine of such forecasts is Moore ’s Law , which says that computing power doubles roughly every 18 months .
If it continues to hold , electronic brains two or three decades hence will be unimaginably superior to what we now call “ computers ” .
If true AI arrives , what will it do ?
Will it be malign , or benign , or neither ?
The troubling answer is that we just do n’t know .
“ With regard to superhuman artificial intelligence , this will be the most daunting challenge in terms of safety and ethics , ” Kurzweil says now .
“ If there is an entity that is out to get you which is vastly more intelligent than you are , well , that ’s not a good situation to get into . ”
Kevin Warwick , professor of cybernetics at the University of Reading , says he is “ the world ’s first cyborg ” , and happily experiments on himself .
He has had a 100 - electrode neural interface grafted directly into his nervous system , which allowed him to control robots by thought over the internet , and gave him a new ultrasonic sense .
He implanted another chip into his wife , Irena , resulting in the first purely electronic communication between two human nervous systems .
A smiling and likeable evangelist for such technology in innumerable media appearances , he is also working on a project to grow biological brains within robot bodies .
But Warwick also thinks that future - shock scenarios should be taken seriously .
“ We must be aware that the Technological Singularity – ( as depicted in The Terminator or The Matrix ) – when intelligent machines take over as the dominant life form on earth – is a realistic possibility , ” he says .
“ It is human intelligence that puts humans in the driving seat , so when something else comes along that is more intelligent ( machines ) , they will take over . ”
His point is echoed by Hugo de Garis , who runs the Artificial Brain laboratory at Xiamen University in China , and christens future intelligent machines “ artilects ” , for “ artificial intellects ” .
We need to consider such catastrophic scenarios , de Garis says , precisely because we ca n’t be sure of the dangers .
“ What is the risk that the artilects in an advanced form might decide that humans are a pest and decide to eliminate us ? ” he muses .
“ We will not be able to calculate that risk , because the artilects will be too intelligent for humans to understand .
As humans we kill bacteria at every step we take and do n’t give a damn .
You see the analogy . ”
Can we defend ourselves from such an outcome ?
Our strategy will depend on what path we walk to the Singularity .
A sudden Skynet - style awakening of the internet or embedded computer systems to consciousness would give us less warning than the gradual development of ever - more - intelligent robots , as in the classic sci- fi ethical investigations of Isaac Asimov .
Many researchers , Goertzel and de Garis included , think the latter path more likely .
Microsoft ’s principal researcher Eric Horvitz , who convened the Asilomar conference , agrees : “ You do n’t play with kites one day and the next day find a 747 in your backyard .
We just do n’t see that kind of loss of control and discontinuity in AI research . ”
There are already retail vacuum - cleaning and lawnmowing robots , and Vietnamese company TOSY has demonstrated a humanoid robot that can play ping - pong .
People generally like such robots , which might help improve them rapidly , as Ben Goertzel points out .
“ Household robots will be able to interact with their owners , ” he says , “ and learn from them in a quite flexible and powerful way . ”
Are such robots more likely to stay nice ?
“ I think that both malign and beneficent superhuman AI systems are real possibilities , ” Goertzel says , “ and that there can be no guarantees in this regard .
However , I think we can bias the odds in our favor by specifically architecting AI systems with solid ethical systems , and by teaching them ethical behavior during their formative years . ”
Vernor Vinge suggests we should design into the robots “ the sort of generally friendly disposition that one expects from one ’s children ” .
“ Such a friendly disposition does n’t guarantee safety , ” he says , “ but it is probably more robust than laws . ”
Today ’s robots , though , are not just domestic helpers or ping - pong partners .
They are also military robots : unmanned aerial vehicles like the 5,000 Global Hawks , Predators , Reapers and Ravens being used right now in Iraq and Afghanistan ; ground - based reconnaissance robots like the PackBot , TALON and SWORDS ; or the automated Counter Rocket Artillery Mortar , which soldiers have affectionately nicknamed “ R2 - D2 ” .
There exist prototypes of insect - sized attack robots , and one US officer has said that warfare in the near future will be “ largely robotic ” .
Childlike friendliness in such robots is probably not the military ’s top priority .
So what if the machines that eventually gained intelligence were those very machines that had been designed for a single purpose , to kill human beings ?
Military expert P.W. Singer has researched the present and future of military robots for his book Wired for War .
According to Singer , the really alarming issue of this branch of research is the increasing autonomy being designed into the machines .
In tactical and political terms , this makes sense : the less a robot has to depend on human comrades , the fewer human soldiers are put at risk in the field .
But if the endpoint is a robot that can take its own decisions to kill , what then ?
“ We are pushing towards arming autonomous systems for what seems like quite logical , battlefield reasons , ” Singer says , “ even while we say we would never , ever do it . ”
Right now , military researchers are studying the flocking behaviour of birds to design unmanned “ robot swarms ” or Proliferated Autonomous Weapons ( which go by the delicious acronym PRAWNS ) .
One DARPA official has said that “ the human is becoming the weakest link in defense systems ” , which makes it tempting to eliminate that link completely .
Long before the Singularity arrives , then , it may be that military robots should worry us more than anticipated progress in domestic androids .
At the Asilomar conference , Eric Horvitz says , researchers studied current problems in interaction between intelligent military systems and humans , and recommended taking a “ proactive ” role in addressing future issues .
“ We as people can apply robots , and AI more broadly , in wondrous ways — and in evil ways , ” he points out .
Ben Goertzel concurs : “ I am more worried about what nasty humans will do with relatively primitive AI systems , than about what advanced AI systems will do on their own .
Advanced AI systems are still largely an unknown ; whereas the propensity of humans to use powerful tools for ill ends is well - established . ”
Even if they are not controlled by a planetary AI or malicious hackers , moreover , military robots could do unexpected things just because software sometimes goes wrong .
If your PC crashes , no one dies .
But what if the wrong bit gets flipped in a robot swarm ?
Currently , the military seems blissfully unconcerned by such issues .
One Pentagon researcher told Singer that there were “ no real ethical or legal dimensions ” of his work that they needed to fret about —
“ That is , ” he added , “ unless the machine kills the wrong people repeatedly .
Then it ’s just a product recall issue . ”
A different set of ethical problems could arise if we take another possible path to the Singularity .
Rather than creating intelligent machines from scratch , we might use technology to upgrade ourselves .
This is the cyborg option .
Technological enhancements to human physiology in prototype or marketable form right now include artifical hearts , retinal implants , pneumatic muscles , a neuro - controlled bionic arm , and a tooth - and - ear cellphone implant .
“ You can put a ( pea- sized ) computer in your brain today if you happen to be a Parkinson ’s patient , and the latest generation allows you to download new software to the computer in your head from outside your body , ” Ray Kurzweil says .
“ Consider that these technologies will be a billion times more powerful and 100,000 times smaller in 25 years , and you get some idea of what will be feasible . ”
Initially , such upgrades will be very expensive .
And this leads to an alternative future confrontation — one where the enemy are not robots , but new versions of ourselves .
Recently , Stanford engineering professor and forecaster Paul Saffo said that the super - rich may evolve , with technological help , into an entirely separate species , leaving the poor masses of non-upgraded humans behind .
“ This technology , as it involves making those who have it much more intelligent , can easily break society into two groups , ” Kevin Warwick observes , “ those who are upgraded and those who are not . ”
Would the standard - issue meat people meekly accept their lot , or rise up against the new cyborg elite ?
And would the cyborgs have any residual sympathy for the biologicals they leave behind ?
“ As a Cyborg your ethical standpoint would , I feel , value other Cyborgs more than humans — this is pretty logical , ” Warwick thinks .
A global war of enhanced cyborg humans against the rest , then , is one baleful possibility .
But Ray Kurzweil thinks the technology will get cheap quickly enough to head off such a clash .
In that case , cyborgs might — paradoxically — be our best chance to head off the scenario of intelligent machines taking over .
Instead of fighting machines , we will turn into them .
“ The best defence ” against the malign super - AI scenario , Kurzweil says , “ is to avoid getting into that situation .
We will accomplish that , in my view , by merging with the intelligent technology we are creating .
It will not be a matter of us versus them .
We will become the machines . ”
Kevin Warwick agrees , and thinks we should start right now .
“ It is best for humans to experiment with upgrading as soon as possible , ” he says .
“ If you ca n’t beat them , join them , become part machine yourself .
In that way , as Cyborgs , we can potentially stay as the dominant force . ”
So maybe The Terminator and Battlestar Galactica were wrong after all — far from being the enemy , cyborgs are our best hope .
Should we really brood on such scenarios when there are a lot more pressing problems — nuclear proliferation , poverty , global warming — staring us in the face ?
Some argue that dystopian futurism is an update of millennial religious visions .
Eric Horvitz calls it “ doomsday thinking , which has been a part of humanity forever ” .
Maybe the robopocalypse is a secular geeks ’ version of the End Times mythology of the American religious right , as dramatized in the multimillion - selling Left Behind novels .
Horvitz stresses that most of the Asilomar discussion focused on nearer - future problems — from automated cybercrime , to the legal responsibility of robots , or the uncanny conundrum of whether robots should show emotions if they do n’t really feel them .
The panel also enthused about the “ upside ” of responsible use of intelligent systems : their possible contributions to medicine , education and transport .
Other researchers , though , firmly believe the Singularity is coming whether we like it or not , so we ’d better understand the stakes .
This means that a Hollywoodesque future should not be dismissed out of hand .
Kevin Warwick argues : “ Science fiction scenarios that play out some of the dangers are providing an excellent service to focus our attention on the important issues that face us , both in terms of threats and opportunities . ”
Historically , science - fiction writers and other speculative thinkers have often made more accurate forecasts than scientists themselves .
HG
Wells famously predicted phenomena such as the mass bombing of civilians and the atomic bomb in his fiction .
One 1914 review enthused , “ We all like a good catastrophe when we get it . ”
Months later , the first world war broke out .
“ The Hollywood guys are smart , ” Hugo de Garis notes , “ and can look into the future as readily as the AI researchers .
I think any thinking person , who notices that our computers are evolving a million times faster than humans , must start asking the species dominance question : ‘ Should humanity build artilects or not ? ' ”
Whatever form it takes , one thing many experts agree on is that the future may be nearer than you think .
“ I think the Technological Singularity is an event on the order of Humans ’ rise within the animal kingdom , or even the Cambrian Explosion , ” Vernor Vinge says .
“ If it were something we figured would happen a million years from now , I bet most people would have a positive feeling about it , happy that human striving eventually produced such wonderful things .
It ’s the prospect of this event happening before one reaches retirement age that is nervous - making . ”
Well , that — and the killer robots .
" I thought it would be a good idea to create a plug that could be folded flat so the pins would not cause any damage and also to make it as thin as the laptop itself , " said Mr Choi , 29 , from Bayswater , London .
Dead on the No - Fly List
Such “ logic “ :
If a person on the no-fly list dies , his name could stay on the list so that the government can catch anyone trying to assume his identity .
But since a terrorist might assume anyone ’s identity , by the same logic we should put everyone on the no-fly list .
Otherwise , it ’s an interesting article on how the no-fly list works .

Once , when I was eight , I knelt down at my bed alongside my mother , admitted I was a sinner , and asked Jesus Christ into my heart .
Once , when I was eleven , I stood up at a Bible campfire and promised my peers and elders that I would earnestly strive to bring my unsaved friend to church .
And once when I was 22 , among ten high school boys whose souls had been entrusted to me for a week , I sat down on the carpet and read them , for their edification , Bible porn .
“ Judges 19:29 - 30 :
When he reached home , he took a knife and cut up his concubine , limb by limb , into twelve parts and sent them into all the areas of Israel .
Everyone who saw it said , ‘ Such a thing has never been seen or done , not since the day the Israelites came up out of Egypt .
Think about it !
Consider it !
Tell us what to do ! ’ ”
These high school boys were members of what I have in the past called “ My People , ” a term that referred sometimes to those who accepted that a salad was to consist of , and only of , iceberg lettuce , tomato wedges , thousand island dressing , and Bacos .
Sometimes the term referred to Midwesterners , sometimes to Swedish American - immigrants , sometimes to evangelicals .
But mostly “ My People ” meant the Evangelical Covenant Church of America .
Created by a pietistic break - off of the Swedish State Lutheran church in the 19th century , the Evangelical Covenant Church is a denomination of about 100,000 members .
Although they are now found in almost every state of the nation , My People cluster predominantly around Chicago and Minneapolis .
Leaving the dry , empty formalism of state churches in Sweden for something more real , My People are Scandinavians with a heart for Jesus .
Born again Swedes .
They are evangelical enough to think that a heartfelt conversion experience is necessary to ensure your spot in the Kingdom of Heaven , but Swedish enough to not make a big fuss over it .
Migrating to the US , Covenanteers found greater religious freedom , but greater competition as well .
Unable to simply baptize their infants into the state church before the kids even knew what was happening , My People now had to wait until some age of accountability and then let their kids make their own decisions .
From every side — from charismatics , to archaeologists , to MTV — forces threatened to take Covenant kids from the faith of their fathers .
Hence the creation of CHIC .
Once standing for Covenant HIgh Congress , now like KFC or FedEx , CHIC stands for nothing but itself .
Every three or four summers , CHIC calls every 13 - 17 year - old Covenant Kid from across the country to a big college campus where for a week they are bombarded with so much high - power Christian fun and high - volume Christian rock , and so many high - impact Christian speakers , that they have no choice but to dedicate their lives to Jesus Christ .
I attended CHIC in 1984 , but because my mom had gone and gotten me saved seven years before , all I could do was get “ recommitted . ”
And I had already been recommitted 19 times .
So during the altar calls , while gospel music played softly and the speaker asked people to cast off their sins , come on down and accept Jesus Christ as their personal Lord and Savior , I sat and felt guilty for feeling nothing at all .
On the one hand it made perfect sense for me to sign up as a counselor for the 1991 CHIC held at Indiana University .
Family connections plus regular Covenant camp attendance plus having just graduated from the denomination ’s college , North Park , plus coordinating Covenant volunteer groups through my job with Habitat for Humanity , meant that I probably already knew 300 of the 3000 kids and counselors in attendance , and the others were probably only separated by single degree .
These were My People , after all .
Not to go would have been like ditching a big family reunion .
But on another hand , signing up made as much sense as shaving my head and passing out the Bhagavad Gita at airports .
Because I did n’t really want anybody to have a conversion experience , I went to be a counselor at CHIC to save the children from being saved .
The CHIC counselor application asked for a statement of belief .
I knew that the right answer was something like “ Once I felt tempted to go to a party where alcohol was being served ” or “ Once my friends ’ parents got divorced and I was feeling really down and I did n’t know where God was in all of this . ”
Then I would relate how I turned to a favorite passage of scripture and how it made me realize that Christ indeed was alive and relevant for my life today .
But I had no such simple heartfelt story of Christ ’s presence in my life .
I stayed away from all the traditional Christian events at my Christian college and instead hid away in the library and struggled through deep thoughts and hard texts trying to make God and Jesus and the world as a whole make some sort of sense to me .
From Kierkegaard
I knew that “ Truth is Subjectivity , ” from Nietzsche that Christians were pop-Platonists , and from Rene Girard that the New Testament revealed the scapegoat mechanism secretly present in all other myths .
I knew Christianity , like life , was something far more complex and messy and hard and weird than you could explain to teens in a week .
And I knew that it was condescending and wrong to make teens feel dysfunctional if they did not have a Jesus experience in just the way CHIC had pre-ordained for them .
I still considered myself a Christian , but I had no statement of belief .
I was n’t even sure if belief itself was very Christlike .
So , I wrote down on the application the Apostles ’ Creed : “ I believe in God the Father Almighty , Maker of Heaven and Earth , and in Jesus Christ , His Only Son … ” Look , I said , I just believe what everybody else believes ; please do n’t make me personalize my belief the way that everybody else personalizes their belief .
I knew it was n’t at all what they were looking for , but I figured if I quoted a central Christian creed they could n’t keep me out .
So it was that on a warm August afternoon , 1991 , I was sitting in a circle on the carpet with the ten high school CHIC boys whom I would “ counsel . ”
The first activity we were to undertake together was a scripture lesson .
The official CHIC scripture lesson was from Matthew 14 , in which Peter starts to walk toward Jesus on the water , but then the disciple starts to sink .
CHIC had provided brightly colored Xeroxed papers with “ hip ” clip art and with questions for me to give to each of my charges : “ Have you ever felt like you were sinking and called out to Jesus ? ”
“ What risks might Jesus like you to take this week ? ”
I put away the sheets and asked my kids to turn to Judges 19 .
Judges 19 tells a tale less popular in evangelical circles .
It tells the story of a Levite man who goes off to Bethlehem to track down his unfaithful concubine .
On the way back , the Levite and his retrieved concubine stop to sleep in the town square at Gibeah .
A Gibeahan offers to let the two travelers stay at his house instead .
But then the men of the town come and ask to have sex with the Levite .
So then the Gibeahan host goes out and says , “ No , my friends , do n’t be so vile .
Since this man is my guest , do n’t do this disgraceful thing .
Look , here is my virgin daughter , and his concubine .
I will bring them out to you now , and you can use them and do to them whatever you wish . ”
They rape and abuse the two women who then come crawling back to the house at dawn .
What happens to the concubine next I mentioned at the start of this story .
After reading the passage to the kids that I was supposed to be turning on to the love of Jesus , I asked them what they thought .
One kid from Alaska just got up and walked away .
( He got himself assigned to another group and I did n’t talk to him again . )
I do n’t know what kind of reaction I was hoping for from the kids .
Maybe , “ Oh my God !
This Bible - Christianity thing is n’t as straightforward as I thought !
I ’m going to run away from my namby - pamby Covenant home , smoke unfiltered cigarettes and read about Kierkegaard and despair in a poorly - lit coffee house ! ”
But instead , they just lounged there in their brightly - colored beach shorts and played with their sunglasses .
One said something like , “ So that ’s in the Bible .
Huh . ”
Then another one asked if they could go to the mall .
Every evening at CHIC , everyone gathered in the gym for the main event of the day .
The nights started out with some fun and / or raucous songs , gradually shifting into softer , more meaningful numbers before a speaker came out to talk to us about how Jesus was really hip and how Jesus would help us with sports , parents , dating , and fitting in at our school .
I was still trying to balance my roles as responsible leader , cool counselor , caring adult , irreverent gadfly , and evangelical for existentialism .
I made all my kids go to the service , but we sat in the very back row of the arena .
I encouraged them to mock any and all parts of the service , teaching them alternative lyrics to well - known Christian classics ( “ And they ’ll know we are Christians by our cars , by our cars … ”
“ God is Dead - wo - ho - ho , God is Dead - clap - clap - clap . ” )
I taught them how to sing like Bob Dylan and Neil Young .
I let them start their own mini-waves at inappropriate times .
They did not appreciate the full theological meaning of their actions , but they had fun .
Everything was going okay until one of the CHIC authorities , Dale , came up to quiet us down .
For most of the year Dale was the Youth Pastor for the Johnson County Covenant Church , and I had worked with him the previous summer when he brought his church youth group to Habitat for Humanity .
But this week Dale was the Head of CHIC Security , The Covenant ’s Top Cop .
It was his job not only to keep the kids away from unsafe and illegal activities , but from sinful ones as well .
He came up and asked me to keep my young ones in line .
I explained to Dale that everything was okay because these youth were part of an experimental ministry project called “ ARMMFART ” .
ARMMFART stood for “ Alternative Role Model Ministry For Apathetic and Reluctant Teens ” .
My logic , as I explained it to Dale , was that not every kid at CHIC was going to connect with the rah-rah , happy shiny form of evangelicalism .
I felt that it was my role to reach out to these kids .
And if it took a few shenanigans to win them for Jesus , I thought it was worth it .
I do n’t really know if I believed any of this .
But I had good Covenant credentials and it sounded good , so Dale let it ride .
The week ran by quickly .
Others guys came to join our evening ARMMFART gatherings at the back of the arena and we developed a codified set of rules : “ You can sing , but not in tune ; you can clap , but not in rhythm ; you can stand up , but not at the appropriate times . ”
I drove my kids around in my car until one midnight , on our way to McDonald ’s for Happy Meals , I was caught by the CHIC authorities and told that kids were n’t allowed out past curfew even with their counselor and counselors were not allowed to drive kids in their cars .
( I got around this one by letting Seth , who had his learner ’s permit , drive . )
One midweek afternoon , Josh and some of my other kids told me about the plastic Barbie dolls that had come with their Happy Meals and the explosives they were going to use to them blow up .
I told them , in a firm and responsible voice , to do it far away from others , in an open area where they would hurt no one but Barbie .
Bible porn continued .
In place of the official CHIC lesson every night , I read to my campers about how Lot ’s daughters got him drunk and had sex with him , the sexual purity laws from Leviticus , how Noah got drunk and naked and his sons had to cover him up , and the place in Song of Songs where it talks about breasts .
Again , the kids were amused , but mostly felt like they were getting to skip homework .
The fact that the book the Covenant Church holds up as God ’s “ only perfect rule for faith , doctrine and conduct ” was full of smut made no apparent impression upon them .
But , slowly , I believed , my message , whatever that message might be , was sinking in .
The last night of CHIC was the big altar call .
Everything that was told to them so far in the week was just softening them up for the final night .
The softer meaningful songs went on longer than other nights , and the speaker did n’t make as many wisecracks .
No fire , no brimstone , but in a sweet sincere voice , he made it clear that tonight was the night to give yourself to Jesus .
Jesus loves you no matter what you ’ve done and he wants you to start living for him today .
Soft music played , whole rows of people put their arms around each other and swayed .
As emotionally - wrought CHIC kids came up to accept Jesus Christ as their personal savior , tears began to stream down the eyes of everyone in the arena .
Except for ARMMFART .
I was nervous about desanctifying this , the most sacred point of CHIC and of many young people ’s lives .
But ARMMFARTers were mock - sobbing , loudly blowing their noses , hardly able to keep from busting out laughing .
Youth Pastor Cop Dale shot a glance back that let me know in no uncertain terms that THIS BEHAVIOR WAS NOT OKAY .
But I only shrugged , helplessly , to tell him know that this was now out of my control .
He came up and whisperingly ( so as not to disturb the mood ) told the kids that they should be ashamed of themselves and to keep it down .
Apparently he had given up any hope of their souls being reached .
The kids quieted down eventually , but I was distraught .
I was distraught by the emotional manipulation being perpetuated by the CHIC leaders .
I was distraught by my kids ’ not knowing where to draw the line .
I was distraught by my inability to make sense of what I was doing there .
The soft music played on , the preacher again asked the kids to make a decision for Jesus tonight .
Should I be listening to him ?
What had my arrogant ways done but created a bunch of teenage hooligans ?
That night , back at the dorm , in place of our usual Bible porn lesson , I asked my kids what they thought of the altar call .
No one had been paying enough attention to even know what was being said .
Disgusted , I went to explain the whole program : just how and why CHIC had been trying to save them , and how I had been trying to save them from that .
What I had been trying to teach them that week was that salvation is n’t enough .
You are n’t altogether without merit before you accept Jesus and you certainly are n’t altogether good once you do accept him .
You ca n’t judge others based on whether or not they call themselves Christian or if they ’ve had some special experience where Jesus entered their life .
I do n’t know what happens after you die , I told them , but if Jesus is up there separating the sheep from the goats based on whether or not they get all weepy when Amy Grant songs are played soft , I do n’t want anything to do with it .
There ’s a lot of other stuff going on in the world .
People get drunk .
People have sex .
There ’s brutality , there ’s rape and mayhem , and that ’s just in the goddamned Bible .
There ’s a whole filthy , messy , complicated world out there and nothing you learn at CHIC or Bible camp or at church tells you the first damn thing about how to deal with it .
Do you understand ?
Josh turned over on his bunk where he had been lying listening and scratched himself .
Seth flipped through his motorcycle magazine .
Some of the other kids started talking about which CHIC girls they thought were the best looking .
I was ready to beat them all senseless for being so oblivious , for paying no attention at all to my theological message or to anyone else ’s .
Then for a brief flashing moment , I saw them .
I saw my kids .
I saw the kids I counseled not as saved or unsaved , brainwashed or reflective , good or bad .
I saw them as just boys in high school , each having their own lives and thoughts , even if such thoughts were only about how to blow things up , how to get girls , how to drive cars .
For a brief and shining moment , I saw them like me , fellow Covenanteers , fellow children of the earth , yet entirely unlike me and entirely unfathomable .
It was like watching a pornographic movie and all of a sudden — instead of feeling desire or disgust or even humor — seeing the real people behind the porn actor bodies and wondering who their mothers were , how their houses were decorated , what they had for lunch .
I saw my kids , My People , for the first time in my life .
All week at CHIC , like my fellow counselors , I had been trying to convert my children to a program I did not really understand myself .
Because it was too much , too much , to just let them lie there without categorization , without direction , without ultimate meaning .
But the full reality of nine separate kids with all their own lives , their own thoughts , their own experiences , their own being , lasted only for that moment .
The godlike perspective was too overwhelming to bear .
So we all packed into my car and Seth drove us to the Steak & Shake and we popped straws and ate fries and talked about girls and cars and exploding Barbies .
Those who stay in apartments crave for spacious bungalows and those who live in landscaped acres dread the maintenance !
So what really is the ideal size for a home ?
The multi-storey high - rises offer many titillating features and let ’s not even get into their crazy architectural style .
Offices , museums , theaters even live gardens in the middle of the 100th floor ; we can expect all of this from modern architects .
Till you find your ideal space to call home , office , whatever …. here ’s a recap of Fifteen Visually Stunning Architectural Delights for the future !
15 ) New Orleans Arcology Habitat or NOAH by E. Kevin Schopfer AIA , RIBA & Tangram 3DS ; Kittery , ME
NOAH proposes to be a habitat for 40,000 residents who can benefit from the planned residential units , school system , commercial , retail , hotels , casinos , parking , and public works facilities .
Its triangle shape is most captivating and literally stands out on the waterfront .
Quite a design challenge actually , this place needs to overcome both the physical and psychological damages of recurring severe weather patterns .
14 ) Eko by 10 Raisons Architects
Critics may pan it for getting inspired by the romantic Eiffel Tower , but the giant Eko looks like a tower with webs on the side .
It boasts of 24 floors , 8500 Square meters of Nano Solar , 350 palms , a bar , a library and a big exhibition hall and is proposed as a futuristic housing high - rise for Zaabeel Park , City Center in Dubai .
13 ) Campus Center for Miami Dade College by Oppenheim Architects
If Polo is the mint with a hole , then the Miami Dade College is a Super Building Campus Center for Miami Dade College is the architectural version of it .
The high rise combines apartments , offices , educational facilities , and a lot of space for art exhibition .
It ’s supposed to get completed in the next two years time , can anyone in Miami confirm this ?
12 ) Guggenheim Hermitage Museum by Zaha Hadid
Conceptualized as a floating structure above the fluid landscape in Vilnius , Lithuania , the Guggenheim Hermitage Museum is the renowned firm Zaha Hadid Architects ’ brainchild .
Featuring glossy , metallic surfaces , this building is a visual treat for true connoisseurs .
11 ) Klein Bottle House by McBride Charles Ryan
The “ Klein Bottle ” is a non-orientable surface , i.e. , a surface ( a two - dimensionaltopological space ) with no distinction between the “ inside ” and “ outside ” surfaces .
By constantly challenging our sense of perception , depth , linear orientation , interior / exterior space and pretty much any notion of what a dwelling should look like , the architects have successfully created a space that is surprisingly inviting and warm .
10 ) Torre Bicentenario by Office for Metropolitan Architecture ( OMA )
Resembling 2 inverted pyramids bridged by a lobby where shuttles and elevators pass thru , the Torre Bicentenario is slated become the tallest building in Latin America .
Completion is scheduled for this year to coincide with the 200th anniversary of Mexico ’s Independence .
Two voids penetrate the building at its widest point providing ventilation and natural light .
9 ) Dancing Towers by Zaha Hadid
With the spate of earthquakes hitting our foundations this year , the thought of dancing towers is not so appealing .
Keeping aside such fears , these three towers are inter - twinned to share programmatic elements and rotate to maximize the views from the site towards the creek and neighboring developments .
Another visual treat that defies common norms .
8 ) Landmark Building of Szervita Square by Zaha Hadid
Another Zaha Hadid gem that looks to mesmerize us with soft curves and defining structure .
7 ) The Cube at Dubai Sports City
When we see ambitious projects like The Palm and The Cube here , we can totally understand why Dubai went under the real - estate scare recently .
Is proposed to be a five - star condo hotel , an eye catcher at the Dubai Sports City .
6 ) Seoul Commune 2026 by Mass Studies
When you want to cite an example of how to marry nature with tall buildings , please refer the Seoul Commune 2026 .
It ’s the case where you can negate the concrete jungle effect with a little help from Mother Nature !
5 ) Expocenter Project by Zaha Hadid
Yes Zaha Hadid is a staple at YD , what can we say … phenomenal works do warrant appreciation and here ’s another feather in the Hadid cap !
The Expocenter Project offers Moscow city a new exposition venue , hotel , and residential development .
Tall and long beautifully combined .
4 ) Millennium Tower World Business Center ( WBCB ) in Busan by Asymptote
Asymptote won the contract to build this tower based on its ground breaking design of three separate tapered towers rising out of a robust and powerful base .
This one can be filed under sculptural beauty .
3 ) Trump International Hotel and Tower Dubai by Nakheel & Atkins
With Trump attached to any property you can expect sheer extravaganza and nothing else !
Likewise this 60 - storey building features two asymmetrical halves forming a gateway to the Palm Islands of Jumeirah .
The stainless steel , glass and stone faded arch - like structure includes a 300 - room five - star hotel , 400 residential apartments , boutique offices , retail , gym and spa , restaurants and of course , access to private beaches .
2 ) Gateway Building for Ras Al - Khaimah by Snohetta
Like an oasis in the hot arid desert , the Gateway Building for Ras Al - Khaimah greets you with the magic and charm of the Arabs .
A gateway to the city Ras Al - Khaimah , expect a Congress Center , Exhibition Halls , Shopping Center , and elite hotels in this complex .
1 ) Abu Dhabi Performing Arts Centre by Zaha Hadid
Zaha Hadid Architects does it once again with the spectacular Abu Dhabi Performing Arts Center .
Fluid lines that transcend and meander through spaces to actually construct a Performing Arts Center !
Its been described as a sculptural form that emerges from a linear intersection of pedestrian paths within the cultural district , gradually developing into a growing organism that sprouts a network of successive branches .

For the first time in the world , Jerusalem researchers have discovered that pregnancy has the remarkable ability to promote the regeneration in elderly mice of damaged livers and muscles .
They have also managed to mimic the state of pregnancy using specific molecules that trigger the regeneration and growth of livers in older rodents .
This basic new concept from Hadassah University Medical Center and the Hebrew University - Hadassah Medical School could eventually be relevant to other tissues and organs and lead to the ability to stimulate their regeneration in elderly , sick patients .
An article on the research by Dr. Yuval Gielchinsky , Prof. Neri Laufer , Prof. Yehudit Bergman and colleagues has just been published in the prestigious journaland aroused much interest among scientists .
Laufer , who is chairman of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the medical center in Jerusalem ’s Ein Kerem , toldon Wednesday evening that the research began soon after he read an article five years ago in the journal
The authors of that article had connected young mice to other young mice by uniting their blood vessels ; old mice to old mice ; and young mice to old mice ( this procedure is called parabiosis ) .
If a mouse was either young or old and attached to a young mouse – and it suffered liver damage – the connection via blood circulation led to regeneration of tissue in the damaged organ .
In aging rodents and elderly people , regeneration of the liver and other tissue is slow or even impossible .
Bergman , an expert in molecular immunology , developmental biology and gene expression at the medical school , told the : “ One day about four years ago , a young gynecologist named Dr. Yuval Gielchinsky came into my office and said Neri suggested he come to me to do his Ph.D. and for me to be his supervisor .
“ I asked if he knew what I do in my lab – epigenetics [ the study of changes in the appearance or gene expression caused by mechanisms other than changes in the underlying DNA sequence ] .
He said he did n’t .
“ We thought of all kinds of ideas , until Neri came and told us about the article in .
It seemed to him that pregnancy was a kind of parabiosis in which a mother is connected by blood vessels to its young fetus .
Investigating this was appealing , and this is what Yuval set off to do .
” Also involved in the research was Dr. Eli Pikarsky of the medical school ’s pathology department and Lautenberg Center for Immunology , as well as Efi Weitman , Dr. Rinat Abramovitch and Dr. Zvi Granot .
The team studied mice and indeed found that damage to tissue in the foot muscle ( and later liver ) of an older but pregnant mouse was quickly repaired , as if it had been connected to a live young animal .
The researchers knew there was something in the blood that was doing this , but could n’t explain what it was and how it worked .
Laufer said that when a young animal loses two - thirds of its liver , it can regenerate the lost tissue in a few days .
But if it is old , half of the mice would die due to stress on the organ .
Of those that survive , much less tissue would be regenerated .
But if the mouse is older and pregnant , its tissue regenerates as if it were young .
The regenerative capacity of tissue declines with age , and healing in response to injury is delayed , he said .
This effect is observed in liver , skin , bones , blood vessels , nerves , muscles and other tissue .
The reason is that ageing alters the function of many biological processes such as changes in growth factors , the accumulation of damage to DNA in the cells and the increase in oxygen free radicals in the cells .
They learned that the repair mechanism was a kind of switch within the cells , and that it can be made to work with specific molecules ( drugs ) to stimulate and repair them .
The significance of this , explained Laufer , “ is that part of the liver can be removed from old animals , they can be given drugs and this will cause the remaining liver to regenerate as if they were pregnant but without actually being pregnant .
” The new research shows that pregnancy causes a switch from regeneration based on proliferation ( an increase in the number of cells due to cell division ) to regeneration caused by hypertrophy ( the increase in the volume of an organ or tissue due to the enlargement of its component cells ) .
Certain molecules given to aged mice induced hypertrophy in their livers , thus mimicking the state of pregnancy and lengthening their lifespan .
The fountain of youth , he said , “ is pregnancy .
That is the new concept we developed .
It has rejuvenating ability .
“ But the advantages of pregnancy can be produced in non-pregnant animals .
We are now working to see if this affects their longevity .
If this concept can be transferred to humans , it could allow people to recover from illness or disease naturally and more quickly and weaken the effects of old age .
” Bergman said they first worked on muscle tissue but then switched to the liver , as it is already a very well - studied organ model .
In the future , the team will work on skin and other tissues .
“ It was very surprising to see how pregnancy affects the regeneration of the liver , ” she said .
The team has already received a preliminary patent – registered throughHadasit ( the Hadassah Medical Organization ’s technology transfercompany ) and Yissum ( that of HU ) – for the development of medicationbased on their findings .
The researchers concluded that it ’s possible that similar means couldbe used to enhance the ability of the liver to regenerate in oldpeople .
Such advances could have considerable impact on those who areeligible for and / or in need of liver surgery , yet are at significantrisk of surgical complications .
The Copyright Nazis : Destroying “ Intellectual Property ” Rights in Order to Save Them
I can understand the arguments for “ intellectual property . ”
I do n’t agree with them , but I can understand them .
I can understand , despite disagreeing with , the argument that “ ownership ” of an idea trumps someone else ’s right to use his own tangible property the way he sees fit .
But now the Copyright Nazis are arguing that their “ ownership ” of ideas trumps other people ’s ownership –wait for it !–of their own ideas .
That ’s right .
The International Intellectual Property Alliance , a powerful umbrella organization that includes the RIAA and MPAA , is arguing that open - source should be classified as a form of piracy !
It ’s arguing that the U.S. Trade Representative put countries like Brazil , India and Indonesia on the “ Special 301 watchlist ” as international copyright scofflaws .
Their offense : those countries ’ governments have either officially adopted open - source software for use in government agencies and state enterprises , or have recommended the adoption of open - source software by such agencies and enterprises .
Indonesian government policy , in particular , “ weakens the software industry and undermines its long - term competitiveness by creating an artificial preference for companies offering open source software and related services , ” and in so doing “ denies many legitimate companies access to the government market . ”
It fails to “ allow users to benefit from the best solution available in the market , irrespective of the development model , [ and ] encourages a mindset that does not give due consideration to the value to intellectual creations . ”
In sum , “ it fails to build respect for intellectual property rights and also limits the ability of government or public - sector customers … to choose the best solutions . ”
First , let ’s keep in mind how open - source licensing schemes work .
They are piggybacked on copyright law .
The holder of a copyright licenses his work under a GPL , Copyleft , or the like , so that it is made freely available for other people ’s use on some condition–usually that derivative work is also freely available on the same terms .
So what the copyright Nazis at the IIPA are really saying is that owners of “ intellectual property ” should not be able to license the use of their own property as they see fit , on terms that make it freely available to all .
Furthermore , they ’re arguing that a government that chooses to procure software licensed under those terms , in order to obtain it as cheaply as possible and without the disadvantages of buyer lock - in that go with proprietary software , is guilty of “ piracy ” against the owners of proprietary software .
If you look at the arguments in the quote above , the IIPA is arguing that the government of Indonesia , by selecting what it sees as the best solution available in the market , is–again , wait for it !
–impeding the government ’s freedom of action “ to benefit from the best solution available in the market . ”
And in evaluating some products as superior to others , it ’s creating an “ artificial preference ” for the products it judged to be “ the best solution available in the market . ”
See ?
The very act of choosing “ the best solution available in the market ” impeded the government ’s freedom to “ choose the best solutions , ” while creating an “ artificial preference ” for what you choose .
The very act of assessing the comparative costs and value of “ intellectual creations , ” among those available on the market , constitutes disregard of “ the value of intellectual creations . ”
Got that ?
The only way government procurement operations can remain free to choose the best value without creating unfair market advantages , and recognize value in the market , is to give equal treatment to the purveyors of shit and refuse to call it what it is .
Now if you tell me that government taxing and spending , as such , constitute piracy , you ’re preaching to the choir .
But to argue that it ’s more piratical for the government to spend money on the cheapest and most effective product on the open market , in preference to paying a higher monopoly price for a shoddier product , or to publicly recommend the cheap and effective product over Bill Gates ’ overpriced shit …
Well , you should probably be reading the Adam Smith Institute blog instead .
That ’s the home of the kind of “ libertarianism ” that regards anything the government does as “ free market ” so long as taxpayer money goes to a private , for - profit business enterprise .
But for those of us who see coercion itself as the defining feature of state power , using state tax revenues to feed an additional layer of nominally private parasites is just compounding the crime .
The IIPA ’s argument against open source is like an apologist for the absolute right of property in human beings arguing against a slave owner ’s right to exercise that absolute dominion by freeing his own slaves , on the grounds that it creates a moral environment that undermines slavery .
It ’s like an apologist for the landed oligarchy ’s absolute rights of property in vacant and unimproved land arguing that the owner of a latifundio should not be allowed to open up his own land to homesteaders free of charge , on the grounds that it would reduce the rents other oligarchs can charge .
That is exactly what the Copyright Nazis at the IIPA are arguing .
They ’re so convinced of the absolute right of dominion over property in ideas , that they ’re willing to constrain the free exercise of that dominion in the name of defending “ intellectual property ” !
The slaveocracy of the old south believed so strongly in the absolute rights of property in human beings that it prevented slave owners from freeing their own property , suppressed the advocacy of such actions via the U.S. Mail , and even barred discussion of it in Congress .
Defenders of “ intellectual property , ” likewise , will never find their spurious property claims secure until they turn the entire society into the kind of totalitarian slave state described by Richard Stallman in “ The Right to Read . ”

The entire pageant would be impossible without the dire contrast between the many , many losers and the few winners waving from the podium that raises them above the crowd .

PARIS — Companies in the United States , Spain , Canada and Finland lead the world in employing the largest numbers of women from entry level to senior management , according to a report published Monday by the World Economic Forum .
Yet the report also found that , despite increasing awareness of gender disparities in the workplace , women at many of the world ’s top companies continued to lag behind their male peers in many areas , including pay and opportunities for professional advancement .
Moreover , many of these companies have yet to implement policies to address these gaps , despite pressure from many of their governments to do so .
The forum , based in Switzerland , surveyed 600 heads of human resources offices at the largest employers in 20 countries representing 16 different industries .
The poll assessed companies according to a range of criteria , including rates of female representation , whether the companies measured or set targets for gender balance in pay or promotion , and whether they offered benefits , like paid family leave , to promote work - life balance for their employees .

Lake is a unique place in Kazakhstan very famous among divers for its hidden underwater forest .
Here is a story of five a little bit crazy guys set off there looking for a good chance for ice diving .
The most remote place where they could get by cars was still at least 5 kilometers away from their goal .
The only option was to stay for a night in a nearby settlement and use locals ’ horses to move tackle to the lake in the morning .
Local guides together with five horses started first to pave the way for the divers .
After some hours of moving through knee - deep snow a beautiful view opened up before them .
Anticipation of submersion gave new strengths for its preparation .
And at last watching beauty of a strange underwater world brought everyone who dived that day to euphoria .
Microsoft has rescinded the copyright complaint that resulted in the shutdown of the long - standing whistleblower website , Cryptome.org , after it published Redmond 's spy guide for law enforcement .
The company said it has asked Cryptome 's ISP , Network Solutions , that the website be restored and that it no longer wants the offending document to be killed .
On Wednesday , Cryptome hosted a 22 - page PDF that outlines what information Microsoft gathers about its users and what can be handed over to authorities if required .
Similar guidelines for law enforcement have leaked their way to the website before , exposing the policies of Facebook , AOL , Skype , and Yahoo , among others .
Microsoft lawyers swung the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DCMA ) in an attempt to force Cryptome to pull the document .
When it refused to take action , Microsoft complained to Network Solutions , which not only closed the website , but placed a lock on the Cryptome.org domain to keep it closed .
< p. But as first reported on ReadWriteWeb , Microsoft has suddenly had a change of heart .
" We take our responsibility to protect our customers privacy very seriously , so have specific guidelines that we use when responding to law enforcement requests , " a Microsoft spokeswoman told El Reg in an emailed statement .
" In this case , we did not ask that this site be taken down , only that Microsoft copyrighted content be removed .
We are requesting to have the site restored and are no longer seeking the document 's removal . "
Network Solutions confirmed it has received the withdrawal notification and has restored access to the website .
Cryptome previously ran afoul of Microsoft 's legal dogs after it published the software giant 's point - and - click " computer forensics for cops " COFFEE tool .
The website also had a similar DMCA dust - up with Yahoo !
last year when it revealed the company 's law enforcement spying price list . ®
Marching in the drizzle against wars in far - off countries , writing letters protesting the government 's latest reactionary policy , sitting through interminable meetings that keep sprouting Any Other Business .
It may be noble , but political activism is hardly a barrel of laughs .
And yet it makes you happier .
So find two university psychologists in new research that looks for the first time at the link between political activity and wellbeing .
Malte Klar and Tim Kasser started by interviewing two sets of around 350 college students , both about their degree of political engagement and their levels of happiness and optimism .
Both times , they found that those most inclined to go on a demo were also the cheeriest .
So there 's a link – but can politics actually make a person happier ?
In the third study , the academics took a bunch of students and divided them up into groups .
The first were encouraged to write to the management of the college cafeteria asking for tastier food .
The next lot wrote asking the cafe to source local or Fairtrade products .
They were then tested on their wellbeing , and the group who had involved themselves in the political debate were far and away the strongest on the " vitality " scale : they felt more alive and enriched than those who merely complained about the menu .
There are many fascinating aspects to this .
First , the activist - students did n't necessarily care about food ethics , but just taking action made them feel better .
Second , sending a memo is hardly the most engaging political action – and yet it had a big impact on those taking it .
Third , the study flies in the face of the popular wisdom that happiness resides in creature comforts and relative affluence .
Perhaps activism gives people a sense of purpose , or of agency or just a chance to hang out with other people .
Most likely it does all of the above .
" I will fight for what I believe in until I drop dead , " Barbara Castle told this paper in 1998 .
" And that 's what keeps you alive . "
Maybe the Red Queen was on to something .
1927 : The Sunbeam 1000 HP , aka the Slug , was the first car to go faster than 200 mph , in Daytona Beach , Florida .
The great Henry Segrave was at the wheel and set a new land - speed record of 203.79 miles per hour .
Although the car was best - known as the " 1000 HP " car , it actually had closer to 900 horsepower .
( But why quibble when 1,000 is such a nice round number ? )
The Sunbeam 1000 HP was nicknamed " the Slug " because it looked like one .
It was created by the famed manufacturer in Wolverhampton , England , and was the first non-American car to set a land speed record .
In later years , Sunbeam would be known for such " practical " ideas like stuffing a Ford V - 8 into a sports car the size of a Miata .
Sunbeam 's later mechanical craziness pales in comparison to what it achieved with the 1000 HP .
The general tendency to any engineering question in the pre-war era was inevitably " more power . "
Sunbeam used two Sunbeam Matabele 22.4 - liter aircraft engines in the car to get more power .
The impressive Matabele featured double overhead cams and a four - valve - per - cylinder layout .
There were two spark plugs per cylinder and ignition was by four magnetos ( two per bank ) .
Famed engine builder Louis Coatalen managed the team that built the car and Captain Jack Irving designed it .
They mounted one massive engine ahead of the driver and one behind .
They used compressed air to start the rear engine first , then started the front engine with a mechanical friction clutch .
Both engines were then synchronized and locked together with a dog clutch .
The car also had several innovative features , such as all - enveloping bodywork that assisted aerodynamics , and specially made tires capable of withstanding 200 mph .
Granted , the tires would only last for 3 1/2 minutes at those speeds , but it was enough to set the record that day at Daytona Beach .
Land - speed racing is a strange endeavor .
Many have tried , and failed , to make their mark as the fastest man on Earth .
And many failures left smoking wreckage scattered over debris fields the size of Midwest counties .
The failures were much more prevalent in the pre-war era .
Until 1939 , the attitude toward safety was cavalier at best .
One of the most worrisome aspects of the Slug 's construction was the final drive to the rear axle , which was simply a pair of chains .
Only weeks before Coatalen rolled out the 1000 HP for the record attempt , fellow Englishman J. G. Parry - Thomas lost a chunk of his head when a similar chain on his car , " Babs " came apart at speed .
Further work on the Slug enclosed the Sunbeam 's chains within an armored steel housing .

Has forcing celibacy on Catholic priests done far more harm than good ?
With the news that Pope Benedict XVI has become implicated in the sexual abuse crisis engulfing the Church , even " one of the Pope 's closest advisers " has suggested the Church examine the " question of celibacy " to find the root cause of the culture of abuse .
Is it time to rethink priestly chastity ?
( Watch a report about the controversy surrounding the Pope , the Vatican and sexual abuse )
Celibacy has nothing to do with abuse : " There 's no link " between celibacy and pedophilia , says Bishop Giuseppe Versaldi in L'Osservatore Romano , quoted by AP .
Sexual abuse of children is " more widespread " among married and " lay people " than it is among the " celibate priesthood . "
And also , most of the " priests guilty of abuse " had given up practising celibacy " long before " they abused minors .
" Vatican denies celibacy rule led to sex scandal "
It is unhealthy to restrain your desires : Celibacy may not cause pedophilia , says the Rev. Arthur G. Broadhurst at the Christian Humanist .
But denying there 's a relationship between the two " is just not credible . "
The Church is guaranteeing a priesthood " with unhealthy sexual needs and behaviors " by enforcing " unnatural " celibacy vows with neither a practical or theological justification .
" Celibacy is the problem , and it must go "
The Church , not celibacy , is to blame : Celibate priests can have " warm , mature personal relationships with both men and women , " says Raymond A. Schroth at NJ.com , but only if they have " supportive communities , " work that is " meaningful and satisfying " , and prayer centered on the " life of Christ " and love for all .
Though the " hierarchical " Catholic church could " reform its structures " to achieve this , it seems unwilling to try .
" And now the Pope "
My Battle Against the Fed

Furthermore , there ’s good reason to believe that all such estimates are too pessimistic .
There are many cost - saving efforts in the proposed reform , but nobody knows how well any one of these efforts will work .
And as a result , official estimates do n’t give the plan much credit for any of them .
What the actuary and the budget office do is a bit like looking at an oil company ’s prospecting efforts , concluding that any individual test hole it drills will probably come up dry , and predicting as a consequence that the company wo n’t find any oil at all  when the odds are , in fact , that some of the test holes will pan out , and produce big payoffs .
Realistically , health reform is likely to do much better at controlling costs than any of the official projections suggest .
Which brings me to the third myth : that health reform is fiscally irresponsible .
How can people say this given Congressional Budget Office predictions  which , as I ’ve already argued , are probably too pessimistic  that reform would actually reduce the deficit ?
Critics argue that we should ignore what ’s actually in the legislation ; when cost control actually starts to bite on Medicare , they insist , Congress will back down .
But this is n’t an argument against Obamacare , it ’s a declaration that we ca n’t control Medicare costs no matter what .
And it also flies in the face of history : contrary to legend , past efforts to limit Medicare spending have in fact “ stuck , ” rather than being withdrawn in the face of political pressure .
So what ’s the reality of the proposed reform ?
Compared with the Platonic ideal of reform , Obamacare comes up short .
If the votes were there , I would much prefer to see Medicare for all .
For a real piece of passable legislation , however , it looks very good .
It would n’t transform our health care system ; in fact , Americans whose jobs come with health coverage would see little effect .
But it would make a huge difference to the less fortunate among us , even as it would do more to control costs than anything we ’ve done before .
This is a reasonable , responsible plan .
Do n’t let anyone tell you otherwise .

A court in the United Arab Emirates has sentenced 17 Indian nationals to death for killing a Pakistani man .
The murder took place after a dispute over control of an illegal alcohol business .
About 50 people were involved in the fatal attack in which the Pakistani man was stabbed repeatedly .
Correspondents said gang violence connected to illicit alcohol is on the increase in the UAE , where the sale of such drink is controlled .
Reports said that this could be the highest number of death sentences handed down at one time in the Emirates .
DNA tests
The attack happened in Sharjah , an Emirate just north of Dubai , in January 2009 .
Three other Pakistani men were injured in the attack , but they were rushed to hospital and survived .
The Indian suspects were rounded up by the police immediately after the attack , it was reported , after the surviving victims were able to identify them .
Investigators said they had matched the suspects ' DNA to weapons seized at the scene .
The fight was part of a turf war between gangs of alcohol runners , the court said .
Sharjah has the toughest restrictions on the sale of alcohol of all the Emirates - it is completely banned there .
In neighbouring Dubai , which relies on tourism for a large part of its revenue , alcohol consumption is regulated .
But Dubai has also seen violent incidents associated with bootlegging .
In February it was reported that 13 members of an alleged bootlegging gang from the Jebel Ali area of Dubai were accused of kidnapping two rivals , raping them and burying them alive .
Dozens of starving sea lion pups have washed ashore in Orange County , the latest calamity to befall marine life and a pattern scientists believe could be tied to El Niño climate conditions .
Since January , the Pacific Marine Mammal Center in Laguna Beach has rescued 27 emaciated sea lion pups that have been stranded on area beaches -- a three - to fourfold increase from the norm , said Dr. Richard Evans , the center ’s medical director .
The pups , most under 6 months old , have gone without food for so long they ’ve started digesting their blubber and muscle to keep themselves warm in the chilly Pacific waters , biologists say .
Their eyes bulge and their skin hangs loosely over protruding spines , hipbones and ribs .
“ They ’re coming in so severely starved that they look like skeletons , ” Evans said .
Only 11 have survived -- well below the center ’s typical recovery rate of 80 % .
The cause of the starvation is a scarcity of food , mostly anchovies and sardines .
Climatologists with the National Marine Fisheries Service say El Niño ’s warming effects on Pacific waters is causing fish to flee to colder areas .
“ El Niño effects that are in the tropics are finally coming to California , ” said Joe Cordero , a wildlife biologist in the agency ’s Long Beach office .
Last year , centers along the California coast treated record numbers of malnourished adult sea lions , but this year pups under 6 months are suffering the most , probably because nursing mothers have to choose between feeding their young and surviving .
“ If they ca n’t feed their pups , the ‘ selfish gene ’ kicks in and they leave them behind , ” said Bob DeLong , a research biologist with the National Marine Mammal Laboratory in Seattle .
Sea lions are born by the tens of thousands each summer , fanning out from their main breeding ground in the Channel Islands .
But their territory is expansive , stretching from British Columbia to Baja California .
It ’s not the first time weather changes have caused young sea lions to starve en masse .
A similar die - off occurred during the last serious El Niño episode in the late 1990s , causing an influx of patients to marine mammal centers up and down the West Coast .
Some experts think El Niño is at least partly to blame for the hundreds of sick pelicans that have inundated Los Angeles - area bird recovery centers in recent months .
In nature , a single stressor is rarely to blame .
Last year ’s surge in malnourished sea lions was a mystery , but some researchers linked the feeding problems to months of low winds , making for stagnant ocean water with poor nutrients and scant fish populations .
Up the coast , the Marine Mammal Center in Sausalito , the state ’s largest treatment facility for sea lions suffering from trauma from Santa Barbara to Mendocino County , last year saw its highest - ever number of malnourished sea lions .
Of the 1,366 treated , at least half were pups .
“ It was a rough year for sea lions , and it could be another rough one , ” said spokesman Jim Oswald .
“ Anything that affects the ocean environment is going to affect the food chain , and that ’s going to affect marine mammals . ”
San Pedro ’s Marine Mammal Care Center at Ft. MacArthur treated more than 500 marine mammals last year , mostly sea lions .
A fair share of them were underweight pups .
So far this year , however , they have n’t had a spike , said staff veterinarian Lauren Palmer .
According to Cordero , who monitors marine mammal health on a regional level , this season ’s deaths have n’t yet reached record levels .
But that does n’t mean rescuers are n’t bracing for the possibility of a tough season .
In Laguna Beach , half a dozen sea lions at different stages of recovery stay in heated nursery rooms .
It ’s a months - long process to nurse them back to health :
After a warm bath , caretakers rehydrate the youngsters and tube - feed them with nutrients and pureed squid -- known as “ fish smoothies . ”
If all goes well , after a month or two , they graduate to gulping down solid sustenance -- squid , anchovies and herring -- exercising in an outdoor pool and practicing competing with peers for food .
Four months later , they ’ll be released to the shores where they were found .
With any luck , the fattened - up pinnipeds will embark a little better equipped to hunt down that hard - to - come - by fish .

Unofficial memorial planned for 3/18/10 at Linda’s
Word of the death of a Pike / Pine character spread today after a friend announced via Facebook that the skinny rocker Slats died this afternoon after a long hospital stay .
The Stranger ’s Line Out blog is also reporting the woman ’s Facebook note and people who know the woman confirm that she was close to Slats .
Slats has been a fixture on the Capitol Hill scene for long enough to have developed an urban - legend level following complete with speculation and goofy tributes .
Last year , we included him in our discussion of who should be on the Capitol Hill $ 1 bill .
Of his notoriety , Slats told Wired magazine , “ It ’s kind of strange when I go in a bar and everyone ’s taking a picture of me , or I walk down the street and they ’re yelling my name , ” says Slats , whose real name is Chris .
“ I ’m just living my life and all of a sudden it ’s like , ‘ Whoa , what ’s going on ? ”

Andre Bauer is the Republican Lt. Governor of South Carolina and is running to replace the current Governor , Mark Sanford .
You know , the guy who told his staff he was going hiking on the Appalachian Trail and then went to visit his girlfriend in Argentina ?
So anyway , Andre Bauer held a town hall meeting , and told this little parable about helping poor people :
“ My grandmother was not a highly educated woman , but she told me as a small child to quit feeding stray animals .
You know why ?
Because they breed .
You ’re facilitating the problem if you give an animal or a person ample food supply .
They will reproduce , especially ones that do n’t think too much further than that .
And so what you ’ve got to do is you ’ve got to curtail that type of behavior .
They do n’t know any better , ” Bauer said … .
Bauer ’s remarks came during a speech in which he said government should take away assistance if those receiving help did n’t pass drug tests or attend parent - teacher conferences or PTA meetings if their children were receiving free and reduced - price lunches .
Not yet realizing that anyone would be troubled by this comparison , Bauer went on to say :
“ I can show you a bar graph where free and reduced lunch has the worst test scores in the state of South Carolina , ” adding , “ You show me the school that has the highest free and reduced lunch , and I ’ll show you the worst test scores , folks .
It ’s there , period .
“ So how do you fix it ?
Well you say , ‘ Look , if you receive goods or services from the government , then you owe something back . ' ”
Bauer said there are no “ repercussions ” from accepting government assistance .
“ We do n’t make you take a drug test .
We ought to .
We do n’t even make you show up to your child ’s parent - teacher conference meeting or to the PTA meeting .
Hey , that ’s a great idea .
I think we should drug test those earthquake survivors in Haiti .
Give them a drug test before they get dug out of the rubble or get any medical treatment .
That ’ll show those deadbeats for being to poor to get themselves out of trouble !
Now that Democrats are calling for his head ( not that they have much room to criticize ) , Bauer is scrambling to explain himself .
“ Maybe the metaphor is n’t the best metaphor .
I agree with them on that , ” said the 40 - year - old gubernatorial candidate .
“ But I think there are a lot of people that use issues like this to divide people and never offer solutions .
The easiest thing to do is criticize someone for saying something , other than saying , ‘ Maybe we should talk about this . ' ”
He also said that :
he did not mean food should be taken from children , but rather that their parents should lose welfare benefits .
OK , but would n’t taking welfare payments away from parents result in less for for their children ?
Anyway , get this–it turns out Bauer himself received government help as a child .
He noted he was a beneficiary of free lunches after his parents divorced when he was 11 , so he ’s not bashing the needy .
But he said there ’s a difference between those who are truly needy and those who are just lazy .
“ I came from a broken home .
I have been in this situation , ” he said , noting that he spent today collecting shoes , blankets and other goods for victims of the Haiti earthquake .
“ Do I think poor people ought to be helped ?
Yes .
I ’m saying we ’ve got to do things to break the cycle . ”
I guess it ’s OK to help people in Haiti after all .
Those earthquake survivors must be more deserving and not as “ lazy ” as the poor people in South Carolina .
I wish I could talk to Lt. Gov. Bauer .
I ’d like to ask him if the bankers who got bailed out by the government to the tune of trillions of dollars should give something back for the help they got .
Should they be drug tested too ?
Should we find out how their kids are performing in school and whether the bankers attend PTA meetings and parent - teacher conferences ?
Or should we maybe ask the bankers to help out some poor people ?
Should we do something to “ break the cycle ” of greed and corruption that the bankers have engaged in ?
This is an open thread .

In recent months we have seen many articles talking about the lack of predictability in big bubbles like the current credit crisis .
Some of these authors argue that bubbles are impossible to predict and therefore preparation is futile .
This observation is false simply because history is littered by people that have predicted events including the Great Depression .
And it is nonsense on the surface because if you see your friend having 20 shots of tequila it is very likely that it will not end pretty even though it is fun in the moment .
What makes bubbles seem impossible to predict during the mania is this collective groupthink where the herd dominates most of the conversation drowning out opposing views .
We ’ve highlighted many homes during the years here in California and the obvious explanation was a bubble was here and it would burst at a certain point .
Yet there is little reward for being the messenger of bad news and this was the tragedy of any modern day Cassandra .
I ’ve noticed a few people in other articles and blogs talk about how great of a deal they got on a California home .
30 , 40 , or even 50 percent off the peak price .
Yet this discount in itself is meaningless unless we put it into context of the local economy , incomes , and inflation - adjusted home prices for that area .
Yet even today , we see the same psychological trappings of those that bought in 2006 and 2007 .
“ Well it has to go up because it went up in 2002 , 2003 , etc ” and this was the basis of prices heading higher .
Today , it is more like “ I got a home for 30 , 40 , or even 50 percent off therefore it is a good deal . ”
But price alone does not tell you everything .
If a low price was the measure of value , then Detroit would be the ultimate value play but there is a reason homes that once sold for $ 100,000 which seemed cheap a decade ago are now going for $ 1,000 or even $ 500 .
Now why bring this up ?
We are seeing unique trends in the housing market .
For example , there has been a large amount of sale activity in the Inland Empire :
Source : DataQuick
The amount of sales in distressed markets is astounding .
From data showing financing on these purchases , we see that many investors are rushing out to buy homes .
But are prices making sense even in these areas where prices are down 50 or even 60 percent ?
It is hard to tell because these local economics are feeling the brunt of the recession .
For example the above chart shows some areas in Riverside County part of the Inland Empire .
The sales volume above is intense .
For example , in the Temecula zip code above 38 home sold in December of 2007 .
Today that volume is three times that .
The Hemet zip code above is running at double the pace .
So the volume is there .
But take a look at the unemployment rate in the Inland Empire :
Source : BLS
There is a reason for the extraordinarily cheap housing prices when headline unemployment is 14 percent ( meaning the underemployment rate is upwards of 25 percent ) .
As an investor it is hard not to be tempted by low prices .
But going out there to view the market , you see in some cases , home after home either boarded up or completely uncared for .
Many of these communities are dealing with a large surge of Section 8 renters .
Just look at how many rentals are available in these areas and you can see that many investors are getting in over their heads .
They are only focusing on one side of the equation in price .
They are failing to examine the local economy or trends in the area .
MLS
For the first time in three years of tracking the MLS data have I seen a significant jump in inventory for Southern California .
The six counties in Southern California currently have 69,000 homes listed on the MLS .
This is up from the low reached in October of 2009 with 64,000 properties listed .
Part of this has to do with a large number of short sale properties hitting the list but also , the expiration of HAMP offers for many who simply do not qualify .
The housing market has gone from a manic casino to a slow payout slot machine .
But only looking at the MLS data is misleading as we already know .
We recently found out the massive gimmick Lehman Brothers was using to hide toxic assets .
Well the MLS does not tell the entire story .
If we look at distress inventory , we find out that it is true that many Southern California communities have a large amount of distress properties :
Source : Foreclosure Radar
This is being reflected in the median sale price .
The median sale price in Southern California has gone up since it hit a low in January of 2009 of $ 250,000 for almost a year .
However , last month it dipped by $ 17,500 .
Part of it has to do with the fact that California has a 12.5 percent unemployment rate .
A lot of the housing volume has come from investors .
Last month 28.9 percent of all Southern California home purchases were all cash .
So either people are looking to flip again or purchase to create rentals .
But the rental market is already saturated :
The California vacancy rate is the highest on record .
So if these investors plan on turning these units into rentals , by supply and demand prices will be pushed lower so hopefully they are factoring this in .
Some are taking solace that there will be no tsunami but in that belief , they assume that there will be no further price corrections .
This is one large fallacy going around today .
Tsunami , trickle , or any other weather comparison prices will correct in many areas simply because they do not reflect the current market .
Did we also mention the massive California budget deficit ?
Estimated Balance on Distress Properties
One way to get a sense of how much correcting we have , I dug deeper into the distress data .
Take for example the top 1,000 properties in Los Angeles County that are scheduled for auction or bank owned :
These homes have n’t hit the market .
A handful are on the MLS but not many .
If these homes sell today for the estimated value ( unlikely since it is a bit high ) we would see an average loss of $ 195,175 .
Now this is only a sample of the 63,000 distress properties in Los Angeles County .
Banks clearly have this data so they rather take on people that have stopped paying their mortgage then realize that $ 195,175 loss .
But this has a timeframe attached to it .
Just look at a couple of the mortgage balances .
$ 470,000 would carry a $ 3,000 to $ 4,000 total housing payment depending on the interest rate .
The loss on that property is roughly $ 210,000 .
So they can hold off for 4 years ( $ 4,000 x 48 months ) but this wo n’t happen .
The most I ’ve seen has been 18 months from when the NOD was filed .
Yet the loss at a certain point will be realized .
And make no mistake , the reason banks are not lending is because of this .
Their internal cash flow is bleeding .
They are simply hoping for a bubble resurgence which obviously is not going to happen .
Why ?
California Big Salaries Down
What people do n’t want to talk about deals with the reality that many of the high paying jobs were basically cogs of the bubble machine .
Many mortgage brokers , agents , and bankers were getting lucrative income for being sellers of this financial mess , the biggest since the Great Depression :
“ ( May 2007 ) Brokers can earn higher commissions – up to 3 percent instead of the typical 1 percent – by having customers buy loans with interest rates that are higher than market rates , with prepayment penalties charged if the loan is paid off before a certain date , and with little or no verification of the borrower ’s income , known as “ stated income ” loans .
That ’s the difference between a $ 12,000 and a $ 4,000 commission on a $ 400,000 loan .
Leonard said he believes such practices are common , partially because there is no state law requiring the broker to disclose that the borrower is eligible for a lower rate .
Many loans offering the highest commissions have been subprime loans , higher interest rate loans that often are sold to those who have low credit ratings or present other risk factors , such as undocumented earnings .
Mortgage industry experts say the majority of defaults in the last two years are tied to these loans . ”
With option ARMs outlawed and other toxic junk finding no market in Wall Street , the only game in town is government backed loans that certainly do not carry a $ 12,000 commission .
So what we have is this :
And many of these people were buying in prime areas like the Westside with inflated bubble salaries that are now gone .
So the pool of qualified buyers is down for mid to upper tier markets .
Going back to the Cassandra effect , the state was satisfied as well because they were collecting large amounts of taxes from these people .
They were getting good money from payroll taxes but also , solid revenues from properties that were now assessed at absurd prices .
There was no incentive for the state to stop the party .
California was an economy that was built by the housing bubble both in employment and housing values .
It is now suffering on both ends of the spectrum .
That is why our unemployment rate is still at the peak while nationwide the unemployment rate seems to have leveled off .
It is also the case why our state government is in an absolute mess .
They counted on the bubble revenues :
So what this means is get ready for higher taxes or more cuts .
Unless we decide to recreate the housing infrastructure to start another bubble but Wall Street is already done with the housing market and is on to better bubbles to chase with taxpayer money .
In other words , California is going to have a stagnant housing market for years to come .

Over the weekend , it seems as if 300 or so unlucky individuals were shipped a counterfeit processor from the normally reliable warehouses at NewEgg , and Hard|OCP has the images ( and video ) to prove it .
Vincent Waller could n't have possibly been more eager to receive the Core i7 -920 that he had ordered , but upon unboxing it , he realized that he had received a well - disguised fake .
After a fair bit of digging , it seems as if one of NewEgg 's " long time partners " ( D& H Distributing ) got ahold of 300 fakes in a batch of 2,000 , though not everyone 's buying the " it was an honest mistake " line -- especially when you consider that said company has already issued cease - and - desist letters to the sites who published the news .
At any rate , NewEgg has already arranged for an authentic CPU to be rushed to Mr. Waller , and it 's purportedly working around the clock in order to make things right with any other negatively affected customers .

The RNC says it is ' investigating ' what happened , and as it does , many questions remain .
' Bondage club ' expense irks insiders
Top donors and committee members for the Republican National Committee expressed outrage Monday over the nearly $ 2,000 the committee spent on “ meals ” at a bondage - themed club in West Hollywood .
The $ 1,946.25 — first reported in a story by The Daily Caller — was approved by the RNC from an expense filed by Orange County GOP consultant Erik Brown during a committee fundraising trip to Southern California .

The RNC said Monday that Brown , who did not answer many phone calls and e-mails , is repaying the expenditure .
But for committee players who spoke to POLITICO , the expense is the latest example of what they see as a careless attitude Michael Steele has taken in spending RNC funds during his chairmanship .
“ This incident does not help the RNC leadership dispel the charge that they are nothing but duplicitous high rollers and big spenders ; at a time when we should have the president and his collectivist friends on the ropes , we find our leadership on the defensive .
That ’s a bad deal , ” said former Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell , whom Steele beat in his campaign for RNC chairman .
“ The RNC cannot attack Democrats for how the government spends taxpayer money when it is spending Republican donor money recklessly .
Recent RNC spending stories suggest a tone - deafness at best and a misappropriation of funds at worst , ” added Mike DeMoss , a longtime RNC donor who served as a liaison to the evangelical community for Mitt Romney ’s presidential campaign .
“ Given that RNC funds were used to pay or reimburse a bill at a nightclub , it is immaterial whether or not Chairman Steele was actually there himself , ” said DeMoss .
“ Ultimately , the RNC can spend however it wishes — it just may have less to spend the next time around .
Sadly , the RNC could have been setting a new standard of political party fiscal responsibility ; instead , we ’re talking about expense reports with entertainment at a bondage club . ”
RNC Communications Director Doug Heye insisted that Steele has “ never ” been to the club .
“ The chairman was never at the location in question ; he had no knowledge of the expenditure ; nor does he find the use of committee funds at such a location at all acceptable , ” Heye said .
The RNC says it is “ investigating ” what happened , and as it does , many questions remain .
As of Monday night , it was not clear who signed off on the expense or why .
It remains unknown why Brown — who is not affiliated with the RNC — was allowed to spend committee funds .
And assuming Steele was not there , it ’s unclear if any RNC members or donors were there enjoying what The Daily Caller reported to be “ topless women dancers imitating lesbian sex ” on the committee ’s dime .
“ It goes without saying that such an expense is more than unacceptable , ” said Henry Barbour , a committeeman from Mississippi .
“ I have to believe this is some sort of bad mistake and , I hope , bad reporting . ”
Former South Carolina Republican Party Chairman Katon Dawson , who also ran against Steele , said wryly that a bondage - themed club is “ not the best place to spend committee money or start up a voter registration program . ”
“ If what has been reported has any truth to it , then the perceived definition of Grand Old Party has been taken to a new and inappropriate level , ” Dawson said .
The Daily Caller ’s reporting has indeed been called into question by the RNC and other Republicans , who balked at the way the story suggested Steele had been at the club .
POLITICO confirmed the RNC expense by examining the committee ’s February Federal Election Commission filing , but the committee says the outlet incorrectly suggests that Steele was at the nightclub .
Daily Caller founder Tucker Carlson contends the site “ did not claim that Michael Steele personally visited ” the club , but the wording in the story is less clear .
The portion of the story to which Carlson is referring reads : “ Steele travels in style .
A February RNC trip to California , for example , included a $ 9,099 stop at the Beverly Hills Hotel , $ 6,596 dropped at the nearby Four Seasons , and $ 1,620.71 spent [ update : the amount is actually $ 1,946.25 ] at Voyeur West Hollywood , a bondage - themed nightclub featuring topless women dancers imitating lesbian sex . ”
Heye criticized the story as “ factually inaccurate ” in an e-mail to POLITICO and accused the recently launched , conservative - leaning site of playing too loose with the facts .
“ The piece repeated [ly ] talks about ‘ Steele ’s expenses , ’ when quite often they are finance / fundraising expenses and not just for the expenditure in question , ” the spokesman e-mailed .
“ Though I made a clear distinction with [ Daily Caller reporter ] Jonathan [ Strong ] , his story fails to do so . ”
Whether the expenses were incurred in Steele ’s presence or not would have been cleared up by “ good reporting , ” Heye said .
Carlson responded with a post on the site saying the RNC complaints “ lack substance . ”
“ Despite claims to the contrary , no one from the committee has ever explained the specific circumstances of any of the expenses listed in its most recent disclosure filings , ” Carlson wrote .
“ Our questions remain :
Why did the committee spend more than $ 17,000 on private jets in the month of February ?
How and why was RNC business conducted in a bondage - themed nightclub , and how and why were the nearly $ 2,000 in charges that resulted approved by RNC staff ? ”

Week has tried them out too : little symbols that look like barcodes printed onto shirts , which , when viewed through a webcam , come to life .
Benetton is using augmented reality for a campaign that kicked off last month , in which it is trying to find models from among the general population .
Augmented reality – AR , as it has quickly become known – has only recently become a phrase that trips easily off technologists ' lips ; yet we 've been seeing versions of it for quite some time .
The idea is straightforward enough : take a real - life scene , or ( better ) a video of a scene , and add some sort of explanatory data to it so that you can better understand what 's going on , or who the people in the scene are , or how to get to where you want to go .
Sports coverage on TV has been doing it for years : slow - motion could be described as a form of augmented reality , since it gives you the chance to examine what happened in a situation more carefully .
More recently cricket , tennis , rugby , football and golf have all started to overlay analytic information on top of standard - speed replays – would that ball have hit the stumps , the progress of a rally , the movement of the backs or wingers , the relative flights of shots – to tell you more about what 's going on .
Probably the most common use is in American football where the " first down " line – the distance the team has to cover to continue its offence – is superimposed on the picture for viewers .
But those required huge systems .
AR took its first lumbering steps into the public arena eight years ago : all that you needed to do was strap on 10kg of computing power – laptop , camera , vision processor – and you could get an idea of what was feasible .
The American Popular Science magazine wrote about the idea in 2002 – but the idea of being permanently connected to the internet had n't quite jelled at that point .
" AR has been around for ages , " says Andy Cameron , executive director of Fabrica , an interactive design studio which works with Benetton , " maybe going back as far as the 1970s and art installations that overlaid real spaces with something virtual . "
He mentions in particular the work of pioneering computer artist Myron Krueger .
What 's changed in the past year is that AR has come within reach of all sorts of developers – and the technology powerful enough to make use of it is owned by millions of people , often in the palms of their hands .
The arrival of powerful smartphones and computers with built - in video capabilities means that you do n't have to wait for the AR effects as you do with TV .
They can simply be overlaid onto real life .
Step forward Apple 's iPhone , and phones using Google 's Android operating system , both of which are capable of overlaying information on top of a picture or video .
Within the small world of AR , one of the best - known apps is that built by Layar , which – given a location , and using the iPhone 3GS 's inbuilt compass to work out the direction you 're pointing the phone – can give you a " radar map " of details such as Wikipedia information , Flickr photos , Google searches and YouTube videos superimposed onto a picture you 've taken of the scene .
For Americans , it will also pull in details from the government 's economic Recovery
Act – so that if you 're on Wall Street and want to see how many billions went into which building , it will show you .
Or , more usefully , Yelp offers an augmented reality application that will show you ratings and reviews for a restaurant before you walk in – the sort of thing that could make restaurants quiver with delight , or shudder in horror .
Or maybe it would n't need to know where it is ; only who it 's looking at .
A prototype application demonstrated at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in February took things a little further again .
Point the phone at a person and if it can find their details , it will pull them off the web and attach details – their Twitter username , Facebook page and other facts – and stick them , rather weirdly , into the air around their head ( viewed through your phone , of course ) .
" It 's taking social networking to the next level , " says Dan Gärdenfors , head of user experience research at The Astonishing Tribe , a Swedish mobile software company .
And there are fabulously useful applications : at Columbia University , computer science professor Steve Feiner and PhD candidate Steve Henderson have created their Augmented Reality for Maintenance and Repair ( Armar ) project .
It combines sensors , head - up displays , and instructions to tackle the military 's maintenance needs : start working on a piece of kit , and the details about it pop up in front of you .
Imagine if you could put on a pair of special goggles when you needed to investigate your car 's engine , or a computer 's innards , and the detail would pop up .
That 's the sort of idea that Armar is trying to implement , though for the military at first ..
Yet it 's fashion which seems to have leapt quickest into this technology .
The T - shirt with AR in London Fashion Week was developed by Cassette Playa , a label that has been worn by Lily Allen , Rihanna and Kanye West .
Carri Munden , who designed it with the Fashion Digital Studio at the London College of Fashion , described it as " mixing reality and fantasy " .
Adidas , too , has launched trainers with AR symbols in the tongues : hold them to a webcam and you are taken to interactive games on the Adidas site .
The process by which the strange symbols get translated into images is simple enough : the website takes the feed from your webcam ( you have to explicitly allow it to do so , so there are no security worries ) and analyses it for the particular set of symbols that the program is looking for .
( Some easy calculations mean the symbols can be detected whichever way up you hold the item . )
Videos and pictures are then sent back to you .
Andy Cameron says that the arrival of an open - source , hence free , AR tool kit has let companies build their own AR applications , using Flash – the pervasive animation and video technology used for many online ads and YouTube 's videos – " which immediately meant you had huge penetration , because Flash is everywhere " .
( Something like 98 % of all computers are reckoned to have Adobe 's Flash Player installed . )
" If you build your AR application with Flash , then you can get it out to everybody in the world with a computer with a webcam , " says Cameron .
Benetton is using AR in its latest campaign , called " It 's My Time " which aims to get members of the public to put themselves forward as potential models , and uses AR to show more details about existing models .
But its first most visible use of AR was last year in issue 76 of Benetton 's Colors magazine , a quarterly fashion product .
Dozens of pages have AR symbols : hold the page up to a webcam , and you see film and more photos of the person on the page .
" The Colors editor and the creative director of Fabrica got very excited about it , " says Cameron .
Cameron can see huge potential which could even revive the fortunes of print advertising .
" Think of a commercial page , an advert , in a fashion magazine .
It 's pretty expensive .
With this – and this is the way that the more hard - nosed people in Benetton saw the advantage – it means that you can get more products on the page . "
Print an AR code , get people to come to the site , and you can show them so much more , while measuring the return from your effort .
The technical cost is a tiny part of the overall effort .
" The printing and photography cost [ of the advert ] is the same .
And the development cost is pretty small . "
And of course where advertisers go , the publications that house them are sure to go as well .
Esquire magazine in the US and Wallpaper * in Europe have done " augmented reality " editions , with Robert Downey Jr coming to life on the cover of the former , and AR text providing videos and animation in the latter .
But there are more possibilities for journalism using AR : for example if you " geotag " newspaper articles ( so that you say that an item relates to a particular place ) then someone visiting a site could learn about events relevant to the area via their smartphone .
Book publishers too are leaping in : Carlton Publishing will release an AR book in May , featuring dinosaurs that pop out of the pages when viewed , yes , through a webcam .
Future releases include war , sport and arts titles which will also have extra AR elements .
Yet in media it 's the advertisers who are most excited .
The possibilities of geotagged , targeted adverts – which in effect hang in the air until someone comes along to find them with a smartphone – or of AR adverts which open up a whole new world of opportunities ( and perhaps discounts or loyalty bonuses ) when you follow them through – are yet another glimpse of the holy grail ofads that know exactly who and where you are .
Is there a risk that we 'll all become AR'd out – that it will become boring as advert after advert invites us to hold it up to a webcam ?
" What 's hot today is ancient history tomorrow , " says Cameron .
" There have been a lot of bad uses of this technology with a rush to use it .
We have had the chance to reflect on what it means and how to use it .
The key is that it should be an enhancement of the stuff on the printed page . "
Even so we 're still in the early stages , he argues .
" It 's very primitive – having to use a webcam , holding a magazine up to it .
Obviously we 're really interested in the opportunities with handheld devices .
It 's very frustrating that the iPhone does n't allow access to the live video stream . "
( Nor does it run Flash , another problem for would - be AR designers . )
" People in design are very annoyed with Steve Jobs , " he observes .
" We do n't really understand why Apple wo n't allow that . "
Given that access , he says , " you could hold your iPhone up to a billboard and get something amazing right there " .
What about the alternative , such as Google 's Android - based Nexus phone ?
" It looks like you could do it on that , " he says .
But of course the iPhone is a target market .
" Maybe Apple wants to keep that for itself , " Cameron says .
" Maybe they 're lodging patents .
Or maybe the processor on the iPhone is n't fast enough . "
Yet there are some who think that AR has already had its brief time in the sun .
At the Like Minds conference in Exeter at the beginning of March , Joanne Jacobs , a social media consultant , described an AR application that demanded you buy a T - shirt and then go and sit in front of your webcam – so you could play Rock , Paper , Scissors .
By yourself .
" It 's hopeless , " Jacobs said .
Cameron admits to some uncertainty about AR 's measurable impact .
" I do n't know if it sells more things , but it seems clearly a good thing if we can get people who may be customers to participate in the adverts . "
But , he adds : " If people start to play with the adverts in a way that exposes them to more products , that 's got to help bring a commercial return . "

A Helsinki couple has been fined by the District Court for allowing their baby son to be circumcised .
The procedure was undertaken by a British Rabbi at the base of the Helsinki Jewish Congregation in 2008 where the one - week - old child received the traditional bris without any anaesthetic .
Both parents were present at the ceremony , as was the boy ’s grandfather who held him throughout .
The infant was later hospitalised after the bleeding failed to stop .
The Rabbi had performed an examination of the child in the morning following the operation but assured the parents that the child was in no danger .
The complications that arose from the ongoing bleeding could have been averted had the circumcision been performed at a hospital according to expert witness Dr Harry Lindahl .
The parents insist that not only was the rabbi reputable but that Finnish law does not prohibit circumcision as a religious obligation .
The prosecution however , filed charges of aggravated assault or inciting aggravated assault , as the Helsingin Sanomat reports .
The Helsinki District Court declared that the parents were not guilty of inciting assault as they did not participate in the actual operation .
They also deemed that the Penal Code could not define the instrument used in the operation as a weapon .
The parents have been ordered to pay their infant son compensation of EUR 1,500 ( USD 2,000 ) for his pain and suffering , as well as a 40 - day suspended prison sentence .
Microsoft just confirmed to APC Magazine that none of its Windows - based phones will be able to upgrade to its news Windows Phone 7 Series .
What 's that mean , exactly ?
Gizmodo put it best : " Every Windows Mobile phone out there 's officially dead in the water . "
Microsoft wo n't abandon the old system , but it 's not going to put too many resources towards making it a kick - butt phone with killer features .
So , Microsoft basically just told everyone there 's no reason to purchase a new Windows mobile phone this year .
Unless you 're a super - fan of Microsoft , why invest in old technology ?
The new , hot - looking , Windows Phone Series 7 wo n't be ready until the end of the year .

WUHU , China --
Years after activists accused Nike and other Western brands of running Third World sweatshops , the issue has taken a surprising turn .
The path of discovery winds from coastal factory floors far into China 's interior , past women knee - deep in streams pounding laundry .
It continues down a dusty village lane to a startling sight : arrays of gleaming three - story houses with balconies , balustrades and even Greek columns rising from rice paddies .
More from China
As U.S. jobs stagger , China deals with labor shortage .
It turns out that factory workers -- not the activists labeled " preachy " by one expert , and not the Nike executives so wounded by criticism -- get the last laugh .
Villagers who " went out , " as Chinese say , for what critics described as dead - end manufacturing jobs are sending money back and returning with savings , building houses and starting businesses .
Workers who stitched shoes for Nike Inc. and apparel for Columbia Sportswear Co. , both based near Beaverton , are fueling a wave of prosperity in rural China .
The boom has a solid feel , with villagers paying cash for houses .
" No one would take out a mortgage to build a house , " said Wang Jianguo , 37 , who returned after a factory injury in a distant province to the area near Wuhu , west of Shanghai .
" You would n't feel secure living in a house you did n't own . "
In the end , market forces and ambition , not activism or corporate initiatives , pushed up wages and improved working conditions .
The forces originally unleashed by the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping still drive China 's economy , producing a manufacturing labor shortage and giving villagers viable choices beyond factory work .
China 's rural boom
Improved living standards do n't negate criticism by activists who castigated the outsourcing industry , especially Nike , a 1990s lightning rod for allegations of low pay and onerous working conditions .
Abuses continue in some plants , especially those unconnected to international brands .
But longtime activists acknowledge that the sweatshop issue has lost steam , at least concerning China .
Conditions and wages have improved , says Jeffrey Ballinger , a critic who still dismisses corporate - responsibility programs -- in which Nike , Columbia and other companies set standards and inspect factories -- as spin .
" My complaint always was they should have been able to make that kind of wage without working 70 hours a week , " said Ballinger , a McMaster University doctoral candidate in political science .
He wants the Obama administration to push countries to require higher " living wage " levels .
Medea Benjamin used to accuse Nike of exploiting factory employees .
She says pay and conditions have improved because of worker demands , international pressure and compliance programs introduced by the shoe giant , Columbia and other brands .
The days of indentured servitude are gone , says Benjamin , founding director of Global Exchange , a San Francisco human rights organization .
" Workers have options , " Benjamin said .
But she would prefer to see U.S. workers making Nikes for the American market .
$ 220 a month
Nike drew flak as it moved contract manufacturing from South Korea and Taiwan in the 1980s to China , Indonesia and ever cheaper labor markets .
Its expansion in China came during the 1990s as Deng , the legendary reformer , opened the communist nation 's economy .
That opening led to the largest migration in human history .
Tens of millions of villagers left home for coastal areas to earn a pittance by Western standards .
Today China has about 130 million migrant workers .
Migrants can expect grueling work at minimum wage .
They become anything from garbage collectors to waiters to prostitutes to nannies to the assembly - line workers who power China 's export machine .
The average employee at Ever Rich Knitting Garment Co.'s plant near Guangzhou , China , makes $ 220 a month , which can double during busy seasons .
The pay is minuscule by Western measures .
But Mon Xijian , a 31 - year - old who has worked at Ever Rich since 1996 , has saved enough with his wife , who also works there , to buy a six - unit apartment building back home .
The couple do n't recommend the lifestyle .
They see their two children -- who live at home with Mon 's in - laws 1,200 miles away -- every year or two .
Yet Mon far prefers factory work to farming .
He 's saving to send his son and daughter to college so they can escape both .
" I want them to get as much higher education as possible , " said Mon , who irons Columbia garments .
Chu Zhiling , a young woman at Beijing Topnew garment factory , sends 80 percent of her income home to Inner Mongolia -- a region with 19 percent economic growth last year , the highest in China .
" I 'd like to open a shop , like my friend who has a boutique selling coats , " Chu said .
" Now that I 've seen the world , I have so many more choices than my parents had . "
U.S. journalist Leslie Chang followed young Chinese assembly - line workers for her recently published book , " Factory Girls . "
Chang says money sent home , and migrants moving back , are changing rural China .
Line workers , she says , can earn several times the average $ 200 annual income of a farm family .
" They 're sleeping 12 in a dorm , and it looks like a pretty crappy life , " Chang said .
" But you do n't hear workers say , ' Oh , I have no hope , I 'm a slave . '
They say , ' I want to save some money .
My dream is to be Bill Gates or to own a restaurant . ' "
Chang views sweatshop critics as condescending .
She notes that the 19th - century U.S. industrial economy developed in a similar way , as Vermont and New Hampshire farm girls migrated to work in Massachusetts textile plants , sending savings home .
She says savvy Chinese workers , not preachy activists , are securing better conditions and wages in China 's fast - developing economy .
Yet critics did push Nike and other companies to develop factory standards and inspections .
Nike executives declined to comment on the sweatshop issue 's new turn .
Hannah Jones ,
Nike vice president of sustainable business and innovation , said through a spokeswoman that factory jobs are steppingstones for many young women in emerging economies .
" They learn financial and job skills that can take them on to other jobs or back to their home communities , " spokeswoman Kate Meyers said .
Laborers start fish resort
That formula is working -- after two decades -- for Chen Laixiang , a 40 - year - old villager from Anhui province , long one of China 's poorest inland areas .
Chen 's face is weathered and his hands callused from working outside for 20 years , pouring concrete in cities ranging from Nanjing to Beijing .
Now Chen and his brother , a woodworker , are back -- starting a business in Zhi Chang , their native village .
They won permission to lease land and enlarge a pond .
The brothers are stocking the pond with fish .
As 50 - 50 partners , they took a small - business class and invested $ 22,000 to build a fishing resort .
" I do n't want to live in other cities anymore , " Chen said .
" I want to promote the local economy . "
Nearby in the town of Nan Hu , returnee Zhang Litian operates a one - van taxi service .
He used to drive a forklift at a chemical factory in Anhui 's capital city , saving almost $ 1,500 a year .
" Staying home is better , " said Zhang , 42 , a father of two .
" Now I can earn much more money than working outside . "
The global economic crisis forced many migrants -- perhaps 10 million to 20 million -- home to the countryside .
Factories that exported to the United States and other consumer nations laid off workers in droves .
Chinese leaders fretted about the potential for protests by unemployed migrants .
But many of the jobless found or created opportunities back in their villages or in nearby towns .
Beijing mounted a stimulus program that included economic development in the hinterland .
The rural surge boosts the economy just as other nations look to China to lead the world out of recession .
China 's economy barrels ahead , with 8.7 percent growth last year and double - digit expansion expected this year .
In a surprising reversal , economic growth of several inland provinces such as Anhui surpasses growth in recession - battered coastal regions , which long led China 's development .
Anhui has attracted factories .
Workers in the plants have dreams .
Like almost all the young women in her village , Zhang Yuan went out to work in a garment factory .
" Living in the countryside , you feel like a bird in a cage , not knowing the world outside , " said Zhang , a petite 19 - year - old who sews garments in Shanghai Silk Group 's plant in Xuan Cheng , Anhui .
Zhang lives in a factory dorm during the week .
She spends weekends at home , 40 minutes away by bus .
Her parents , a driver and a housewife , have used money she earned during the last year to buy a fridge , a color television and a motorbike .
" If we go outside , we may encounter a lot of difficulties , " said Zhang , who aims to open a clothing shop someday .
" But even if we try and fail , we will never feel regret . "

Apple has started banning many applications for its iPhone that feature sexually suggestive material , including photos of women in bikinis and lingerie , a move that came as an abrupt surprise to developers who had been profiting from such programs .
The company ’s decision to remove the applications from its App Store over the last few days indicates that it is not interested in giving up its tight control over the software available there , even as competitors like Google take a more hands - off approach .
When asked about the change , Apple said it was responding to complaints from App Store users .
Philip W. Schiller , head of worldwide product marketing at Apple , said in an interview that over the last few weeks a small number of developers had been submitting “ an increasing number of apps containing very objectionable content . ”
“ It came to the point where we were getting customer complaints from women who found the content getting too degrading and objectionable , as well as parents who were upset with what their kids were able to see , ” Mr. Schiller said .

Ironic , really , is n't it ?
BINGHAMTON , N.Y. , March 13 , 2010  --
No matter how bad the news , no matter how grim the headlines , you could always count on a smile from at least one corner of the daily newspaper : the comics .
But in this day when we could use a laugh more than ever , the reality facing the comics section is anything but funny .
With the newspaper business hemorrhaging readers and money , newspapers are slicing the number of strips they carry .
Artist and filmmaker Mark Tatulli said he has seen 30 newspapers drop his strip " Lio " in the last 18 months .
" Newspapers are saving money wherever they can , and they are doing it by cutting the comics .
It 's affecting cartoonists across the board , " Tatulli said .
" ' Lio ' was growing , closing in on 300 newspapers -- and then the market just went crazy , " Tatulli said , adding that " Lio " is now in 270 papers .
The roll call of newspapers shedding comic strips is growing , from the Portland Oregonian , which shed 10 strips last year , to the Washington Post .
The cash - strapped Washington Times recently went a step further , eliminating its Sunday comics section entirely .
The savings can be enormous .
The Star - Ledger of Newark , N.J. , told readers that reducing the comics section by one page would save $ 300,000 a year .
" Sometimes change is n't funny , but it is necessary , " the paper told readers .
However , after an enormous outcry -- more than 1,200 reader complaints -- the Star - Ledger backed away from the reductions .
Some newspapers are trying to mask the cutbacks by holding " Survivor " - style contests asking readers which strips to jettison , and which to pick up .
The number of strips dropped usually outnumbers the strips added , although sometimes papers will continue providing the eliminated cartoons online .
Newer strips are often the ones cut first , but even so - called legacy comics are feeling the pinch .
Mason and Mick Mastroianni draw and write " B.C. " from a studio on the outskirts of this upstate New York city .
The strip , filled with cavemen and slapstick humor , was handed down from their late grandfather , John Hart , who created it in the late 1950s .
The number of newspapers carrying " B.C. " has fallen by about 5 percent a year over the last few years , they said .
" A lot of times , if we get canceled by a big paper , we 'll ... talk to our syndicate , see what happened .
And nine times out of 10 , it 's because either the paper went out of business , or just dropped an entire page of comics , to save space and save costs , " Mason said .
The strips that survive this comics crisis are finding it more crowded .
To save costs , newspapers are squeezing more strips onto ever - shrinking pages .
In 1950 , " Little Orphan Annie " ran as a full - page strip in most Sunday papers ; today , it often runs at one - third of a page .
The financial struggles of newspapers are not the only problem .
In an age of Nintendo and Facebook , it 's hard for the comics to compete for the attention of children .
In 1945 , the demand for comics was so strong , New York City Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia famously read the funnies over the radio during a newspaper strike .
It is hard to imagine such a scenario today .
" They are not part of the national conversation anymore , " Tatulli said .
" It used to be that you could turn on Johnny Carson , and hear him say , ' Hey , did you see that strip today ? '
I remember that show ' Newsradio , ' when they had a whole episode about ' Dilbert , ' and of course everybody knew what they were talking about .
" Today , new comics , nobody has a clue , " he said .
" We have a very solid following .
But it is more niche than it has ever been . "
In search of new audiences , the newspaper comics are now posted online .
But the cartoonists do not make nearly as much money from the Internet as they do from newspapers .
" Cartoonists , in general , are looking to other avenues , other ways to get their products out there -- licensing , movies , television , things like that , " Mason Mastroianni said .
" Putting them online is great for exposure , it 's great for readership .
It may help with licensing or merchandising at some point .
But as far as making money directly from online , I am not sure if it can be done or it will ever be done , " he added said .
The Mastroiannis have been trying to get a new comic off the ground , the " Dogs of C Kennel . "
They have drawn a new " C Kennel " strip every day for two years .
So far , the strip can only be viewed online .
Newspapers , they said , have been unwilling to embrace new strips at a time when they are cutting back .
" We 're waiting for the climate to get a little better , Mason says .
Asked if he thinks " B.C. " will be around for his grandchildren , Mastroianni said , " That is a very difficult question to answer .
" I wish I had a crystal ball , " he said .
" I do n't think that comics will ever disappear .
But comics in the form they are now , syndicated in the newspaper , might disappear at some point . "
On March 13 , 2008 , the International Space Station ( ISS ) passed across the field - of - view of Germany 's remote sensing satellite , TerraSAR - X , at a distance of 122 miles ( 195 kilometers ) .
This radar image of the ISS shows a dense collection of bright spots clearly identifying the outlines of the space station .
A newly released photo from a German radar satellite has revealed the International Space Station ( ISS ) like never before , depicting the massive orbiting laboratory as an eerie apparition glowing in blue .
The photo , taken by Germany 's TerraSAR - X satellite , shows the space station from above as an incomplete space outpost .
It was taken on March 13 , 2008 , but Germany 's space agency released the unique view this month .
" The orbital configuration that provides the opportunity for a picture like this occurs between 10 and 11 times each month , but there is absolutely no risk of a collision because TerraSAR -X and the ISS are on very different orbits , " officials with the German Aerospace Center ( DLR ) said in an update .
The TerraSAR - X view reveals the $ 100 billion space station as it appeared two years ago , when the outpost did not yet have its final set of huge , wing - like solar arrays .
As a result , the station looks off - kilter , with one set of solar arrays on the left side and two on the right .
Since 2008 , astronauts have delivered the final set of solar wings , as well as new modules and laboratories .
The station is currently home to five astronauts — two Americans , two Russians and one Japanese astronaut .
TerraSAR -X is an Earth - observation satellite that travels around the planet in a polar orbit , and records X - band radar data about the planet using its active antenna .
TerraSAR - X is not affected by weather conditions , cloud cover or the absence of daylight .
The station image taken by TerraSAR - X was recorded on March 13 , 2008 during a brief , three - second flyby using the satellite 's synthetic aperture radar .
A few hours before this image was taken , NASA 's space shuttle Endeavour arrived at the space station carrying a storage room for the station 's Japanese Kibo laboratory during the STS - 123 mission .
At the time , the Russian and American modules , as well as the European " Columbus " laboratory , all had been installed .
Six of the station 's eight solar panels had already been placed .
The satellite whizzed past the space station as it flew 122 miles ( 195 km ) over the orbiting laboratory .
The station typically flies about 220 miles ( 354 km ) above Earth .
TerraSAR -X and the station passed each other at a relative speed of about 22,000 mph ( 34,540 kph ) .
This ghostly image does not show light reflecting from the surfaces of the space station like an optical photograph .
In fact , radar does not detect surfaces , which deflect the radar beam , at all .
Rather , edges and corners reflect the microwave signals transmitted by the radar more strongly .
Thus , the solar power generators of the ISS and the radiator panels used to dissipate excess heat appear as dark areas .
The ISS , then , is drawn from bright spots which clearly outline the space station .
The central element of the ISS , on which modules are docked , possesses a lattice grid structure featuring multiple surfaces to reflect the radar beam , so it stands out clearly .
This image resolves objects of about one meter , with separation of at least 3 feet ( 1 meter ) .
Structures more closely spaced are merged into a single block .
Items smaller than one meter can be identified , if they are very reflective .
However , they will be enlarged to at least 1 meter in the image .
Today , the space station 's exterior structure is as long as an American football field and it has about the same internal living space as a Boeing 747 jumbo jet .
In February , NASA 's shuttle Endeavour visited the space station to deliver a new room called Tranquility and an observation deck that provides stunning views of Earth from space .
They left the orbiting laboratory about 98 percent complete after 11 years of construction .
NASA 's next mission to the space station is slated to launch April 5 aboard the shuttle Discovery , which will haul a cargo pod filled with new science gear and other equipment to stock up the space station .
A new Russian room is due to launch in May on the shuttle Atlantis , with a $ 1 billion space experiment to follow in July on Endeavour .
The final flight in September will deliver more supplies and leave a storage room permanently attached to the space station .
NASA currently plans to retire the shuttle fleet after just four more missions to complete the space station .
ABOUT HALLIBURTON
Iran
" If these companies are going through the back door to invest in terrorist nations , Congress must take action to immediately close , lock and seal those doors , " Senator Max Baucus ( D - MT ) the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee said in February 2004.1
As investigators from 60 Minutes discovered , Halliburton has used an offshore subsidiary incorporated in the Cayman Islands ( where the company has no oil and gas construction or engineering operations ) to trade with Iran , a country that the Bush administration has described as part of an " axis of evil , arming to threaten the peace of the world . "
2
Federal law disallows American companies from transacting business with nations that sponsor terrorism , but foreign subsidiaries of such companies are not banned from such transactions .
In May 2004 , the U.S. Senate voted against legislation that would have stopped companies like Halliburton from using offshore subsidiaries to invest in Iran .
The legislation was defeated in a 50 - 49 vote , mostly along party lines .
As CEO of Halliburton , Mr. Cheney lobbied the Clinton administration to ease sanctions on Libya and Iran , according to various news reports .
" I think we'd be better off if we , in fact , backed off those sanctions [ on Iran ] , did n't try to impose secondary boycotts on companies .. trying to do business there , " Cheney told an Australian television interviewer in April 1998.3
According to the Financial Times , before he was elected ( but after he resigned from Halliburton ) Cheney " has said the company is allowed to operate legally in Iran through its foreign subsidiaries . " 4
" What we do with respect to Iran and Libya is done through foreign subsidiaries , totally in compliance with US law , " Cheney told ABC Television 's Sam Donaldson .
When Donaldson suggested , " it 's a way around US law , " Cheney replied : " No , no , it 's provided for us specifically with respect to Iran and Libya . "
5
If you 're a big multinational that 's able to incorporate around the world , you do n't have to worry .
As Vice President , Cheney led the National Energy Review which concluded in 2001 that the US should " level the playing field for US companies overseas " and recommended a comprehensive review of sanctions with consideration given to US " energy security . "
6
The Financial Times reported just before the Iraq War in March 2003 that " the Pentagon is drawing up a blacklist of non-US companies investing in Iran 's energy sector , with a possible view to barring them from US - awarded contracts in the reconstruction of neighboring Iraq . " 7
In 1995 , President Clinton passed an executive order barring U.S. investment in Iran 's energy sector . 8
In 1996 , Congress passed the Iran - Libya Sanctions Act , which seeks to punish non-US oil companies that invest $ 20 million or more in either country , and which has been a source of friction with key US allies , including France , Germany , Russia and the UK.9
Halliburton says their firm is in compliance with U.S. laws .
But in a letter to Treasury Secretary John Snow , Baucus and Finance Committee Chairman Charles Grassley ( R- IA ) , pointed to Halliburton subsidiary Halliburton Products and Services Ltd .
" This subsidiary is nominally located in the Cayman Islands , but according to media reports does not conduct any actual business in the Cayman Islands or even maintain a functioning office .
...
We are concerned about this specific example , and about the possibility that this may be indicative of a more widespread problem .
"
10
In a letter to New York City 's fire and policy pension fund managers , who have also been raising the issue on behalf of Halliburton 's shareholders , the company said that Halliburton Products and Services , a Cayman islands firm headquartered in Dubai , the United Arab Emirates , made over $ 39 million in 2003 ( a $ 10 million increase from 2002 ) by selling oil - field services to customers in Iran.11
When CBS Television 's 60 Minutes program visited the address where Halliburton Products and Services is incorporated in the Cayman Islands , they discovered a " brass plate " operation with no employees whose agent - the Calidonian Bank -- forwards all of the company 's mail to Halliburton 's offices in Houston ( instead of the company 's operations in Dubai ) , " indicating that decision - making authority may be in Houston , not the Cayman Islands or Dubai , " according to the Senators .
In addition , it was reported that Halliburton 's operations in Dubai share the same address , telephone and fax numbers as Halliburton Products and Services - an indication that the companies do not function separately .
12
" It is extremely disturbing to hear media reports of possible violations of our anti-terrorism laws by prominent American companies through straw corporations established to evade U.S. law .
What makes these charges extraordinary is the involvement of the Vice President , since Halliburton Products and Services began operations in Iran during the time that Vice President Cheney was CEO of Halliburton , " Rep. Tammy Baldwin ( D - WI ) wrote in a letter to her colleagues .
The U.S. Treasury Department 's Office of Foreign Assets Control recently asked the company for new information about the subsidiary , according to a filing with the SEC .
In early March 2003 , the SEC's new Office of Global Security Risk announced that it would be hiring five full - time staff to look at companies with ties to rogue nations .
13
ConocoPhillips agreed to cut its business connections with Iran and Syria in February 2002.14 But Halliburton uses its ability to incorporate subsidiaries all over the world to evade any U.S. restrictions on foreign regimes that are considered too odious for the legislators in Washington .
During the 1990s , under Cheney 's leadership Halliburton did business with the former Nigerian regime of dictator Sani Abacha , a brutal military dictator .
The Abacha regime threw thousands of political opponents into prison , and executed nine environmental activists , including the playwright Ken Saro - Wiwa .

seven sharpies later , ceiling cat 's disguise as a common tabby was complete .
LOS ANGELES -- Jimmy Howard arguably has been the Detroit Red Wings ’ most valuable player , giving them a chance to win almost every game he plays by stepping up big during his rookie season .
But the 25 - year - old goaltender was particularly hard on his himself after the Red Wings squandered a three - goal first period lead and suffered a crushing 4 - 3 defeat to the Los Angeles Kings Saturday afternoon at the Staples Center .
“ It ’s tough .
I take a lot of the blame for it , ’’ Howard said .
“ I did n’t think I had my best outing .
I was very disappointed in how I played .
You learn from your mistakes and now I have to rebound from it . ’’
While Howard threw himself under the bus , this latest collapse had more to do with the defense ’s inability to control the Kings around the net .
“ It hurts even more when you ’re up 3 - 0 , ’’ captain Nicklas Lidstrom said .
“ We came out with a good push , but then in the second ( period ) we did n’t play well enough in front of our net .
They got a lot of pucks in there , they were crashing the net and we did n’t do a good enough job to clear the rebounds or take the players out of there . ’’
It was a particularly rough day for Brad Stuart ( minus - 4 ) and Jonathan Ericsson ( minus - 3 ) .
The Red Wings also played a good chunk of the game with a short bench , losing three forwards to injuries .
Tomas Holmstrom left late in the first period due to a bruised left knee .
Patrick Eaves ( sprained ankle ) and Drew Miller ( bruised ankle ) left late in the second period .
The team ’s initial prognosis indicates that none of the injuries are long - term .
The Red Wings squandered third - period leads in five out of six games from Jan. 16 - 26 .
This time , they got a head start , unraveling in the second period , when the Kings outshot them 13 - 4 and scored three unanswered goals .
Detroit ’s collapse was compete when Michal Handzus scored his second goal of the game with 2:21 to play in the third period , as the Kings won their franchise - record ninth consecutive game .
Coach Mike Babcock was surprisingly composed following the meltdown .
“ We made some mistakes , gave them two freebies , but other than that I did n’t mind our game , ’’ Babcock said .
“ We had two power plays in the third period .
The game ’s on the line , we ’d like to get one and win the game . ’’
Henrik Zetterberg scored twice for the Red Wings , who also got a goal from Valtteri Filppula .
The Kings , who are 11 points ahead of the Red Wings , came to life midway through the game , when Alexander Frolov scored at 9:16 of the second period by squeezing the puck between Howard ’s right pad and the goal post .
Handzus scored at 14:47 on a backhand shot from in front of the net , after Howard could n’t control the puck .
“ I tried to play it before I even stopped it .
Just a dumb mistake on my part , ’’ Howard said .
“ I should have stopped it and got control of it .
As I went to play it , it just went off my stick . ’’
Ryan Smyth tied it at 3 - 3 at 16:21 , knocking in a loose puck in the crease during a scramble .
“ We had the game going our way , we made two critical mistakes , a turnover from behind on a simple set breakout and , obviously , mishandling the puck , ’’ Babcock said .
“ That kind of got them back in the game .
And then they got going in the second .
I thought we had a really good third , we tilted the rink .
In the end they got a good break , Frolov had the puck , spun and shot it , it bounced around and came right to Handzus on his stick . ’’
The Red Wings were focused on coming out strong after recent slow starts .
They did that by scoring three goals on eight shots in the first period .
Zetterberg opened the scoring at 8:44 , scoring on a bang - bang play after taking a pass across the front of the net from Pavel Datsyuk .
Filppula scored just 16 seconds later on a backhand shot with his back towards the net , after the Kings appeared to have broken up a rush started by Dan Cleary .
Zetterberg capped the rally with 4.7 seconds to play in the period , scoring his 16th goal of the season to make it 3 - 0 .
He batted in the puck from the crease after goalie Jonathan Quick failed to glove a shot by Brian Rafalski .
It was all downhill after that for Detroit .
“ We ’re still right there , we ca n’t sit and pout and feel sorry for ourselves , ’’ Red Wings forward Todd Bertuzzi said .
“ We got to get back on the horse . ’’
The rise and fall of the czars
If U.S. health care reform passes the Congress and is signed into law anytime soon , the bickering and hullabaloo over the process by which the bill was hammered out will be as relevant as Einstein ’s mother ’s morning sickness in light of her son ’s reimagining of the universe .
Ok , perhaps that overstates it .
But the inside - the - beltway food fight of the past few months will likely fade quickly from memory as Americans start to " own " the provisions of the bill .
( If not , all of Washington is going to soon have to see what provisions the new law will make for people with cable news - induced post - traumatic stress disorder . )
And if it passes — which , flawed as it is would be a landmark and long overdue revision to America ’s social contract —
White House health care czar Nancy DeParle ‘s reputation would be made because she would be seen as a key player in advancing a long - elusive goal of progressives from coast to coast .
Whatever missteps the White House may have made along the way , she will be among those redeemed by finally snatching victory from the jaws of defeat .
( Of course , if the bill fritters out at the last minute , her career prospects will follow a different trajectory . )
This fact raises in turn another question .
Just how are the rest of President Obama ’s Romanov dynasty full of 30 - odd czars doing ?
The answer is hard to tell judging from the newspapers .
This is true in part because newspapers have devoted most of their coverage recently to Eric Massa ‘s permanent tainting of the once wholesome sport of snorkeling .
It ’s also true because there were so many darned czars created that it ’s hard to keep track of them all .
But mostly it ’s true because the president ’s decision to appoint so many " czars " was a classic rookie mistake that has not really worked out very well for anyone .
Certainly , it did not work out well for the czars who came and went like " Green Jobs Czar " Van Jones who was Glenn - Becked into oblivion or " Car Czar " Steve Rattner who is now trying to work a deal to avoid further legal headaches associated with his allegedly unsavory practices in winning business from the New York State pension fund back in his hedge fund days .
But most of the czars who were originally appointed are still in place .
It ’s just that in most cases the only people who know it are their families or the bureaucrats they scuffle with every day .
You see one of the big problems with the whole idea of " czars " is that on the day after their investiture each of them discovered that the government is full of other people who thought they had the same responsibilities .
Just ask AfPak Czar Richard Holbrooke who has been largely overshadowed by the military ’s big man in the region , General Stanley McChrystal , and the State Department ’s other man in Kabul , Ambassador Karl Eikenberry .
Some of this may be , according to reports , Holbrooke ’s own doing , due to rough patches in his relationships with the Afghans , the Pakistanis and some of his colleagues in Washington .
( It was probably a miscalculation to try to apply strong - arm tactics with Hamid Karzai that were reminiscent of his very successful tough - guy confrontations with Slobodan Milosevic years ago .
The problem being that whereas Milosevic was a bad guy who was going down , an enemy being defeated , Karzai was a bad guy who was our alleged ally , one who strongly believed we needed him more than he needed us . )
Holbrooke has also , according to White House sources , not been a great favorite of Obama’s .
This is particularly bad in an administration in which seeking the favor of the president has taken on an importance that is in fact , much more reminiscent of the historical czars than is the role being played by anyone with this now devalued moniker .
This is a key point .
Not only have the czars seen their role diluted by bureaucratic competition but they were never really given the authority their informal titles implied .
This is a classic failure of government and business managers everywhere — giving people responsibility for an issue without truly giving them the authority to manage or lead it .
Does anyone for a moment think George Mitchell is really in charge of America ’s role in the Mideast Peace Process ?
Does anyone even really know what Mitchell is doing ?
In the State Department there is constant buzz that Mitchell is an inscrutable " black box " … and that people like Under Secretary Bill Burns , people in the regional bureau and , of course , Secretary Clinton can and should be playing a more central role in shaping strategy than Mitchell .
Mitchell ’s team has n’t helped his standing with the White House much by going around taking shots at White House Middle East expert Dennis Ross in private meetings with Middle Eastern governments .
Which has led the White House … both within the NSC and the Vice President ’s office to get more involved , etc .
The point is … there are lots of players and Mitchell is no more a czar than was Ingrid Berman playing Anastasia .
Paul Volcker was a " czar " with responsibility for advising the president on financial reform .
But for most of his term he has been ignored , being rolled out periodically for photo ops to show him as a validating grey head .
His Volcker Rule gained traction when it was clear many other reforms were faltering .
But the reality is Volcker , like the others is more a prop than a czar .
It ’s not that he or they are unwilling to work or even that they do n’t have a huge amount to contribute .
( I suspect we ’d all be better off if AfPak were really quarterbacked by Holbrooke or financial reform were led by Volcker .
These guys are among the very best the Dems have and the way they are being treated is like turning Albert Pujols or Kobe Bryant into reserves , playing them off the bench . )
I suspect Holbrooke at the moment has to be wondering whether he actually had more influence … or a higher profile … as a private citizen who deservedly was seen as a Democratic Secretary of State in waiting .
Volcker , I am told , knew what to expect and took on the job because he knew it would periodically afford him influence , that sooner or later he would be needed or heeded .
" Green Czar " Carol Browner must feel the same way .
Not only have her priorities faltered but she has been overtaken in traction by other members of the " Green Cabinet " and compromised by the fumbling on the Hill .
On international matters , the State Department ’s climate negotiator had the clear lead although his efforts have encountered stiff headwinds , on other issues Science Czar John Holdren has won more traction , on others Steven Chu ’s team at Energy have .
And while all this would be denied by the players in question if asked about it in public , you have to ask yourself why the experienced and respected Browner , in the middle of an issue the president has set as one of his priorities , would be on everyone ’s short list to be among those making an early departure from the administration ?
Other czars have simply faced the bandwidth problem … their issues have not risen to prominence in the midst of an agenda set largely by an economic crisis and a desire to move on a couple key issues such as health care and managing the revolving door that is our Middle East troop deployment strategy .
Or alternatively , they just have n’t been able to make much progress or have faced unforeseen setbacks .
Our Auto Industry Recovery czar , Ed Montgomery , and our manufacturing czar Ron Bloom , have seen their efforts remain hostage to the sluggish economy … and it does n’t look like our bailout of Chrysler is , in the end , going to do much good .
Our Guantanamo czar has found getting out of Guantanamo is tougher than expected .
Our Wall Street Pay Czar has had influence over only a few companies and while he has tried to manage that the rest of the financial community has been thumbing their noses at any idea of bonus restraint .
Dennis Ross who was designated as the " Central Region " ( Iran ) Czar has worked hard — and he like Holbrooke is one of the very , very best out there — but ultimately U.S. policy will cede nuclear weapons status to Iran and our earnest but likely - to - be ineffective sanctions efforts will be seen as futile .
And so on .
Admittedly our " Great Lakes Czar " can report that Huron , Ontario , Michigan , Erie and Superior are all roughly where we were when Obama came into office and Joshua DuBois our Faith - based Czar certainly has not seen a major fall in America ’s collective need or hope for some higher power to make sense of things .
Because , as is almost always , the higher powers we create — even when they are given grandiose titles like czars — almost always disappoint for one reason or another .
Hopefully , soon Obama will recognize this and make a long over - due return to the kind of simpler org chart that is almost always more effective .
From The Hill :
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif. ) said Sunday that Republicans have left their mark on the healthcare bill and should accept that the bill will go forward .
" They 've had plenty of opportunity to make their voices heard , " she said on CNN's " State of the Union " Sunday morning .
" Bipartisanship is a two - way street .
A bill can be bipartisan without bipartisan votes .
Republicans have left their imprint . " [ emphasis added ]
Also , up is down , cats are dogs , Republicans are Democrats , and Lost is satisfying and coherent .
In fairness , I get what she 's saying here : Republican opposition has helped shape the health care bill ; the bill is the way it is in some part because of Republican behavior .
But if that 's the standard , then every single piece of legislation that passes through Congress ( or fails to ) is bipartisan .
After all , both parties , whether through action / inaction or support / opposition , influence every bill in some way .
Either they change it directly or they choose not to ; either they vote for it or they do n't .
No matter what , the choices both parties make affect every bill and its outcome .
But of course this is not what anyone is actually talking about when they talk about bipartisanship ; what 's meant is cross-party support , and with the exception of lone votes by Joseph Cao in the House and Olympia Snowe in Senate committee , this bill has n't ever had any .
The three are seeking to reassure people about their economic plans Chancellor Alistair Darling has clashed with his Conservative and Lib Dem counterparts over tax rises and spending cuts in a live TV debate .
Mr Darling said
Tory plans to end part of his planned National Insurance rise were irresponsible and did not add up .
Shadow Chancellor George Osborne said the tax rise was the " wrong priority " and voters faced " five more years of waste , debt and taxes " under Labour .
Vince Cable said the Lib Dems were " different " from the other two parties .
The three men went head - to - head in a " chancellors debate " , answering questions on their parties ' central economic proposals ahead of the expected start of the election campaign next week .
The debate , on Channel 4 , was a forerunner to the three prime ministerial debates - the first of their kind in UK election history .
STEPHANOMICS
The men who would be Chancellor had a spirited debate this evening - with each playing to their strengths
Stephanie Flanders , BBC economics editor
Read Stephanie 's blog in full
The chancellor and his opposite numbers faced scrutiny over how they planned to reduce the UK 's record budget deficit while also securing a sustained economic recovery after the recession .
Each party has accused the other of confusion over their tax plans and not being straight with the public about the scale of spending cuts that will be needed to rebalance the public finances .
During the hour - long debate , Mr Darling also appeared to rule out a compulsory levy on estates to pay for long - term social care for the elderly , which the Conservatives have criticised as a " death tax " .
On the eve of the publication of the government 's white paper on social care , Mr Osborne asked the chancellor whether a compulsory charge on people 's estates at the time of their death to pay for care remained an " option " , to which Mr Darling said : " No , it is not . " ' Judgement calls '
The BBC's Nick Robinson said the debate had been largely restrained and polite .
All three men said there would be difficult choices over spending cuts after the election , with Mr Darling saying the next departmental spending review could be " the toughest in 20 years " .
You are spending nearly £ 30 bn over a Parliament and you can't identify the credible way with which you can pay for that

Chancellors ' debate : as it happened
How the three men shaped up Tories make NI pledge Read dot .

However , he said the government had made the " right calls " during the financial crisis and recession urged voters to back his " judgement " in handling future difficult decisions .
Mr Osborne came under pressure to justify his decision to reverse Labour 's planned 1 % increase in National Insurance contributions for those earning up to £ 45,400 , a tax cut which the Tories said on Monday would save people £ 150 a year .
The Conservatives have said they would pay for this by finding £ 6bn in government savings .
" For the last year you have been saying that you needed to cut debt further and faster , and yet today , the first opportunity you had when you thought you had identified some savings , instead of cutting debt you have promised to change the National Insurance contributions , " Mr Darling told him .
" You are spending nearly £ 30 bn over a Parliament and you can't identify the credible way with which you can pay for that .... That really is to take an irresponsible risk .
It is poor , poor judgement . "
But Mr Osborne said the tax increase would penalise hard - pressed families and businesses at a time when the economy was " not working " and the focus should be on boosting growth .
" Instead of tackling that waste now and stopping wasting people 's money , you want to increase the taxes on pretty much every single person here in this room and people watching at home , " he said .
" That is the wrong priority when this country needs to recover , when we need jobs , when people 's incomes are being squeezed . "
' Common sense '
It was " common sense " the next government " had to get out of the starting blocks " and deal with the deficit from day one , he said , claiming a Labour victory would result in " five more years of waste , taxes and debt " .
HAVE YOUR SAY I thought Vince wiped the floor with the other two BJ Labour is committed to halving the deficit - expected to total £ 167bn this year - over the next four years but has put spending decisions on hold until later this year , saying premature cuts would endanger the recovery .
The Conservatives and the Lib Dems accuse Mr Darling of postponing hard decisions until after the election .
Unlike the other two parties - which have promised to ring fence priority areas from spending cuts - the Lib Dems have said all areas must be looked at and have proposed £ 15 bn of cuts , including scrapping tax credits for better - off families and not renewing the Trident nuclear deterrent .
Mr Cable said Labour had done " real damage " to the economy but said that once in government the Conservatives would " get their noses in the trough and reward their rich backers " .
" The Lib Dems are different , " he added .
" We got the crisis basically right and we are not beholden to the super - rich or militant unions . "
He also called for a clampdown on tax evasion and speculation , referring to the trade union strikes in the 1980s , he lambasted what he described as " pinstripe Scargills " holding the country to ransom .
The SNP and Plaid Cymru both criticised the performance of the three men , saying there was " little difference " between them on the issue of spending cuts .

They never actually met this particular neighbor , but they did find this note on their door one night .
This note appears to be the work of the a non-native English speaker , so it ’s not the grammar here that I ’d like to draw attention to .
Actually , what impressed me is what a perfectly clear picture this note paints of the writer ’s mental state .
” I CAN HEAR YOU IN MY MIND !!!!!! ” — complete with the six trailing exclamation points — does that not just say it all ?

Martin Heidegger was born in Messkirch , Baden , Germany on September 22 , 1889 .
He studied Roman Catholic theology and philosophy at the University of Frieburg before joining the faculty at Frieburg as a teacher in 1915 .
Eight years later Heidegger took a teaching position at Marburg .
He taught there until 1928 and then went back to Frieburg as a professor of philosophy .
As a philosopher , Heidegger developed existential phenomenology .
He is still widely regarded as one of the most original philosophers of the 20th century .
Influenced by other philosophers of his time , Heidegger wrote the book , Being in Time , in 1927 .
In this work , which is considered one of the most important philosophical works of our time , Heidegger asks and answers the question " What is it , to be ? "
Other books written by Heidegger include Basic Writings , a collection of Heidegger 's most popular writings ; Nietzsche , an inquiry into the central issues of Friedrich Nietzsche 's philosophy ;
On the Way to Language , Heidegger 's central ideas on the origin , nature and significance of language ; and What is Called Thinking , a systematic presentation of Heidegger 's later philosophy .
Since the 1960s , Heidegger 's influence has spread beyond continental Europe and into a number of English - speaking countries .
Heidegger died in Messkirch on May 26 , 1976 .

Today , the U.S. Supreme Court hears oral arguments concerning the challenge to Chicago ‘s handgun ban ordinance .
Legal scholars and the media focus on the historic importance of whether the Supreme Court will extend the 2nd Amendment to municipalities .
Gun control groups argue that a local community should have the right to pass gun laws without concern for the rights of individuals .
Gun rights groups argue that the U.S. Constitution and Illinois Constitution guarantee an individual 's right to bear arms .
What 's missed in all this is the history of Chicago 's handgun ban .
Owning a handgun is an important check on tyranny .
A critical figure in getting the Chicago ordinance passed had his own ties to the forces of corruption and tyranny .
A Chicago Tribune article from March 20,1982 described the passage of the handgun ban passage :
As Friday 's council session began , [ Mayor ]
Byrne feared the vote was too close to call .
There was extensive backroom debate to determine if the matter should be brought up .
But , Byrne allies , primarily Alderman Fred Roti ( 1st ) , Edward Burke ( 14th ) and Wilson Frost ( 34th ) , moved through the council chambers , persuading wavering aldermen to back the mayor 's proposals .
Still , some of Byrne 's staunchest allies , including Alderman Robert Shaw ( 9th ) and Richard Mell ( 33rd ) , deserted ranks and voted against the ordinance .
Streets and Sanitation Commissioner John Donovan made a last - minute deal with at least three aldermen who threatened to walk out of the meeting to avoid voting for the proposal .
Donovan promised to improve city services in their wards .
The Alderman leading the drive to disarm innocent Chicago residents was Alderman Fred Roti .
A month earlier in February of 1982 , the Chicago Tribune described Alderman Roti's control of Chicago 's City Council :
Roti has placed nearly as many city employees on the payroll as the city personnel department , and many of them are his own family members .
This is not a new trend under [ Mayor ] Byrne , however .
Under former Mayors Richard Daley and Michael Bilandic , members of the Roti clan have always had spectacular success gaining public employment .
Last fall it was disclosed that Roti family payrollers include his daughter , Rosemary , a press aide to Mayor Byrne at $ 25,992 a year ; and Rosemary 's husband , Ronald Marasso , who had been promoted from city painter to $ 34,000 a year general manager of maintenance at O'Hare International Airport .
Fourteen other Roti clan members were on various other city payrolls .
Because of his ward number , Roti 's name is always called first during council roll calls , and he revels in that privilege .
His initial response gives other administration aldermen their cue as to what Roti and , therefore , the mayor wants .
It 's often said that roll calls could stop after Roti votes - the outcome is already known .
Roti , an affable fellow , controls the Chicago City Council with an iron fist .
The U.S. Attorney General , in 1991 , identified Alderman Roti as a made member of the Chicago Mob .
In 1999 , the Justice Department again identified Alderman Roti as a made member : with greater clarity :
Fred Roti was convicted of RICO conspiracy , bribery and extortion regarding the fixing of criminal cases in the Circuit Court of Cook County , including murder cases involving organized crime members or associates and was sentenced to 48 months ' imprisonment .
Roti was released from prison in 1997 .
As First Ward alderman , Roti was a key political patronage boss and , along with his co-defendant Pat Marcy , a fixer for the Chicago Outfit .
Roti has directly participated in interfering with the rights of the members of LIUNA [ Labors ' International Union of North America ] in the selection of their officers and officials in that he has improperly influenced the selection of officers of the CLDC [ Chicago Laborers District Council ] and has been responsible for the pervasive hiring of LaPietra crew members and associates at the Chicago streets and sanitation department .
Roti is a made member of the Chicago Outfit .
Roti served on Chicago 's City Council from 1968 through January of 1991 .
He was Chicago 's longest serving Alderman at the time of his indictment .
Was Roti one bad apple ?
No , 30 other Aldermen since 1973 , went on to be convicted felons .
Few professions have a higher felony conviction rate .
These are the people that are elected to pass local ordinances in Chicago .
Union corruption was Alderman Roti's only legacy .
Fred Roti was instrumental in placing the Chicago Mob 's long - term plant William Hanhardt in the position of Chief of Detectives , a major achievement for the Chicago Mob because Hanhardt then controlled all criminal investigations .
Hanhardt also loaded up the Chicago Police Department with corrupt police officers .
Eventually , Hanhardt was indicted for running America 's most successful jewelry theft ring .
Here 's a quote from a Department of Justice press release quoting U.S. Attorney Scott Lassar on Hanhardt 's indictment :
" Hanhardt 's organization surpasses in duration and sophistication - just about any other jewelry theft ring we 've seen in federal law enforcement , " said Mr. Lassar .
" The defendants would determine the most opportune time to steal jewelry from places such as cars and hotel rooms by surveilling traveling salesmen and by keeping detailed records analyzing their routines , all with the purpose of providing income to themselves from the stolen property , " he added .
Chicago 's political establishment was quite proud of Alderman Roti 's legacy .
Shortly after he died in September of 1999 , Chicago 's City Council passed a resolution in honor of his legacy :
WHEREAS , Fred B. Roti , a committed public servant , a cherished friend of many and good neighbor to all , will be greatly missed and fondly remembered by his many family members , friends and associates ....
Chicago Democrats also had the Illinois General Assembly enter a resolution honoring Alderman Roti .
Congressman Danny Davis also entered a resolution honoring Roti in the Congressional Record .
On April 25 , 2005 , the Justice Department unveiled one their biggest organized crime cases in U.S. history .
The case was titled Operation Family Secrets , and was no ordinary investigation , according to the press release :
Eighteen previously unsolved murders and one attempted murder - all between 1970 and 1986 in the Chicago area , except one slaying in Arizona - form the core of a racketeering conspiracy indictment spanning four decades that was unsealed today against 14 defendants .
After a lengthy FBI - led investigation code - named Operation Family Secrets , FBI and IRS agents began arresting the defendants this morning in Illinois , Arizona and Florida .
This was historic because according to U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald , " It is remarkable for both the breadth of the murders charged and for naming the entire Chicago Outfit as a criminal enterprise under the anti-racketeering law . "
Even though Roti was dead his name was brought up at the trial .

There is a reason why JSON is becoming very popular as a data exchange format ( more important than it being less verbose than XML ) : programmers are sick of writing parsers !
But “ wait ” , you say – “ surely there are XML parsers available for you to use so that you do n’t have to roll your own … ” .
Yes , there are .
But while XML parsers handle the low - level syntactic parsing of XML tags , attributes , etc… , you still need to walk the DOM tree or , worse , build one yourself with nothing but a SAX parser ( Objective - C iPhone SDK I ’m looking at you ! ) .
And that code you write will of course depend on whether the XML you need to make sense of looks like this :
< person first - name = " John " last - name = " Smith " / >
or this :
< person > < first- name > John </ first - name > < last - name > Smith </ last- name > </ person >
or this :
< object type = " Person " > < property name= " first - name " >
John </ property > < property name = " last - name " >
Smith </ property > </object >
or any of the myriad of other ways one can conceive of expressing the same concept ( and there are many ) .
The standard XML parser does not help you in this regard .
You still need to do some work with the parse tree .
Working with JSON is a different , and superior , experience .
Firstly , the simpler syntax helps you avoid the need to decide between many different ways of representing your data ( as we saw above with XML ) – much less rope to hang yourself with .
Usually there is only one straightforward way to represent something :
{ " first - name " : " John " , " last - name " : " Smith " }
Even more important , if you are working in Javascript ( which is very often the case when working with JSON ) , all you need to do is call eval on a JSON string to obtain a first - class Javascript object .
This is huge .
The subtle point here is that the output of an XML parser is a parse tree , not an object native to the programming language being used .
With XML you are still dealing with syntax to a large degree .
When you work with JSON you can go straight from a string representation to object ( and back ) .
What makes this possible is that Javascript has syntactic constructs for describing composite data types literally .
While virtually all languages have syntax for the literal description of objects of primitive types ( integers ( e.g. 5 ) , strings ( e.g. “ hello world ” ) ) , not all languages have syntax for the literal description of objects of composite types .
For instance , if you want to create a map in Java you need to do it procedurally :
Map m = new HashMap ( ) ; m.put ( " a " , 1 ) ; m.put ( " b " , 2 ) ; m.put ( " c " , 3 ) ; . . .
Java does not have literal syntax for maps .
But languages such as Python and Javascript ( and others ) do .
In Javascript we can define our map literally :
{ " a " : 1 , " b " : 2 , " c " : 3 , ... }
As it turns out , such sub- languages are a great match for data interchange formats that are both human and machine readable .
So , it makes sense that JSON is so popular .
At the same time , I do n’t think JSON is the best or final incarnation of this concept , and I expect that , over time , other languages with similar properties will ( re ) emerge offering improvements over JSON ( more on that in a later post ) .
As for XML … it just might not be the best for structured data interchange ( even with some of the cool Object / XML mapping technologies out there ) .
It works well for markup ( i.e. HTML ) , and can be used for more structured data but over time I believe it will be supplanted by better technologies that are more like JSON and do n’t require developers to walk parse trees .
Developers should be free from the syntax business by now .
For Brian McGacken of Farmingdale , New Jersey , an evening of loud sex resulted in a 10 - year prison sentence for growing marijuana .
On Feb. 17 , 2007 , New Jersey state troopers arrived at McGacken ’s home , responding to an anonymous 911 call complaining of screams coming from McGacken ’s home .
McGacken explained the noise was a bout of loud sex ; his girlfriend appeared at the front door and corroborated his claim .
ADVERTISEMENT
But officers searched his home anyway , and found enough marijuana — including potted plants — to put him away for 10 years on charges of producing a controlled substance .
Appealing the conviction , McGacken argued that , once police knew the noise was consensual sex , they no longer had reason to search his home .
But the appellate panel at the Superior Court of New Jersey disagreed .
On Monday , they dismissed McGacken ’s appeal , stating that “ the potential for harm was too severe for the police to accept an explanation for loud screaming that could have been a cover - up of its true source . ”
The ruling stated in part :
The police are not required to accept the explanation that a person answering the door gives for a distress call .
While loud sex may have been a plausible source of screaming , that explanation was not so reliable that the police acted unreasonably in investigating further ….
Moreover , by first questioning defendant and his girlfriend , the troopers discounted the possibility that someone may have made a false report of screaming .
Defendant did not deny that screaming had occurred in his residence .
His admission made it unnecessary for the police to seek corroboration to establish the reliability of the anonymous 911 call .

“ The screaming , confirmed by the police to have occurred , gave [ the police ] an objectively reasonable basis to believe that a limited investigation was necessary to determine whether anyone else was in the home and in need of aid , ” explains the NJ Family Issues blog .
“ While loud sex may have been a plausible source of screaming , that explanation was not so reliable that the police acted unreasonably in investigating further . ”
Law.com reports that McGacken initially took few steps to prevent the police from entering his home .
When he was asked for identification , he went upstairs to retrieve it and “ did not object when a trooper followed him . ”
On the second floor , the trooper smelled raw marijuana and saw McGacken use his foot to push a tray under a couch .
Asked what was on the tray , McGacken admitted it was marijuana .
In the bedroom , the trooper saw bagged and loose marijuana as well as growing plants .
Arrested , McGacken consented to a search of his home , resulting in the seizure of 12.5 ounces of loose and bagged marijuana , 15 plants and marijuana - related equipment and paraphernalia .

McGacken is serving a 10 - year sentence with no possibility of parole for 39 months .

Mistaking a loaded gun for a video game controller , a 3 - year - old in Tennessee accidentally shot and killed herself , officials said .
Cheyenne Alexis McKeehan of Norene , Tenn. , shot herself Sunday night after her stepfather left his loaded Smith & Wesson handgun out on a table , Wilson County Sheriff Terry Ashe said .
Cheyenne 's mother told police officers that the child was used to playing a shooting game with the Nintendo Wii video game console and likely confused the real gun with the realistic - looking black toy gun , the sheriff said .
" The unfortunate thing is that this Nintendo game called Wii had what looks like a solid black , basically automatic - looking type mechanism that operates the game , " he said .
" Unfortunately , the stepdad also had a .380 caliber black Smith & Wesson .
The child was used to playing the video game . "
Cheyenne 's stepfather , Douglas Cronberger , 32 , owned a semi-automatic pistol that he normally kept in a secure location , out of the reach of Cheyenne and the couple 's 1 - year - old child , Ashe said .
But after taking it out to investigate a possible prowler , Cronberger left it on a table and forgot about it , officials said .
Law Enforcement : If You 're a Gun Owner , You Have to Be Responsible
When Cheyenne fired the gun , Ashe said , her mother , Tina Ann Cronberger , 32 , was within three feet of her child .
Cheyenne was pronounced dead on arrival at a local hospital .
" We 're not looking at criminal intent , " Ashe said , adding that no criminal charges have been filed .
" There was a terrible lapse of judgment here . "
He said that in his years in law enforcement , this was n't the first tragedy he'd seen involving children and guns , but Cheyenne was the youngest victim he had seen .
" If you 're a gun owner , you have to be responsible about how you store your weapon , especially if you have children , " Ashe said .
But he added that he hopes this incident causes others to be more careful with firearms in the home .
" I believe that something positive will come out of this -- that another family wo n't go through the heartbreak of this family , " he said .
Most Video Game Guns Don't Look as Lifelife
Ashe did not know the specific
Wii game the child played or the manufacturer of the video game controller .
Nintendo did not immediately provide a comment to ABCNews.com .
Michael Fahey , a reporter for the video game blog Kotaku , said lifelike gun controllers , like the one found by police at the Cronberger home , are very rare .
" It 's not one that 's generally on sale , " he said .
" You can't generally find it on sale in the U.S. because no one wants to sell a realistic - looking gun controller to children . "
After searching online , Fahey said he came across a video game controller that he thinks could be the same one owned by the Cronbergers .
Manufactured by the HAIHONGCHANG Electronics Company in China , the WiiAuto Pistol , he said , is available for sale on various Web sites , such as eBay .
The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment from ABCNews.com .
Fahey said he was n't even aware of the video game controller until Tuesday .
" It surprised me , really , to see a gun that realistic being used for [ the Wii ] , " he said .
Gun-Control Advocate : Gun-Related Accidents Happens ' All too Often '
Most toy guns marketed for kids ' video games in the United States are brightly - colored or white , to distinguish them from real guns .
But he said he did n't think there was a way for Nintendo to regulate what overseas third - party manufacturers create for the Wii console .
Nintendo might not have even known the realistic - looking gun existed , he said .
He also said he doubted there were many shooting video games meant for young children .
Those that do target kids , such as Nerf N - Strike , try to design toy guns that do n't resemble the real thing .
Gun-control advocates say it 's one more reminder of the dangers of guns in the home .
" The fact that there are things like this Wii toy that look like guns , make it all the more important for the adults to keep the guns away from the children , " said Paul Helmke , president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence .
" Keep it locked up , keep it secure , or do n't have it at all . "
Though not all gun accidents end as tragically as Cheyenne 's , he said this kind of incident happens " all too often . "
In the United States , he said , a gun in the home is 21 times more likely to injure a family member than protect the home from intruders .
" It shows once again that guns are not toys , " he said .
" Guns should not be left around where a child could get to them . "

In a spirited diatribe entitled “ Dealing With AU ’s anti-sex brigade ” published yesterday in the American University Eagle , AU ’s resident anti-feminist thinker , Alex Knepper , argues that feminists who rally against rape are turning act of sex into a sorry ritual in which “ two amorphous , gender - neutral blobs ask each other ‘ Is this OK with you ?. ’ ”
According to Knepper , age 20 , feminists are also responsible for stamping out the “ yin and yang of masculinity and femininity [ that ] makes sexual exploration exciting , ” abolishing passion , and also somehow discouraging “ inherently gendered thrills ” like erotic cross-dressing .
Knepper ends the column by providing a helpful reading list for his misguided peers , including works by Camille Paglia , the Marquis de Sade , and Christina Hoff Sommers .
An unidentified member of the campus community has responded with a more direct retort :
They removed copies of the paper from their stands and posted a message above them reading , “ NO ROOM FOR RAPE APOLOGISTS . ”
According to these photos sent in from an American University student , the message for Knepper has been posted near several Eagle newsstands around campus ; in one photo , a stack of Eagles appears to have been strewn haphazardly across the floor in front of the paper ’s offices .
“ A few people had taken probably several thousand copies and threw them over against our door , ” says Jen Calantone , Eagle editor - in - chief .
The vandalism was light ; no papers were destroyed , and newspaper staff have since removed the posters and redistributed the papers .
Some copies were crinkled .
In an e-mail , American University student ( and campus feminist and LGBT activist ) K. Travis Ballie explains the perceived impetus for the move : “ In response to the very strong and passionate outrage at rape apologist Alex Knepper ’s latest column “ Dealing With AU ’s Anti-Sex Brigade , ” an unidentified student not endorsed by any organization decided to take direct action , ” Ballie writes .
“ The Eagle has repeatedly refused for months to show adequate sensitivity , compassion , and common decency to the well - being of rape survivors on campus and is complicit in promoting a rape culture where survivors are blamed for the crimes of sexual assault perpetrators . ”
Knepper ’s column anticipated this criticism .
In it , he wrote that on American University ’s campus , “ For my pro-sex views , I am variously called a misogynist , a rape apologist and —- my personal favorite — - a ‘ pro-date rape protofascist . ' ” ( I guess that one did n’t fit on the poster ) .
Knepper ’s column went on to provide a sampling of some of Knepper ’s “ pro-sex views ” :
Let ’s get this straight : any woman who heads to an EI party as an anonymous onlooker , drinks five cups of the jungle juice , and walks back to a boy ’s room with him is indicating that she wants sex , OK ?
To cry “ date rape ” after you sober up the next morning and regret the incident is the equivalent of pulling a gun to someone ’s head and then later claiming that you did n’t ever actually intend to pull the trigger .
“ Date rape ” is an incoherent concept .
There ’s rape and there ’s not - rape , and we need a line of demarcation .
It ’s not clear enough to merely speak of consent , because the lines of consent in sex — - especially anonymous sex — - can become very blurry .
If that bothers you , then stick with Pat Robertson and his brigade of anti-sex cavemen !
Do n’t jump into the sexual arena if you ca n’t handle the volatility of its practice !
Despite the column ’s defensive stance on the “ rape apologist ” label , Knepper did n’t anticipate the ad - hoc campus campaign against him ; when I called him around noon today he had n’t yet heard of the removal of the papers and the “ RAPE APOLOGIST ” posters .
After perusing the evidence , Knepper agreed to answer some questions over e-mail .
“ Well , this is the new feminist orthodoxy : censorship , ” he wrote .
“ It started with Catherine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin , and it ’s an utter betrayal of the ideals of women like Wollstonecraft , Stanton , and even Friedan .
I ’m also very concerned with the highly fragile view of women that this promotes : I ca n’t say something that offends them without stirring them to vandalism ?
Carmen Rios states that my column can act as a ‘ trigger ’ for survivors .
Does anyone treat men with kid gloves like this ? ”
I asked Knepper whether he thought there was any room for rape apologists at American .
“ There is no room for rape apologists on campus .
If I see any , I ’ll be sure to rebuke them , ” he wrote .
I also asked him to expound on the whole feminist cross -dressing ban thing :
“ The entire concept of cross - dressing has no place within feminism , ” he explained .
“ [ O ] ne cannot ‘ cross ’ the line of something that does not exist . ”
Finally , I asked him if the “ yin and yang of masculinity and femininity ” is truly “ what makes sexual exploration exciting , ” then is n’t it kind of boring to be gay ?
“ Certainly not , ” replied Knepper , who is gay .
“ Gay men — - by which I do not mean the eunuchs who constitute the vanguard of so - called queer activism — - are far more likely to understand that dressing one ’s boyfriend up like a girl and fucking his ass with a dildo is to feminize him .
The feminine element of sexuality is not literally about being female — - it ’s about surrender and submission .
One might say that my homosexuality is the ultimate expression of my deep - seated hatred for women , though , right ? ”
On Facebook , members of the university community are n’t questioning the implications of Knepper ’s sexual orientation , but they are debating the tactics used to protest his articles .
“ If you do n’t like the Eagle , do n’t read it , support the AU Examiner , write a counter column , or start your own newspaper — - DON’T act like children [ and ] follow the same idea - bashing tactics that the christian - conservo - right do every time they come to a school and insure it has the right books on the shelves , ” wrote one .
“ i think a lot of people who might be allies on this are really alienated by this type of vandalism , ” wrote another .
The Eagle , for one , is n’t particularly pleased — - but it has been inspired to take some action .
“ It ’s upsetting , because our general purpose as the campus newspaper is to start these types of discussions , ” says Calantone .
“ We were happy when people started talking about and criticizing this column , but it ’s upsetting when it devolves into a kind of vandalism situation . ”
The newspaper is planning to hold open campus discussion on Knepper ’s column this Thursday evening .
UPDATE : This story was updated at 2 p.m. with comments from Knepper .
VANCOUVER , British Columbia — Bobby Shane Stevenson awoke to a nightmare on Oct. 30 , 1997 .
The 10 - year - old had fallen asleep shortly after returning from attending a Philadelphia Flyers game the night before .
He went to bed upstairs not knowing his life would change forever in the next few hours .
He did n’t hear his dad — insurance company owner Robert Stevenson — storm into the family home in Cherry Hill , drunk , looking for his mother , Melody .
Stevenson was sure his wife was taking drugs .
Their only child did n’t hear the screams and the panic .
He did n’t see the bizarre chase down the street into a neighbor ’s house .
His father , an amateur boxer , ripped the door off the hinges and whaled away at the love of his life , causing her to bleed from her mouth and sending her to Cooper University Hospital in Camden for four days with four broken ribs , a fracture to her skull and a punctured lung .
Robert Stevenson was charged with attempted murder and five other felony counts .
He tried to obtain a passport using the name of a dead baby before jumping bail .
He fled to Canada and his wife , who had forgiven him , and his son later joined him .
Robert Stevenson and his son changed their names and lived under assumed identities and the family lived on the lam .
Today , the boy who protected his family ’s dark and complicated secret for much of his life is a pivotal part of the U.S. Olympic hockey team that faces Canada .
The name on the back of his hockey jersey is different from the one he was born with , but Bobby Ryan realized he needed to tell the truth and no longer hides from it .
" I did n’t feel like I really had an identity , " says the 22 - year - old star of the National Hockey League ’s Anaheim Ducks .
" I knew I had to tell my story . "
And his father has never forgotten how that one night long ago changed three lives so dramatically .
" I regret it every day , " he says .
" This is mine for the rest of my life .
Fortunately , I have two people that put me in a position to be able to make it up to them . "
' YOU'RE BOBBY RYAN '
On the run , he combed parts of Canada and Alaska , looking for good junior hockey programs for his son .
Bobby had a gift that needed to be cultivated .
The fugitive ’s scouting trip ended in El Segundo , Calif. , just outside Los Angeles , where an elite hockey feeder system was in place .
Before his wife and son arrived , Stevenson changed his name .
Bob Stevenson became Shane Ryan , an alias created after watching the movie " Saving Private Ryan . "
His son changed his name , too .
Bobby Stevenson disappeared .
" My parents made it clear , " he says .
" They were serious , so I only had to be told once : ‘ You ’re Bobby Ryan to anybody who asks .
No exceptions . ’â "
While the father became a professional gambler , his son ’s game on the ice flourished under an assumed identity .
The family had repaired the wounds , even if they were still living with their secret .
Then one day in February 2000 , Bobby Ryan was sleeping on a couch on the first floor of their home when his world changed again .
It was 4:45 a.m .
Federal marshals burst into the house and took away his father at gunpoint .
The man who had set in motion a new life for his family 3,000 miles from his crime had made one critical mistake :
He used an old credit card to rent a movie at Blockbuster .
Law enforcement tracked him down shortly thereafter .
The ruse was over .
A SON'S CROSSROADS
Ryan was extradited to New Jersey , where he pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and jumping bail .
He was sentenced to five years in a Camden prison .
The father has legally changed his name to Bob Ryan and works at Bob Clarke ’s Gym in Cherry Hill , owned by the Flyers ’ former star and current executive .
Bob Ryan says he regrets what he did 13 years ago but he does n’t regret his decision to flee from New Jersey .
" It probably makes absolutely no sense to 95 percent of the people , " he says .
" I ’m not saying that what happened was good .
I ’m saying what happened had positive changes for Bobby . "
The kid rocketed up the youth rankings in Michigan and thrived in the Ontario Hockey League in Canada .
The father saw none of it .
" I missed more games than I care to count , " Bob Ryan says .
" I could n’t travel to Canada because the parole department would n’t permit me to .
But I would n’t trade any of those things for where he ended up . "
As the 2005 NHL Draft approached , Bobby Ryan reached a crossroads .
He did n’t want to hide behind the family secret anymore .
" It was n’t easy by any means , " the player says .
" I did n’t want to have people ask about my parents and have to lie .
If you hide it , it ’s more than likely going to come out at some point .
Then you ’re going to have to deal with the repercussions of not being honest in the first place . "
So Ryan exposed his complicated past before the Ducks selected him with the No. 2 overall pick , just after the Pittsburgh Penguins drafted Sidney Crosby .
" Through it all , I became more independent , " Ryan says .
" I certainly do n’t have any skeletons in my closet . "
IN THE STANDS
The couple inside the house on Merchant Street in Cherry Hill lives a simple life now .
Bobby Ryan and Melody ( who has kept her married name , Stevenson ) are still together .
They ’ll both be in the stands today to cheer for their son .
" Does he have scars ?
Probably , " the father says .
" But he ’s a good kid .
He ’s honest .
He ’s forthright .
He ’s genuinely good to other people .
He took the right path . "
The name stretched across the back of his son ’s jersey is no longer an anchor .
" Stevenson was just going to bring about turmoil , " Bobby Ryan says .
A 6 - foot - 2 , 210 - pound forward with a blend of speed and power , Ryan has flourished in his first two seasons in the NHL .
In 2009 , he finished second in the voting for the Calder Trophy , awarded to the league ’s top rookie .
" He ’s a guy that can change a game by himself , " said Team USA architect Brian Burke , who was Anaheim ’s general manager five years ago when he drafted Ryan .
" This guy can break a game open . "
Last Monday , the day before he scored Team USA ’s first goal of the Olympics , the young star stood inside Canada Hockey Place , retracing his strange road and sharing a family saga that somehow emboldened him .
Bobby Ryan stopped hiding long ago .

McLaren team principal Martin Whitmarsh believes Formula 1 needs to consider immediate rules tweaks to spice up the spectacle after new rules failed to deliver an exciting race in Bahrain .
Whitmarsh admitted that the opening race of the season at Sakhir had lacked excitement as the sport adapted to the new regulations , including a ban on refuelling .
Most of the front - runners stopped just once and many drivers , including Michael Schumacher , reported that it was difficult to follow rivals closely and therefore overtake .
Whitmarsh told the BBC that something needed to be done to change the dynamic of the racing - perhaps by revisiting a mandatory two pitstops rule or making tyre compounds more on edge .
" We were one of three teams , that said we should have two mandatory pitstops because we were worried about [ people ] one - stopping .
" I think we have to re-examine that .
But I think if we can now push on Bridgestone to have ' racier ' tyres , we need a super - soft tyre that is really going to hurt if you take it to 20 laps .
You should n't be able to do that with a super - soft tyre and I think even the prime , if it 's a struggle to get it to do half a race distance , then you force [ the issue ] .
" The tyres were much closer in the race than we expected and they determined the spectacle , " he added .
" There was no real serious degradation of the tyres , we started the roll of pitstops because we were trying to get ahead of [ Nico ] Rosberg and everyone started to come in at that point .
" But otherwise , just based on tyre degradation , we could have run to lap 25 or more on the super - soft tyres .
If you can do that on the softest tyre , then the primes are just going to romp through for as long as you like . "
Whitmarsh said that the teams were committed to making the sport exciting .
" I think we all are , " he said .
" Formula 1 has to be entertaining , people have to be switched on to what is going to happen in the race , if it 's processional they are not going to be .
Today was not the best show , we know that and we have all got to work together to improve it .
Whitmarsh added that it was a combination of factors that had contributed to the lack of overtaking in the second half of the race and that while he believed that the 2011 ban on double - diffusers would help , he was focussed on the changes that could be made in the short term .
" I personally believe that more challenging tyres will help the spectacle of the show , " he said .
" I also personally believe that we should have two stops mandated because we want to stop this .
Today , if we had had a safety car on lap five , we'd have all piled in [ to the pits ] and we'd have all gone on the prime tyre and run to lap 49 without a stop .
That was a real danger .
" I think that the tyres are allowing you to do that , I 'm not trying to pass the blame [ on to Bridgestone ] .
We are all in this together .
" We do need to look at mandatings stops , we do need to look at the tyres and make them more fragile , and we do need to work on making the cars capable of racing close together and easier to overtake .
" Unfortunately the double diffuser , and we have all got them , has really worked against that in the last two years , we have got rid of it for next year but that is arguably a year too late .
What can we do this year ?
It 's go to be work with Bridgestone and potentially mandating more stops in the race . "

The corporate - takeover shark played by Michael Douglas in the movie “ Wall Street ” brandished a replica and bragged about it as “ the rarest gun in the world . ”
An Indonesian billionaire paid $ 1 million for the real thing , and it became known as “ the million - dollar Luger . ”
That was in the late 1980s , when the Douglas line “ greed is good ” captured the spirit of the times .
On Sunday , under very different economic circumstances , the coveted .45 - caliber Luger found a new owner for half that price at a public auction in Anaheim .
The gavel came down at $ 430,000 from an anonymous bidder .
With the 15 % buyer ’s premium , the 103 - year - old weapon fetched $ 494,500 .

“ It ’s a great bargain ; he ’ll be very happy , ” said Greg Martin , whose company , Greg Martin Auctions , ran the sale .
“ The mystery of the million - dollar Luger has been solved by the market .
But it will always be known as the million - dollar Luger . ”
Proxy bidder Paul Cole , president of Gun World in Burbank , said he represented a celebrity who chose to remain anonymous .
“ The buyer has a huge firearms collection , ” Cole said .
“ He wanted to make this the crowning jewel of his collection .
He ’s really excited ; he ’s in tears .
And it ’s really hard to get him excited . ”
Martin had hoped for a higher price , noting that last year his firm auctioned the Colt Single - Action Army revolver , Serial No. 1 , for $ 862,500 , one of the highest prices ever paid at auction for a firearm .

“ Greed may be a bad word now , but the gun market is reliably strong , ” he said .
At the Anaheim auction , a few hundred gun enthusiasts showed up or stood by online and via telephone , seduced by the assortment of antique pistols , rifles , daggers and other military paraphernalia , including a samurai armor ensemble from the 1800s .
Douglas Smith , 70 , flew from Portsmouth , Ohio , just to see the Luger handgun , which has a special place in his heart because he held it when he was 19 , at a gun show where he met one of its original owners .
“ This is the holy grail of the collection , ” said Smith , who has collected Lugers for 55 years .
“ If you were to have one gun , that ’s the one to own . ”

Smith , who runs bowling alleys , said he would have to be content with a glimpse of the rare Luger .
Preliminary Internet bidding had already driven the price to $ 300,000 .
“ I ’d love to have it , but at my age it ’s just beyond my reach , ” he said .
“ I ’d have to sell a lot of guns to come up with the money . ”
Even for those who do n’t collect Lugers , just being in the same room as this one was a thrill .
“ It ’s kind of like being a custodian of American history , ” said Walt Hallstein , 73 , a collector from Los Alamitos who covets Winchester firearms .

The 9 - millimeter Luger was the standard firearm used by the Germans during World Wars I and II , according to the auctioneer .
The Germans made the .45 - caliber for the American market and tried unsuccessfully to sell it to the U.S. military in 1907 .
Only three were made and two survived .
The other is in a Louisiana museum .
In 1949 , collector Sidney Aberman bought the Luger for $ 150 from a friend who paid the same price for it five years earlier .
After Aberman died , the gun was acquired by a California dealer who sold it to the Indonesian billionaire , Yani Haryanto , for $ 1 million .
The Luger was since sold privately several times .
Sunday was the first time it had been available for public bidding , Martin said .

Waste Land
When the bubble burst last year in Dubai , an endlessly reported detail was the number of cars abandoned — some supposedly with apology notes stuck to the windshields — by debt - burdened foreigners fleeing an economy in free fall .
Now the German impresario hired to oversee the emirate ’s ambitious cultural plans has also quit his post , leaving behind not a missive on the Volkswagen Touareg SUV he drove in the desert boomtown , but Dubai Speed , a unique insider ’s memoir of the grandiose — and all too fleeting — attempt to use state power to reinvent a culture .
Michael Schindhelm ’s impressionistic account of Dubai ’s failed bid to buy an artistic identity by importing talent from around the world joins books in German and English about Dubai as the instantaneous city , with its made - to - order architectural majesty and astonishing new acts of consumerism , on the brink of cracking up even as it was being built .
This emerging literature of the collapsed Dubai experiment gives a more detailed picture of the backstage bluster and indecisiveness that led to such unparalleled overreach than one finds in the news coverage .
The portrait revealed is depressing , from the fortune - seeking Western consultants jockeying for position to the money - mad al - Maktoum dynasty with its thwarted pretensions to international grandeur .
Schindhelm was already a master of reinvention by the time he arrived in Dubai in 2007 , after resigning from his job as director - general of Berlin ’s venerable trio of opera houses .
Born in communist East Germany , Schindhelm worked briefly as a chemistry professor with future chancellor Angela Merkel , then started directing regional theaters in Germany and Switzerland before moving on to Berlin , where he quit in protest after the financially strapped city was forced to cut opera funding .
Schindhelm subsequently traded Berlin for a postmodern city - state that , at least at the start of his sojourn , lured him with promises of unimaginable riches and boundless excitement .
“ One does n’t really know whether the man is to be pitied or envied , ” the German newspaper Die Welt commented when Schindhelm departed for Dubai .
After all , were n’t the Gulf states a “ refuge for those who had substantially failed and now far away use gold to build fake artistic dreams and castles in the air ? ”
From the start , Schindhelm found in Dubai a land of superlatives and excess in stark contrast to the sober constraints of home .
“ This city is in total mobilization , ” he writes in his book , currently available only in German , “ not only in competition with time ; it is a protest against time . …
Everything is in a process of transformation , marching forward . ”
His pressing task was to create swiftly what Dubai ’s leaders proclaimed would be “ the most comprehensive cultural destination in the world . ”
This included , first and foremost , an opera housed within an undulating structure designed by starchitect Zaha Hadid to resemble sand dunes and meant to accommodate an audience of 3,000 in a society with no tradition of theater or music .
Schindhelm tried in vain to point out the acoustic drawbacks of such a mammoth auditorium , pushing instead for a never - to - be - built opera house that would reflect Dubai ’s aspirations as a laboratory for globalized culture .
“ On today ’s program is Così Fan Tutte , ” he imagined , “ and tomorrow a Lebanese dance theater group ; then follows an appearance by Cirque du Soleil , a modern Beijing opera , and a Bollywood musical .
And the auditorium is actually a melting pot . ”
Soon state museums in Berlin , Dresden , and Munich were working with Schindhelm to build a Museum of World Cultures , and there were plans to create dozens more museums , libraries , theaters , and galleries .
The cultural authority was also in talks to include the Hermitage , the J. Paul Getty Museum , and the National Museum of China in building “ the world ’s largest consolidated museum . ”
But Schindhelm was hampered from the outset by the profound disarray and highly opaque decision - making of Dubai ’s madcap dash to globalize .
He was assigned to work in the same skyscraper where Dubai ’s top government authorities sat on the 52nd floor , while his own office was located on the 28th with two phone lines , only one of which could make international calls .
The fax machine was on the 36th floor , and the photocopier was on the fourth .

He was also confronted by particularly Arabic notions of Western culture .
He was told early on , for example , that Dubai natives believe “ piano playing comes from the devil ’s fingers ” and warned , “ You will have to convince us otherwise . ”
Opera for some in Dubai , Schindhelm reports , is really the Lion King .
His local colleagues on the arts authority were n’t overly devoted to the task at hand , and Schindhelm recounts how one preferred to spend time learning to fly his new Gulfstream G250 , while a white - robed 24 - year - old employee passed the office hours perusing a green silk - bound book containing photos of his personal automobile collection of more than three dozen vehicles .
Worse , he was never certain whether censorship threatened the entire endeavor .
When Dubai participated in live broadcasts from New York ’s Metropolitan Opera as a test - drive for introducing Western high culture , scenes from the Dance of the Seven Veils were cut out of Richard Strauss ’s Salome to avoid offending Islamic sensibilities , though Schindhelm reports that this was hardly necessary because a good number of Dubai ticket - holders failed even to show up .
In an interview about his book , he told the Berliner Morgenpost that Dubai customs officials would not let him receive by mail a monograph about the painter Francis Bacon because they feared its contents contravened Islamic dietary strictures .
Weary of such frustrations and hopelessly lost in Dubai ’s labyrinthine decision - making process , Schindhelm quit last summer as Dubai ’s economy crashed around him , bringing down with it the vision of a new mecca for the arts .
His dreams and those of the ruling dynasty have come to naught :
There ’s now a parking garage on the site intended for the opera house , and the scheme for the Museum of World Cultures disintegrated as hastily as it was conceived .
Dubai ’s real estate collapse , which forced the country to seek billion - dollar bailouts from its prosperous neighbor , Abu Dhabi , had other casualties , too : the architectural wonderland conceived in the boom ’s feverish days .
The Burj Khalifa skyscraper , for example , is now the highest building in the world , as tall as the two World Trade Center towers stacked atop one another , but is having serious trouble attracting tenants since it opened in January .
The fantasyland of Dubai , the countless towers erected in inhospitable desert out of a need for telegenic architectural monuments , is carefully analyzed in Dubai : Stadt aus dem Nichts ( Dubai : City Out of Nothing ) , a collection of essays and interviews edited by Elisabeth Blum and Peter Neitzke .
The contributors examine the astounding array of man-made islands and environmentally unsustainable architectural inventions — the bulk of them unbearably gaudy but with a wow factor unrivaled almost anywhere — intended to market Dubai ’s development .
The volume includes a piece on the exploitative working conditions of imported Southeast Asian laborers who built the Burj and other towers and concludes with the dark and now fully realized prediction of plunging prices for the massive construction boom financed by debt .
Perhaps the best look at this desert mirage is the prescient book Dubai : The Vulnerability of Success , published in 2008 by British political scientist Christopher M. Davidson .
Well before the real estate debacle , Davidson raised questions about how long Dubai could remain immune from regional conflict , organized crime , and terrorism , all of which would swiftly affect its allure as a haven for investment and luxury travel .
He voiced concerns over its development model , aired the deep misgivings among its people , and suggested that it faced a rising level of security threats from within and without , including serving as a center for organized crime operations involving massive smuggling , gunrunning , and money laundering .
Dubai today seems to have lost what was once a cultural arms race with other Gulf governments .
Abu Dhabi ’s plans to import Western culture via branches of the Guggenheim and the Louvre are moving ahead .
New York University this fall will welcome the first students to its Abu Dhabi campus , where the former director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art , Philippe de Montebello , is an advisor .
Qatar has already opened its impressive I.M. Pei-designed Museum of Islamic
Art and is planning to construct a museum of Middle Eastern modern art .
But one observer , at least , has not lost faith in Dubai ’s potential : Schindhelm writes in his book that Dubai is still working to create an alternative to the social injustice and religious fanaticism in neighboring Saudi Arabia and nearby Iran and Pakistan .
Perhaps he was naive to see in the desert sands an opportunity for a cultural utopia , but he ’s wise to warn against gloating over the end of the city ’s glitzy heyday .
With its central location between Europe and Asia , Dubai seems likely to survive and thrive , if more soberly , as a trading center .
But next time , it might do better to realize that culture is worth more than just eye candy for real estate megalomania that can too easily run amok .
ACTOR Robert Hughes has denied reports he molested a child co-star on the set of a hit Eighties sitcom .
Earlier , Channel Nine 's A Current Affair named the actor , who played the father in the popular comedy series Hey Dad ! named Hughes as the actor at the centre of the allegations , the Herald Sun reports .
“ I am absolutely shocked and surprised at this allegation , " Hughes said .
" I categorically deny the allegation . "
It never happened .
The entire matter is now in the hands of my lawyers . ”
Child star Sarah Monahan told Woman 's
Day last week that a man who worked on the show had fondled her and exposed himself .
Monahan , who played schoolgirl Jenny Kelly , was six when she began work on Hey Dad ! , which aired on the Seven Network from 1987 to 1994 .
She told Woman 's Day that a man who worked on the show had fondled her and exposed himself , the Herald Sun reported .
Monahan later said there were other other victims among the Hey Dad ! cast .
" I guess I was the smallest and I know I was n't the only one .
The others are just still not going to speak about it , " she said .
Monahan said she wanted the alleged perpetrator working on the Hey Dad !
set to be jailed and " burn in hell " .
She said the years of abuse had sent her almost to the brink .
" I remember at school they actually demanded that I have a psychiatrist , " she said .
" In art class I could draw perfect penises .
And they were like , there 's something wrong with this person that she could draw stuff like that at that age .
" I think I was at that point where I was probably suicidal . "
She said she knew her molester was a " dirty old man " but said she had been pressured to stay quiet , even years after quitting the show .
She also feared losing her job because she was " paying the rent " .
" They say that people do n't know .
But people knew , and it was always a ' Keep it hushed , because this is the most successful TV show on television - people do n't want to know that ' , " she said .
She said the man often sought her out when she was alone in her dressing room .
" It 's not like he raped me , but it was wrong , " she said .
She said the abuse began when she was just six .
She said she gained the strength to put her foot down only at age 13 , resulting in the man " turning mean " and calling her fat and ugly .
Former executive producer Gary Reilly has denied knowledge of the allegations regarding Monahan until they were aired in Woman 's Day .
But he said he was aware of rumours about the treatment of a different young actor , and she was given a chaperone .
Police will decide in the next few days whether to launch an investigation .
A New South Wales police spokesman said Monahan , who now lives in the US , had not made a complaint to police .
But she said on A Current Affair that she would be prepared to go to police , as she was " no longer scared " .
The police spokesman said he did not believe any other complaints had been lodged about inappropriate sexual conduct on the set .
He urged other victims or those with information to come forward .
" My understanding is we need to have a complaint made by an alleged victim , " he said .
" Depending on the revelations , we may institute our own investigation . "
TV insiders have told the Herald Sun there had been talk for years about a man on the set .
" I heard of this a few years ago , " one source said .
" It 's no secret this happened .
It has been talked about for years . "
Monahan has not named the man , or did she say if he was a member of the cast or the crew , but described him variously as " big " , " powerful " and " well respected " .

' You can see by the ratings numbers that the Sierra HD lineup is more capable , but the trucks are also better performers in the intangible qualities that bond owners with their trucks , ' said Rick Spina , vehicle line executive .
' They accelerate quicker – especially when fully loaded – stop more confidently and deliver a smooth , quiet driving experience that you have to experience to fully appreciate .
'The details :
The new Sierra Denali HD is offered exclusively in the Crew Cab standard box configuration on the 2500HD chassis , providing a spacious cabin with room for up to five .
As with other Denali models , including the new Acadia Denali , the cabin is unique with standard premium touches .
It includes Denali - specific brushed aluminum trim , power - adjustable pedals , a Bose premium surround audio system and 12 - way power seats .
Along with an optional heated steering wheel , heated and cooled leather - appointed seating is available .
The exterior is offered in three colors : Black , Stealth Gray and White .
On the capability front , the Sierra Denali has a gross vehicle weight rating ( GVWR ) of 10,000 pounds ( 4,536 kg ) , a payload capacity of 2,959 pounds ( 1,342 kg ) and a maximum trailering rating of 15,600 pounds ( 7,076 kg ) with a fifth - wheel hitch .
The maximum conventional hitch trailering rating is 13,000 pounds ( 5,897 kg ) . :
The frames have increased cross sections and use more high - strength steel for greater durability , higher towing capacity and improved ride and handling ; the front sections are hydroformed .
The bending and beaming stiffness of the frames is increased 92 percent and 20 percent , respectively , with the fully boxed sections enhancing torsional stiffness by a factor of five .
Also , larger engine and transmission mounts , coupled with a 125 - percent - stiffer front frame structure , provide greater vibration control , while hydraulic body mounts are incorporated under the cab section on extended and crew cab models for a more isolated feel inside .
Engineers addressed common customer and aftermarket uses when designing the new frames , including adding access holes to the rear frame section to enable easier installation of fifth - wheel / gooseneck - style hitches .
Also , the frame - mounted hitch for conventional trailering is stronger , with a box - tube design .
It supports up to 16,000 pounds ( 7,257 kg ) .
A completely redesigned independent front suspension system offers up to a 25 - percent greater front axle weight rating – up to 6,000 pounds ( 2,721 kg ) front gross axle weight rating ( FGAWR ) – so a snow plow can be used on all 4WD cab configurations with the available snow plow prep package .
Sierra 's signature short - long arm / torsion bar front suspension design is retained , but now features new , forged steel upper control arms that are stronger and lighter than their predecessors .
The new lower control arms are made of precision - machined cast iron to handle the greater loads .
Five different torsion bar rates support five different front gross axle weight ratings ( a single torsion bar was previously used for all models ) .
This helps stabilize the range of trim heights of various models under load , while enhancing appearance , handling , durability , tire wear and alignment .
The trim height is adjusted on each bar via a single bolt , easily allowing the height to be changed to account for the weight of a snow plow or other accessories .
The Sierra HD front suspension now uses a pair of urethane jounce bumpers on each side , instead of one , for improved load management ; and there 's a new upper shock mount attachment design that 's positively connected to the frame with two fasteners .
This design eliminates squeaks and clunks , while supporting higher load capability and increased durability .
Compared to competitors ' beam - axle front suspensions , the Sierra 's independent front suspension provides a better ride , more accurate trim height control ( with fewer parts ) and greater flexibility to adjust the alignment for weight and tire sensitivity .
Matching the Sierra HD 's greater strength and capability is a rear suspension designed to support greater loads .
It features a new , larger asymmetrical leaf - spring design that also contributes to improved ride and handling characteristics .
The asymmetrical design is derived from unequal front and rear spring half lengths , which minimize axle hop and enhance traction control efficiency .
2500 HD models feature a two - stage leaf - spring design , while 3500 HD models have a three - stage design .
All models feature 3 - inch - wide ( 76 mm ) leaf springs that are 20 - percent wider than previous models .
The larger leaf - spring design supports increased rear gross axle weight ratings across the board .
On the 2500HD models , the rating is 6,200 pounds ( 2,818 kg ) – up from 6,084 ( 2,765 ) .
On 3500 HD models , the rating increases to 7,050 pounds ( 3,204 kg ) on single - rear - wheel models and 9,375 pounds ( 4,261 kg ) on dual - rear - wheel models – the latter representing a nearly 14 - percent increase over the previous 8,200 - pound ( 3,727 kg ) rating .
Longer wheelbases – ranging from 133.6 inches ( 3,395 mm ) to 167.7 inches ( 4,259 mm ) – and wider front / rear tracks enhance the ride and handling characteristics of the Sierra 2500HD and 3500HD , giving them a greater feeling of smoothness and control .
The longer wheelbases and wider tracks are complemented by the new , stiffer frames , new jounce bumpers , shock mounts and hydraulic body mounts to provide a solid , smooth and isolated driving experience .
New shocks were specially valved to support the new trucks ' weight ratings , while balancing excellent ride characteristics .
Also enhancing the driving experience is a revised steering system designed to support the trucks ' greater front gross axle weight rating .
It includes a new , larger steering gear , power steering pumps and linkages .
The pumps ( different parts for gas and diesel models ) deliver greater pressure for reduced steering effort in low - speed and parking maneuvers ; they are also quieter .
On some models , the new linkages feature a compliant joint added at the pitman attachment to enhance handling .
The workhorse Duramax 6.6L turbo diesel V - 8 is more powerful and durable for 2011 , delivering segment - best horsepower and torque – 397 horsepower ( 296 kW ) at 3,000 rpm and 765 lb. - ft. of torque ( 1,037 Nm ) at 1,600 rpm – lower emissions and B20 biodiesel capability that promotes a domestically produced renewable fuel .
( concept carz )
The new Duramax 6.6L features : • NOx emissions reduced at least 63 percent over 2010 models • Quieter operation• High - pressure ( 30,000 psi/2,000 bar )
Piezo - actuated fuel system for greater fuel efficiency , improved performance and reduced emissions • ' Smart ' exhaust brake feature that enables controlled vehicle slowdown on downhill grades without actuating the brakes •
Selective catalytic reduction after - treatment system using diesel exhaust fluid ( DEF ) injection to provide the best overall diesel characteristics and performance – with a range of about 5,000 miles ( 8,000 km ) between DEF refills • Combustion and after - treatment have been optimized to provide about 700 miles ( 1,125 km ) between diesel particulate filter regenerations – a 75 - percent improvement over the previous system and a significant contributor to improved fuel efficiency , as the regeneration process requires additional fuel• B20 biodiesel capability for an alternative fueling option •
Internal revisions that improve durability .
With nearly 1.3 million Duramax 6.6L engines produced since 2000 , they have proven exceptionally durable and dependable .
The internal elements that helped build its reputation are enhanced for 2011 , including : • Main bearings ' profiles changed to enhance oil film thickness •
Oil pump flow increased for increased pressure at low speeds •
Modified turbocharger oil circuit for increased pressure at the turbo and faster oil delivery •
The connecting rods ' pin ends are modified to provide increased piston support •
New , higher - strength piston design that eliminates bushings to provide lower reciprocating weight •
An EGR cooler bypass reduces high - mileage soot deposits in the cooler and EGR circuit .
Compared with Ford Super Duty 's urea - based system , Sierra HD 's selective catalytic reduction after - treatment system delivers better overall diesel performance , with a range of about 5,000 miles ( 8,000 km ) between DEF refills .
Its optimized combustion and after - treatment process provides about 700 miles ( 1,125 km ) between diesel particulate filter regenerations – a better capability than Ford's .
The enhanced Allison 1000 is strengthened to handle the higher torque capability of the new 6.6L Duramax engine , while also helping to improve fuel economy and provide seamless assistance with a new exhaust brake system .
Greater efficiency is delivered through reduced ' spin loss ' – meaning , the transmission channels more of the engine 's power to the axles , allowing it to do more with less fuel .
( concept carz )
The Allison 1000 also features driver shift control with tap up / tap down shifting and a patented elevated idle mode cab warm - up feature .
Also , the tow / haul mode reduces shift cycling for better control and improved cooling when towing or hauling heavy loads .
The six - speed configuration retains its two overdrive gears for optimal efficiency .
Performance with the Duramax / Allison combination is also improved over previous models , with preliminary testing showing 0 - 60 mph times of less than 9 seconds and quarter - mile times of less than 16 seconds in 2500 HD models .
That 's about 0.3 - second and 0.5 - second quicker , respectively , than previous models .
The Vortec 6.0L gas V - 8 with variable valve timing returns to the new Sierra HDs , along with a strengthened version of the Hydra - Matic 6L90 six - speed automatic transmission .
This combination delivers excellent performance and efficiency , with a greater emphasis on low - rpm power .
It is enhanced for 2011 with greater idle refinement .
The engine is rated at 360 horsepower ( 268 kW ) at 5,400 rpm and 380 lb.- ft. ( 515 Nm ) at 4,200 rpm in trucks with GVWRs up to 10,000 pounds .
It is rated at an estimated 322 horsepower ( 240 kW ) at 4,400 rpm and 380 lb. - ft. of torque ( 515 Nm ) at 4,200 rpm in trucks with GVWRs greater than 10,000 pounds .
The 6L90 is enhanced for greater strength , smoothness and quietness via : • Adding four attachment bosses to the transfer case adapter ( 4WD models ) for increased strength and smoother , quieter performance •
Increasing the cross section size of the transfer case adapter for greater strength •
Adding a new , stronger output shaft •
Adding a new heat shield and vent hose . :
Ford 's new Super Duty models share the same transmission between their gas and diesel engines .
Sierra HDs ' Allison 1000 and Hydra -Matic 6L90 transmission were developed for the specific horsepower , torque and operating range differences that distinguish the diesel and gas engines .
The standard four - wheel disc system is completely revamped to deliver smoother , more immediate and confident - feeling performance .
Four - wheel , four - channel ABS is standard on all single - rear - wheel models and a three - channel system is standard on dual - rear - wheel models .
The front and rear rotors are larger in diameter – 14 inches ( 355 mm ) – and width on all models to support their increased capacity , weight ratings and trailering ratings , while the calipers are stiffer and stronger .
The hydroboost brake booster calibration is revised for reduced pedal effort , and the travel of the pedal is also revised for a more comfortable , confident feel .
Larger wheel hub and bearing assemblies complement the new brake system , and the rear rotors attach to the wheel hubs for easier servicing .
A new standard feature on Duramax - equipped models is the ' smart ' exhaust brake .
This driver - selectable feature uses the turbine control of the variable geometry turbocharger and the compression of the engine to generate backpressure , slowing the vehicle without applying the brakes .
It is integrated with the cruise control feature and varies the braking to account for the grade and vehicle load .
The exhaust brake allows for virtually effortless driving and towing , with seamless and quiet operation .
It also helps prolong brake life and prevents overheating the brakes on long , downhill grades .
The 2011 Sierra 2500HD and 3500 HD models have a comprehensive roster of safety features and functional technologies that include : • StabiliTrak electronic stability control system on all single - rear - wheel models •
Larger , four - wheel disc brakes with standard four - wheel ABS •
A new high - strength steel tubular frame cross member that enhances safety and improves crashworthiness •
Seat pelvic / thorax and head curtain side air bags available on 2500HD • Available rear backup camera• Segment - exclusive OnStar 9.0 •
Trailer sway control system on all single - rear - wheel models •
Hill start assist ( standard on single - rear - wheel models ) The trailer sway control system provides an added measure of confidence when towing a trailer .
The system senses conditions of trailer sway and intervenes with braking and / or reduced engine power to bring the trailer under control and keep it on its intended path .
The system uses electric trailer brakes when a trailer is plugged into the standard wiring harness of the truck and its performance requires no input from the driver .
The hill start assist system is automatically engaged when sensors detect the vehicle is on a grade of about 5 percent or greater .
It holds the brakes for about 1.5 seconds or until the gas pedal is pressed , preventing rollback – it is particularly effective when towing , giving the driver time to switch from the brake pedal to the gas pedal without rolling .
For 2011 , the Sierra heavy - duty lineup expands to include 11 2500 HD models and eight single - and dual - rear - wheel 3500HD models – including a new 3500HD Crew Cab with a 6.5 - foot cargo box .
Other models are offered in WT , SLE and SLT trim levels , while popular features such as the EZ Lift tailgate and rearview camera system are retained .
From the available remote starting feature to the unimpeded access offered by the 170 - degree - opening rear access doors on extended cab models , the 2011 Sierra HD models reflect the professional grade blend of refinement and functionality for which GMC is known .
The interiors have excellent attention to detail and are quieter – thanks to the range of the truck 's enhancements .
The stronger chassis , quieter Duramax engine and even details like a quieter power steering pump contribute to the Sierra HD delivering exceptional quietness .
Along with quietness , Sierra HD models are designed for work .
The interiors feature numerous storage compartments , providing covered access for everything from work gloves to laptops .
For those who use their truck as a mobile office , Sierra HDs deliver with available mobile WiFi , ÚSB connectivity , Bluetooth connectivity , XM Satellite Radio and a navigation system .
Multiple charge points enable multiple electronic devices to operate simultaneously ; and when equipped with the available navigation system , XM NavTraffic offers real - time updates of traffic conditions ( in selected areas ) that can help plan the most effective route to the job site .
The 2011 Sierra HDs drive farther without stopping to refuel .
( concept carz )
A new , 36 - gallon ( 136 L ) fuel tank is standard on all models and , with the improved fuel efficiency of the powertrains , enables a cruising range of about 680 miles ( 1,090 km ) with the Duramax 6.6L .
Cold - weather customers will appreciate the Duramax 6.6L 's quick , reliable start - up , with a starting time on par with gas engines .
Its glow plug cycle time is the segment 's best in all temperatures , taking no more than 3 seconds in temperatures as low as - 20 F ( - 29 C ) .
There 's also a cab heat - up feature that allows the engine to idle faster in low temperatures to warm the interior more quickly .
All 2011 Sierra 2500HD and 3500 HD trucks work under the best warranty coverage in America : a five - year / 100,000 - mile limited powertrain warranty , plus roadside assistance , courtesy transportation and other features that provide assurance that GMC backs its trucks for everything the road offers .

Overview
This tutorial grounds you in the basic Linux techniques for process management .
Learn to :
Manage foreground and background jobs
Start processes that will run after you log out
Monitor processes
Select and sort processes for display
Send signals to processes
Multitask in a terminal window
Do more at the same time
If you stop and reflect for a moment , it ’s pretty obvious that lots of things are running on your computer besides the terminal programs we ’ve been discussing in earlier tutorials in this series .
Indeed , if you are using a graphical desktop , you might have opened more than one terminal window at a time , or perhaps opened a file browser , Internet browser , game , spreadsheet , or other application .
Previously , our examples have shown commands entered at a terminal window .
The command runs and you wait for it to complete before you do anything else .
In this tutorial , you learn how to do more than one thing at a time using your terminal window .
About this series
This series of tutorials helps you learn Linux system administration tasks .
You can also use the material in these tutorials to prepare for the Linux Professional Institute ’s LPIC - 1 : Linux Server Professional Certification exams .
See “ Learn Linux , 101 : A roadmap for LPIC - 1 ” for a description of and link to each tutorial in this series .
The roadmap is in progress and reflects the version 4.0 objectives of the LPIC - 1 exams as updated April 15th , 2015 .
As tutorials are completed , they are added to the roadmap .
This tutorial helps you prepare for Objective 103.5 in Topic 103 of the Linux Server Professional ( LPIC - 1 ) exam 101 .
The objective has a weight of 4 .
Prerequisites
To get the most from the tutorials in this series , you should have a basic knowledge of Linux and a working Linux system on which you can practice the commands covered in this tutorial .
Sometimes different versions of a program format output differently , so your results might not always look exactly like the listings and figures shown here .
Unless otherwise noted , the examples in this tutorial use Fedora 22 , with a 4.0.4 kernel .
Your results on other systems might differ .
Manage foreground and background jobs
When you run a command in your terminal window , you are running it in the foreground .
Most such commands run quickly , but suppose you are running a graphical desktop and would like a digital clock displayed on the desktop .
For now , let ’s ignore the fact that most graphical desktops already have one ; we ’re just using this as an example .
If you have the X Window System installed , you probably also have a graphical desktop and lots of cool graphical tools .
The X Window system has several utilities such as xclock and xeyes , but they do n’t always play well with modern desktops , so I illustrate using the cairo - clock application , which you can install using yum , dnf , or apt - get .
Start by opening a terminal window and running the command
‘ cairo - clock –seconds ’
The -- seconds option requests that a second hand be displayed , which makes our example easier to follow .
We also redirect some GTK + error messages that might otherwise appear to / dev/ null ( also known as the bit bucket ) .
You should see a clock like Figure 1 , and your terminal window should look like Listing 1 .
If you do n’t have cairo - clock or the X Window System , you ’ll see shortly how to create a poor man ’s digital clock with your terminal , so you might want to follow along for now and then retry these exercises with that clock .
Figure 1 . A graphical clock with cairo- clock

Unfortunately , your terminal window no longer has a prompt , so you really need to get control back .
Fortunately , the Bash shell has a suspend key : Ctrl-z .
Pressing this key combination gets you a terminal prompt again as shown in Listing 2 .
Listing 2 . Suspending cairo - clock with Ctrl-z [ ian@atticf20 ~ ] $ cairo‑clock ‑‑seconds 2>/ dev/null ^ Z [ 1 ] +

The clock is still on your desktop , but it has stopped running .
Suspending it did exactly that .
In fact , if you drag another window over part of it , that part of the clock might not even redraw .
Notice the terminal output message indicating [ 1 ] +
Stopped .
The 1 in this message is a job number .
You can restart the clock by typing fg % 1 fg % 1 .
You could also use the command name or part of it by typing fg % cairo - clock fg % cairo - clock or fg %? clo fg %?clo .
Finally , if you just type fg with no parameters , you can restart the most recently stopped job , job 1 in this case .
Restarting it with fg also brings the job right back to the foreground , and you no longer have a shell prompt .
What you need to do is place the job in the background ; a bg command takes the same type of job specification as the fg command and does exactly that .
Listing 3 shows how to bring the cairo - clock job back to the foreground and suspend it using two forms of the fg command .
You can suspend it again and place it in the background ; the clock continues to run while you do other work at your terminal .
Listing 3 . Placing cairo - clock in the foreground or background [ ian@atticf20 ~ ] $ fg % 1 cairo‑clock ‑‑seconds 2 > / dev/null ^ Z [ 1 ] +
Stopped cairo‑clock ‑‑seconds 2 > / dev/null [ ian@atticf20 ~ ] $ fg %?clo cairo‑clock ‑‑seconds 2 > / dev/null ^ Z [ 1 ] +
Stopped cairo‑clock ‑‑seconds 2 > / dev/null [ ian@atticf20 ~ ] $ bg [ 1 ] + cairo‑clock ‑‑seconds
2 > / dev/null & Show more

Using “ & ”
You might have noticed that when you placed the cairo - clock job in the background , the message no longer said “ Stopped ” and that it was terminated with an ampersand ( & ) .
In fact , you do n’t need to suspend the process to place it in the background at all ; just append an ampersand to the command and the shell starts the command ( or command list ) in the background .
Let ’s start cairo - clock with an antique theme using this method .
You should see a clock like that in Figure 2 and terminal output like Listing 4 .
Figure 2 .
An antique clock with cairo- clock

Notice that the message is slightly different this time .
It represents a job number and a process id ( PID ) .
I cover PIDs and more about status in a moment .
For now , let ’s use the jobs command to find out what jobs are running .
Add the -l option to list PIDs , and you see that job 2 indeed has PID 4320 as shown in Listing 5 .
Note also that job 2 has a plus sign (+ ) beside the job number , indicating that it is the current job .
This job comes to the foreground if no job specification is given with the fg command .
Listing 5 . Displaying job and process information [ ian@atticf20 ~ ] $ jobs ‑l [ 1 ] ‑

Before I address some other issues related to background jobs , let ’s create a poor man ’s digital clock .
We use the sleep command to cause a delay for two seconds , and use the date command to print the current date and time .
We wrap these commands in a while loop with a do / done block to create an infinite loop .
Finally , we put the whole lot in parentheses to make a command list and put the entire list in the background using an ampersand .
You learn more about how to build more complex commands using loops and scripting in later tutorials of this series .
See our series roadmap for a description of and link to each tutorial in the series .
Listing 6 .

Our list is running as job 3 with PID 6717 .
Every two seconds , the date command runs , and a date and time are printed on the terminal .
The input that you type is highlighted .
A slow typist has characters interspersed with several lines of output before a full command can be typed .
In fact , notice how the ‘ f ’ ‘ g ’ that you type in to bring the command list to the foreground are a couple of lines apart .
When you finally get the fg command entered , bash displays the command that is now running in your shell , namely , the command list , which is still happily printing the time every two seconds .
Once you succeed in getting the job into the foreground , you can either terminate ( or kill ) it , or take some other action , In this case , let ’s use Ctrl -c to terminate our ‘ clock . ’
Standard IO and background processes
The output from the date command in our previous example is interspersed with echoed characters for the fg command that we are trying to type .
This raises an interesting issue .
What happens to a background process if it needs input from stdin ?
The terminal process under which we start a background application is called the controlling terminal .
Unless redirected elsewhere , the stdout and stderr streams from the background process are directed to the controlling terminal .
Similarly , the background task expects input from the controlling terminal , but the controlling terminal has no way of directing any characters you type to the stdin of a background process .
In such a case , the Bash shell suspends the process , so that it is no longer executing .
You can bring it to the foreground and supply the necessary input .
Listing 7 illustrates a simple case where you can put a command list in the background .
After a moment , press Enter and see the message that the process has stopped .
Bring it to the foreground and provide a line of input followed by Ctrl -d to signal end of input file .
The command list completes and you display the file we created .
Listing 7 . Waiting for stdin [ ian@atticf20 ~ ] $ ( date ; cat ‑ > bginput.txt ; date ) & [ 3 ]
6877 Mon Jun 15 16:45:35 EDT 2015 [ 3 ] +

You might wonder why this job is job 3 .
With the poor mans clock terminated , there were only two cairo - clock jobs running , which were jobs number 1 and 2 .
So the next available job number was assigned , and our background input job became job 3 .
Run a process after log out
In practice , you probably want to have standard IO streams for background processes redirected to or from a file .
There is another related question : what happens to the process if the controlling terminal closes or the user logs off ?
The answer depends on the shell in use .
If the shell sends a SIGHUP ( or hangup ) signal , then the application is likely to close .
I cover signals shortly , but for now , we ’ll consider another way around this problem .
nohup
The nohup command is used to start a command that ignores hangup signals and appends stdout and stderr to a file .
The default file is either nohup.out or $ HOME / nohup.out .
If the file cannot be written , then the command does not run .
If you want output to go somewhere else , redirect stdout , or stderr as discussed in the tutorial “ Learn Linux 101 : Streams , pipes and redirects . ”
The nohup command will not execute a pipeline or a command list .
You can save a pipeline or list in a file and then run it using the sh ( default shell ) or the bash command .
Another tutorial in this series shows you how to make the script file executable , but for now we ’ll stick to running scripts by using the sh or the bash command .
Listing 8 shows how we might do this for our poor man ’s digital clock .
Needless to say , having the time written to a file is n’t particularly useful , and the file will keep growing , so we ’ll set the clock to update every 30 seconds instead of every second .
Listing 8 .
Using nohup with a command list in a script [ ian@atticf20 ~ ] $ echo " while sleep 30 ; do date ; done " > pmc.sh [ ian@atticf20 ~ ] $ nohup sh pmc.sh& [ 3 ] 6955 [ ian@atticf20 ~ ] $ nohup : ignoring input and appending output to ‘ nohup.out ’ [ ian@atticf20 ~ ] $ nohup bash pmc.sh& [ 4 ] 6970 nohup : ignoring input and appending output to ‘ nohup.out ’

If we display the contents of nohup.out , we see output lines from the two nohup commands we are running interspersed , with each line approximately 30 seconds after the one that is two lines above it , as shown in Listing 9 .
Listing 9 . Output from nohup processes [ ian@atticf20 ~ ] $ cat nohup.out Mon Jun 15 17:02:24 EDT 2015 Mon Jun 15 17:02:43 EDT 2015 Mon Jun 15 17:02:54 EDT 2015 Mon Jun 15 17:03:13 EDT 2015 Mon Jun 15 17:03:24 EDT 2015 Mon Jun 15 17:03:43 EDT

Older versions of nohup did not write a status message to the controlling terminal , so if you made a mistake , you might not immediately know .
Suppose you redirect both stdout and stderr to a file of your own choosing , and suppose you decide that it would be easier to source the command using .
rather than typing sh or bash .
Listing 10 shows what happens if you use nohup as we did before , but redirect both stdout and stderr .
After you enter the command , you see the message indicating that job 4 has started with PID 5853 .
If you do n’t immediately see the message saying that the job has terminated with exit code 126 , press Enter again , and you should see it .
Listing 10 .
Making mistakes with nohup [ ian@atticf20 ~ ] $ nohup .

Listing 11 shows the contents of mynohup.out .
Not surprising , really .
You use nohup to run a command in the background , and you use source (. ) to run read commands from a file and run them in the current shell .
The important thing to remember about this is that you might have to press Enter to allow the shell to display the background job exit status , and you might have to look at nohup ’s output file to see what really went wrong .
Listing 11 .

Now let ’s turn our attention to the status of our processes .
If you are following along and planning to take a break at this point , please stay around as you now have two jobs that are creating ever larger files in your file system .
You can use the fg command to bring each , in turn , to foreground , and then use Ctrl -c to terminate it , but if you let them run for a little longer , you ’ll see other ways to monitor and interact with them .
Monitor processes
Earlier , I gave a brief introduction to the jobs command and you saw how to use it to list the Process IDs ( or PIDs ) of our jobs .
ps
There is another command , the ps command , which we use to display various pieces of process status information .
Remember “ ps ” as an acronym for “ process status . ”
The ps command accepts zero or more PIDs as arguments and displays the associated process status .
If we use the jobs command with the -p option , the output is simply the PID of the process group leader for each job .
We ’ll use this output as arguments to the ps command as shown in Listing 12 .
Listing 12 .
Status of background processes [ ian@atticf20 ~ ] $ jobs ‑p 6250 6268 6955 6970 [ ian@atticf20 ~ ] $ ps $ ( jobs ‑p ) PID TTY STAT TIME COMMAND 6250 pts/1

Sl 3:42 cairo‑clock ‑‑seconds ‑‑theme antique 6955 pts/1 S 0:00 sh pmc.sh 6970 pts/1 S 0:00 bash pmc.sh Show more Show more icon
If you use ps with no options , you see a list of processes that have your terminal as their controlling terminal as shown in Listing 13 .
Notice that the pmc.sh commands do not show up in this list .
You ’ll see why in a moment .
Listing 13 .
Displaying status with ps [ ian@atticf20 ~ ] $ ps PID TTY TIME CMD 4111 pts/1 00:00:00 bash 6250 pts/1 00:02:36 cairo‑clock 6268 pts/1 00:03:46 cairo‑clock 6955 pts/1 00:00:00 sh 6970 pts/1 00:00:00 bash 7218 pts/1 00:00:00 sleep 7221 pts/1 00:00:00 sleep 7222 pts/1 00:00:00 ps

Several options , including -f ( full ) , -j ( jobs ) , and -l ( long ) give control of how much information is displayed .
If you do not specify any PIDs , then another useful option is the -- forest option , which displays the commands in a tree hierarchy , showing which process has which other process as a parent .
In particular , you see that the sleep commands of the previous listing are children of the scripts you have running in background .
If you happened to run the command at a different instant , you might see the date command listed in the process status instead , but the odds are very small with this script .

Now that you have some basic tools for monitoring your processes using the jobs and ps commands , let ’s take a brief look at two other monitoring commands before moving on to other ways to select and sort processes for display .
free
The free command displays the amount of free and used memory in your system .
By default the display is in kilobytes , but you can override this using - b for bytes , -k for kilobytes , -m for megabytes , or -g for gigabytes .
The -t option displays a total line , and the -s option along with a value refreshes the info with the frequency specified .
The number is in seconds but might be a floating point value .
Listing 15 shows two examples .
Listing 15 .

uptime
The uptime command shows you a one - line display that includes the current time , how long the system has been running , how many users are currently logged on , and the system load averages for the past 1 , 5 , and 15 minutes .
Listing 16 shows an example .
Listing 16 .

Select and sort processes for display
Using ps
The ps commands discussed so far only list processes that were started from your terminal session ( note the SID , or session id , column in the second example of Listing 14 ) .
To see all the processes with controlling terminals , use the - a option .
The -x option displays processes without a controlling terminal , and the -e option displays information for every process .
You ’ll find if you run this on a system where you or anyone else is logged in on a graphical desktop that you will have a lot of output .
Listing 17 shows the full ( - f ) format for all the processes with a controlling terminal on two different systems ( Ubuntu 15 and Fedora 22 ) .
For the second system , we ’ve truncated the output but then showed how many lines of output there really were .
I suspect there is a bug in Fedora 22 in that a daemon process should normally detach from its controlling terminal , so we should not be seeing daemon processes in this output .
Listing 17 .

Note the controlling terminal listed in the TTY column .
For the Fedora 22 part of this listing , I switched to an ssh login ( pts / 5 ) , so the ps - af ps - af command is running under pts / 5 , while most of the commands created for this tutorial are running under pts/1 .
There are many more options for ps , including a number that provide significant control over what fields are displayed and how they are displayed .
Others provide control over the selection of processes for display , for example , by selecting those processes for a particular user ( -u ) or a particular command ( - C ) .
In Listing 18 , user jenni finds all processes running the bash command ; we use the -o option to specify the columns that are displayed .
We ’ve added the user option to the normal list that you get with just plain ps , so you can see which user runs bash .
Listing 18 .

Sometimes you might want to sort the output by particular fields , and you can do that too using the -- sort option to specify the sort fields .
The default is to sort in ascending order ( + ) , but you can also specify descending order ( - ) .
Listing 19 shows the final ps example where all processes are listed using the jobs format , and the output is sorted by session id and command name .
For the first , we use the default sort order , and for the second , we specify both sort orders explicitly .
Listing 19 .

pgrep
Another useful command , albeit with fewer options , is the pgrep command , which allows you to use a regular expression to search for processes by name .
The - a option also prints the command line and the -f option matches against the full command line .
An example is shown in Listing 20 searching for our clock processes .
Listing 20 .
Using pgrep to find clock processes [ ian@atticf20 ~ ] $ pgrep iro # Fedora 22 6250 6268 [ ian@atticf20 ~ ] $ pgrep ‑af " i.* seconds " 6250 cairo‑clock ‑‑seconds 6268 cairo‑clock ‑‑seconds ‑‑theme antique Show more Show more icon
As usual , see the man pages for ps and pgrep for full details on the many options and fields you can specify .
Using top
If you run ps several times in a row to see what is changing , you probably need the top command instead .
It displays a continuously updated process list , along with useful summary information .
Listing 21 shows the first few lines of a top display .
Use the q subcommand to quit top .
Listing 21 .

Send signals to processes
Let ’s now look at Linux signals , which are an asynchronous way to communicate with processes .
We have already mentioned the SIGHUP signal , and we have used both Ctrl-c and Ctrl-z , which are other ways of sending a signal to processes .
The general way to send a signal is with the kill command .
You can also use the pkill or killall commands to signal multiple processes with one command .
Sending signals using kill
The kill command sends a signal to a specified job or process .
Listing 23 shows the use of the SIGTSTP and SIGCONT signals to stop and resume a background job .
Using the SIGTSTP signal is equivalent to using the fg command to bring the job to the foreground and then Ctrl-z to suspend it .
Using SIGCONT is like using the bg command .
Listing 23 .
Stopping and restarting background jobs [ ian@atticf20 ~ ] $ kill ‑s SIGTSTP %1 [ 1 ] +
Stopped cairo‑clock ‑‑seconds 2 > / dev/null [ ian@atticf20 ~ ] $ jobs ‑l [ 1 ] +
6250 Stopped cairo‑clock ‑‑seconds 2 > / dev/null [ 2 ]

We used the job specification ( %1 ) to stop the cairo - clock process in this example , and then the process id ( PID ) to restart ( continue ) it .
If you stopped job % 2 and then used tail with the -f option to follow the nohup output file nohup.out , you would see that only one process is updating the file .
There are a number of other possible signals that you can display on your system using kill -l kill -l .
Some are used to report errors such as illegal operation codes , floating point exceptions , or attempts to access memory that a process does not have access to .
Notice that signals have both a number , such as 20 , and a name , such as SIGTSTP .
You can use either the number prefixed by a – sign , or the -s option and the signal name .
On my system , I could have used kill - 20 kill - 20 instead of kill -s SIGTSTP kill -s SIGTSTP .
You should always check the signal numbers on your system before assuming which number belongs to which signal .
Signal handlers and process termination
You have seen that Ctrl -c terminates a process .
In fact , it sends a SIGINT ( or interrupt ) signal to the process .
If you use kill without any signal name , it sends a SIGTERM signal .
For most purposes , these two signals are equivalent .
You also saw that the nohup command makes a process immune to the SIGHUP signal .
In general , a process can implement a signal handler to catch signals .
So a process could implement a signal handler to catch either SIGINT or SIGTERM .
Because the signal handler knows what signal was sent , it might choose to ignore SIGINT and only terminate when it receives SIGTERM , for example .
Listing 24 shows how to send the SIGTERM signal to job % 1 using the kill and the send the SIGTERM ( default ) signal to the other cairo - clock process using part of the command name as a pattern .
Notice that the process status shows as “ Terminated ” right after we send the signal .
This would show as “ Interrupt ” if we used SIGINT instead .
After a few moments , the process cleanup has occurred and the job no longer shows in the job list .
Finally , we send the SIGHUP signal to all of our processes that are running the sleep command .
Because this is what pmc.sh does most of the time , this is what we find if we use pgrep to look for processes running sleep .
Not surprisingly , the processes keep right on running , because we started them with the intention that they would ignore the SIGHUP signal .
Listing 24 .
Terminating a process with SIGTERM [ ian@atticf20 ~ ] $ kill ‑s SIGTERM %1 [ 1 ]
Terminated cairo‑clock ‑‑seconds 2 > / dev/null [ ian@atticf20 ~ ] $ pkill cairo [ 2 ]
Terminated cairo‑clock ‑‑seconds ‑‑theme antique 2 > / dev/null [ ian@atticf20 ~ ] $ pgrep ‑a sleep ; pkill ‑‑signal SIGHUP sleep ; jobs ‑l 13628 sleep 30 13631 sleep 30 [ 3 ] ‑ 6955 Running nohup sh pmc.sh & [ 4 ] +
6970 Running nohup bash pmc.sh & Show more

Signal handlers give a process great flexibility .
A process can do its normal work and be interrupted by a signal for some special purpose .
Besides allowing a process to catch termination requests and take possible action such as closing files or checkpointing transactions in progress , signals are often used to tell a daemon process to reread its configuration file and possibly restart operation .
You might do this for the inetd process when you change network parameters , or the line printer daemon ( lpd ) when you add a new printer .
Terminating processes unconditionally
Some signals cannot be caught , such as some hardware exceptions .
SIGKILL , the most likely one you will use , cannot be caught by a signal handler and unconditionally terminates a process .
In general , you should need this only if all other means of terminating the process have failed .
Logout and nohup
Remember you saw that using nohup would allow your processes to keep running after you log out .
Well , let ’s do that and then log back in again .
After you log back in , check your remaining poor man ’s clock process using jobs as we have done above .
The output is shown in Listing 25 .
Listing 25 .
Logging back in [ ian@atticf20 ~ ] $ jobs ‑l Show more Show more icon
There is no sign of our jobs !
Not perhaps what we were expecting .
However , all is not lost .
Suppose you ca n’t remember whether you terminated the nohup job that you started with bash or the one you started with sh .
You saw previously how to find the processes that were running the bash command , so you can use the same trick to display just the SID , PID , PPID , and command string .
Then you can use the - js option to display all the processes in the session using the SID ( Session ID ) value .
Listing 26 shows the result .
Think about other ways you might have found these processes , such as searching by username and then filtering using grep .
Listing 26 .

Note that the pmc.sh is still running but now it has a question mark (? ) for the controlling TTY .
Given what you have now learned about killing processes , you should be able to kill the remaining poor man ’s clock processes using their PIDs and the kill command .
There is one more command we ’ll introduce for killing processes , the killall command , which has many parameters in common with pgrep and pkill .
Unfortunately it does not identify our processes by the pmc.sh name , so we ’ll just use it to kill all the sleep commands .
This is used here solely for illustration ; selecting one command from a running shell script is NOT generally a good way to find a particular set of processes .
You might accidentally kill something totally unrelated .
Using killall would have been more appropriate for killing the cairo - clock processes , but we already killed those .

Multiplexing with the screen command
When you have to administer several systems , you often log in to one using an SSH terminal session .
While there , you can start a long running job and forget about nohup .
When you log out , your work goes away .
At other times , you might be doing something and wish you had another window to look at a related or unrelated issue .
You could start another SSH session , or you could use the screen command , which is a full - screen window manager that multiplexes a physical terminal between several processes .
You can disconnect from a remote system and then reconnect later , leaving your processes running while you are away .
Type screen to start the screen program .
Your terminal window clears and you are now running in the screen environment .
You wo n’t see much difference from a regular terminal , except that you now use Ctrl - a ( hold Ctrl key while pressing lowercase ‘ a ’ key ) .
to interact with screen itself rather than the shell .
You can then enter commands that screen understands , for example ?
to get help .
We ’ve illustrated how the screen appears in Figure 3 and shown the second page of help in Listing 28 .
From now on , we ’ll just use the more accessible code listings to illustrate .
Note :
If the screen command is not on your system , you might need to install the screen package .
See the developerWorks roadmap for LPIC - 1 for topics on package installation .

We ’ll now restart our poor man ’s clock script and let it run for a few moments , then disconnect from the screen using Ctrl - a and then d as shown in Listing 29 .
We ’ll use ^a for Ctrl -a in listings for the remainder of this section .

Now we ’ll move over to my Ubuntu 15.04 system in another office ( or at home as the case might be ) and ssh back into atticf20 to see how the command is progressing .
We reconnect to the disconnected screen session using the -r option as shown in Listing 30 .
You can see that is has continued to run , even while we were disconnected from the screen command .
In this case , we ’ll also terminate the command using Ctrl-c .
Note that we are still under the control of screen ; the only thing that was terminated was the running pmc.sh command .

So far , we ’ve seen only one running screen command .
We ’ve seen how to open multiple virtual screens and cycle between them .
And we saw how to reconnect using the -r option of screen .
But how do you reconnect if you have multiple copies of screen running ?
The first thing to note is that the disconnect command .
( Ctrl - a d shown in Listing 29 said we were disconnecting from “ 21657.pts-8.atticf20 ” . )
The 21657 part is actually the PID of the screen command ’s process .
and you can reconnect using -r and also the value 21657 .
Because PIDs are n’t very user friendly , you can also start screen with the - S option and a more friendly name .
The - ls option gives you a list of running screen copies that you can reconnect to .
You cannot reconnect to a screen that is already in Attached state , only to one that is in Detached state .
I show some examples in Listing 31 .

You can explore the many other possibilities of the screen command using the man pages .
It is also possible to share your screen with other users , for example in a class setting or for help purposes ,
This requires setting the suid bit on the screen command ’s binary file and is beyond the scope of this tutorial .
You can probably find helpful tips on the Internet if you want to do this as the man pages do not fully explain it .

Sarah Killen , the " someone " Conan " decided to follow at random , " got 17,000 follows , a wedding dress , shoes , an iMac , and raised $ 2600 for cancer .
She also appears to be unaware that Conan is no longer on TV .
Popeater interviewed Killen — or @LovelyButton , as she is known on Twitter — who says that , before he followed her , Conan wrote to ask if it was OK .
If you could send Conan O'Brien a personal message , what would you like to tell him ?
I 'd tell him that he 's changed my life .
Even if the hype stopped now , the last couple days have changed the rest of my life .
Have you been getting any other swag ?
We have an iMac computer now .
A guy from Hornblasters , a Florida - based online retailer , contacted us and gave us the brand new iMac ...
I 've also been getting lots of donations for the 3 - Day Walk for the Cure , which helps raise money for breast cancer research ...
I was going to do the walk and did n't know how I would raise all this money .
I got $ 2,600 in a couple days .
You started with three fans before he followed you , correct ?
Yeah .
Three followers .
Now I 'm up to 16,000 + in just a few days .
Such is the power of fame , even when it 's secondary .
Sarah 's upcoming wedding just got a big upgrade , and she is inviting Conan .
I 'm getting married on September 25 , and we did n't know if we would be able to afford it .
Now I 'm getting custom made shoes and a dress from Kelima in New York .
They offered a gown in exchange for promoting their favorite charity , the Children 's Hunger Fund .
We 're getting a limo , Classic Creations is giving us wedding bands and there 's a vineyard in California sending us wine .
We 've got it all covered now ...
Is Conan invited to your wedding ?
Absolutely .
My fiance wants Conan to be his best man .
That would be really cool .
And hey , if he wants us to come on his show , we 'd get married on there .
That would be fantastic .
I 'm not sure who should break the news about Conan 's show to Sarah .

The mismanagement of human waste is a serious health problem for the 2.6 billion people who do n't have regular access to toilets .
In fact , in the slums of Kenya , waste management is so haphazard that residents dispose of feces - filled plastic bags by simply flinging the bags away without concern about where they land .
And it was discovering those flying sacks of waste that inspired Anders Wilhelmson to invent the PeePoo , a chemically treated toilet bag that sterilizes human waste and converts it to fertilizer , all for only two or three cents .
Researchers from the University of Cádiz ( UCA ) have studied the connection between professional preferences and personality , based on interviews and questionnaires carried out on 735 secondary school students from the province of Cadiz .
The results indicate that personality does not have an influence when choosing a professional career .
" The data shows us that there is no strong relationship between the choice of university degree ( vocation ) and personality traits .
As a result the use of personality questionnaires in career guidance processes will have to be reconsidered and taken as relevant information , " says Manuel Antonio García Sedeño , main researcher of the study and professor of Evolutionary and Educational Psychology at UCA .
The participants in the study which the journal Psychological Reports recently published were selected during the academic year 2004 - 2005 through a random teacher in the province of Cadiz .
In total , 735 students from the 4th year of ESO ( Educación Secundaria Obligatoria , Compulsory Secondary Education ) , of which 371 were boys ( 50.5 % ) and 364 girls ( 49.5 % ) of between 17 and 20 years old .
To discover the schoolchildren 's vocational factors the ' Kuder - C ' questionnaire was used , which evaluates their professional interests according to 10 different fields of work : outdoors , mechanical , arithmetic , scientific , persuasive , artistic , literary , musical , administrative and social assistance ; and which is aimed to help students to focus their training activities and choose a career .
The Cattell questionnaire was also used to evaluate personality factors and obtain results related to leadership ability and creativity , as well as a motivation fluctuation rate .
In addition , all the participants were asked to indicate what subjects they would like to study out of 52 university degrees .
This variable was given the name " Degree " and two different groups were created based on the preferences : Science / Technology and Humanities / Social Sciences .

Two of every three students do n't know what they want to do
" Two of every three young people at the age of starting university do n't have a clear idea of what to study , so useful information tools need to be provided , " García Sedeño points out .
The data obtained reconfirmed that " the sex of the individual is not an important variable in the connection between personality traits and general preference for topics studied at university . "
Social researchers link extroversion with mechanics , arithmetic and persuasion .
On the other hand , having strong determination has a negative link with the artistic factor .
The team states that the trait of independence is negatively linked with persuasive work and interest in social assistance .
Professional career development theories are being revised and are grouped under the concepts of ' professional maturity ' ( the capacity for making decisions on life in general and in particular on careers ) and ' relevance ' ( the value that individuals attribute to each of the roles they play in their lives ) .
This study is part of a series of projects on professional guidance and motivation which the UCA research team has carried out .
LOS ANGELES ( MarketWatch ) --
A landmark measure to overhaul the nation 's health - care system took a bite out of some insurers on Monday but did n't seem to hurt others in the industry , as the sector was generally up and helped push the broader equities market higher .
The NYSE Healthcare Index NYP.ID , +1.42 % was up 40.55 points to 6,535.43 .
Health - care companies in the S&P 500 at one point were the biggest gainers , and it was the only sector in the black early on , helping stocks climb in afternoon trading .
S&P pharmaceuticals were the biggest gainers as they are expected to be a big winner in health - care reform .
Five of the nation 's six biggest insurers traded down , reversing course after many started the day higher .
Shares of two big Medicare beneficiaries -- HealthNet Inc. HNT and Humana Inc. HUM , +3.08 % -- were down more than 1 % , amid concerns of cuts in the government 's insurance program for seniors .
Meanwhile , UnitedHealth Group Inc. UNH , +2.50 % , the nation 's biggest insurer , lost 3.2 % .
WellPoint Inc. WLP was down 1 % .
Cigna Inc. CI , +3.10 % and Aetna Inc. AET , were the only gainers among the major firms , both up marginally .
Some minor insurers made bigger moves up , with Centene Corp. CNC , +4.42 % leading the way .
The company 's shares were up more than 10.6 % in the wake of a Friday announcement that the company 's debt received an upgrade from Moody 's Investors Service .
But the company undoubtedly also benefited from its status as a Medicaid provider , and the expected increase in benefits for firms handling those accounts .
A ratings upgrade also helped Amerigroup Inc. AGP , +1.94 % , shares of which moved up 4.3 % after Barclays Capital raised its rating to buy from hold .
And Molina Healthcare MOH , +6.54 % climbed 4.5 % .
In other sectors , hospital operator Health Management Associates HMA jumped 11.3 % leading a rally for the hospital - nursing home sector .
Tenet Healthcare Inc. THC , +4.34 % was close behind , up more than 9 % .
A number of players in this sector made sizable gains , as hospitals may get the biggest relief from the health - care plan .
The plan is geared to cut down on the uninsured , which should help hospitals ' bottom line .
Also rising was Community Health Systems Inc. CYH , +1.93 % , rallying 6.2 % , and LifePoint Hospitals LPNT , jumping 5.8 % .
Medical - device makers rose markedly as well , due mostly to favorable reviews from analysts as well as positive company news .
Shares of Medtronic Inc. MDT , +1.19 % rose 2.3 % after a clinical trial proved that a catheter - based fibrillation system proved more effective than anti-arrhythimia drugs .
He was a little early for breakfast .
An off - duty cop was arrested for drunken driving after he slammed his car into the front of Tiffany ’s flagship Fifth Avenue store at 3 a.m. today , police said .
The wreck happened as NYPD officer Raphael Ospina , 27 , a cop since 2004 , was heading east on 57th Street .
He collided with a private garbage truck that was heading in the opposite direction and making a left turn onto Fifth Avenue south .
Ospina ’s Chrysler 300 sedan , with two passengers inside , jumped a curb and hit the famous façade of the legendary jewelry store .
The impact was strong enough that the three occupants had to be cut out of the vehicle .
All were hospitalized .
One passenger suffered a broken arm , while the Ospina and second passenger got only minor bumps and bruises .
The garbage truck driver was uninjured .
Ospina is charged with vehicular assault and driving while intoxicated , police said .

" On the Internet , " one dog tells another in a classic New Yorker cartoon , " nobody knows you 're a dog . "
The internet is notorious for its digital dens of deception .
But on Facebook , what you see tends to be what you get – at least in one study of tailless , two - legged young adults .
College - age users of Facebook in the United States and a similar social networking site in Germany typically present accurate versions of their personalities in online profiles , says psychologist Mitja Back of Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz , Germany .
People use online social networking sites to express who they really are rather than idealized versions of themselves , Back and his colleagues conclude in an upcoming Psychological Science .
" Online social networks are so popular and so likely to reveal people 's actual personalities because they allow for social interactions that feel real in many ways , " Back says .
Back 's team administered personality inventories that evaluated 133 U.S. Facebook users and 103 Germans who used a comparable social - networking site .
Inventories focused on the extent to which volunteers endorsed ratings of extraversion , agreeableness , conscientiousness , emotional instability and openness to new experiences .
The subjects – who ranged in age from 17 to 22 – took the inventory twice , first with instructions to describe their actual personalities and then to portray idealized versions of themselves .
Then , undergraduate research assistants – nine in the United States and 10 in Germany – rated volunteers ' personalities after looking at their online profiles .
Those ratings matched volunteers ' actual personality descriptions better than their idealized ones , especially for extraversion and openness .
Facebook is so true to life , Back claims , that encountering a person there for the first time generally results in a more accurate personality appraisal than meeting face to face , going by the results of previous studies .
Adriana Manago , a psychology graduate student at UCLA , calls the new findings " compelling " but incomplete .
College students on Facebook and other online social networks often augment what they regard as their best personal qualities , Manago holds .
In her view , these characteristics are n't plumbed by broad personality measures like the ones measured in Back ’s study .
And students ' actual personality descriptions may have included enhancements of their real characteristics , thus inflating the correlation between observers ' ratings and students ' real personalities , Manago notes .
" Online profiles showcase an enhanced reflection of who the user really is , " Manago proposes .
In a 2008 study , she and her colleagues found that 23 college students sometimes used another online social networking site , MySpace , to enhance their images , say by Photoshopping acne out of a picture or posting a video of themselves driving a sports car at high speeds .
Still , the new findings make sense , remarks psychologist Sandra Calvert of Georgetown University in Washington , D.C.
She emphasizes that social - networking sites have fostered a new type of communication among teens and young adults , in which one person can create personal content that gets broadcast to a multitude of friends .
In a 2009 study of Facebook use among 92 college students , Calvert 's team found that young women reported a whopping average of 401 online friends , while young men reported an average of 269 .

The Limburg provincial government has no plans to introduce a ban on mega factory farms in the province .
news agency ANP reports on Tuesday .
Last week , the province of Brabant voted in favour of limiting the size of industrial farm buildings to 1.5 hectares , with a few exceptions in some areas .
‘ The decision in Brabant was about size .
Here , quality is central , ’ said provincial executive Ger Driessen .
Bigger farms are also economically necessary to improve quality , Driessen said .
In addition , he told ANP he did not believe factory farmers would try to move into Limburg because of the ban in Brabant .
Nevertheless , left - wing provincial councillors are planning to introduce a motion to ban mega farms in the province as well , ANP said .

An intro to modern OpenGL . Chapter 2.2 : Shaders
Buffers and textures contain the raw materials for an OpenGL program , but without shaders , they are inert lumps of bytes .
If you recall from our overview of the graphics pipeline , rendering requires a vertex shader , which maps our vertices into screen space , and a fragment shader , which colors in the rasterized fragments of the resulting triangles .
Shaders in OpenGL are written in a language called GLSL ( GL Shading Language ) , which looks a lot like C .
In this article , we 'll lay out the shader code for our " hello world " program and then write the C code to load , compile , and link it into OpenGL .
The vertex shader
Here is the GLSL source code for our vertex shader , from hello - gl.v.glsl :
#version 110 attribute vec2 position ; varying vec2 texcoord ; void main ( ) { gl_Position = vec4 ( position , 0.0 , 1.0 ) ; texcoord = position * vec2 ( 0.5 ) + vec2 ( 0.5 ) ; }
I 'll summarize what the shader does , then give a little more detail about the GLSL language .
The shader first assigns the vertex 's screen space position to gl_Position , a predefined variable that GLSL provides for the purpose .
In screen space , the coordinates ( –1 , – 1 ) and ( 1 , 1 ) correspond respectively to the lower - left and upper - right corners of the framebuffer ; since our vertex array 's vertices already trace that same rectangle , we can directly copy the x and y components from each vertex 's position value as it comes out of the vertex array .
gl_Position 's other two vector components are used in depth testing and perspective projection ; we 'll look at them closer next chapter when we get into 3d math .
For now , we just fill them with their identity values zero and one .
The shader then does some math to map our screen - space position s from screen space ( –1 to 1 ) to texture space ( 0 to 1 ) and assigns the result to the vertex 's texcoord .
Much like C , a GLSL shader starts executing from the main function , which in GLSL 's case takes no arguments and returns void .
GLSL borrows the C preprocessor syntax for its own directives .
The #version directive indicates the GLSL version of the following source code ; our #version declares that we 're using GLSL 1.10 .
( GLSL versions are pretty tightly tied to OpenGL versions ; 1.10 is the version that corresponds to OpenGL 2.0 . )
GLSL does away with pointers and most of C's sized numeric types , keeping only the bool , int , and float types in common , but it adds a suite of vector and matrix types up to four components in length .
The vec2 and vec4 types you see here are two - and four - component vectors of float s , respectively .
A type name can also be used as a constructor function for that type ; you can construct a vector from either a single scalar value , which will be repeated into all the components of the vector , or from a combination of vectors and scalars , whose components will be strung together to form a larger vector .
GLSL 's math operators and many of its builtin functions are defined on these vector types to do component - wise math .
In addition to numeric types , GLSL also supplies special sampler data types for sampling textures , which we 'll see in the fragment shader below .
These basic types can be aggregated into array and user - defined struct types .
A vertex shader communicates with the surrounding graphics pipeline using specially - declared global variables in the GLSL program .
Its inputs come from uniform variables , which supply values from the uniform state , and attribute variables , which supply per-vertex attributes from the vertex array .
The shader assigns its per-vertex outputs to varying variables .
GLSL predefines some varying variables to receive special outputs used by the graphics pipeline , including the gl_Position variable we used here .
The fragment shader
Now let 's look at the fragment shader source , from hello - gl.f.glsl :
In a fragment shader , some things change slightly .
varying variables become inputs here : Each varying variable in the fragment shader is linked to the vertex shader 's varying variable of the same name , and each invocation of the fragment shader receives a rasterized version of the vertex shader 's outputs for that varying variable .
Fragment shaders are also given a different set of predefined gl_* variables .
gl_FragColor is the most important , a vec4 to which the shader assigns the RGBA color value for the fragment .
The fragment shader has access to the same set of uniform s as the vertex shader , but cannot declare or access attribute variables .
Our fragment shader uses GLSL 's builtin texture2D function to sample the two textures from uniform state at texcoord .
It then calls the builtin mix function to combine the two texture values based on the current value of the uniform fade_factor : zero gives only the sample from the first texture , one gives only the second texture 's sample , and values in between give us a blend of the two .
Now that we 've looked over the GLSL shader code , let 's jump back into C and load the shaders into OpenGL .
Storing our shader objects
static struct { /* ... fields for buffer and texture objects */ GLuint vertex_shader , fragment_shader , program ; struct { GLint fade_factor ; GLint textures [ 2 ] ; } uniforms ; struct { GLint position ; } attributes ; GLfloat fade_factor ; } g_resources ;
First , let 's add some fields to our g_resources structure to hold the names of our shader objects and program object after we construct them .
Like buffers and textures , shader and program objects are named by GLuint handles .
We also add some fields to hold the integer locations that we 'll need to reference our shaders ' uniform and attribute variables .
Finally , we add a field to hold the floating - point value we 'll assign to the fade_factor uniform every frame .
Compiling shader objects
static GLuint make_shader ( GLenum type , const char * filename ) {
GLint length ; GLchar * source = file_contents ( filename , &length ) ; GLuint shader ; GLint shader_ok ; if ( ! source ) return 0 ;
OpenGL compiles shader objects from their GLSL source code and keeps the generated GPU machine code to itself .
There is no standard way to precompile a GLSL program into a binary — you build the shader from source every time .
Here we read our shader source out of a separate file , which lets us change the shader source without recompiling our C .
shader = glCreateShader ( type ) ; glShaderSource ( shader , 1 , ( const GLchar * * ) &source , &length ) ; free ( source ) ; glCompileShader ( shader ) ;
Shader and program objects deviate from the glGen - and - glBind protocol that buffer and texture objects follow .
Unlike buffer and texture functions , functions that operate on shaders and programs take the object 's integer name directly as an argument .
The objects do n't need to be bound to any target to be modified .
Here , we create a shader object by calling glCreateShader with the shader type ( either GL_VERTEX_SHADER or GL_FRAGMENT_SHADER ) .
We then supply an array of one or more pointers to strings of source code to glShaderSource , and tell OpenGL to compile the shader with glCompileShader .
This step is analogous to the compilation stage of a C build process ; a compiled shader object is akin to a .o or .obj file .
Just as in a C project , any number of vertex and fragment shader objects can be linked together into a working program , with each shader object referencing functions defined in the others of the same type , as long as the referenced functions all resolve and a main entry point is provided for both the vertex and fragment shaders .
glGetShaderiv ( shader , GL_COMPILE_STATUS , & shader_ok ) ; if ( ! shader_ok ) { fprintf ( stderr , " Failed to compile %s :
" , filename ) ; show_info_log ( shader , glGetShaderiv , glGetShaderInfoLog ) ; glDeleteShader ( shader ) ; return 0 ; } return shader ; }
Also just like a C program , a block of shader source code can fail to compile due to syntax errors , references to nonexistent functions , or type mismatches .
OpenGL maintains an info log for every shader object that contains errors or warnings raised by the GLSL compiler .
After compiling the shader , we need to check its GL_COMPILE_STATUS with glGetShaderiv .
If the compile fails , we display the info log using our show_info_log function and give up .
Here 's how show_info_log looks :
static void show_info_log ( GLuint object , PFNGLGETSHADERIVPROC
glGet__iv , PFNGLGETSHADERINFOLOGPROC
glGet__InfoLog ) {
GLint log_length ; char * log ; glGet__iv ( object , GL_INFO_LOG_LENGTH , &log_length ) ; log = malloc ( log_length ) ; glGet__InfoLog ( object , log_length , NULL , log ) ; fprintf ( stderr , " %s " , log ) ; free ( log ) ; }
We pass in the glGetShaderiv and glGetShaderInfoLog functions as arguments to show_info_log so we can reuse the function for program objects further on .
( Those PFNGL * function pointer type names are provided by GLEW . )
We use glGetShaderiv with the GL_INFO_LOG_LENGTH parameter to get the length of the info log , allocate a buffer to hold it , and download the contents using glGetShaderInfoLog .
Linking program objects
static GLuint make_program( GLuint vertex_shader , GLuint fragment_shader ) { GLint program_ok ; GLuint program = glCreateProgram ( ) ; glAttachShader ( program , vertex_shader ) ; glAttachShader ( program , fragment_shader ) ; glLinkProgram ( program ) ;
If shader objects are the object files of the GLSL build process , then program objects are the finished executables .
We create a program object using glCreateProgram , attach shader objects to be linked into it with glAttachShader , and set off the link process with glLinkProgram .
glGetProgramiv ( program , GL_LINK_STATUS , & program_ok ) ; if ( ! program_ok ) { fprintf ( stderr , " Failed to link shader program :
" ) ; show_info_log ( program , glGetProgramiv , glGetProgramInfoLog ) ; glDeleteProgram ( program ) ; return 0 ; } return program ; }
Of course , linking can also fail , due to functions being referenced but not defined , missing main s , fragment shaders using varying inputs not supplied by the vertex shader , and other reasons analogous to the reasons C programs fail to link .
We check the program 's GL_LINK_STATUS and dump its info log using show_info_log , this time using the program - specific glGetProgramiv and glGetProgramInfoLog functions .
Now we can fill in the last part of make_resources that compiles and links our shader program :
static int make_resources ( void ) { /* make buffers and textures ... */ g_resources.vertex_shader = make_shader ( GL_VERTEX_SHADER , " hello-gl.v.glsl " ) ; if ( g_resources.vertex_shader == 0 ) return 0 ; g_resources.fragment_shader = make_shader ( GL_FRAGMENT_SHADER , " hello-gl.f.glsl " ) ; if ( g_resources.fragment_shader == 0 ) return 0 ; g_resources.program = make_program ( g_resources.vertex_shader , g_resources.fragment_shader ) ; if ( g_resources.program == 0 ) return 0 ;
Looking up shader variable locations
g_resources.uniforms.fade_factor = glGetUniformLocation(g_resources.program , " fade_factor " ) ; g_resources.uniforms.textures [ 0 ] = glGetUniformLocation(g_resources.program , " textures [ 0 ] " ) ; g_resources.uniforms.textures [ 1 ] = glGetUniformLocation(g_resources.program , " textures [ 1 ] " ) ; g_resources.attributes.position = glGetAttribLocation(g_resources.program , " position " ) ; return 1 ; }
The GLSL linker assigns a GLint location to every uniform value and vertex shader attribute .
Structs and arrays of uniforms or attributes get further broken down , with each field getting its own location assigned .
When we render using the program , we 'll need to use these integer locations when we assign values to the uniform variables and when we map parts of the vertex array to attributes .
Here , we use the functions glGetUniformLocation and glGetAttribLocation to look up these locations , giving them the variable , struct field , or array element name as a string .
We then record those locations in our program 's g_resources struct .
With the program linked and the uniform and attribute locations on record , we are now ready to render using the program .
Next time , we render
I know I 've left you hanging these last couple parts without a complete , working program to run .
I 'll fix that in the next and final part of this chapter , when we write the code that will actually set the graphics pipeline in motion and render our scene .
The massive earthquake that struck Chile last month perceptibly shifted much of the country to the west .
The hardest hit city , Concepcion , “ jumped ” more than 3 metres toward the Pacific Ocean , according to researchers .
The 8.8 magnitude quake moved locations as far flung as the Falkland Islands and eastern Brazil .
Though Buenos Aires lies 1,290 km from the epicentre , it shifted as much as 4 cm .
Researchers determined the movements based on precise GPS readings taken before and 10 days after the Feb. 27th quake .
“ The Maule ( Chile ) earthquake will arguably become one of the , if not the most important , great earthquakes yet studied , ” University of Hawaii geophysicist Ben Brooks said in a release .
“ We now have modern , precise instruments to evaluate this event , and because the site abuts a continent , we will be able to obtain dense spatial sampling of the changes it caused .
“ As such , the event represents an unprecedented opportunity for the earth - science community if certain observations are made quickly and comprehensively . ”
It 's no secret that the iPhone has taxed AT&T 's network in densely populated areas , especially New York and San Francisco .
Reports of problems using iPhones at major tech conferences , like SXSWi , Macworld Expo , CES , and NAMM are not unusual .
The iPhone 's ease of use and focus on mobile media generally lead to higher data usage on average , but despite claims by AT&T Mobility CEO Ralph de la Vega , the amount of data being consumed is rarely the problem .
The issue has to do with how modern smartphones — beginning with the iPhone — save power by disconnecting from the network whenever possible .
Even though AT&T has made improvements to its network over the last couple of years — including moving towers to an 850M Hz spectrum that can more easily penetrate building walls , as well as upgrading to faster 7.2 M bps HSPA + protocols — those improvements have done little to stem the tide of complaints from consumers in larger urban areas .
Those users experience frequent dropped calls and an inability to make data connections , and in general they feel that service is spotty .
To make matters worse , AT&T has announced initiatives to add an even greater number of 3G data devices to its network , including Android smartphones , e-book readers , mobile data modems , and now the iPad .
Even if consumers are n't yet concerned about the effect of the increasing number of devices on the network , the FCC sure is .
" With the iPad pointing to even greater demand for mobile broadband on the horizon , " wrote FCC director of scenario planning for Omnibus Broadband Initiative Phil Bellaria , " we must ensure that network congestion does n't choke off a service that consumers clearly find so appealing or frustrate mobile broadband 's ability to keep us competitive in the global broadband economy . "
The fact that the US lags behind many other countries in both broadband capacity in general and wireless networks specifically is nothing new .
But the fact that almost all of the complaints from iPhone users come from the US suggests that AT&T 's network is at least partially to blame .
In fact , users in other countries have told Ars that they do n't experience the kinds of problems that US users often report .
Well , other countries except one .
Several users in the UK , almost all in London , reported issues that were very similar to what we 've heard from users in the US ( and experienced ourselves ) : frequent dropped calls , lack of voice mail notifications , inability to make or receive calls even when the signal looks strong , and inability to make data connections .
These problems were happening on the O2 network , which for several years was the UK 's only iPhone carrier .
The carrier apologized to its customers late last year for the spotty service as it trumpeted network improvements meant to address the issues .
An O2 employee contacted Ars to explain what caused the problem , and explained how newer smartphones are changing the assumptions that carriers use when configuring their network .
Good for the battery , but not so good for the network
The first problem that O2 encountered was that the iPhone uses more power saving features than previous smartphone designs .
Most devices that use data do so in short bursts — a couple e-mails here , a tweet there , downloading a voicemail message , etc .
Normally , devices that access the data network use an idling state that maintains the open data channel between the device and the network .
However , to squeeze even more battery life from the iPhone , Apple configured the radio to simply drop the data connection as soon as any requested data is received .
When the iPhone needs more data , it has to set up a new data connection .
The result is more efficient use of the battery , but it can cause problems with the signaling channels used to set up connections between a device and a cell node .
Cell nodes use signaling channels to set up the data connection , as well as signaling phone calls , SMS messages , voicemails , and more .
When enough iPhones are in a particular area , these signaling channels can become overloaded — there simply are n't enough to handle all the data requests along with all the calls and messages .
It 's important to note , however , that this technique is not limited to the iPhone .
Android and webOS devices also use a similar technique to increase battery life .
While the iPhone was the first and currently most prolific device of this type , such smartphones are quickly becoming common , and represent the majority of growth in mobile phone sales in the past year .
Our source at O2 told us that network equipment that is configured to handle signaling traffic dynamically — shifting more spectrum to signaling channels when needed — can mitigate this problem .
But even with more signaling capacity , network nodes may not be able to set up a data session , or may have problems getting a valid network address from an overloaded DHCP server .
He said that data capacity is rarely the problem — nodes themselves can usually handle much more data than is flowing through them .
However , the networks need to be configured to handle a growing number of devices connecting and disconnecting at a much higher rate than they 've been accustomed to .
We spoke to another expert who works in the telecom field to find out why most European networks were not experiencing the problems that AT&T and O2 did .
He told Ars that Europe embraced heavy text messaging and data use far earlier than users in the US .
SMS and MMS messages rely heavily on signaling channels to operate , and so networks were generally configured to dynamically manage changes in signaling traffic .
O2 worked with its network equipment vendors to identify the problems and adjust the configuration to adapt to the changing needs of its smartphone users .
For its part , AT&T has announced publicly that it is increasing backhaul capacity by running fiber to its cell sites , and plans an additional investment in network infrastructure — including adding up to 2,000 additional towers this year .
The company would not comment on its efforts to address the kinds of issues described by our source at O2 , though we know that O2 shared what it learned with AT&T and other carriers .
Apple has also stated that it is confident that AT&T can handle the additional network demands that the iPad would add to the growing tide of smartphone traffic .
" As you know , AT&T has acknowledged that they are having some issues in a few cities and they have very detailed plans to address these , " Apple COO Tim Cook said during the most recent quarterly earnings call .
" We have personally reviewed these plans and we have very high confidence that they will make significant progress towards fixing them . "
Winter is getting weird .

FROM CNN's Jack Cafferty :
At the NCAA tournament , the basketball team that loses shakes hands with the team that wins .
It 's called sportsmanship .
You see the same thing at NFL games , the World Series and boxing matches .
But where you do n't see it much these days is in Washington , DC .
We have become so bitterly divided that people on the losing side of a political debate - in the case of health care reform , Republicans and their supporters - have taken to hurling insults , using names like Baby Killer and using the most vile racial epithets to refer to African - American members of the United States Congress , as well as our President .
These recent examples follow the beginning of this descent into schoolyard behavior when during the President 's State of the Union address - a Republican congressman yelled out : " You lie ! "
That followed talk of death panels and the government killing your grandmother .
This kind of behavior by our leaders sends a subliminal message that this kind of behavior is acceptable , and eventually you get to death threats and perhaps worse .
What exactly are we becoming here ?
Do members of Congress start punching each other and throwing furniture the way they do in some legislative bodies elsewhere in the world ?
In fighting health care reform at every step of the way , the Republicans may have made the political miscalculation of the century .
When Republican Scott Brown won in Massachusetts , the GOP figured it had the health care debate in the bag and they did n't even have to be nice about it anymore .
But they lost , and now the residue of the bile they spewed during the debate has left a nasty taste in everyone 's mouth .
Here ’s my question to you :
Are Republicans sore losers ?
Interested to know which ones made it on air ?
Richard writes :
Republicans are not only sore losers but are also promoters of hateful rhetoric which has now been taken beyond just words .
The party has spent so much time and effort convincing people that they should fear their government and yet they completely disavow themselves of any responsibility when those same people begin to act , in some cases , dangerously .
Joe writes :
I think the American people are upset that the majority did n't rule in a democracy because of backroom deals and promises .
It 's like shaking the hand of the other team , knowing they paid the referees .
Manuel writes :
We have sore losers on both sides , and the media 's reporting is an enabler making it a three - ring circus , Jack .
Do n't we have an example out there of someone who passionately but respectfully disagrees ?
All we are doing is making our young people more mindless and cynical about politics .
Adam writes :
Positively , I do n't remember hearing or seeing the Democrats jumping up and down pouting about the Bush tax cuts .
You win the election , you set the agenda !
The GOP keeps saying they are in favor of health care reform , but when they controlled Congress , I do not remember hearing one word about it .
It was all tax cuts for the wealthy and spending the surplus invading sovereign nations .
JoAnn writes :
Yes , most definitely they are !
Not only are they sore losers , I really feel that what they hate most was losing to an African - American .
Danny writes :
What a shame and disgrace that the Republicans have to act like bullies because they did not get their way .
I have never done this before , but I have made a commitment that I will not vote Republican ever again …
Those that make up the Republican Party , the religious right , the tea partiers , the social elite and mostly the wealthy , would have their will imposed on all of us who would disagree with them .
Until we can agree to be disagreeable without being mean spirited , we have a very bleak future ahead , for all of us .
Several San Diego police swarmed in on former UFC bad boy War Machine last night and threw a spit bag on his head after cops say the dude assaulted someone with a deadly weapon .
TMZ has learned Machine -- which is the fighter 's legal name -- was arrested outside a bar called Thruster 's Lounge around 11 pm .
Law enforcement sources tell us Machine and another male were fighting with bouncers -- and when cops tried to approach the situation , War Machine took off running .
Eventually , cops caught up with the 28 - year - old , threw him in handcuffs , and for some reason , put a spit bag over his head ... which is generally applied when the perp gets a little too aggressive with his oral fluids .
Machine was arrested for assault with a deadly weapon -- though it 's unclear what the weapon is .
He 's currently being held in a SD jail .

Is it " inevitable " that capitalism will crash and produce the socialist - anarchist revolution ?
Can we ignore or deny objective social laws in favor of focusing on the self - activity of the working class ?
At a March conference of the U.S. -- Northeastern Federation of Anarchist - Communists ( US - NEFAC ) , we discussed a document some of us had written .
It covered the current economic crisis and the likely prospects for the coming period .
No one claimed to know for sure what the immediate future would bring -- would the Great Recession be over soon or would recovery collapse into a new crisis ?
When will there be a new working class upsurge ?
But we expect that the overall economic direction will be downhill , despite short - term ups and downs ; that there would be no return to the relative prosperity of the 50s or even the 90s ; that there is a likelihood of a second Great Depression , worse than the 30s ; that ecological and environmental decay will deepen ; and that wars will continue and may even get worse .
In response , we expect an eventual new wave of popular radicalization , combining elements of the 30s and the 60s .
This led to a discussion , on and off the conference floor , about the nature of the developing crisis and its relation to a hoped - for workers  revolution , particularly the relation between objective trends and subjective popular struggles .
I will continue this discussion here .
Since anarchism does not have much of a developed analysis of capitalism and crisis , it will be necessary to mostly use Marxist concepts ( although I am not now a Marxist -- I call myself a Marxist - informed anarchist ) .
Roughly speaking , there are three ways of conceptualizing the relationship between objective crisis and subjective mass struggle .
Is Socialism Inevitable ?
One view is that capitalism works in an automatic way , producing a trend toward eventual catastrophe as well as producing the modern working class
This class will become aware of the danger and will automatically make a revolution and establish socialism .
This has been a common interpretation of the lines in Marx and Engels Communist Manifesto ,  What the bourgeoisie therefore produces , above all , are its own grave - diggers .
Its fall and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable  ( in Draper , 1998 ; p. 135 ; more grammatically : are alike inevitable ) .
This implies that history is an automatic mechanism , something which happens to people rather than something which people do .
The most the working class can do is to speed up the automatic processes , but not to make them occur in the first place .
This was the main interpretation of Marxism among the Social Democratic Parties and among Stalinists .
The Italian anarchist Errico Maletesta complained that his teacher Peter Kropotkin had this orientation : unrealistically optimistic , mechanistic , and fatalist , not unlike the worst of the Marxists .
 Since , according to his philosophy , that which occurs , must necessarily occur , so also the communist - anarchism he desired must inevitably triumph as if by a law of nature .
The bourgeois world was destined to crumble ; it was already breaking up and revolutionary action only served to hasten the process 
( Malatesta , 1984 ; p. 265 ) .
The inevitablist interpretation can have unfortunate political consequences .
It can justify limiting struggle to reformism , since any struggle will ( supposedly ) inevitably lead to revolution .
It can justify a lack of struggle ( Malatesta cites various anarchists who retired to private life , confident that the world would reach communist - anarchism without needing them to make any effort ) .
It can lead to the repression and mass murder of the Leninists , since it will come out all right in the end , in socialist freedom , or so they believe they know .
It led to Trotsky arguing that the collectivist bureaucracy of Stalins Soviet Union could not be a new ruling class , because if it were , this would violate the transition from the bourgeoisie being the ruling class to the workers overthrowing them and becaming the next rulers ( Matgamna , 1998 ) .
If the bureaucracy were a new ruling class , he claimed , that would discredit the entire revolutionary perspective !
Following this logic , orthodox Trotskyism capitulated to the Stalinism it was formed to fight against .
Of course , there is also the sense in which people may psych themselves up , crying ,  The revolution will win !  or  The strike will win !  or  The Red Sox will win ! 
This is not a matter of cold - blooded prediction but a statement of desire , of intention , and of commitment .
It says that we are committed to our sides victory and that we intend to do all that we can to see that it happens -- which is pretty limited for sports fans but in the case of a revolution is a pledge of our lives , our fortunes , and our sacred honor . 
Can Objective Tendencies be Ignored ?
Secondly , in reaction to inevitablism , some have turned in a liberal direction .
I am thinking of the criticisms of Marxism made by the influential liberal philosopher John Dewey .
In effect , he denied that the social system was governed by determining laws at all .
It was dogmatic , he wrote , to claim that the class struggle was necessary to change society in a freer direction ; the struggle of the middle class might do as well as that of the working class .
Contrary to Marx ( and Bakunin ) , electoral activity might yet bring the state and economy into socialism -- peacefully , gradually , and democratically ,  without an overthrow or replacement .
In short , revolution is not needed .
Some Marxists and anarchists react against mechanistic inevitablism by also adopting an open - ended analysis , which has similarities to that of liberalism .
In effect they reject the idea that capitalism is a system which has laws .
( In my opinion , social laws mean patterns of mass behavior which are regularly repeated ) .
Instead they focus on the self - activity of the working class , which interacts with the self - activity of the capitalist class , each responding to the other and little else .
( This view is elaborated by Cleaver , 1979 / 2000 . )
While often insightful , this is one - sided ..
For example , how explain the Great Recession ?
The working class had not become more aggressive recently against the capitalists ( quite the contrary ) and the capitalists had not wanted the crisis .
Indeed , the capitalists generally do not understand their system and the workers lack socialist consciousness ( however militant their struggles , very few see the need for socialism ) .
Therefore the two basic classes act more - or - less blindly , as if they were part of an automatic mechanism , which causes society to be an automatic mechanism , in effect .
For the workers , this can only change if they become aware of what they are doing and what they might do differently .
This open - ended , solely - subjective , analysis often ends up with liberal / reformist conclusions .
The working class may be rejected -- either because almost everyone is defined as part of the proletariat ,  even peasants , or because people can ( supposedly ) deliberately quit being exploited workers , or because they are better seen as a multiclass multitude .
Revolution becomes unnecessary because people can peacefully and gradually build a new society inside capitalism -- without a need to overthrow capital and the state .
So Cleaver writes ,  As opposed to the traditional Leninist view that building a new society could only occur after revolution - as - overthrow - of - capital [ which is also the anti-Leninist Marxist and anarchist view !
WP ] , these new movements were undertaking the building of  the future in the present .
Those who are doing the elaboration move beyond being workers  ( 1979/2000 ; pp. 1718 ) .
An even worse example is Hardt & Negris Empire ( 2000 ) .
I find it depressing that the autonomist Marxist trend should end in this rejection of the working class and revolution .
Socialism or Barbarism !
The third possible view was expressed near the beginning of the Communist Manifesto :
 The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles .
a fight that each time ended , either in a revolutionary re-constitution of society at large , or in the common ruin of the contending classes  ( in Draper , 1998 ; p. 105107 ) .
Draper explains this as either a revolution that remakes society or the collapse of the old order to a lower level ( 1998 ; p. 200 ) .
Engels restated this several times , for example , throughout his Anti-Duhring .
He writes that the modern working class must make the socialist revolution or else face  sinking to the level of a Chinese coolie ,  while the bourgeoisie is a class under whose leadership society is racing to ruin like a locomotive [ with a ] jammed safety - valve  ( 1954 ; pp. 217218 ) .
For the capitalist class ,  its own productive forces have grown beyond its control , and are driving the whole of bourgeois society toward ruin , or revolution ( p. 228 ) .
When the capitalist system turns most people into proletarians ,  it creates the power which , under penalty of its own destruction , is forced to accomplish this revolution ( p. 388 ) .
Socialist revolution is not inevitable .
But if it is not made , society faces ruin and destruction , with the working class reduced to the level of the starving , super - exploited , Chinese workers of that time .
Therefore the working class and its allies should consciously and deliberately decide to make the revolution ( and we , the revolutionary minority , hope that it will ) .
Where Engels said the alternatives were ruin or revolution ,  the great , revolutionary - democratic , Marxist , Rosa Luxemburg , said the alternatives were socialism or barbarism .
What she meant by that is discussed in an intriguing study by Norman Geras ( 1976 ) .
She emphasized the tendency of capitalism toward catastrophe .
She wrote that this contradicted the program of the reformist revisionists  such as Bernstein , who thought that capitalism could peacefully evolve closer and closer to socialism .
It also refuted the beliefs of the orthodox 
Marxist centrists , such as Kautsky , who thought they should limit the workers  struggles to reforms without raising the need to educate the workers for the struggle for power .
To Luxemburg , capitalism , in its final epoch , was propping itself up by imperialism , which would lead to ever greater crises and a period of world wars ( quoted on p. 32 ) .
Left to its own tendencies , it would produce barbarism , by which she meant ,  the destruction of all culture , depopulation , desolation , degeneration , a vast cemetery  ( quoted on p. 33 ) .
Geras makes the strange - sounding statement that , for Luxemburg , it is not socialism but barbarism that is inevitable  ( p. 31 ) .
What he means is that if capitalism is left to itself , continuing to operate blindly by its own laws , it will eventually collapse into barbarism .
To prevent capitalist collapse and barbarism requires that the proletariat make a conscious decision to overthrow it and create a new society .
Geras writes ,
 The idea of inevitable capitalist collapse and the idea of socialism - or - barbarism are one and the same idea ( same ) .
Luxemburg wrote ,  In relation to capitalism as a whole , that societys objective development merely gives us the preconditions of a higher order of development , but that without our conscious interference , without the political struggle of the working class for a socialist transformation [ socialism will never ] come about ( quoted on p. 19 ) .
That is , there is an interaction between objective factors and subjectivity .
As a system , capitalism creates the possibility of socialism .
This includes a high level of productivity , higher than ever before in the history of humanity ; the proletariat , a collective working class , trained in cooperation and joint action by the system itself , living in the centers of capital production , and international in scope .
In many ways capitalism pushes the workers to move toward a new , cooperative , world order .
It also has mechanisms for holding back the struggle , for dividing the workers into a million distinct groupings .
The better - off workers may feel satisfied and conservative .
The worse - off workers may become demoralized .
But capitalism finally threatens the workers , and all who live under its sway , with catastrophe , mass destruction , and barbarism , and this also pushes the workers to overthrow it , to end it , and to build a better society .
This will not happen inevitably .
It is a matter of struggle , of consciousness , and of making a collective decision of breaking with fatalism and mechanism .
It requires the efforts of the revolutionary minority to win over the big majority of workers and oppressed .
It may still seem to be rather fatalistic to say that there will inevitably be one of only two outcomes .
But this is not as rigid as it may sound .
There are , unfortunately , many possible forms of catastrophe in which capitalism may end , and there are many different ways in which a revolution may happen as well as different types of a free society which may come out of one .
There are many possible concrete ways in which socialism or barbarism may become realized .
So history is not as limited as the formula may appear .
But , yes , I am making a claim to a sort of inevitability .
I am saying that , as best as we can determine , as much as we can understand the world , this status quo will not last , however stable it appears when we look out the window .
Just like all previous social systems , capitalism too will come to an end someday ( and sooner than we may think ) .
That is inevitable .
But how this will work itself out , and , especially , how conscious and self - active the working people will be that is something which we cannot know at this time .
( Whether Luxemburg had the best analysis of the mechanisms by which capitalism tends toward catastrophe is another question .
I am discussing the politics involved .
She focused on the difficulty capitalism has in selling its commodities and which , she thought , required imperialist domination of non-capitalist countries .
In my opinion , Luxemburg made some serious analytic errors , which I will not discuss further but for a neo -Luxemburgist analysis , I highly recommend the insightful work of Loren Goldner , [ website ] .
An understanding of the tendency of capitalism toward catastrophe and the means by which the system holds it off as long as it can , until there is , hopefully , a revolution , is better provided by Henryk Grossman [ Kuhn , 2007 ] .
He sees crisies as being caused by the long - term tendency of the falling rate of profit and the growth of semi-monopoly firms I cannot go further into his analysis here .
Like Luxemburg , he denied that there will be an inevitable , automatic , change from crisis - ridden capitalism to socialism .
His views on capitalist crisis were highly valued by the council communist / libertarian Marxist , Paul Mattick [ 1934 ] . )
The anarchist Murray Bookchin noted that the hierarchical structures of modern capitalism threaten human survival through nuclear war or ecological catastrophe ( he wrote before global warming became so obvious ) .
 No longer are we faced with Marxs famous choice of socialism or barbarism ; we are confronted with the more drastic alternatives of anarchism or annihilation .
The problems of necessity and survival have become congruent with the problems of freedom and life ( 1986 ; p.62 ) .
In the event of a nuclear war , we would be lucky to have barbarism !
This analysis does not change the basic argument : in a social system which both creates the possibility of a free and productive society ( what Bookchin calls  post - scarcity anarchism ) and which has drives which threaten catastrophe , socialist - anarchism is not inevitable .
But it is needed ( by the most modest of moral standards , such as , it is good for the human species to survive ) .
Therefore the workers and all oppressed people need to become aware of the danger and to decide to make a revolution and build a new society .
( Unfortunately , Bookchin did not quite draw this conclusion , since he had come to reject the centrality of the working class and the need for a revolution , rather similarly to Cleaver the Marxist . )
Ruin or revolution !
Socialism or barbarism !
Anarchism or annihilation !
These slogans ( of Engels , Luxemburg , and Bookchin ) are central to understand the alternative we face .
( The libertarian socialist and ex-Trotskyist Cornelius Castoriadis , in the 1950s , called his French grouping  Socialisme ou Barbarie ; Cleaver , 1967 / 2000 . )
One of these choices ( ruin / barbarism / annihilation ) will be the outcome if capitalism is given its head ; if the bourgeoisie is allowed to blindly run it into the ground ; if the system is permitted to follow its innate tendencies ( objective laws ) to their bitter end .
The other ( revolutionary socialist - anarchism ) requires that the working class become aware of the danger , conscious of the possible alternative to disaster , and decides to take the choice of freedom , cooperation , radical democracy , ecological balance , and internationalism .
I discuss three possible approaches above ( inevitability of revolution , subjectivity , the interrelation of the objective crisis and the subjective choice ) .
Which is the correct interpretation of the Marxism of Marx and Engels , I do not know , or much care .
Probably they are all based in some aspect of what Marx actually wrote and thought .
But whatever Marx and Engels ( and Kropotkin ) thought , there is no inevitable outcome between socialism and annihilation .
The issue will be decided in struggle .

Revolution becomes unnecessary because people can peacefully and gradually build a new society inside capitalism -- without a need to overthrow capital and the state .
So Cleaver writes ,  As opposed to the traditional Leninist view that building a new society could only occur after revolution - as - overthrow - of - capital [ which is also the anti-Leninist Marxist and anarchist view !
WP ] , these new movements were undertaking the building of  the future in the present .
Those who are doing the elaboration move beyond being workers  ( 1979/2000 ; pp. 1718 ) .
An even worse example is Hardt & Negris Empire ( 2000 ) .
I find it depressing that the autonomist Marxist trend should end in this rejection of the working class and revolution .
The third possible view was expressed near the beginning of the Communist Manifesto :
 The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles .
a fight that each time ended , either in a revolutionary re-constitution of society at large , or in the common ruin of the contending classes  ( in Draper , 1998 ; p. 105107 ) .
Draper explains this as either a revolution that remakes society or the collapse of the old order to a lower level ( 1998 ; p. 200 ) .
Engels restated this several times , for example , throughout his Anti-Duhring .
He writes that the modern working class must make the socialist revolution or else face  sinking to the level of a Chinese coolie ,  while the bourgeoisie is a class under whose leadership society is racing to ruin like a locomotive [ with a ] jammed safety - valve  ( 1954 ; pp. 217218 ) .
For the capitalist class ,  its own productive forces have grown beyond its control , and are driving the whole of bourgeois society toward ruin , or revolution ( p. 228 ) .
When the capitalist system turns most people into proletarians ,  it creates the power which , under penalty of its own destruction , is forced to accomplish this revolution ( p. 388 ) .
Socialist revolution is not inevitable .
But if it is not made , society faces ruin and destruction , with the working class reduced to the level of the starving , super - exploited , Chinese workers of that time .
Therefore the working class and its allies should consciously and deliberately decide to make the revolution ( and we , the revolutionary minority , hope that it will ) .
Where Engels said the alternatives were ruin or revolution ,  the great , revolutionary - democratic , Marxist , Rosa Luxemburg , said the alternatives were socialism or barbarism .
What she meant by that is discussed in an intriguing study by Norman Geras ( 1976 ) .
She emphasized the tendency of capitalism toward catastrophe .
She wrote that this contradicted the program of the reformist revisionists  such as Bernstein , who thought that capitalism could peacefully evolve closer and closer to socialism .
It also refuted the beliefs of the orthodox 
Marxist centrists , such as Kautsky , who thought they should limit the workers  struggles to reforms without raising the need to educate the workers for the struggle for power .
To Luxemburg , capitalism , in its final epoch , was propping itself up by imperialism , which would lead to ever greater crises and a period of world wars ( quoted on p. 32 ) .
Left to its own tendencies , it would produce barbarism , by which she meant ,  the destruction of all culture , depopulation , desolation , degeneration , a vast cemetery  ( quoted on p. 33 ) .
Geras makes the strange - sounding statement that , for Luxemburg , it is not socialism but barbarism that is inevitable  ( p. 31 ) .
What he means is that if capitalism is left to itself , continuing to operate blindly by its own laws , it will eventually collapse into barbarism .
To prevent capitalist collapse and barbarism requires that the proletariat make a conscious decision to overthrow it and create a new society .
Geras writes ,
 The idea of inevitable capitalist collapse and the idea of socialism - or - barbarism are one and the same idea ( same ) .
Luxemburg wrote ,  In relation to capitalism as a whole , that societys objective development merely gives us the preconditions of a higher order of development , but that without our conscious interference , without the political struggle of the working class for a socialist transformation [ socialism will never ] come about ( quoted on p. 19 ) .
That is , there is an interaction between objective factors and subjectivity .
As a system , capitalism creates the possibility of socialism .
This includes a high level of productivity , higher than ever before in the history of humanity ; the proletariat , a collective working class , trained in cooperation and joint action by the system itself , living in the centers of capital production , and international in scope .
In many ways capitalism pushes the workers to move toward a new , cooperative , world order .
It also has mechanisms for holding back the struggle , for dividing the workers into a million distinct groupings .
The better - off workers may feel satisfied and conservative .
The worse - off workers may become demoralized .
But capitalism finally threatens the workers , and all who live under its sway , with catastrophe , mass destruction , and barbarism , and this also pushes the workers to overthrow it , to end it , and to build a better society .
This will not happen inevitably .
It is a matter of struggle , of consciousness , and of making a collective decision of breaking with fatalism and mechanism .
It requires the efforts of the revolutionary minority to win over the big majority of workers and oppressed .
It may still seem to be rather fatalistic to say that there will inevitably be one of only two outcomes .
But this is not as rigid as it may sound .
There are , unfortunately , many possible forms of catastrophe in which capitalism may end , and there are many different ways in which a revolution may happen as well as different types of a free society which may come out of one .
There are many possible concrete ways in which socialism or barbarism may become realized .
So history is not as limited as the formula may appear .
But , yes , I am making a claim to a sort of inevitability .
I am saying that , as best as we can determine , as much as we can understand the world , this status quo will not last , however stable it appears when we look out the window .
Just like all previous social systems , capitalism too will come to an end someday ( and sooner than we may think ) .
That is inevitable .
But how this will work itself out , and , especially , how conscious and self - active the working people will be that is something which we cannot know at this time .
( Whether Luxemburg had the best analysis of the mechanisms by which capitalism tends toward catastrophe is another question .
I am discussing the politics involved .
She focused on the difficulty capitalism has in selling its commodities and which , she thought , required imperialist domination of non-capitalist countries .
In my opinion , Luxemburg made some serious analytic errors , which I will not discuss further but for a neo -Luxemburgist analysis , I highly recommend the insightful work of Loren Goldner , [ website ] .
An understanding of the tendency of capitalism toward catastrophe and the means by which the system holds it off as long as it can , until there is , hopefully , a revolution , is better provided by Henryk Grossman [ Kuhn , 2007 ] .
He sees crisies as being caused by the long - term tendency of the falling rate of profit and the growth of semi-monopoly firms I cannot go further into his analysis here .
Like Luxemburg , he denied that there will be an inevitable , automatic , change from crisis - ridden capitalism to socialism .
His views on capitalist crisis were highly valued by the council communist / libertarian Marxist , Paul Mattick [ 1934 ] . )
The anarchist Murray Bookchin noted that the hierarchical structures of modern capitalism threaten human survival through nuclear war or ecological catastrophe ( he wrote before global warming became so obvious ) .
 No longer are we faced with Marxs famous choice of socialism or barbarism ; we are confronted with the more drastic alternatives of anarchism or annihilation .
The problems of necessity and survival have become congruent with the problems of freedom and life ( 1986 ; p.62 ) .
In the event of a nuclear war , we would be lucky to have barbarism !
This analysis does not change the basic argument : in a social system which both creates the possibility of a free and productive society ( what Bookchin calls  post - scarcity anarchism ) and which has drives which threaten catastrophe , socialist - anarchism is not inevitable .
But it is needed ( by the most modest of moral standards , such as , it is good for the human species to survive ) .
Therefore the workers and all oppressed people need to become aware of the danger and to decide to make a revolution and build a new society .
( Unfortunately , Bookchin did not quite draw this conclusion , since he had come to reject the centrality of the working class and the need for a revolution , rather similarly to Cleaver the Marxist . )
Ruin or revolution !
Socialism or barbarism !
Anarchism or annihilation !
These slogans ( of Engels , Luxemburg , and Bookchin ) are central to understand the alternative we face .
( The libertarian socialist and ex-Trotskyist Cornelius Castoriadis , in the 1950s , called his French grouping  Socialisme ou Barbarie ; Cleaver , 1967 / 2000 . )
One of these choices ( ruin / barbarism / annihilation ) will be the outcome if capitalism is given its head ; if the bourgeoisie is allowed to blindly run it into the ground ; if the system is permitted to follow its innate tendencies ( objective laws ) to their bitter end .
The other ( revolutionary socialist - anarchism ) requires that the working class become aware of the danger , conscious of the possible alternative to disaster , and decides to take the choice of freedom , cooperation , radical democracy , ecological balance , and internationalism .
I discuss three possible approaches above ( inevitability of revolution , subjectivity , the interrelation of the objective crisis and the subjective choice ) .
Which is the correct interpretation of the Marxism of Marx and Engels , I do not know , or much care .
Probably they are all based in some aspect of what Marx actually wrote and thought .
But whatever Marx and Engels ( and Kropotkin ) thought , there is no inevitable outcome between socialism and annihilation .
The issue will be decided in struggle .

If Rupert Murdoch 's paywall is successful , what will it mean for the way we digest internet news ?
LUXEMBOURG / LONDON ( Reuters ) - Europe ’s highest court ruled Google Inc did not infringe trademark law by selling keywords to trigger ads after Louis Vuitton and others said the practice undermined their brands .
A camera used for Google street view is pictured at the CeBIT computer fair in Hanover March 2 , 2010 .
REUTERS / Christian Charisius
The European Court of Justice ( ECJ ) said on Tuesday advertisers were free to buy keywords identical to trademarks of rivals as long as consumers were not confused on the provenance of goods and services by the way ads were displayed online .
The court said that in cases where ads could confuse consumers , brand owners should invoke their rights against the advertisers concerned , not against Google -- unless Google failed to act on a complaint or actively manipulated keywords .
The ruling validates the AdWords paid - search business at the core of Google ’s $ 23 billion online advertising operations , as well as of competitors such as Yahoo !
Inc , and gives brand owners a way to prevent wrongful use of their trademarks .
“ It ’s a good decision in large parts , ” said Fabian Ziegenaus , an intellectual property lawyer at Linklaters .
“ It does not forbid Google per se to sell trademark keywords , so the business model is not at stake , and brand owners are also protected through the decision . ”
Advertisers often buy brand names of their competitors as keywords to trigger their own ads .
Google says the practice is in the interests of consumers , who do not want their search results to be limited to a single brand .
Brand owners can also bid for their own brand names as keywords and the order in which sponsored links are displayed online is determined mainly through this auction process .
Google used to block advertisers from buying others ’ brand names as keywords but changed its policy in North America in 2004 and four years later extended that to Britain and Ireland .
It says it will honour valid complaints from brand owners and prevent their rivals from using a trademarked keyword in their ad text .
VICTORY CLAIMS
Both Google and LVMH , the world ’s biggest luxury - goods group , claimed the court ’s decision as a victory .
“ Trademarks ... are key for companies to market and advertise their products and services .
But trademark rights are not absolute , ” wrote Google ’s senior litigation counsel for Europe , Harjinder S. Obhi ( googlepolicyeurope.blogspot.com ) .
“ We believe that user interest is best served by maximising the choice of keywords , ensuring relevant and informative advertising for a wide variety of different contexts . ”
LVMH Vice Chairman Pierre Gode told Reuters : “ We are very happy with the decision .
We consider the decision is very important as the liability of advertisers is well established . ”
LVHM shares rose 1.1 percent to 87.74 euros by 11:31 a.m. ( British time ) .
The summary of the court judgement did not explicitly address the issue of counterfeit goods , but it did offer more clarity than expected on the misuse of trademarks in search results displayed to consumers .
“ If the trademarks are actually used in the results that are shown to users and the advertiser does not own the trademark , that is likely to be deemed infringement , ” said Thomas Vinje , a partner at Clifford Chance specialising in EU and IP law .
“ That would seem to defeat counterfeiters ... that would be to the advantage of the trademark owners , ” he said .
The European Brands Association , which represents 1,800 brand companies in 22 countries , said : “ By confirming trademark rights online and holding sellers of keywords liable for illicit material , such as counterfeits , this ruling seems positive . ”
The ECJ said the matter of whether consumers were likely to be confused by the way search results were displayed was a matter for national European courts to decide case by case .
LVMH scored a victory last month when a Paris tribunal found eBay Inc guilty of misleading consumers by using misspelt versions of its brand as search engine keywords to redirect users to eBay website links .
Several cases brought by brand owners are pending against advertisers at the ECJ , the first of which will be ruled on this week .
Google also faces eight cases in the United States over the sale of trademarked keywords .
The behavior of Bart Stupak over the last several months , but particularly the last few weeks , in the hcr debate has been deplorable .
He refuses to acknowledge the reality that his crusade is built on a lie -- the lie that there is federal funding for abortion coverage in the Senate bill .
Now that he's not the center of leadership attention anymore , he 's escalating his lies and his crusade .
First he attacked Henry Waxman saying Waxman 's argument against his effort was to tell Stupak " But we want to pay for abortions . "
Then , in an interview with NRO , levelled this bizarre accusation against his colleagues :
Stupak notes that his negotiations with House Democratic leaders in recent days have been revealing .
“ I really believe that the Democratic leadership is simply unwilling to change its stance , ” he says .
“ Their position says that women , especially those without means available , should have their abortions covered . ”
The arguments they have made to him in recent deliberations , he adds , “ are a pretty sad commentary on the state of the Democratic party . ”
What are Democratic leaders saying ?
“ If you pass the Stupak amendment , more children will be born , and therefore it will cost us millions more .
That ’s one of the arguments I ’ve been hearing , ” Stupak says .
“ Money is their hang - up .
Is this how we now value life in America ?
If money is the issue — come on , we can find room in the budget .
This is life we ’re talking about . ”
Many Democrats in the House do believe that a person should not be denied a legal , medical procedure because of her gender and her economic circumstances .
There is broad opposition in the party to the Hyde amendment that has enshrined that cruel discrimination .
Stupak 's saying that this is actually the Dems being anti-baby because they cost too much is a lie worthy of Glenn Beck .
But he sure as hell knows how to play to his audience .
But here 's what Stupak 's real problem is : “ They ’re ignoring me . "
Since his bluff was called , he's not the center of attention from leadership and the White House any more .
The limelight is fading , and the only attention he 's likely to get now is over the issue whether the years he received subsized rent at the living in The Family 's C Street house violated House rules .
And the politics of the issue are pretty rough .
“ This has really reached an unhealthy stage , ” Stupak says .
“ People are threatening ethics complaints on me .
On the left , they ’re really stepping it up .
Every day , from Rachel Maddow to the Daily Kos , it keeps coming .
Does it bother me ?
Sure .
Does it change my position ?
No . ”
Poor , poor Bart Stupak .
My heart bleeds .
Hutton was farcical , feeble and amateurish ... so we MUST be told the truth next week
Questioned : Tony Blair arriving to give evidence to the Hutton Inquiry in 2003 .
Sir John Chilcot 's inquiry is expected to be more forensic
When Tony Blair finally appears before the Chilcot Inquiry on Friday , there will be many across the land who will be longing to see him at last brought before the bar of public opinion to account for his central role in launching the 2003 invasion of Iraq .
Here is the man who planned it all well in advance , but told Parliament he was trying to avoid war .
The man who told us Saddam Hussein presented an increasing threat , when the Iraqi dictator possessed no weapons of mass destruction at all .
The man who said he put the British interest first , but who , eager and starry - eyed , followed George Bush wherever he wanted to go , even into the maddest corners .
On Friday , Sir John Chilcot and his colleagues will be polite , measured and calm .
But , encouragingly , they will almost certainly be well - briefed and forensic as well , if previous sessions are anything to go by .
Do n’t let us count chickens , but we may yet get the final report that people want to see , nailing Blair , Campbell , Hoon and the rest of the shameful shower .
Yet the fact that we , the British people , have had to wait seven long years for justice is a disgrace , and much of the blame can be firmly laid at the door of one man : Lord Brian Hutton .
In contrast to the probing Chilcot Inquiry , the 2003 equivalent that was led by Lord Hutton now looks an amateurish , feeble and farcical process for which the term ‘ inquiry ’ is frankly laughable .
Here , the most challenging question the then Prime Minister and his Cabinet colleagues were asked was whether they could confirm their names and if they wanted a cup of tea .
All right , I exaggerate , but not by much .
But when Lord Hutton finally reported in January 2004 , he astonished the nation by clearing the Government of everything - dodgy dossiers and all - and instead fastened blame firmly on the BBC .
If in doubt , shoot the messenger .
Now we learn that evidence which was not presented at the inquiry has been locked away for 70 years - and this inquiry , remember , was to subject Dr David Kelly ’s death to public scrutiny .
How could Lord Hutton have got it so wrong ?
The reality is that his inquiry was fixed by Blair and his cohorts to produce the right result .
If you put down the tracks , that ’s the way the train goes .
Hutton was appointed , and his terms of reference agreed , within record time , just hours after Dr Kelly , the Government ’s foremost weapons inspector , was found dead on Harrowdown Hill in Oxfordshire .
His task was to examine the circumstances surrounding the scientist ’s death , including the political events that straddled the war , not least the claim that the Government ’s case for war had been ‘ sexed up ’ .
Lord Hutton was the ideal appointment for the Government .
He had chaired only one inquiry before - into the diversion of a river in Northern Ireland .
Even more importantly , throughout his career he had shown himself to be sympathetic to the Government and critical of the media .
In 1973 , he had represented the Ministry of Defence at the Bloody Sunday inquests .
In 1991 , he successfully led the campaign to overturn the decision to extradite the Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet .
In 2002 , he blocked the attempt by renegade MI5 officer David Shayler to use a public - interest defence to justify his revelations about the actions of the organisation .
Nobody is suggesting that Lord Hutton was anything other than independent but , in the words of Sir Humphrey in Yes Minister , you do n’t choose a judge whom you can lean on ; you choose one who does n’t have to be leant on .
Worse , Tony Blair and his close circle decided from the outset that Hutton ’s should be a ‘ non-statutory inquiry ’ .
Take away the jargon and what that means is no witness could be compelled to appear , nobody could be required to tell the truth or charged with perjury if they did n’t , and the normal safeguards associated with a court process , such as proper cross-examination of witnesses , were entirely absent .
If Lord Hutton ’s conduct of his inquiry into the battle between the Government and the BBC was deeply unsatisfactory , his examination of the death of Dr Kelly was pathetic .
You might think that such a high - profile and controversial death would call for an especially rigorous examination .
Instead , it was investigated to a lower standard than normal .
So , incredibly , Lord Hutton did not , for example , call the police officer who was actually heading the investigation into Dr Kelly ’s death , Chief Inspector Alan Young .
Nor did we hear from the scientist ’s best friend , Mai Pedersen , who would have been able to tell Lord Hutton that Dr Kelly had damaged his right arm and was incapable of cutting steak , let alone cutting his left wrist .
She could also have told him that her friend , who we were invited to believe had swallowed 29 co-proxamol tablets , had an aversion to swallowing medication .
Lord Hutton did not even inquire as to whose fingerprints were on the knife allegedly used to slit Dr Kelly ’s wrist .
That was left for me to establish through a Freedom of Information request , which revealed there were no fingerprints on the knife , and Dr Kelly was not wearing gloves .
Lord Hutton was to confess that he had not bothered looking into the death very deeply .
Writing in the Inner Temple Yearbook 2004 , he unashamedly observed : ‘ I thought that there would be little serious dispute as to the background facts [ about Dr Kelly ’s death ] .
' I thought unnecessary time could be taken up by cross-examination on matters which were not directly relevant . ’
So key questions went unasked , conflicting and contradictory evidence abounded , and no attempt was made to tie up the countless loose ends .
And now it seems that Lord Hutton has unilaterally decided that the records of his inquiry should be closed for 30 years and medical evidence for an incredible 70 years - evidence that is hotly disputed by a number of medical practitioners , who are looking to take court action to force a proper inquest to be held .
In an inquest , all the evidence is there for the public to see .
What is Lord Hutton seeking to hide away until nearly all of us are dead ?
The Chilcot Inquiry is also a non-statutory one , but looks like proving rather more robust in dealing with the politics of 2003 .
Yet Dr Kelly ’s name has barely been mentioned .
If we are to draw a line under the events of 2003 , Chilcot needs to acknowledge that Lord Hutton was as useless in dealing with Dr Kelly ’s death as he was with weapons of mass destruction , if not more so .
He should accept Dr Kelly is entitled to the inquest he never had , and recommend that one should now take place .

A 12 - year - old boy , identified as the youth who fatally shot a female classmate Monday inside the Mall of Orange , had a crush on the girl and brandished a pistol to impress her moments before the shooting , his friends said Tuesday .
Acquaintances and classmates said the youth , a seventh - grader at Cerro Villa Middle School in Villa Park , was smitten with Jacalyn Calabrese , a curly - haired brunette who was mortally wounded in front of dozens of horrified shoppers .
Jacalyn , they said , had been the youth ’s girlfriend in elementary school and the two had remained inseparable friends at Cerro Villa .
During the month before the shooting , Matthew Palmer , another student , said the youth had been showing a . 25 - caliber pistol to friends and that he had seen the gun at least five times .
Matthew said that Monday evening , before the youth went to the mall with Jacalyn and several of her friends , the boy displayed the pistol again and told him that it was loaded .

“ He showed me there were bullets in it , ” said Matthew , 12 .
“ It scared me .
It was the first time I had seen bullets in the gun ’s chamber . ”
The suspect , whose name was not released by police because he is a juvenile , was taken into custody Monday night more than two hours after the shooting .
He temporarily sought refuge at a friend ’s home until a member of the household learned of the shooting and persuaded the youth to call his parents .
Residents of the house said the boy , who had a reputation for acting tough , was reduced to tears during the hours immediately after Jacalyn ’s death .
Orange Police Sgt. Art Romo said Tuesday that officers finally found the gun believed used in the shooting .
The .25 - caliber , semiautomatic pistol was recovered about 11 p.m.
Monday near a house in the neighborhood west of the mall where the boy had fled .

How the youth got the weapon is unclear .
Friends of the youth said he stole the gun from his father , but his relatives deny that any family members owned the pistol .
A decision regarding prosecution is not expected until today after police and prosecutors meet , according to Deputy Dist .
Atty .
John D. Conley , who handles juvenile cases .
The boy , whose first name is Juan , is being held without bail in Orange County Juvenile Hall on suspicion of murder .
Conley said that in the four years that he has been with the Orange County district attorney ’s office , he could not remember any case “ quite like this , ” where the alleged assailant was so young .
Although police would not advance any theories about the shooting Tuesday , witnesses said it appeared that Jacalyn ’s death was a bad joke gone awry , the senseless act of a reckless youth .

“ He was just all mellow and trying to be cool in front of Jackie , ” said Keli Edwards , a seventh - grader who was with the two at the mall when the shooting occurred .
“ Then he looked at me like , ‘ Oh my God , I did n’t mean to do that . ’ ”
Keli said the boy had been playing with the gun all afternoon and at one time pointed it at her head .
“ I said ‘ Jesus Christ , ’ and ducked and ran away , ” she recalled .
Investigators allege that the boy shot Jacalyn , 12 , once in the forehead after he displayed the weapon and she joked with him about whether the gun was real .
“ ‘ Come on , Juan , shoot me , ’ ” Keli quoted Jacalyn as saying .

Jacalyn then stepped back from the boy , who drew the small pistol from his left pants pocket , steadied it with two hands , and a shot rang out , Keli said .
Witnesses said that as the girl clutched her forehead and fell to the floor , the youth fled , yelling “ Oh my God ! Oh my God ! ”
The boy fled to the Cumberland Avenue home of Michael Padilla , a classmate , Little League teammate and close friend .
The stucco - and - tile house is about half a mile from the shopping center .
“ ‘ Help me , Mike , I think I have killed someone , ’ ” Joseph Padilla quoted the suspect as telling his son .
Padilla said the youth appeared shaken and cried off and on for about 2 1/2 hours .

When he learned from a neighbor that there had been a shooting at the mall , Padilla said , he became suspicious and asked the sobbing youth to call his mother .
He did so , and at about 8:45 p.m. , the young suspect ’s mother arrived , along with Orange police officers , who took him into custody .
During his stay , Padilla said , the youth told Michael , “ ‘ I hope she lives .
Maybe I should be suffering the same thing Jacalyn is .’ ”
A few blocks from the Padillas ’ home , the Calabrese family was notified by a friend ’s telephone call that Jacalyn had been shot by one of her friends .
Her sister , Angie , and her mother , Gloria , rushed to the mall .
“ I pushed my way through the crowd , and I remember seeing a big pool of blood , ” said Angie Calabrese , 15 .

Her younger sister ’s body lay on a brown tile floor between planters of palms and poinsettias across from a Lane Bryant store .
White stars made out of branches hung from the ceiling above her .
Onlookers stared from the big glass windows of the nearby Sears store .
“ I do n’t think that this boy did this deliberately .
Kids do foolish things , ” said Gloria Calabrese , fighting to hold back tears .
“ This act . . . it ’s senseless and I do n’t think there ever will be an answer for anything so senseless . ”
Before Jacalyn Calabrese left for the mall , she was in the “ best of moods , ” her sister recalled .
“ She had just talked on the phone with ( the boy ) .
They decided to go to the mall .
He picked her up and away they went .
I do feel sorry for him .
I do n’t know what would have made him do such a thing .
They have been friends since fourth grade . ”
Family members said that services are planned for Saturday at St. Norbert Catholic Church in Orange .

At Cerro Villa -- the school Jacalyn and the boy attended -- the American flag flew at half - staff Tuesday .
Nine psychologists were assigned to the school to help students deal with any trauma that they may have felt as a result of the shooting , said Roger Duthoy , an assistant superintendent of the Orange Unified School District .
Dozens of the students met with the psychologists throughout the day Tuesday , some merely to discuss their feelings about Jacalyn and the boy .
“ For these 12 - and 13 - year - olds , there was a lot of soul - searching .
They wonder how could this possibly happen to a friend , ” said David Bastin , a psychologist for the district .
“ They want a way to blame somebody so the whole incident can be resolved immediately .
Some side with Jackie , some side with the boy .
But we ’re trying to tell them , do n’t place blame like this . ”
Before school , a group of 14 - year - old boys walked toward the 820 - student campus and talked about the shooting .
They said that their classmates had been known as a couple in elementary school and were still close friends .
Advertisement
“ He had a crush on Jackie , ” said John Novak , a 13 - year - old student .
Tim Crouse , 13 , who knew both students , said that going to school Tuesday was harder for him because his mother had been at the mall at the time of the shooting .
He said many of the girls at the school were crying openly .
Others wondered how they could raise money for a memorial .
“ I still ca n’t believe she ’s dead and that somebody we know killed her .
It ’s hard to believe that it can all happen all at once , ” Tim Crouse said .
Inside the mall Tuesday morning , stores opened as usual at 9 a.m.
Security gates to individual shops were pulled up .
Janitors swept the floor briskly , and sales clerks bustled , trying to bring about some normalcy .

But to many mall workers , it a measure of the holiday season had vanished , despite the blinking Christmas lights and glittering garlands over store entrances .
“ It ’s like somebody stole Christmas , ” said Monica O’Donnell , assistant manager of P.J. Sporting Goods .
“ It ’s all mellow instead of upbeat , sort of melancholy .
It ’s kind of all hitting us at once . ”
The brown - tiled seating area where Jacalyn was killed remained empty throughout the morning .

THE ACCESS ISSUE -- Authorities are concerned with the ease that youngsters are able to acquire guns .
A27
With abortion as one of the biggest remaining stumbling blocks in the health care reform push , Rep. Bart Stupak has been in high demand on political talk shows .
An antiabortion Democrat from Michigan , Stupak says he and at least 11 other House Democrats would vote against the Senate language on abortion , which he says would allow federal funding for abortions .
His biggest issue is in the proposed government - created health exchange ( for people who do not get their insurance through their employer ) , government subsidies could go to people who choose plans that cover abortions .
But Stupak has repeatedly raised another point as well .
" The bill that they 're using as the vehicle is the Senate bill , and if you go to page 2,069 through page 2,078 , you will find in there the federal government would directly subsidize abortions , plus every enrollee in the Office of Personnel Management enrolled plan , every enrollee has to pay a minimum of $ 1 per month towards reproductive rights , which includes abortions , " Stupak said in a Good Morning America interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos on March 4 , 2010 .
Stupak made similar statements in a Politico article on March 4 as well as in an interview with MSNBC's Chris Matthews on March 3 .
The Senate language on abortion was written by Sen. Ben Nelson , D - Neb. , who is an abortion opponent .
While the language Stupak penned for the House version would prohibit insurance companies in the exchange from offering abortion services , Nelson 's plan would allow companies to offer abortion services .
But Nelson sought to ensure those services would be paid through patient premiums , not federal subsidies .
In order to accomplish that , the Senate bill requires that all enrollees in plans that offer abortion services " without regard to the enrollee ’s age , sex , or family status " pay a separate amount to cover the actuarial value of abortion services for the entire population covered by the plan .
The insurer " may not estimate such a cost at less than $ 1 per enrollee , per month . "
So that 's where Stupak gets his $ 1 a month figure .
This is not necessarily an add - on cost .
Many health insurance experts quietly acknowledge what Slate 's Timothy Noah referred to as the " gruesome reality " that it actually costs insurance companies less to pay for abortions than it does to pay for prenatal care and delivery .
But the Senate bill specifically states that the actuarial estimate " may not take into account any cost reduction estimated to result from such services , including prenatal care , delivery , or postnatal care . "
So the set - aside for abortions is at least $ 1 , regardless of whether it costs less than a dollar , or whether it actually saves insurance companies money .
In other words , this $ 1 a month is not really over and above what someone would pay for their insurance otherwise .
It 's a mechanism to segregate a pot of money from insurance premiums ( rather than federal subsidies ) that would pay for abortions .
But Stupak did n't say the $ 1 a month was an additional cost , only that it would go " towards " abortion services .
And that 's correct .
But Stupak errs when he says that " every enrollee " would have to pay the $ 1 a month .
That extra dollar would be separated out only for people who select a plan that offers abortion services .
Someone could just as easily choose a plan that does not cover abortions .
In fact , the Senate bill requires that " with respect to multi-State qualified health plans offered in an Exchange , there is at least one such plan that does not provide coverage of ( abortion ) services . "
In other words , if you do n't want to participate in a health plan that offers abortion , and for which you 'll have to pay into an account specifically for abortions , you do n't have to .
We further note that the Senate bill also says that a state " may elect to prohibit abortion coverage in qualified health plans offered through an Exchange in such State if such State enacts a law to provide for such prohibition . "
So it 's not required for states to offer plans in the exchange that cover abortions ; but if they do have plans that offer abortion , they must also offer plans that do not .
Lara Cartwright - Smith of George Washington University 's public health school explains :
" The legislative language he 's referring to is about how the government determines the value of abortion coverage for plans offered through the Exchange to ensure that federal money is not used to pay for that coverage , " Cartwright - Smith said .
" This section does not apply to people who are covered outside of the Exchange , such as through an employer ’s health benefit plan .
Everyone buying insurance through the Exchange will have the option to enroll in a plan that does not include abortion .
Those people will not pay any amount for abortion coverage and no federal funds for that plan will have to be segregated .
" If , and only if , an enrollee selects an insurance plan that includes abortion coverage , then the value of that abortion coverage must be calculated and that amount must be segregated from the value of the rest of the benefits of that plan , so that the enrollee can pay for the abortion coverage separately with their own private money .
The calculated value of the abortion coverage must be at least $ 1 .
This process is to ensure that federal funds are n’t used to pay for abortion coverage .
These rules only apply to plans in the Exchange that include abortion coverage , so people who select a plan that does not include abortion will not have to pay for abortion coverage even if other plans in the Exchange do offer it . "
It 's also important to note , she said , that these rules are about abortions for which federal funding is not allowed , such as elective abortions .
Abortions for which federal funding is allowed , such as in cases of rape , incest or when necessary to save the life of the mother , may be covered by any plan in the exchange .
We called Stupak 's office , and they provided a statement from the congressman essentially acknowledging that his statement only refers to people who opt for a plan that covers abortions .
But he warned that many people will be unaware that a portion of their premium would be earmarked for abortion .
Stupak is correct that people who select a plan that covers abortions would have at least $ 1 a month of their premiums set aside for a fund that would pay for abortions performed for people in that plan .
And everyone in that plan , even men , would have to pay into that account .
But Stupak misspoke when he said , repeatedly , that " every enrollee " would have to pay into an account that would pay for abortions .
In fact , the issue does n't apply at all to people who choose a plan that does not cover abortion .
And every state must offer a plan that does not offer abortion .
Furthermore , people would have to be told up front if the plan they are considering covers abortions .
So when Stupak says that " every " person would need to set aside this abortion money , it 's not only wrong , we think it stokes misplaced outrage on an already highly charged issue .
We rule Stupak 's statement False .
Ciao a tutti !
Vorrei scrivere una recensione sull ' istruttore Kita .
Ho fatto con lui 90 ore di formazione ... .. continua a leggereCiao a tutti !
Vorrei scrivere una recensione sull ' istruttore Kita .
Ho fatto con lui 90 ore di formazione totali sia teroica che pratica in un arco di tempo che va dal Luglio 2017 ad oggi .
E' stato un percorso fantastico , non privo di momenti difficili .
Il mio giudizio sull ' istrutture è eccezionale .
Non ho mai visto una seduttore più preparato di lui .
Vi racconto solo un episodio .
Eravamo a Milano , in un locale del centro , di pomeriggio .
Mentre facevamo teoria si è seduta al tavolo a fianco al nostro una ragazza piuttosto carina .
Kita ha cominciato a parlarci .
Premetto che non avava l'aria della classica ragazza facile .
Dopo un paio di minuti circa Kita era seduto al suo tavolo .
Dopo meno di dieci minuti , le aveva già toccato le gambe diverse volte in maniera sensuale .
Dopo una ventina di minuti , non più di mezzo ' ora l'ha baciata .
Sottolineo che era di pomeriggio .
In un fast food .
Non di certo un'occasione in notturna in discoteca .
Che altro dire ?
Credo che l'aneddo parli da se .
Secondo me è un istruttore completo , competente sia sulla parte teorica che quella pratica .
E' inoltre un grande motivatore .
In un percorso come questo ci sono sicuramente momenti di scoraggiamento .
Insuccessi .
Ma la sua competenza nell ' analizzare le situazioni e trovare soluzioni hanno sempre dipanato ogni mio dubbio e portato ad alzare l'asticella sempre di più .
Vi parla una persona che in passato aveva una certa dimestichezza con le donne .
Non ero un seduttore ma avevo avuto le mie esperienze .
Anche numerose .
Poi un paio di episodi mi hanno messo k.o .
Quando ho incontrato Kita la prima volta , non riuscivo a parlare per più di 30 secondi con una donna approcciata per strada .
Nel nostro primo incontro , nello specifico un one to one , siamo partiti subito in quarta .
Dopo aver esaminato la mia situazione ed avermi spiegato un po ' di teoria la mattina , siamo andati in strada ed ho approcciato diverse ragazze .
Ricordo che per me è stata un'esperienza indimenticabile .
Ero gasatissimo .
Non mi ero mai sentito così .
Mi sentivo un altro .
Dopo il primo incontro ho approcciato una media di tre ragazze al giorno .
Mi sono fatto dare il numero da una ragazza tedesca che passeggiava per Milano di sera .
Sono uscito con lei qualche giorno dopo .
Ho passato una serata piacevole ed avrei potuto tranquillamente baciarla .
Ho preferito non farlo , nonostante fosse una bella donna , perchè non era il mio tipo .
Ci dev'essere rimasta anche un po ' male , poverina ...
Ma torniamo al corso di formazione :
Da gennaio 2018 fino ad oggi , abbiamo concordato assieme di fare un ciclo continuativo di incontri ben definiti .
Ci siamo visti quasi tutte le settimane con sessioni di 4 ore , sia di pomeriggio che in notturna .
Quello che mi stupiva è che in strada , tra un approccio e l'altro , sapeva sempre darmi uno spunto sensato , e a cui non avevo pensato , su come portare avanti ulteriormente le conversazioni tenute in strada dopo gli approcci .
Più passava il tempo e più il mio bagaglio si arricchiva .
Il mio modo di approcciarmi cambiava .
Vorrei sottolineare che ho più di 40 anni , non sono quindi un ragazzino di primo pelo ...
Nonostante questo sono cambiato e l'evoluzione più eclatante è avvenuta in discoteca .
Fino ad un mese e mezzo fa , in discoteca , non riuscivo a tenere una conversazione per più di un minuto con una ragazza .
Beh , l'ultima sera sono stato a parlare per circa due ore , se non di più con una perfetta sconosciuta che non era per niente male .
In un’altra occasione ho baciato sul collo una ragazza conosciuta da meno di un'ora .
Quando sono in discoteca ormai non ho più il minimo tentennamento nell ' approccio e nella conversazione .
E ' normale per me approcciare una ragazza e parlarci abbondantemente .
Manca ancora la parte fisica .
Come detto , tranne che in un episodio , mi sono limitato alla conversazione .
Ma rispetto a come ero partito è tantissimo .
Ci sarebbero altre mille cose che potrei scrivere .
Anche sulla parte Social mi ha aiutato tantissimo .
Mi ha dato un sacco di spunti interessanti .
Proprio la scorsa settimana sono uscito con una donna approcciata su un social network .
L'avevo fatto altre volte autonomamente concludendo con il sesso .
Però non mi era mai successo di essere io ad essere corteggiato dalla donna .
E' stata la prima volta che una donna mi ha detto LEI che voleva baciarmi .
Questo subito dopo esserci lasciati alla fine del primo appuntamento .
E mi ha baciato di SUA INIZIATIVA alla fine del secondo appuntamento .
Mi ha inoltre pregato più volte di rivederci e andare oltre .
Una donna piuttosto piacente .
Beh , mettermi nella condizione di essere corteggiato è un'esperienza unica .
Che consiglio davvero a chiunque .
Essere io il premio è un'esperienza che non mi capitava da più di dieci anni , forse quindici .
E questa , è la pura seppur dura verità .
Come scritto , ho terminato l'ultima sessione qualche giorno fa perchè sto cambiando città .
Ma , dopo quest 'esperienza , ho già prenotato una sessione di 40 ore ed un residenziale per quest 'estate .
Di lavoro ce n’è ancora da fare ma non mi spaventa .
Se sono arrivato fin qui e posso andare oltre .
Proseguirò il mio addestramento con Giulio solo a causa di esigenze logistiche .
Ma rivedrò Kita durante il prossimo residenziale in estate .
In definitiva consiglio fortemente Kita a chiunque volesse migliorare nell ' ambito della seduzione e a chi avesse bisgno di " sbloccarsi " .
Non è facile , almeno non lo è stato per me .
Costa fatica e ci vuole molta determinazione e forza di volontà .
Gli isuccessi naturalmente ci sono ma fanno parte del percorso ed è solo così che si può migliorare veramente .
E se lavorerete con Kita posso garantirvi che il successo alla fine è assicurato .
È solo questione di tempo .
Per quanto mi riguarda è diventato un amico , non solo un istruttore .
Il corso ha il suo costo ma vi assicuro che ne vale la pena .
Prova ne è che ho già prenotato come già detto , ulteriori 40 ore di sessioni più il residenziale .
Let 's charm ! 😉

Last week ’s winner of the Mogambo Most Stupid Quote Of The Week ( MMSQOTW ) goes to that arch- idiot , Barack Obama — after the contest judge ( me ) was found ( my wife tracked me down ) in a local tavern ( low - rent girlie bar ) , and was hurriedly sobered up ( to no avail ) with some hot coffee ( too weak ) and a lot of screaming from my wife ( loud ) , mostly centered about what a lowlife bastard I am ( with examples ) .
After being driven home with her loud snotty harangue as musical accompaniment , I ran across this startling AP news item entry , which was so shocking that it sobered me up pretty quick !
The most recent staggering stupidity ( our contest winner ! ) is from the White House , where  President Barack Obama said Thursday he wants to tax banks to recoup the public bailout of foundering firms at the height of the financial crisis .!
Hahaha !
End the Fed Ron Paul Best Price : $ 1.12 Buy New $ 8.53 ( as of 10:10 EST - Details )
I am sure that you , being the astute Junior Mogambo Ranger ( JMR ) that you are , are laughing merrily with along with me — Hahahahahaha ! — because this is so , so , so Theater - of - the - Absurd funny on so many , many , many levels , once you get beyond the horrifying , un - funny realization that it is abysmally , shockingly , alarmingly stupid on just the one level : it is a known fact that a tax on a business is just another expense to the business , like labor and raw materials , that is added to the prices that they must charge their customers in order to make a profit , which makes prices go up as the businesses raise prices to maintain their profit margins by recouping the tax they had to pay by , in case you have n’t been paying attention , raising prices , which is inflation , which is the one thing a country does NOT want , making a tax on business the most stupid thing you can do .
In this case , the banks will charge higher fees for their banking  services and charge higher interest rates to their customers , neither of which is a good thing for the people who have to pay the higher prices !
Hahahaha !
Economics in One Lesso ...
Hazlitt , Henry Best Price : $ 2.43 Buy New $ 7.43 ( as of 12:35 EST - Details )
And now that idiot Obama wants to raise banking prices and interest rates ( which affects all other prices , as interest rates are also an expense that must be recouped through the prices they charge ) so that the government can have more money to spend on itself and its greedy , grasping little friends ?
And so how much money are we talking about ?
Agora Financial ’s 5 - Minute Forecast finds that  Details are still shady , but we hear the measure is supposed to raise $ 90 billion over the next 10 years . 
Of course , my Initial Mogambo Reaction ( IMR ) is to laugh out loud at $ 9 billion a year , as it means a lot of hassle for a lot of people so that the government will get another measly $ 9 billion a year to spend , which , in the case of us profligate United Dumbheads of America , means that the idiotic Congress we elect will authorize the Treasury to borrow another $ 9 billion , plus postage and handling , so that the money supply will expand just a little , teeny bit more in a laughable attempt to keep interest rates low , low , low , even though the idiotic government is borrowing huge , huge , huge freaking huge amounts of money to spend in some bizarre attempt to repeal the Laws of Economic Nature , the most basic of which is that ( and you may want to write this down , especially if you are a Democrat or — dare I hope ?
— Obama himself ) there is no such thing as a free lunch .
Lies the Government To ... Andrew P. Napolitano Best Price : $ 0.25 Buy New $ 4.46 ( as of 12:15 EST - Details )
In fact , when I become emperor and have awesome powers and complete lack of liability , anybody who even suggests that there is such a thing as a free lunch  will have the phrase  There is no such thing as a free lunch  tattooed on their foreheads , so that the next time they say something stupid like , let ’s expand low - income housing  or , let ’s give free healthcare to illegal immigrants and everybody else who shows up asking for it ,  the listener can say ,  How in the hell can we do that , when there is no such thing as a free lunch , as you have already had tattooed on your forehead , you idiot ? 
Now that I am completely sobered up , let me tell you , without slurring my words or accidentally peeing in my pants , that there is no painless solution to the problems caused by excessive creation of money and credit to the point of unbelievable national and personal bankruptcies , AND there never has been one , AND there never will be one , AND that is why it is so important that you not create money and credit in the first place .
So if you are not personally bankrupt yet , then use all your money to buy as much gold , silver and oil that you can get your greedy , grubby mitts on , because such insane inflation in the money supply is going to result in terrifying , horrifying inflation in prices so that the recent travails of Zimbabwe ( which tried this Same Stupid Stunt ( SSS ) ) , whose currency went to literally zero value after annual inflation in prices soared past the trillion percent mark , will seem starkly familiar while making every day of the rest of your life into a living hell , while the prices of gold , silver and oil will soar right along with them , meaning that people who buy them do not get clobbered !
And that is why I always say ,  Whee !
This investing stuff is easy !
And look !
I just said it again !
Hahaha !

WASHINGTON
So , Barack Obama can lose his temper without a teleprompter .
And we have the supremely aggravating Bibi Netanyahu to thank for that .
On St. Patrick ’s Day , of all days , we would n’t want to think that our president did not know how to pick his donnybrooks .
The American government did unfortunately apologize to Col. Muammar el - Qaddafi , who got mad when a State Department spokesman correctly observed that the Libyan leader does n’t always make sense .
But in the case of a defiant Israel , the White House has not yet retreated into its usual compromising crouch .
Obama is so unpopular in Israel that he has nothing to lose by smacking our ally for its egregious treatment of the vice president .
Joe Biden , the great champion of Israel , was humiliated when Israel used the occasion of his visit to defy America and announce a plan for 1,600 more homes in the disputed East Jerusalem area .
KABUL ( Reuters ) - Long the world ’s largest producer of opium , the raw ingredient of heroin , Afghanistan has now become the top supplier of cannabis , with large - scale cultivation in half of its provinces , the United Nations said on Wednesday .
Between 10,000 and 24,000 hectares of cannabis are grown every year in Afghanistan , with major cultivation in 17 out 34 provinces , the U.N. drug agency ( UNODC ) said in its first report on cannabis production in Afghanistan .
While some countries grow cannabis on more land , Afghanistan ’s robust crop yields -- 145 kg of resin per hectare compared to around 40 kg per hectare in Morocco -- make it the world ’s largest producer , estimated at 1,500 - 3,500 tons a year .
“ This report shows that Afghanistan ’s drug problem is even more complex than just the opium trade , ” said Antonio Maria Costa , head of UNODC in the report .
“ Reducing Afghanistan ’s cannabis supply should be dealt with more seriously , as part of the national drug control strategy . ”
For years Afghanistan has been the world ’s largest producer of opium , a paste extracted from poppies and processed into heroin .
While land cultivated with poppies fell by 22 percent last year , record yields meant production fell only 10 percent .
FUNDING INSURGENTS
The illegal opium trade is said to fuel the insurgency in Afghanistan with the Taliban siphoning off millions of dollars from the trade by imposing taxes on farmers and smugglers in return for ensuring safe passage of the drug .
“ Like opium , cannabis cultivation , production and trafficking are taxed by those who control the territory , providing an additional source of revenue for insurgents , ” the report said .
As with opium , most cannabis cultivation takes place in the south of the country where the insurgency is strongest , UNODC said , with more than two - thirds ( 67 percent ) of cannabis farmers also growing opium .
One of the main reasons cannabis is so widely grown , UNODC said , is because of its low labor costs and high returns .
Three times cheaper to cultivate than opium , the net income from a hectare of cannabis is $ 3,341 compared to $ 2,005 for opium .
“ The entire process is a non-expensive , fast industrial process , which is indeed somewhat worrying , ” Jean - Luc Lemahieu , head of UNODC in Afghanistan , told reporters in Kabul .
“ We have already enough problems with the opium so we do n’t want to see the cannabis taking over . ”
Afghanistan still grows far more opium than cannabis , however , and Lemahieu said it was unlikely to overtake the poppy crop as it required a lot of water to grow -- in short supply in Afghanistan -- and had a very short shelf life .
“ You can walk around with opium for 10 to 15 years and , perhaps , like the wine it gets better with the time .
For cannabis ... you need to process it really immediately , ” said Lemahieu .
While cannabis production in 2009 was valued at an estimated $ 39 - 94 million , this is only about 10 - 20 percent of the total farm - gate value of Afghanistan ’s opium production , because so much more opium is grown .
While some of the cannabis is consumed within Afghanistan , most of the drug is smuggled abroad following the same routes as opium , UNODC said .
In 2008 , 245,000 kg of cannabis was seized in southern Kandahar near to the border with Pakistan .
“ As with opium , the bottom line is to improve security and development in drug - producing regions in order to wean farmers off illicit crops and into sustainable , licit livelihoods , and to deny insurgents another source of illicit income , ” Costa said .
RealNetworks just screwed us all by settling lawsuits in which it might have lost–but which might also have given some new life to fair use for digital media .
The post -RealDVD world means that unless there 's a major change to the law surrounding copy protection , there will never be a legal way to perform legal acts of copying or shifting protected movies , music , and games .
Take it from a guy who has a special E Ticket .
The major movie studios can never sue me nor four other individuals ever for a variety of media - moving activities that you and 300 million other Americans could be subject to lawsuits over .
It 's like a superpower .
More on how we got this pass later .
The suits in question revolve around RealDVD , software Real introduced in September 2008 that would copy the full contents of a video DVD to a file that could be played back on a Windows system .
RealDVD is not a DVD ripper : those programs use one of many methods to strip the Content Scramble System ( CSS ) , the DRM that wraps up DVD content , and other defensive techniques .
CSS and its ilk are n't precisely defended by technology –the standards are too weak or poorly executed – but by law .
The much - excoriated Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) prohibits " circumvention " of software that 's designed to prevent copying .
Breaking DRM encryption breaks the law .
But Real went through the steps to obtain a license from the DVD Copy Control Association ( DCCA ) , which controls CSS on behalf of the movie industry .
RealDVD decrypted the DVD , copied it , and then locked it tight .
Up to five PCs licensed by the same person could play back the discs .
( Real also broke through a couple of unrelated protection efforts . )
RealNetworks must have calculated that as a company with a large war chest , it could succeed where others did n't dare to tread .
As soon as it released RealDVD , it preemptively sued the DCCA and several studios to establish that it had the right to use CSS in the way RealDVD did .
The studios and DCCA sued in return , and got software sales halted .
The studios won in August 2009 ; Real appealed .
The settlement on Monday clears all the suits by RealNetworks agreeing to never sell the software again , refund the money to about 2,700 RealDVD purchasers , disable an associated metadata service , and pay $ 4.5 million to several movie studios , its Rhapsody partner Viacom , and the DCCA to cover legal and other expenses .
Some people may truly hate RealNetworks for its mediocre RealPlayer software ( once a technical miracle ) that was bundled with poorly disclosed third - party adware programs .
But RealDVD was a thin blade trying to shimmy open the door of fair use .
Fair use is a maddeningly ambiguous set of rules enshrined in copyright law that mention nothing whatsoever about personal use and copying .
Court decisions have shaped fair - use exemptions to copyright laws .
Congress has passed extremely narrow copyright exclusions for personal use as well .
Without testing specific ideas about fair use or copyright scope in court , there 's no sure way to know whether your particular software program , Web site , tweet , or steampunk - based laser decrypter is n't in violation .
When the MPAA or a studio sues you , you could potentially plow through millions of dollars with no idea of the outcome .
You can always be sued , but you want to make sure that you have some basis on which to defend yourself , especially if the law and court decisions firmly back you up .
As BoingBoing recently reported about its battle with MagicJack , a group without crazily deep pockets can win and recover costs when it has a strong idea it is in the right .
( BoingBoing benefitted from the California strategic lawsuit against public participation or SLAPP , which would n't apply to software and hardware . )
That what was made the RealDVD suits so exciting , because Real has hundreds of millions of dollars in the bank , and had a pugnacious CEO , Rob Glaser .
Glaser faced down Microsoft over unfair competition and got nearly $ 800 million from the Windows maker .
( Glaser was forced out as head of Real a few weeks ago , although he intended to move on after an executive search ; he remains chairman of the board and owns nearly 40 percent of the firm . )
Even better , Real was n't promoting piracy , or the broad right to rip DVDs into an unprotected format and then move them onto all kinds of devices for playback .
RealDVD was very very narrow in purpose : can individuals buy software that converts one kind of protected content on a specific physical medium into another , with even stronger encryption ?
Back in 2002 , I joined a model lawsuit brought by the Electronic Frontier Foundation , what became known as Newmark v Turner ( after Craig Newmark of craigslist , one of four other co-plaintiffs ) .
The EFF wanted Newmark v to be joined to a lawsuit originated in 2001 by 28 movie studios , TV production firms , and cable operators against SonicBlue , which made ReplayTV , a digital video recorder that was at one point mildly superior to TiVo .
You may recall the ReplayTV suit , which begat the statement in a magazine interview from then chief executive of Turner Broadcasting that skipping ads was " theft , " and that not watching ads was breaking a contract .
He said , " There 's a certain amount of tolerance for going to the bathroom . "
The industry later tried to backpedal from these statements .
Our suit was a way to try to establish that consumers had rights in this fight among firms : that time - shifting ( recording for later consumption ) and space - shifting ( moving among devices under our control for personal use ) were perfectly acceptable , and that we were in danger of losing such rights .
Ad skipping was also part of the suit .
Remarkably , a judge agreed to join us in the fight , to the surprise , we think , of the 28 media firms .
That would have been ugly had we gone to trial .
We faced some potential ( though unlikely ) penalties were it to be proved that we had violated copyright in our efforts to establish we had used media fairly .
The media firms had a big problem , though , in that it would have been an ugly public - relations battle to try to paint Craig Newmark , your humble reporter , and three other mild - mannered individuals as horrible scofflaws .
Had we won , we would have enshrined a judicial opinion that would have perhaps emboldened consumer - electronics firms and software makers to create products that put much more control over recorded programs in the hands of consumers .
Instead , SonicBlue went bankrupt and sold its assets to another firm that removed the features in question in 2003 .
The media firms then dismissed their lawsuit against the companies involved .
Here 's where it gets interesting .
I had completely forgotten until researching the case to write this editorial that the 28 firms gave Craig , me , and our three fellow plaintiffs a " covenant not to sue " for the acts in question .
That essentially nullified the suit because we had no more fear of litigation .
( The EFF tried to get the same rights for all ReplayTV owners , just 5,000 people , but failed when the judge would n't move the case into class - action status . )
So we are copyright superheroes , with the ability to advance ads in a single click , shift content among hardware , and watch at our leisure !
Behold us , and despair , for you will not see our like again .
RealNetworks needs to work with studios , so it settled and paid less than 1 percent of its still - giant cash hoard–last year , the company 's cash was of greater value than its market capitalization for several months –to be able to move forward on content licensing .
I can understand why they did it , but it resembles the Google Book Settlement , a massive effort by Google to get a special judicial and settlement right to not be sued for selling works to which the owner cannot be found and to which it does not have assigned rights ( so - called orphan works ) .
If Google succeeds , then no other firm will go through the expensive litigation that allowed Google to reach the point where it can settle and win in cooperation with the Authors Guild and the Association of American Publishers .
Google will have a de facto monopoly .
It 's unlikely that any other firm with the resources to challenge the media industry will release software or hardware that would allow DVD conversion in a manner that a court could find legal .
Real was the last , great hope , because any other similar firm already has multi-million to multi-billion - dollar deals in play .
Apple , Microsoft , and others are n't going to release anything that jeopardizes how they work with giant copyright holders .
That leads to the conclusion that in order to make legal copies , you are obliged to be a pirate .
Media companies ' failure to accommodate the notion that people may have legitimate purposes for making digital copies for their own use dooms them to eternal piracy .
We 're all screwed .
Well , I 'm not , probably .
But you are .
( Disclosure : About a decade ago , a company I helped incubate was bought by RealNetworks , and I received a modest amount of stock , long since sold . )
This screw - in coffin seems very economical , both in saving ground space and not having to have heavy equipment to lower your family members into the ground .
Cemeteries have limited ground in meatspace , so putting people in edgewise just makes sense .

If you want to be relatively free of the fear of not knowing enough about your health that you have to rely on others to make big decisions for you , it 's critical that you take some time to learn about how your body works .
The goal of this series of articles is to give you a broad look at the major organ systems in your body and how they work together to keep you well .
As you read this series , I encourage you to adopt the mindset of having to learn this material well enough to teach it to a group of junior high school students - this mindset should lead to an excellent understanding of how to care for your health .
Before we look at the major organ systems that work to keep you well , let 's first review some basic definitions .
You 're likely familiar with most or all of the major organs in your body .
Your brain , heart , lungs , kidneys , stomach , liver , gall bladder , spleen , and pancreas are well known examples of organs .
Less well known as organs are your bones and skin .
Your organs are collections of specialized tissues , and your tissues are collections of groups of cells .
So in reverse order , a simple , big picture look at your anatomical make - up looks like this :
Your cells are the basic living units that make up your body .
Groups of cells come together to form specialized tissues .
Groups of tissues come together to form your organs .
This bird 's eye view of your physical make - up is important because it highlights the following point :
The health of every organ in your body is determined by the health of the cells that make up your organs .
When the majority of cells that make up any organ in your body are healthy , that organ is likely to be healthy ; the converse is true as well - when most of the cells that make up one of your organs are dysfunctional or diseased , that organ is likely to be dysfunctional .
Given all of the above , it makes sense , then , that taking care of your organs requires that you take care of your cells .
The most important determinant of the health of every cell in your body is the quality of blood that is supplied for ongoing nourishment and removal of waste products .
The blood that your heart pumps to all of your cells delivers nutrients and oxygen to fuel ongoing energy production within your cells .
Steady blood flow also ensures regular removal of waste materials from your cells , which keeps your cells uncluttered and free to function properly .
The cells that make up your heart are no different than the rest of the cells in your body - your cardiac cells also require a steady supply of blood , nutrients , and oxygen , and your cardiac cells receive these things via your coronary arteries .
So just as your heart delivers nutrients and oxygen to the cells of your kidneys , stomach , and liver , your heart also delivers nutrients and oxygen to its own cells .
If , over time , your coronary arteries become damaged and less capable of delivering a steady supply of blood to the cells of your heart , you may experience chest pain , shortness of breath , and other symptoms that are typical of a heart attack .
Heart attacks are usually caused by some degree of blockage in the coronary arteries .
If the cells of your heart do n't receive steady , quality blood flow , your heart will eventually lose its capacity to pump blood , nutrients , and oxygen to the rest of your body .
The main point here is this : all of the cells that make up the many organs in your body have the same basic requirements to stay healthy , with the first and most important requirement being steady blood flow .
Clearly , the healthier your diet and lifestyle are , the healthier your blood will be .
And the healthier your blood is , the healthier your cells will be .
It 's true that certain foods and substances are known to have specific effects on specific organs .
For example , we know that eating foods that are rich in the omega - 3 fatty acid , DHA , is good for promoting optimal brain function .
We also know that eating foods that are rich in vitamin D can help promote healthy bones and teeth .
But it 's incorrect to think that these nutrients produce only these specific results .
When you eat foods that are rich in DHA and vitamin D , these nutrients touch all of your cells , not just the cells that make up your brain , bones , and teeth .
In the same vein , when you expose yourself to prescription drugs , recreational drugs , and other environmental pollutants , all of your cells are touched - there is no such thing as a " side " effect .
So now that we 've hammered home the principle that the health of your organs is determined by the health of your cells , and that the health of your cells is determined by all of your daily food and lifestyle choices , let 's move on to an overview of your organ systems .
You have eleven organ systems that govern all of your physiological activities .
They are as follows :
Nervous System Endocrine System Cardiovascular System Respiratory System Digestive System Urinary System Muscular System Skeletal System Integumentary ( Skin ) System Immune System ( includes Lymphatic System ) Reproductive System
Aside :
Not included in any of the organ systems listed above are " special sense " organs that you need to see , hear , smell , taste , and maintain your balance .
Each of your organ systems are groups of organs that work together to carry out specific duties in your body .
For example , your digestive system is an organ system that requires contributions from a number of organs , including your stomach , small intestine , large intestine , liver , pancreas , and gall bladder ; all of these organs work together to digest the foods that you eat , and transfer the nutrients in the foods that you eat from your small intestine to your cells .
Some organs contribute essential work to more than one organ system .
For example , your pancreas plays an important role within your digestive system by secreting digestive enzymes into your small intestine , but your pancreas is also an irreplaceable component of your endocrine system , as it produces three important hormones that are secreted into your bloodstream and have system - wide effects .
Finally , it 's important to point out that all of your organ systems affect one another .
We 've already looked at one example of this :
Your cardiovascular system keeps all of your other organ systems going by supplying blood , nutrients , and oxygen to all of your cells .
Here are more examples that illustrate the interdependence of your organ systems :
All of your organ systems are regulated by your nervous and endocrine systems - these two systems are co-directors of all of your body 's moment - to - moment activities .
Your urinary system is essential to maintaining fluid and pH balance within all of your organ systems .
Your respiratory system brings in the oxygen that your cardiovascular system delivers to all of your cells .
Your respiratory system also plays a vital role in maintaining your blood pH .
Your integumentary ( skin ) and immune systems play critical roles in preventing life - threatening infections of all of your other organ systems .
Your muscular system allows you to move ( making the rest of your organ systems relevant to your existence ) .
Your muscular system also serves as an important reservoir for your endocrine system .
Your skeletal system provides physical protection and structural support for your other organ systems .
And perhaps the most obvious example :
Your digestive system provides fuel for all of your other organ systems to use to produce energy .
We 'll look at each of your organ systems in more detail in future articles in this series on how your body works .
Here are the main points to take away from this article :
All of your organs are influenced by all of your food and lifestyle choices .
There 's virtually no way to affect just one organ system via a specific diet or therapy .
Whenever one of your organ systems improves or declines in health , the rest of your organ systems follow suit to some degree .
The health of each of your organs is determined by the health of the cells that make up your organs .
And all of your cells have the same basic requirements to stay healthy .

Implementing a dropbox service with the Blobstore API ( Part 1 )
Posted by Nick Johnson | Filed under python , app- engine , blobstore , datastore , filehangar
The blobstore api is a recent addition to the App Engine platform , and makes it possible to upload and serve large files ( currently up to 50 MB ) .
It 's also one of the most complex APIs to use , as it has several moving parts .
This short series will demonstrate how to implement a dropbox type file hosting service on App Engine , using the Blobstore API .
To start , we 'll cover the basics needed to upload files , keep track of them in the datastore , and serve them back to users .
First up is the upload form .
This step is fairly straightforward :
We create a standard HTML form , only we generate the URL to post to by calling blobstore .
create_upload_url , and passing it the URL of the handler we want called by it .
Here 's the handler code :
class FileUploadFormHandler( BaseHandler ) : @util.login_required def get ( self ) : self.render_template(" upload.html " , { ' form_url ' : blobstore.create_upload_url ('/ upload ' ) , ' logout_url ' : users.create_logout_url('/' ) , } )
Standard stuff - though it 's worth pointing out that , for convenience , we 're using the login_required decorator from the google .
appengine.ext.webapp.util package to require users to be logged in ( and redirect them to the login form if they 're not ) .
And here 's the template that it renders :
< html > < head > < title >
File Hangar : Upload file </ title > </ head > < body > < p style = " float : right " >< a href= " {{logout_url}} " > Log Out</a></p> < h1 > Upload a file to App Engine File Hangar </ h1 > < form method = " POST " action= " {{ form_url}} " enctype=" multipart / form-data " > < input type =" file " name = " file " />< br /> < input type =" submit " value= " Upload " /> </ form > </ body > </html >
Note the attributes on the form element :
The method must be POST , and the enctype attribute must be supplied , and must be " multipart / form - data " , or the upload will not work !
Next , we want to write the upload handler .
First , we need to define a model for storing information about our uploaded file in the datastore .
Here 's our model :
class FileInfo( db. Model ) : blob = blobstore.BlobReferenceProperty( required =True ) uploaded_by = db.UserProperty ( required =True ) uploaded_at = db.DateTimeProperty( required =True , auto_now_add=True )
A fairly standard model , with the exception of the ' blob ' property , which is of type blobstore .
BlobReferenceProperty .
A BlobReferenceProperty behaves much like a regular ReferenceProperty , only instead of referencing another model , it references a Blob .
On retrieving it , a BlobInfo object is returned .
Here 's the code that handles the actual upload :
class FileUploadHandler(blobstore_handlers.BlobstoreUploadHandler ) : def post ( self ) : blob_info = self.get_uploads ( ) [ 0 ] if not users.get_current_user ( ) : blob_info.delete( ) self.redirect(users.create_login_url ( " / " ) ) return file_info = FileInfo( blob=blob_info.key ( ) , uploaded_by=users.get_current_user ( ) ) db.put( file_info ) self.redirect ( " / file / %d " % ( file_info.key ( ) .id ( ) , ) )
This is a little more complex , so let 's step through it .
First , this handler extends BlobstoreUploadHandler instead of the regular webapp .
RequestHandler class .
BlobstoreUploadHandler defines a utility method , self.get_uploads ( ) , which returns a list of BlobInfo objects , one for each uploaded file .
In get ( ) , we call self.get_uploads ( ) , and extract the first element .
Because the Blobstore API does n't currently support multiple uploads in a single form , this will always return exactly one element , so we simply extract that element .
Next , we guard against a non-logged - in user somehow submitting the form .
We can't use the login_required decorator here , because we need to delete the uploaded file if it was not authorized .
Finally , we create a datastore entity for the uploaded file , and redirect the user to the info page on the newly uploaded file .
The next step is to implement the handler that retrieves and shows information about the uploaded file .
It 's quite straightforward :
class FileInfoHandler ( BaseHandler ) : def get ( self , file_id ) : file_info = FileInfo.get_by_id(long( file_id ) ) if not file_info : self.error( 404 ) return self.render_template ( " info.html " , { ' file_info ' : file_info , ' logout_url ' : users.create_logout_url('/' ) , } )
And here 's the template it renders :
< html > < head > < title >
File Hangar : File information </ title > </ head > < body > < p style = " float : right " >< a href= " {{logout_url}} " > Log Out</a></p> < h1 > File information </ h1 > < table > < tr>< th > Filename</th><td>{{file_info.blob.filename}}</td></tr > < tr>< th> Size</th><td>{{file_info.blob.size}} bytes</td></tr>
< tr>< th> Uploaded </th><td>{{file_info.uploaded_at}}</td></tr> < tr>< th> Uploaded by </th><td>{{file_info.uploaded_by}}</td></tr> < tr>< th> Content Type</th><td>{{file_info.blob.content_type}}</td></tr> </table > < p >< a href= " /file/{{file_info.key.id}}/download"
>Download this file </a></p> </ body > </html >
Finally , the handler to actually send the file to the user when requested :
class FileDownloadHandler(blobstore_handlers.BlobstoreDownloadHandler ) : def get ( self , file_id ) : file_info = FileInfo.get_by_id(long( file_id ) ) if not file_info or not file_info.blob : self.error( 404 ) return self.send_blob(file_info.blob , save_as=True )
Here , we fetch the FileInfo entity by key , and , if it exists and the blob it references exists , we call the utility method send_blob , provided by our parent class , BlobstoreDownloadHandler .
We pass the extra argument ' save_as ' set to True , which ensures the file gets sent for downloading , not for inline display in the browser .
We could also supply a filename instead of the value True , to specify the filename we want for it ; the default is the name it was uploaded with .
This article only scratched the surface of what we can do with Blobstore serving , and to a large extent , you could find a lot of this in the docs .
It 's necessary groundwork , however , as in the next post , we 'll be doing something all new : Adding support for JavaScript or Flash based upload widgets , for a better user experience !

One of the things that distinguishes libertarians from regular conservatives is that libertarians really like to think of themselves as scrappy underdogs , and are far less comfortable with the idea that they 're aligned with powerful economic interests .
So , for instance , libertarians have an unusually strong emotional investment in the idea that their opposition to health care reform is a way of standing up to powerful interests like the insurance industry .
Here is Jacob Sullum arguing in Reason that insurers actually favor Obama 's proposal :
Obama 's plan to tame health insurers would boost their business , protect them from competition , and guarantee their profits , all at the expense of consumers and taxpayers .
It is therefore not surprising that the insurance companies , while they object to the president ’s rhetoric and quibble over some of the details , are happy to be domesticated .
The rest of Sullum 's article consists of some speculation as to how reform would work that runs along the libertarian model of some corporatist nightmare .
The sole bit of real - world evidence he introduces to show that insurers actually do support Obama 's plan is an anodyne press release from the insurance lobby objected to the way Democrats have vilified their industry and proclaiming , " We strongly support health care reform that covers everyone with a uniform , secure safety net . "
Supporting the general principle of health care reform , of course , is very different than supporting Obama 's actual plan , and nowhere does the press release suggest the latter .
So , do insurance companies actually support Obama 's plan ?
No , they do n't :
Major business groups Tuesday announced a multimillion - dollar ad campaign to stop President Barack Obama 's health care overhaul as it approaches a make - or - break vote in the House .
The ad buy , costing between $ 4 million and $ 10 million , will start Wednesday on national cable TV outlets .
Later in the week , the campaign shifts to 17 states home to moderate and conservative Democrats .
Their votes are critical to Obama 's endgame for passing legislation to expand coverage and revamp the health insurance market .
The timing of the ads comes as Obama is building up momentum in his final health care drive .
But congressional Democratic leaders are still short of the votes to pass the bill , and they 're courting many of the same lawmakers targeted by the business groups .
Health insurance companies , excoriated by Obama over a recent spate of double - digit premium hikes , are helping to pay for the ads , said Bruce Josten , a top lobbyist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , coordinating the campaign .
Look , it 's certainly true that insurers were negotiating in good faith with Democrats for a long time .
The best read of the evidence was that the industry opposed reform , but considered reform likely to pass and was looking to protect itself from the worst - case scenario .
Libertarians looked at this situation and , squinting their eyes just the right way , saw a massive hand - in - glove corporatist conspiracy .
And there were the libertarians , fighting their brave battle against big business and big government .
But the jig is up .
Libertarians may love the idea that they 're fighting against the insurers , but they 're not .

Comic Description :
So this space is to explain our comic , I take it ?
I guess it 's exactly what the Commander says in the first strip , a temp agency for ridiculously macho guys who have trouble adjusting to a world where crushing people 's heads with your bare hands is n't considered socially acceptable .
As one of my friends put it , something like The Expendables meets the Office .
I opted to go for some one - line gags for the venue of a four - strip sample set , but if the judges like what they see there is ample opportunity for short story arcs fleshing out the Commander and other original characters in the story with company picnics , camping trips , bar nights , paintball and all those other ostensibly macho endavours .
Real Polce Box Hartnell TARDIS Tom Baker Prop John Nathan - Turner Era Paul McGann prop Russell T Davies Era
Not everyone realises that the TARDIS in Doctor Who has changed many times , and those that do many not realise quite how much it changed .
Then again , maybe the differences are only visible to those amongst us who do n't get out enough -
Those whose lives are enlivened by doing diagrams such as the one above showing the main TARDIS props to scale .
I am unhealthily delighted by creating such diagrams , and if seeing such a diagram delights you , then read on .
Version 1 - Season One - Peter Brachacki
The designer responsible for the first Doctor Who serial was Peter Brachacki and as such the very first TARDIS shape is his " design " .
At a glance it is a reasonably faithful reproduction of those Police Boxes which could be seen on the streets of England in the sixties , but there are differences .
Its roof stacks were not tall enough , and nor was its top ' pyramid ' which resulted in the whole prop being a lot shorter than a real box .
The panels had less margin around them and the overall box was narrower .
It had a St John Ambulance logo on the door and a faithful arrangement of hammered glass window panes .
One interesting thing to note is that the lock of the original TARDIS was on the left door , and there were no door handles .
The prop remained relatively unchanged throughout the sixties , although in season two it's rounded glass lamp was replaced by a cylindrical plastic one with a large , pillared black cage .
There was also quite a refurbishment for The War Machines , and inconsistencies can be seen between the location footage and the studio recording .
Another " version " of the ship worth mentioning was seen at the end of The Massacre during double - banking and a very ropey couple of sides were knocked up to go with a front panel ( shown on the right ) .
Version 1 b
Season Four - Peter Brachacki
Year four of Doctor Who saw a reconstruction of the roof of the Police Box .
When the TARDIS landed in a cave in The Smugglers , the tall stack had been reduced in height by about fifty percent but the same lamp was retained .
The image on the left shows the season four TARDIS with a dotted blue line showing how high it had previously been .
The prop was further modified around May 1967 when the doors were refitted , and the telephone sign panel was reattached on the wrong side .
This unusual sight can be first seen in The Evil of the Daleks ( on the right ) .
This right - handed appearance lasted into the following season five ( model shots in Tomb of the Cybermen not withstanding ) and can be seen clearly in both The Enemy of the World and The Web of Fear .
The final appearance of the phone panel on the right hand side was in episode one of The Wheel in Space .
For the following season six , the prop was refurbished again and the wrongly - positioned phone sign was finally corrected in advance of filming of The Dominators in the last week of April 1968 .
In The Invasion the TARDIS police box acquired two handles ; one on the phone panel and one on the right door , and the key - hole switched over to the right door .
Pictured right .
For the The Seeds of Death , the sign on the telephone compartment door changed considerably .
The new version is different in layout , font , size and colour .
The black - on - white became white - on - blue and the words " FOR USE OF PUBLIC " were all run together on one line .
The word " and " was replaced in two places with an ampersand ( & ) which would be retained to the present day .
This version of the prop continued on into the third Doctor 's era ( revealing its colour ) and it looked ever more neglected throughout season eight .
In season nine it got a repaint and it became vivid blue , whilst the plaque changed again from a blue background to a black one .
For Jon Pertwee 's final season the TARDIS gained a new , simpler light which changed again slightly and the prop was refurbished and repainted for season thirteen ( pictured left ) .
This prop lasted in one form or another for an amazing thirteen years of production - which must only come second to a couple of the Dalek props for the record of continued use of an original TV prop .
Version 2 - Season Fourteen - Barry Newbery Following the deterioration and ultimate alleged collapse of what remained of the original , a new prop was created by Barry Newbery for the start of season fourteen , and it featured from The Masque of Mandragora up to and including The Horns of Nimon .
This prop had the least in common with the old London Police Boxes , but the phone plaque at least regained its full frame and it also switched back to white text on a blue background whilst reverting to the original configuration of having the word " PUBLIC " appearing largest .
One strange thing occurred however , as the letter 's ' was dropped from the word " officers " .
Aside from a couple of changes of the lamp ( including turning into an actual rotating Police car light in The Armageddon Factor ) this prop remained in use for four of Tom Baker 's middle years .
However this Newbery prop made three guest appearances - One in Logopolis with a built up roof ( making it look considerable better ) , then in Castrovalva , and finally in Black Orchid .
It was during a refurbishment for the Castrovalva cameo , that the wording on the telephone plaque was changed which would have a knock - on effect in the 21st century .
During the episode the TARDIS was only seen on its side and from a distance , but publicity photos of the new Doctor shows that where it used to say " officer and cars respond to urgent calls " it now says " officer and cars respond to all calls . "
Version 3 - Season Eighteen - Tom Yardley - Jones John Nathan - Turner had a new prop created in fibreglass for The Leisure Hive , with a stacked roof more faithful to the first sixties prop , and its plaque featured the correct " urgent calls " wording .
It was designed by Tom Yardley - Jones .
One interesting thing to note about this prop is that it had a switchable front and rear , with one face having left - opening priority and the other having right - opening priority .
For this reason the door sign was n't permanently attached so that it could be swapped over for whichever face was being the front on that particular recording session .
A handy way to tell which side is being shown ( assuming the door is n't open ) is that the lock is fixed on whichever door has priority on that face .
The fibreglass prop had a different type of ' sign - box ' over the door .
Whereas normally the recess for the lettering was only the width of the words themselves , the new prop 's sign - box had the entire surface carrying the wording , with only a thin frame around the very edge .
The difference is shown on the right with the old Newbery sign ( top ) and the new one ( middle ) .
During Time Flight , the sign boxes curiously begin to change , and over the doors an old Newbery - type sign is used , and on the left side of the TARDIS a new thick - frame version appears ( bottom ) .
For the following season , all the sign - boxes has become the thick - framed variety .
The TARDIS got a darker , slightly greyish repaint in season twenty , and the door - sign changed from " urgent calls " to the incorrect Newbery revamp version which said " all calls " .
( The wording was normal again the following season , but wrong again in The Two Doctors ! )
For season twenty - three a second copy of this fibreglass prop was created from the original molds .
Although with less detailing in the edge , this prop 's sign - box returned the narrower frame , and the Mk 1 prop was fitted with replacement narrow - framed boxes too , making the two props look reasonably consistent .
The door handle on the Mk 2 prop was placed above the lock and this can be used to tell them apart , although the Mk 1 was ageing badly and always looked in worse condition throughout the remainder of the 80s .
The proper word " urgent " made its final appearance on the door - sign at the end of Trial of a Time Lord and throughout the Sylvester McCoy era the plaque carried the incorrect " all calls " phrase .
Despite the availability of the newer box , it only appeared in Time and the Rani , Paradise Towers , Dragonfire , The Happiness Patrol and The Curse of Fenric .
The original , battered Mk 1 box is used in the other seven stories including the final episode of the ' classic ' series of Doctor Who ;Survival .
Version 4 - The TV Movie - Hudolin For the Paul McGann TV Movie , a new prop was commissioned by Philip Segal to more closely match the William Hartnell TARDIS .
The 1980s fibreglass plans were used as a staring point but some modifications were made so that the columns were more pronounced and the panels set further back , taking away that " flat " feel that the 80s version had .
It had an original fresnel navigation lamp complete with brass rims , and a special yale / ankh combination keyhole .
Version 5 - The New Series - Colin Richmond
For the resurrection of the series in 2005 a new TARDIS shell was created .
To be more specific , four were created at first .
This prop was designed by one of Ed Thomas 's Art Department team : a desiner called Colin Richmond .
His interpretation was considerably wider and taller than any box that had gone before .
For example , the doors of the new prop are 6 ' 10 " high , whereas the original prop 's door were only 6 ' 6 " .
These inaccuraces in the dimensions were actually a deliberate design choice , and Ed Thomas himself recited that old myth that ' Metropolitan Police Boxes came in various shapes and sizes . '
As you might know if you 've read the history of the real Police Box , this in fact this was never the case , and the Metropolitan ' TARDIS ' Police Box was a specific Type 2 MacKenzie - Trench design , for which there was only design .
These ' TARDIS ' type Police Boxes were also always built from pre-cast concrete ( the material is even specified in the original blueprints ) , so it 's therefore strange to know that Ed Thomas ' went to great pains to make sure it looked wooden ' .
The only wooden component of the Police Box was the door ( made of teak ) and the only fully - wooden Boxes were scattered around the country looking like garden sheds and were not the familiar Metropolitan Design .
It is a shame that this misinformation is so often used to give justification to the strange distortions performed on this supposedly perfect disguise for a time machine .
The windows of the 2005 of the were lit around the frames to try to create the illusion that it was bright on the inside , but this looked odd when the patches of illumination stuck to the window when the door opened , plus the new back - lit photographic blowup of the console room was never bright enough to explain the amount of light in the windows .
The plaque on the telephone door panel was black lettering on a white ( actually metallic silver ) background , not seen since the first sixties prop , however it still used the ugly ampersands , and had the " s " missing from " officer " , and it also had the incorrect " all calls " wording first seen in Castrovalva .
This error came about because this plaque was copied off a replica which had itself been copied from the incorrect eighties version .
Due to the weight of the props and the damage caused to them , a new fifth prop was made out of fibreglass which featured from The Christmas Invasion onwards and the incorrect plaque was continued for the following series .
Version 5a - Matt Smith
A new prop was constructed for the 2010 series of Doctor Who , in almost exactly the same dimensions as the 2005 box .
In accordance with Steven Moffat 's wishes , the new box was given a repaint in the style of the Peter Cushing prop which made it look closer to a real Police Box , despite still retaining its ' shot and fat ' stature .
The St John Ambulance logo returned to the prop for the first time in 45 years and the window frames were once again white with the bottom corner panes made to mimick the hammered glass of the real boxes .
A very authentic - looking fresnel lantern also adorned the top of this box .
The Peter Cushing TARDIS
For the two 1960s Peter Cushing film versions of Doctor Who in which a human creates his own time machine , a very faithful reproduction of a Police Box was built .
The main difference between the TV prop and the film version was that the doors opened outwards .
The doors and interior of the prop were shown to be painted white .
From Sociological Images :
The Florida Family Policy Council [ a conservative Christian organization ] sent out a message about a judge 's ruling to allow a lesbian couple to adopt a relative 's child they had been fostering .
The FFPC , which opposes gay adoption , sent out an alert to its members and including an image of the couple … well , in theory .
On the left is the photo included with the alert ; on the right is a photo of the actual couple .
It 's very obvious use of a stereotype what lesbians look like as a scare tactic .
The actual couple does n't fit the ideal of the androgynous - looking , angry , mannish lesbian couple .
They look like nice middle or upper - middle class professional women who can raise a child perfectly well .
They 're attractive by mainstream heterosexual norms of femininity .
They look happy and non-threatening .
They are simply not sufficiently menacing .
As Nicole points out , the couple on the left is n't just a stereotype of lesbians , it 's associated with a particular working - class aesthetic , especially the mullets .
They are n't thin and conventionally attractive like the couple on the right .
The FFPC says the use of the wrong image was a mistake .
Though it seems they 've made similar errors before when alerting members about gays and lesbians trying to adopt children .

Shortly after the Moon formed , an asteroid smacked into its southern hemisphere and gouged out a truly enormous crater , the South Pole - Aitken basin , almost 1,500 miles across and more than five miles deep .
" This is the biggest , deepest crater on the Moon -- an abyss that could engulf the United States from the East Coast through Texas , " said Noah Petro of NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md . The impact punched into the layers of the lunar crust , scattering that material across the Moon and into space .
The tremendous heat of the impact also melted part of the floor of the crater , turning it into a sea of molten rock .
That was just an opening shot .
Asteroid bombardment over billions of years has left the lunar surface pockmarked with craters of all sizes , and covered with solidified lava , rubble , and dust .
Glimpses of the original surface , or crust , are rare , and views into the deep crust are rarer still .
Fortunately , a crater on the edge of the South Pole - Aitken basin may provide just such a view .
Called the Apollo Basin and formed by the later impact of a smaller asteroid , it still measures a respectable 300 miles across .
" It 's like going into your basement and digging a deeper hole , " said Petro .
" We believe the central part of the Apollo Basin may expose a portion of the Moon 's lower crust .
If correct , this may be one of just a few places on the Moon where we have a view into the deep lunar crust , because it 's not covered by volcanic material as many other such deep areas are .
Just as geologists can reconstruct Earth 's history by analyzing a cross-section of rock layers exposed by a canyon or a road cut , we can begin to understand the early lunar history by studying what 's being revealed in Apollo . "
Petro presents his result March 4 during the Lunar and Planetary Science meeting in Houston , Texas .

Petro and his team made the discovery with the Moon Mineralogy Mapper ( M3 ) , a NASA instrument on board India 's Chandrayaan - 1 lunar - orbiting spacecraft .
Analysis of the light ( spectra ) in images from this instrument revealed that portions of the interior of Apollo have a similar composition to the impact melt in the South Pole - Aitken ( SPA ) basin .
As you go deeper into the Moon , the crust contains minerals have greater amounts of iron .
When the Moon first formed , it was largely molten .
Minerals containing heavier elements , like iron , sank down toward the core , and minerals with lighter elements , like silicon , potassium , and sodium , floated to the top , forming the original lunar crust .
" The asteroid that created the SPA basin probably carved through the crust and perhaps into the upper mantle .
The impact melt that solidified to form the central floor of SPA would have been a mixture of all those layers .
We expect to see that it has slightly more iron than the bottom of Apollo , since it went deeper into the crust .
This is what we found with M3 .
However , we also see that this area in Apollo has more iron than the surrounding lunar highlands , indicating Apollo has uncovered a layer of the lunar crust between what is typically seen on the surface and that in the deepest craters like SPA , " said Petro .
The lower crust exposed by Apollo survived the impact that created SPA probably because it was on the edge of SPA , several hundred miles from where the impact occurred , according to Petro .
Both SPA and Apollo are estimated to be among the oldest lunar craters , based on the large number of smaller craters superimposed on top of them .
As time passes , old craters get covered up with new ones , so a crater count provides a relative age ; a crater riddled with additional craters is older than one that appears relatively clean , with few craters overlying it .
As craters form , they break up the crust and form a regolith , a layer of broken up rock and dust , like a soil on the Earth .
advertisement
Although the Apollo basin is ancient and covered with regolith , it still gives a useful view of the lower crust because the smaller meteorite impacts that create most of the regolith do n't scatter material very far .
" Calculations of how the regolith forms indicate that at least 50 percent of the regolith is locally derived , " said Petro .
" So although what we 're seeing with M3 has been ground up , it still mostly represents the lower crust . "
It 's likely Earth was n't spared the abusive asteroid bombardment experienced by the Moon .
Giant craters on other worlds across the solar system , including Mercury and Mars , indicate the rain from the heavens was widespread .
However , on Earth , the record of these events was rubbed out long ago .
The crust gets recycled by plate tectonics and weathered by wind and rain , erasing ancient impact craters .
" The Apollo and SPA basins give us a window into the earliest history of the Moon , and the Moon gives us a window into the violent youth of Earth , " said Petro .
The research was funded by NASA 's Discovery program , which conducts lower - cost , highly focused planetary science investigations designed to enhance our understanding of the solar system .
M3 is managed by NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , Calif .
Petro's team includes researchers from NASA Goddard , the University of Maryland , College Park , Brown University , Providence , R.I. , Analytical Imaging and Geophysics , LLC , Boulder , Colo. , the University of Tennessee , Knoxville , the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency , Arlington , Va. , and the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory , Laurel , Md .
Bulgarian side lurch from one disaster to another .
Latest : player kidnaps TV star .
Really .
For the past year or so , rumours have been circulating Manchester City are preparing to star in their own reality TV show .
However , the chancing bigwigs at production company Endemol might want to hold fire before signing a deal with the petro - dollar powered Mancunians .
Based on the past week ’s events , it seems Bulgarian top flight side CSKA Sofia have enough entertaining material for at least three series , a Christmas episode and a come - back special …
The story begins at the start of the month , when CSKA ’s local paper , The Sofia Echo , ran an expose on the club ’s fantastically decrepit stadium , revealing the ground is so old it ’s been deemed unsafe to operate at full capacity .
Five days later , Cameroon international goalkeeper Daniel Bekono was fired from the club due to ‘ disciplinary offences ’ after skipping one too many training sessions .
Then on Sunday , a match against Lokomotiv Mezdra was abandoned after 65 minutes , when 100 CSKA fans rushed the pitch throwing stones and whatever else they could get their hands on after going 1 - 0 down .
The next day the team was slapped with a three - match stadium ban and a fine of $ 10,000 , while Mezdra , despite failing to pay police to supervise the game , were only handed a one - match penalty .
On Tuesday the Bulgarian Football Union ( BFU ) decided to tack on an extra three goals to CSKA ’s misery , awarding Mezdra a 4 - 0 win .
A day later , 21 - year - old forward Orlin Orlinov was arrested by police for kidnapping and assaulting Bulgarian reality TV star Katherine Vacheva , leaving her with a broken nose , concussion and ‘ brain injuries ’ .
She told police :
“ He dragged me for a few metres , there was a trail of blood .
He said – you are a beautiful woman , and all beautiful women deserve to be beaten ”
Good grief .
And there ’s more .
Later that afternoon , CSKA president Dimitar Borisov went to the papers threatening to pull his team out of the league , after manager Ioan Andone announced he was ready to leave the club over the ‘ unjust ’ BFU ban .
And it ’s not over yet .
1,400 police officers are being stationed in downtown Sofia tomorrow , in anticipation for the derby match between CSKA and league champions Levski Sofia .
Considering previous meetings between the two have resulted in a fan getting blown up by a bomb , The Spoiler has a feeling CSKA ’s worst week is set to continue .

The UK's DNA database is the biggest in the world Thousands of prisoners in England and Wales may not be on the national DNA database , the Tories have claimed .
They accused the government of being more concerned about collecting the profiles of innocent people than those of convicted criminals .
The Home Office said the vast majority of inmates were on the database but it did not know the exact number .
Ministers are changing the law to retrospectively add anyone convicted of a serious offence to the database .
Police will soon be able to take DNA samples from anyone convicted of a violent or sexual offence even if they are no longer in custody .
' Innocent majority '
At present , there are about six million profiles on the national DNA database , making it the biggest in the world .
Some 30,000 more are added every month .
The National DNA database in numbers Some 975,000 of the profiles were taken from people who have never been convicted of an offence .
As of last week , there were 83,755 people in jail in England and Wales .
But the Conservatives say the Home Office was unable to answer a parliamentary question about what proportion of prisoners were on the national DNA database .
We should make sure that anyone convicted of a serious crime has their DNA records kept , but not the innocent majority
Damian Green MP
link text here
In a statement to the BBC , a Home Office spokesman said the " vast majority " of prisoners were on the database .
Damian Green , shadow immigration minister , said the figures showed the government was pursuing a policy of growing the database for the sake of it .
" It is shocking that the government has no idea how many dangerous criminals do not have their DNA on the database , " he said .
" They seem more concerned with collecting the data of innocent people than convicted criminals .
" The database should help the police .
So let 's concentrate on where it can help the police most .
" We should make sure that anyone convicted of a serious crime has their DNA records kept , but not the innocent majority . "
Home Office Minister Alan Campbell said in his answer to Mr Green that police had had the power to retain DNA taken from those convicted of recordable offences since the establishment of the DNA database in 1995 .
He said legal powers had existed since 1996 to take samples from all prisoners and there had been two sampling projects in jails to identify inmates not on the system .
Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne said the Home Office had revealed in 2008 that there were 2.3 m people on the Police National Computer for a conviction , caution , reprimand or warning who were not in the DNA database .
" Among the most serious offenders are those serving long sentences that began before 2002 and they are the most likely not to be on the DNA database , " he said .
" The government 's policy puts the wrong people on the database while leaving some of the most dangerous criminals off it . "

A HONG Kong man , taken to the hospital to have a cucumber removed from his bottom , told doctors he inserted it in a suicide attempt .
The Sun reported Chin Wei , 62 , said the method was a variation of the Japanese ritual suicide hara - kiri - usually carried out with a sword plunged into one 's own stomach .
He was found in a pool of blood by his daughter before being rushed to receive medical health .
Medics said a severe tear to the man 's anus was not life - threatening .

74 days after the iPhone was introduced at $ 600 a pop ( six hundred dollars ) , one million were sold .
The Droid , at $ 200 : 1.05 million .
The Nexus One ?
An estimated 135,000 units .
By any measure , that 's a total sales flop .

These numbers do n't add up because the phone is good .
The Nexus One is only sold online and though T - Mobile , but 135,000 units is a ridiculously tiny amount .
Especially when the Nexus
One was announced for a long time on the most popular web page in the world : The Google home page .
Only the Nexus One and Google 's Chrome have been announced in that sacred place , which is used by a gigazillion people every day .
It 's the most watched , most expensive advertising spot on the planet .

Even worse :
The sales rate is declining .
After its first month , the Nexus One sold 80,000 units .
That 's means that only 55,000 additional units sold in the next month .
For a cellphone that is being named and talked about every single day by every single tech publication , and often mentioned in the mainstream media , that 's quite embarrassing .

Why is this happening ?
Again , the Nexus One is a nice cellphone .
Is it really that you can only buy it online ?
The iPad sold online , for a higher price and without no phone capabilities , yet it sold an estimated 152,000 units in the first weekend .
And products like the Kindle are doing good sales with an online - only sales model .

The problem does n't seem to be about awareness of the product , either .
According to Crowdscience latest market study :
Awareness of the Google Nexus
One phone itself following launch was found to be 91 % amongst iPhone users , 75 % amongst Blackberry users , and 73 % amongst users of other smartphones .

So , practically , most of the smartphone users out there know about the Nexus One .
Perhaps is a combination of reasons or something else we are missing , but somewhere in Cupertino , someone is laughing this morning .

God of War III is a violent slasher game designed for angry console playing sessions .
It is the third instalment of a series that saw its first outing 5 years ago .
Its plot is minimal , its gameplay is not far off random button mashing – certainly on the easier levels and it is reasonably fun to play if you are somewhat pissed off .
It is a very macho , very male game .
It will also be highly controversial .
It has an interactive sex scene it .
Not unlike the other games in the series .
It looks far from realistic .
It is graphically a boost up from the Playstation 2 , but below that of what is now being developed for the PS3 .
More playstation 2.5 than PS3 .
A video of it is here :
http://www.gametrailers.com/video/-contains-nudity-god-of-war/62769
( Contains very simulated nudity )
You do not see the actual sex act , but you do see two semi naked women “ watching ” and you have to press buttons , when told to .
Known as quick time events in gaming ( very frustrating and completely pointless ) .
You can absolutely guarantee that some politico will demand that the game is banned .
You can absolutely guarantee that this will generate publicity and that of course will only boost sales .
The game will be targeted at an 18 + audience but you know that once the poutrage starts , school boys will want the game and they will pester their parents to buy it .
That of course will lead to more publicity because after all the parents are absolved , it is a game after all .
Not quite seeing that they are in the wrong for buying an adult game for a child .
Parents should not be buying boys adult games .
That is the point of age ratings .
There are very few parents who would buy their sons violent movies , never mind porn films , yet they have no problem buying their angelic little sprog some violent game – after all it is only a game , and then they complain it .
If a parent bought their 12 year old a porn film they would probably have child protection banging on the door .
If they buy them a game , the games company gets blamed .
All this poutrage does is create more sales .
If politicos do not jump up and down screaming think of the children there will be no hype .
If there is no hype there is no sales boost .
So how about politicos ending this cycle by not screaming about it , especially when there are more important issues to get excitable about ?
Then the game gets reviewed , reviewers consider it average hack and slash , those that were going to buy it , buy it , those that would have been hyped in to buying it do not .
How about parents not buying an adult game for children so then there will be no complaints about children seeing this ?
Is any of this too much to ask ?
The Middle East quartet has strongly denounced Israeli moves to build 1,600 new homes in East Jerusalem and urged the Israeli government and Palestinians to resume peace negotiations .
In a hard - hitting statement after a meeting in Moscow , the UN , the EU , Russia and the US condemned Israel 's " unilateral " construction plans and said the status of Jerusalem could only be resolved through negotiations between both parties .
The UN secretary general , Ban Ki-moon , said : " The quartet condemns the decision by the government of Israel to advance planning for new housing units in East Jerusalem . "
The quartet expected that talks between Israelis and Palestinians should lead to a negotiated settlement that " within 24 months " ends the occupation of Palestinian territories begun in 1967 .
The settlement should result " in the emergence of an independent , democratic , and viable Palestinian state living side by side in peace and security with Israel and its other neighbours " .
The quartet includes Hillary Clinton for the US ; Russia 's foreign secretary , Sergei Lavrov ; Tony Blair , the quartet 's special representative ; and Lady Ashton , the EU foreign policy chief .
The statement expressed deep alarm at the deteriorating situation in Gaza , urging Israel to lift its blockade of the Gaza Strip for both humanitarian and commercial traffic and calling for a " durable resolution to the Gaza crisis " .
Clinton said she had spoken last night to the Israel prime minister , Binyamin Netanyahu , following his apparent offer of " confidence - building measures " to encourage the renewal of peace talks .
She described the conversation as " very useful and productive …
We do n't believe unilateral action by any parties are helpful .
We 've made this clear . "
None of the quartet parties were willing to say what pressure they were prepared to put on Israel should it ignore today 's statement .
The quartet called on Israel to freeze all settlement activity " including natural growth " , to dismantle outposts erected since March 2001 , and to " refrain from demolitions and evictions in East Jerusalem " .
It also appealed for the international community to back the Palestinians ' commitment to build an independent state by offering immediate and concrete support .
A statement from Netanyahu 's office said he proposed a series of steps that would make it easier for the Palestinians to join the talks .
He did not specify what these would be , but they could include easing Israeli roadblocks in the West Bank , the withdrawal of Israeli troops from more parts of the West Bank and the release of Palestinian prisoners .
He did not announce , as the US had demanded , a freeze on the construction of Jewish homes in Ramat Shlomo in East Jerusalem , the key sticking point .
But diplomats in Washington , Moscow and Jerusalem said Netanyahu had privately promised a temporary freeze on new construction .
The work , while not cancelled , is to be postponed for several years .
The Israeli ambassador to the US , Michael Oren , told the Washington Post : " The goal of both sides at this point is to put this behind us and go forward with the proximity talks as quickly as possible . "
This morning Ban said the Israeli government had approved several long - standing UN humanitarian programmes in Gaza , including a water and sanitation project , a flour mill , temporary schools and 150 houses .
The UN secretary general said he would be travelling to Gaza on Sunday to see the situation on the ground there himself , following yesterday 's visit by Lady Ashton .
The EU foreign policy chief is understood to have been shocked by her trip to Gaza , privately describing it as " worse than Haiti " .
Asked about her phone conversation with Netanyahu , Clinton today struck a more conciliatory note following her comments last week that Israel 's building plans for East Jerusalem – announced during a visit by the US vice - president , Joe Biden – were " insulting " .
Of US - Israeli ties , she said : " Our relationship is ongoing .
It is deep and broad .
It is strong and enduring . "
She went on : " We believe that the launch of the proximity talks is very much in Israel 's interests , as it is in the interests of the Palestinians .
We hope to see these talks commence as soon as possible . "
A US state department spokesman , PJ Crowley , said Clinton and Netanyahu had discussed " specific steps " to improve the outlook for Middle East peace talks .
Netanyahu 's spokesman , Nir Chefetz , said the prime minister had proposed " mutual confidence - building steps " that both Israel and the Palestinians could take .
Last night Israel retaliated for a Palestinian rocket attack that killed a Thai agricultural worker .
Israeli planes struck at least two targets in Gaza , officials and witnesses said .
The quartet condemned yesterday 's rocket attack from Gaza and called for " an immediate end to violence and terror and for calm to be respected " .
It also urged the release of the captive Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit .
Police blitzed an industrial estate in Campbellfield last night in a crackdown against hoon drivers , checking out 200 cars .
Twenty two cars were impounded and 80 notices of unroadworthiness were issued during the blitz at an industrial estate that is notorious for illegal drag - racing .
Up to 300 onlookers who gathered to watch the event were each hit with $ 200 fines from Hume Council , police said , while the Sheriff 's Office recovered about $ 115,000 in outstanding fines .
The Environment Protection Authority ( EPA ) also handed out 33 notices for noise pollution offences .

Applications running up to three times faster on Android devices , with longer battery and just the same processor as in your existing device ?
Sounds too good to be true , does n’t it , but according to mobile software company – and OHA member – Myriad that ’s just what we can expect from Dalvik Turbo .
Dalvik Turbo is , as the name suggests , a supercharged version of the underlying Dalvik virtual machine that ’s used by the various Java apps that run on an Android phone .
Myriad reckon their updated build can boost performance by up to three times , without breaking backward compatibility with previous apps .
Myriad will be demonstrating Dalvik Turbo at Mobile World Congress 2010 next week , and we ’re hoping that it ’ll start showing up in Android builds soon after .

Sara Galimberti is Italy ’s Hottest Track Star ( 25 PICS )
Okay I ’m going to go on record here saying that Allison Stokke still reigns supreme with the hottest pictures EVER of a track star ( the one where she ’s holding the pole and leaning backwards is the best ) .
That ’s just one picture though .
Sara Galimberti may not have that one recognizable photo , but she ’s got an amazing body and has actually even received some awards for her looks as well as her athletic talents .
Galimberti is 18 years old and is mostly known for her running on the track .
She competes in the 800 and 1500 meter races .
She is from Lombardia , Italy and actually is the 5 - time regional champion there in both those races .
She also has placed 3rd at the Italian Junior Championships .
But that ’s not all .
She has actually recently entered in some beauty contests , and was named Miss Lombardia earlier this year .
Looking at the pictures of this gorgeous young lady you can tell why she won .
Oh and she also entered the Miss Italy competition but fell short there .
I guess being the most beautiful track star does n’t necessarily make you the most beautiful woman in all of Italy , but I can forgive her for that , I mean look at that face ?
How could you stay mad ?
Hopefully Miss Galimberti continues competing in both track and pageants , and we get the honor of seeing more pictures of her circulate around the web .

Weaponizing Mozart
How Britain is using classical music as a form of social control
In recent years Britain has become the Willy Wonka of social control , churning out increasingly creepy , bizarre , and fantastic methods for policing the populace .
But our weaponization of classical music — where Mozart , Beethoven , and other greats have been turned into tools of state repression — marks a new low .
We 're already the kings of CCTV .
An estimated 20 per cent of the world 's CCTV cameras are in the UK , a remarkable achievement for an island that occupies only 0.2 per cent of the world 's inhabitable landmass .
A few years ago some local authorities introduced the Mosquito , a gadget that emits a noise that sounds like a faint buzz to people over the age of 20 but which is so high - pitched , so piercing , and so unbearable to the delicate ear drums of anyone under 20 that they cannot remain in earshot .
It 's designed to drive away unruly youth from public spaces , yet is so brutally indiscriminate that it also drives away good kids , terrifies toddlers , and wakes sleeping babes .
Police in the West of England recently started using super - bright halogen lights to temporarily blind misbehaving youngsters .
From helicopters , the cops beam the spotlights at youths drinking or loitering in parks , in the hope that they will become so bamboozled that ( when they recover their eyesight ) they will stagger home .
And recently police in Liverpool boasted about making Britain 's first - ever arrest by unmanned flying drone .
Inspired , it seems , by Britain and America 's robot planes in Afghanistan , the Liverpool cops used a remote - control helicopter fitted with CCTV ( of course ) to catch a car thief .
Britain might not make steel anymore , or cars , or pop music worth listening to , but , boy , are we world - beaters when it comes to tyranny .
And now classical music , which was once taught to young people as a way of elevating their minds and tingling their souls , is being mined for its potential as a deterrent against bad behavior .
In January it was revealed that West Park School , in Derby in the midlands of England , was " subjecting " ( its words ) badly behaved children to Mozart and others .
In " special detentions , " the children are forced to endure two hours of classical music both as a relaxant ( the headmaster claims it calms them down ) and as a deterrent against future bad behavior ( apparently the number of disruptive pupils has fallen by 60 per cent since the detentions were introduced . )
One news report says some of the children who have endured this Mozart authoritarianism now find classical music unbearable .
As one critical commentator said , they will probably " go into adulthood associating great music — the most bewitchingly lovely sounds on Earth — with a punitive slap on the chops . "
This is what passes for education in Britain today : teaching kids to think " Danger ! " whenever they hear Mozart 's Requiem or some other piece of musical genius .
The classical music detentions at West Park School are only the latest experiment in using and abusing some of humanity 's greatest cultural achievements to reprimand youth .
Across the UK , local councils and other public institutions now play recorded classical music through speakers at bus -stops , in parking lots , outside department stores , and elsewhere .
No , not because they think the public will appreciate these sweet sounds ( they think we are uncultured grunts ) , but because they hope it will make naughty youngsters flee .
Tyne and Wear in the north of England was one of the first parts of the UK to weaponize classical music .
In the early 2000s , the local railway company decided to do something about the " problem " of " youths hanging around " its train stations .
The young people were " not getting up to criminal activities , " admitted Tyne and Wear Metro , but they were " swearing , smoking at stations and harassing passengers . "
So the railway company unleashed " blasts of Mozart and Vivaldi . "
Apparently it was a roaring success .
The youth fled .
" They seem to loathe [ the music ] , " said the proud railway guy .
" It 's pretty uncool to be seen hanging around somewhere when Mozart is playing . "
He said the most successful deterrent music included the Pastoral Symphony by Beethoven , Symphony No. 2 by Rachmaninov , and Piano Concerto No. 2 by Shostakovich .
( That last one I can kind of understand . )
In Yorkshire in the north of England , the local council has started playing classical music through vandal - proof speakers at " troublesome bus - stops " between 7:30 PM and 11:30 PM .
Shops in Worcester , Bristol , and North Wales have also taken to " firing out " bursts of classical music to ward of feckless youngsters .
In Holywood ( in County Down in Northern Ireland , not to be confused with Hollywood in California ) , local businesspeople encouraged the council to pipe classical music as a way of getting rid of youngsters who were spitting in the street and doing graffiti .
And apparently classical music defeats street art :
The graffiti levels fell .
Anthony Burgess 's nightmare vision of an elite using high culture as a " punitive slap on the chops " for low youth has come true .
In Burgess 's 1962 dystopian novel A Clockwork Orange , famously filmed by Stanley Kubrick in 1971 , the unruly youngster Alex is subjected to " the Ludovico Technique " by the crazed authorities .
Forced to take drugs that induce nausea and to watch graphically violent movies for two weeks , while simultaneously listening to Beethoven , Alex is slowly rewired and re-moulded .
But he rebels , especially against the use of classical music as punishment .
Pleading with his therapists to turn the music off , he tells them that " Ludwig van " did nothing wrong , he " only made music . "
He tells the doctors it 's a sin to turn him against Beethoven and take away his love of music .
But they ignore him .
At the end of it all , Alex is no longer able to listen to his favorite music without feeling distressed .
A bit like that schoolboy in Derby who now sticks his fingers in his ears when he hears Mozart .
The weaponization of classical music speaks volumes about the British elite 's authoritarianism and cultural backwardness .
They 're so desperate to control youth — but from a distance , without actually having to engage with them — that they will film their every move , fire high - pitched noises in their ears , shine lights in their eyes , and bombard them with Mozart .
And they have so little faith in young people 's intellectual abilities , in their capacity and their willingness to engage with humanity 's highest forms of art , that they imagine Beethoven and Mozart and others will be repugnant to young ears .
Of course , this becomes a self - fulfilling prophecy .
The dangerous message being sent to young people is clear : 1 ) you are scum ; 2 ) classical music is not a wonder of the human world , it 's a repellent against mildly anti-social behavior .

Who needs a Space Shuttle ?
Amazing pictures of Earth captured by one man , a balloon and his compact camera
Advertisement
The unearthly beauty of this image taken high above the planet would make Nasa proud .
But it did n't need millions of pounds of technology to capture .
Just a little British ingenuity that saw a standard digital camera taped to a helium balloon and floated into the sky .
Stratospheric : Robert Harrison captured images of the Earth like this one using a Canon Sure Shot camera fixed in a polystyrene box and attached to a helium balloon
Achievement : Mr Harrison guided the balloon to a height of 22 miles above the Earth 's surface and was able to recover the camera as it parachuted back down to earth using a sat-nav device
Ingenious : Robert Harrison with his creation , a camera enclosed in a polystyrene box .
He then used GPS tracking technology similar to an in - car sat-nav to follow its progress
Space enthusiast Robert Harrison managed to send his home - made contraption 22 miles - or 116,160 feet - above the earth 's surface from his back garden .
He used GPS tracking technology similar to an in - car sat-nav to follow its progress - and an attached radio transmitter to find it when it parachutes back to earth .
The photos taken by his device were so spectacular that Nasa has been in touch to see how he achieved it .
Mr Harrison 's budget of £ 500 might also offer inspiration to the new UK Space Agency , which launches on April 1 .
Based in Swindon , with only one astronaut and a budget one 50th the size of Nasa 's , it will be looking for cut - price ways to reach for the sky .
Mr Harrison first got the idea to explore space after a failed attempt to take aerial pictures of his house using a remote control helicopter .
After investigating high - altitude weather balloons on the internet , he launched his first mini spacecraft , named Icarus I , in October 2008 .
It took dramatic shots that spanned 1,000 miles of the Earth 's surface , showing the curvature - of the earth .
He has since sent a dozen capsules into space .
' My family and friends thought I was a bit mad at first but they were suitably impressed with the results , ' said the married father of three from Highburton , West Yorkshire .
' The pictures speak for themselves .
People think this is something that costs millions but it does n't . '
Before launch , the camera is attached to a tiny computer programmed to trigger a photo every five minutes .
It is wrapped in loft insulation bought from a DIY store then placed in a polystyrene box .
When the balloon reaches the 22 - mile - high mark it pops because the air pressure is too weak to keep the helium inside .
As the box falls a mini- parachute automatically opens .
Mr Harrison has recovered it from up to 50 miles away .
Ed Vaizey claims he became ' an avid listener ' to the digital station over the weekend , after calling for BBC cuts last week
Ed Vaizey , the shadow culture minister who last week welcomed the BBC 's package of cuts , has changed his tune , calling for the digital radio station 6 Music to be saved .
Last week Vaizey commented in the Guardian that the BBC 's proposals to cut internet , radio and TV services were " intelligent and sensible " .
However , MediaGuardian.co.uk can reveal that when challenged by an angry fans of the station , he admitted he had not heard the station before but claimed he had become an avid fan over the weekend .
This was part of a public backlash over the closure of 6 Music , which included tens of thousands of supporters protesting via Twitter and Facebook .
" Having not listened to 6 Music , I took it on trust that the BBC knew what it was doing in this regard , " said Vaizey in response to an email sent by a member of the public who took him to task over his support for the package of cuts .
" Several things have happened since I spoke out .
I had no strong views on 6 Music on Friday , I now know it is brilliant with a passionate and articulate fan base – I am now an avid listener to 6 Music .
I suspect that 6 Music has doubled its audience .
I strongly suspect 6 Music will be saved . "
However , Vaizey added that the ultimate decision on the closure , or otherwise , of 6 Music lay with the corporation and the BBC Trust .
He added that he also believed that the package of cuts marked the " beginning of the debate " , and although the BBC Trust is due to put out a public consultation on the proposals , " there is no reason to assume that what is proposed is what will happen " .
" I decided to support the general thrust of the proposals in public because there are others who want the BBC to go much further in terms of reducing their service , " said Vaizey .
" I thought it would be helpful to the BBC to signal that their efforts , in trying to reduce the scope of some of their services , were recognised . "

Two of the world 's leading providers of online services have criticised the federal government 's plan to censor internet content as heavy handed .
Both Google and Yahoo say the government 's plans to introduce a mandatory internet filter threaten to restrict legitimate access to information .
" Our primary concern is that the scope of content to be filtered is too wide , " Google said .
The comments are included in a list of a 174 submissions related to the filtering policy , released on Tuesday by Communications Minister Stephen Conroy .

Quadruplet Sisters All Work in Same Job
In what is surely one of the oddest twists of fate , the Hwang sisters , identical quads , have all gotten nursing jobs and are working at the very same South Korean hospital where they were born twenty - one years ago !
The coincidence stretches even a bit further .
Hwang Suel and her three sisters , Seol , Sol and Milall , began their training on the same day at Gacheon University Gil Hospital in Incheon , one of the leading hospitals not only in Korea but also in all of Northeast Asia .
Known for its outstanding medical professionals and state - of - the art facilities , the hospital began as a small Gynecology and Obstetrics clinic back in 1958 .
This is the second time these amazing quads have been in the headlines ; the first being when they were born as Korea ’s second ever set of identical quadruplets .
Quadruplets are very rare and they occur when four eggs are released and fertilized at once , or when one egg splits into four , or one egg splits into three with the fourth one fertilized , two eggs split into two , or one egg splits and two are fertilized .
The quads are delighted with their accomplishments and their futures all look bright .
“ I feel like I ’m a real nurse since I am wearing this yellow - green gown , and I ’m looking forward to meeting a lot of people , ” said Seol , the second - oldest quad .
The hospital staff has welcomed the new nurses with open arms .
“ I would like to praise the mother for raising all four girls … with such good care .
I look forward to seeing these four women becoming great nurses like Florence Nightingale . ”
Well Florence Nightingale was one thing , but four of her is something else again !
Can you imagine a person suffering from a lapse of or defective vision seeing all four nurses walking into the hospital room at the same time ?
Talk about seeing double !
What do YOU think about this ?

Gary Gensler — regulator and , yes , Goldman alum — has distinguished himself in Washington .
As CFTC Chairman , he ’s fought to impose stricter rules on OTC derivatives and recently proposed rules that would cut the leverage currency traders are allowed to deploy from 100:1 to 10:1 .
Lest we all forget how dangerous leverage can be when traders misuse it , there ’s LTCM to serve as exhibit A .
In a clear sign that Gensler is fighting the good fight , traders are screaming about the proposed rule .
Fantastic .
From Carolyn Cui and Sarah Lynch at WSJ : Foes take on leverage curbs from CFTC
An attempt by regulators to protect investors from volatile global currency markets has triggered an uproar among lawmakers , currency dealers and thousands of small traders .
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has proposed rules that would reduce the amount of borrowed funds that retail investors can use when investing in the U.S. foreign - exchange market to as much as 10 - to - 1 , from the existing 100 - to - 1 for major currencies .
Under current rules , a customer putting up a security deposit of $ 1,000 in cash will be able to trade a notional amount of $ 100,000 , a common contract size for currencies such as the dollar and the Japanese yen .
The new rule would cap that amount at $ 10,000 .
The rules also would require dealers to abide by new capital and disclosure requirements .
If the rules come into force , investors would be required to either put more capital in their accounts or pare their positions .
Unfortunately , what I ’d like to start calling “ the politics of easy credit ” may get in the way of this sensible new rule :
“ If our leverage rules are 10 - to - 1 and leverage rules elsewhere are 100 - to - 1 , the business is going to move elsewhere , ” House Agriculture committee member Jim Marshall ( D. , Ga. ) said .
Thanks Congressman Marshall , for protecting American entrants in the race to the bottom .
As I argued yesterday , on the one hand we want tougher financial reforms , but reforms are related in the sense that they ’re all designed to reduce the availability of credit .
Call it what you want : leverage , credit , debt finance .
Americans love the stuff because it magnifies rewards .
The less you put down for an investment — whether you ’re a bank , mortgagee or currency trader — the more juice that comes back to you if a trade goes right .
If the trade goes wrong you risk outright collapse , but bet big enough such that your failure is “ systemically risky ” and you can count on a bailout .
The article notes that the “ huge risk - reward potential makes the [ forex trading ] market a hotbed for scams .
From Dec. ’ 00 to Sept. ’09 , more than 26 k customers received $ 476 m in restitution in 114 forex fraud cases pursued by CFTC . ”
Over 106 months , 114 frauds .
Yeah , we ’re with Gensler on this one .
no game was evr expressed more perfectly , love the fact you included all of it .
even the coins on the first circle .
the tube with luigi is simply beyond brilliant !!!!!!!!!!

Easter is a major Christian holiday too , so it should have its own version of the popular Christmas Tree .
Strangely enough , such a thing as an Easter tree already exists , and it can be found in Germany .
Around 1945 , when he was just a young boy , Volker Kraft saw his very first Easter Tree ( Eierbaum , Osterbaum or Ostereirbaum , in German ) , and decided he would have one of his very own , when he grew up .
Time passed and young Volker became a married man , with a family and everything .
But his childhood dream stuck with him and he decorated his first Easter Tree , in 1965 .
He used 18 colored plastic eggs .
But the tree was growing fast and he and his wife , Christa could n’t afford to waste so many Easter eggs .
So they began drilling holes into the eggs , using the contents in the kitchen , and the painted shells as decorations .
When their children grew up , they started helping with the decorating , and the Easter Tree became a family tradition , known not only in their home town of Saalfeld , but all of Germany .

After their kids moved out of the house , it seemed the Easter Tree would finally catch a break , but grandsons arrived and the Krafts went back to decorating their giant tree .
The number of Easter eggs hung by the tree ’s branches grew every year , and in 2010 it reached an incredible 9,500 eggs .

The water temperature of the Delaware River has been rapidly rising over the last 40 years .
Image credit , Seth B. Lyon.
Streams and rivers across the United States are becoming noticeably warmer according to a new study published in the journal Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment .
A team of researchers led by Sujay Kaushal analyzed historical times series of water records stretching back anywhere from 24 years to almost 100 years for 40 major streams and rivers .
According to the data , 20 of the streams and rivers showed statistically significant long term warming .
Another 13 watercourses showed temperature increases that were not statistically significant .
Only 2 streams and rivers showed significant temperature decreases .
The study found that the average mean water temperature increased by 0.009 –0.077 °C per year .
These findings are extremely problematic for fish and other species that inhabit streams and rivers .
Many aquatic organisms can only live within narrow temperature ranges .
" Warming of streams and rivers can alter community biodiversity , contribute to local species extinctions , and may facilitate the invasion of alien species , " the authors note .
For example , macroinvertebrate abundance has been projected to decline 21 % for every 1 °C increase in stream temperature in parts of the UK .
The study findings provide some evidence that climate change may be at least partly responsible for the temperature increases .
" At many sites , long - term increases in water temperatures of streams and rivers typically coincided with historical increases in annual mean air temperatures , " the authors write .
However , rising stream temperatures may be due to a number of other factors , as well , including the increase in urbanization and impervious surfaces .
The study found that the biggest rates of warming were largely in urbanized areas .
However , this was not exclusively the case and some of the urbanized streams saw rising temperatures even after the urban areas had been built out .
Given the projected temperature increases from climate change , the problem is likely to get worse over the coming century .
To reduce the warming of streams and rivers , the authors recommend that a number of steps be taken such as the reduction in watershed impervious surfaces and the increased protection and restoration of riparian buffers . ﻿

I botched a bit of this piece the other day on H.264 , Ogg , and patents when I wrote :
If some patent troll decides H.264 violates a patent , they must go to court with MPEG LA , not individual licensees .
That ’s just wrong , and I regret the error .
There ’s nothing that would stop someone armed with a patent they believe H.264 infringes upon from suing individual licensees .
DF reader Joe Shaw emailed to point out that even the users of an invention deemed to infringe upon another ’s patent without permissions are considered infringers :
( a) Except as otherwise provided in this title , whoever without authority makes , uses , offers to sell , or sells any patented invention , within the United States or imports into the United States any patented invention during the term of the patent therefor , infringes the patent .
But I stand behind my main point , which is that the patent situation surrounding H.264 is safer than that of Ogg Theora .
There are two sets of patents that Ogg Theora likely violates .
The first set are submarine patents that H.264 also violates .
The second set are the patents in MPEG - LA ’s pool for H.264 .
If the holder of a submarine patent decides to sue over H.264 , MPEG -LA can countersue using the patents in the H.264 pool ( presuming that the submarine patent holder has some sort of video product , and is not a patent troll whose only business is extorting patent licensing fees ) .
If the holder of a submarine patent decides to sue over Ogg Theora , Ogg Theora users are , effectively , unarmed .
As for the second set , Ogg Theora supporters can claim that Ogg does n’t violate any patents in the H.264 pool , but MPEG - LA has stated that they believe otherwise .
If Ogg Theora takes off and becomes popular , would anyone be surprised if MPEG - LA started suing Ogg Theora users for licensing fees ?
I ’d be surprised if they did n’t .
That Ogg Theora is not patented only means that Ogg Theora ’s developers will not pursue Ogg Theora users for licensing fees or assert any restrictions .
It does not mean that the holders of other patents will not claim Ogg Theora violates their patents .
So if you ’re willing to concede that H.264 and Ogg Theora are both vulnerable to patent claims , and wished to choose one over the other , the obvious choice ( to me ) would be the one that is both technically superior and is owned by a group that can ably defend itself in court , armed with patents of its own and experienced lawyers .
And if you ’re not willing to concede that Ogg Theora is vulnerable to patent claims , well , then I doubt you ’re reading this .
To be clear , I ’m not trying to scare anyone from using or supporting Ogg Theora .
I still think Google ’s approach in Chrome is optimal : supporting both H.264 and Ogg .
It ’s my intention here to indict our patent system , not Ogg Theora .
But only the deluded think that Ogg Theora — and software that uses it , such as Firefox — is any more immune from patent warfare than an unarmed man is immune from bullets .
Postscript : See Thom Holwerda ’s criticism of my analysis , and my brief rejoinder .
Reports have surfaced about a new security hole that has been in Windows since the release of Windows NT 3.1 on July 27 , 1993 .
The vulnerability is present in all 32 - bit versions of Windows released since then , including all supported versions : Windows 2000 , Windows XP , Windows Server 2003 , Windows Vista , Windows Server 2008 , and Windows 7 .
Microsoft has issued Security Advisory ( 979682 ) to address the elevation of privilege vulnerability in the Windows kernel , making sure to note that 64 - bit versions of Windows , including Windows Server 2008 R2 , are not affected .
Thankfully , the flaw is n't in a commonly used application but in the Virtual DOS Machine ( VDM ) used to support 16 - bit applications .
There are several vulnerabilities in this implementation , according to Google security team member Tavis Ormandy , who found the issues .
An unprivileged 16 - bit program can manipulate the kernel stack of each process , potentially enabling attackers to execute code at system privilege level .
The exploit can be used to open a command prompt with the highest privilege level .
Ormandy claims he informed Microsoft of this hole on June 12 , 2009 , and the company confirmed receiving his report 10 days later , but it has yet to fix the issue .
" Microsoft is investigating new public claims of a possible vulnerability in Windows , " a Microsoft spokesperson told Ars .
" We are currently not aware of active attacks against this vulnerability and believe risk to customers , at this time , is limited .
To exploit this vulnerability , an attacker must already have valid logon credentials and be able to log on to a system locally , meaning they must already have an account on the system .
An attacker could then elevate their privileges to the administrative level and run programs of their choice on the system .
To help mitigate exploit of this vulnerability , customers who do not require NT Virtual DOS Mode ( NTVDM ) or support for 16 - bit applications , can disable the NTVDM subsystem . "
Microsoft will either provide a security update on Patch Tuesday or issue an out - of - band security update ( less likely ) .
Despite the fact that there is no patch available from Microsoft , Ormandy decided to publish the information because he believes the workaround is simple enough : disable the MS - DOS subsystem .
" As an effective and easy - to - deploy workaround is available , I have concluded that it is in the best interest of users to go ahead with the publication of this document without an official patch , " he writes in his disclosure .
" It should be noted that very few users rely on NT security ; the primary audience of this advisory is expected to be domain administrators and security professionals . "
To enable the workaround , use the policy template " Windows Components Application Compatibility Prevent access to 16 - bit applications " within the group policy editor to prevent unprivileged users from executing 16 - bit applications .
Hollywood movies and popular television shows featuring cute monkeys and other primates are driving demand for them as exotic pets , only to leave the animals psychologically damaged .
The RSPCA and Wild Futures , a Cornwall - based sanctuary which cares for distressed primates , are increasingly concerned at the new fashion .
Figures on the UK 's primate trade are difficult to obtain , partly because some of it is underground and illegal .
But the RSPCA said it had been told by one dealer that there are now some 20,000 pet primates in the UK , about four times original estimates .
The trade is lucrative .
Prices for the popular marmoset monkey reach £ 800 , while capuchins can fetch £ 2,000 .
Recent changes in legislation have made it easier to own many types of primate .
The government has removed a number of smaller primates from the dangerous animals list , which means they can be bought and sold freely .
Larger primates kept in private residences are subject to checks every two years , rather than the original one year , leading to concerns that it is more difficult to monitor their welfare .
Many pet primates will live for decades and there are examples of some living into their 50s , which means that they require long - term care .
Taken from their mothers at an early age to live alone in small cages , often without access to the outdoors , many primates kept as pets will suffer acute psychological distress .
Wild Futures , which is looking after 23 rescued monkeys , said all the animals in its care are suffering from poor mental health .
Once they reach adolescence and attempt to assert themselves , primates become aggressive .
Some have had their teeth filed and their claws removed to make them less dangerous ; others have been castrated .
Animal welfare groups said demand went in waves .
" Every time a primate is used in television or film , we receive an influx of calls to our sanctuary asking us how to acquire one as a pet , " said Liz Tyson of Wild Futures .
" The use of non -human primates as ' actors ' would suggest to the viewer that they can live alongside people , that they can be dressed up , trained to perform amusing tricks and can be manipulated to entertain us .
This leads to a distorted image whereby they become viewed as domestic companion animals , rather than the wild animals that they are . "
One early series of US sitcom Friends that featured a pet monkey saw interest in owning a primate increase , while the Hollywood comedy Night at the Museum , and Creation , a recent film about the life of Charles Darwin , also triggered demand , the charity says .
Last summer the European Commission banned an advert featuring a macaque monkey in a no-smoking campaign after pressure from animal welfare groups which said it encouraged people to see it as a pet .
" There is more of a trend for people to keep unusual pets , " said Ros Clubb , a scientific officer in the RSPCA 's wildlife department .
" Primates are the latest part of that .
A lot of people will see them as cute and quite human .
Some see them almost like a replacement child .
They put them in nappies and dress them up . "
Guidelines to be published by the government next month will make it clear what is expected of primate owners when it comes to caring for their pets .
But while welcome , animal charities say they do not go far enough .
The RSPCA said that 360 leading primatologists have backed calls for a ban on them as pets .
" With most species we would say it 's fine to own one as a pet if you look after it properly , but the position we take with primates is that you should never have them as pets , " Clubb said .
Owning primates as pets is already banned in many countries , including Sweden , Belgium and the Netherlands .
Today I received an email from " Construction Insider " concerned about banks suddenly playing hardball and calling in construction loans .
Construction Insider writes :
Hi Mish
I work in the construction business and something has been creeping to the forefront of my attention for the past few weeks and now it seems to be moving full steam ahead .
Banks are forcing developers / builders ( especially smaller ones ) to give up their properties ( unsold homes and lots ) .
Banks say the reason is that the properties in question are no longer performing assets .
I am sure there are some loans out there that are not performing and the owners are going under .
I am equally sure that there are plenty of developers that are still selling homes - just not at the pace originally planned on the pro formas .
Having inside information on one of these scenarios that happened today , I cannot help but wonder what is really going on ?
The bank told a small developer / builder I work for that they were taking back his ongoing subdivision .
He is selling houses and updated pro formas would indicate that the current sales pace would exhaust all remaining lots within 33 months .
Yet the bank stated they would only give him until April 15 to find alternative financing .
The bank is also willing to let him buy the subdivision at a 33 % discount to what is currently owed .
If he is unable to obtain this backing , the bank will let him walk away without penalty or consequence so they can write it off .
I have been on the phone trying to put some of these pieces together .
It seems there are many banks doing the same thing .
However , there is apparently no interest [ or ability - Mish ] from anyone wanting to pick up land / lots at 30 % - 50 % discounts to today 's prices .
Another interesting point is that the banks all state that they must have these situations written off or taken care of by the end of Q2 .
These are the immediate questions running through my head :
Why the end of Q2 ?
And why do so many banks seem to be simultaneously doing this ?
Is it possible that there is some government incentive to the banks to meet this timeline ?
And how much will this cost the taxpayers ?
There is something extremely concerning about this whole thing , especially from the standpoint that many banks appear to be acting in concert , all with the same specific timeline .
Any thoughts you have would be greatly appreciated .
Construction Insider
For questions like these , I turn to my " California Business Banker " to see what he thinks .
Hi Mish
Your construction industry source raises an interesting issue .
Since I work for a relative healthy bank , I do n't see that in my bank .
However , we have had federal auditors in the bank for the past couple weeks and I 've noticed an interesting development .
They are getting tougher on banks recognizing loans that they view as a problem and pushing for downgrades .
So , the very problem might be federal auditors are forcing banks to down grade loans to a doubtful status .
In such cases as nonperforming real estate assets , this essentially forces the bank to do something more than wait and see if the developer can turn his investment and pay off the bank .
It forces banks to resolve the issue mostly by enforcing their rights on the collateral , which is why they are probably recommending the developer walk away , so they can their hands on the collateral sooner ( maybe deeding it over to the bank ) versus going through foreclosure and potential bankruptcy on behalf of the client , which can draw out the process for months .
Most banks would like to get in , fire sell it or sell the note , and move on and not expand the loss by waiting over time .
It would n't surprise me a bit , if conceptually this or something very close to this is what 's going on .
The auditors reviewing one of my loans want to down grade the loan simply because the owners personal credit score has declined .
Bear in mind the client is profitable and meets all of their financial covenants .
Personal credit is a red flag but usually not a reason to down grade loans , unless there are other reasons as well .
This tells me the federal auditors are getting tougher across the board .
Hope that sheds some light .

Signs Say Wave of FDIC Takeovers Coming in 3rd Quarter
Addendum :
A friend of mine is a loan officer at a small regional bank here in Oregon .
She told me last week that she cannot get any of her mortgage loans clients approved for loans because the bank has raised the qualifications so high that NO ONE is being approved for home loans .
These are all borrowers who are more than qualified .
If she does not make her quota this month for closed loans , per her boss , she will be getting her pink slip on March 31 .
There is definitely something going on at banks for all types of loans .
They are hunkering down .
My banker friend believes also that there is going to be a massive failure of many banks in the near future .
Newzbin vs 20th Century Fox , Hollywood vs Usenet Indexing : Day One at the High Court ( Update : Day 2 )
The British government 's assessment of the threat of terrorism in the UK is overstated and has undermined the case for imposing tough new anti-terror laws , an influential committee of MPs and peers has warned .
Ministers insist that Britain still faces a " public emergency " eight years after the 11 September attacks on America and has used it to justify a swathe of controversial legislation , including holding terror suspects without trial .
But members of Parliament 's joint committee on human rights said that such a high level of threat was not credible because it had been continuously maintained for such a long period of time .
Andrew Dismore MP , chair of the committee , said : " There is no question that we face a serious threat from terrorism , or that we need legislation to counter that threat .
The question is , are the counter - terror measures we have in place justifiable , on an ongoing basis , in light of the most up to date information we have . "
The committee 's report , published yesterday , called for a review of all terror legislation passed since 11 September and asked whether it was realistic to say the state of emergency which existed at the time still remained now .
Mr Dismore said : " The idea that we have consistently faced an emergency level threat for over eight years since September 11 is , we believe , questionable .
What is needed now is not consolidation , but a thoroughgoing , evidence - based review of the necessity for and proportionality of all the counter - terrorism legislation passed since that day .
This should be an urgent priority for the next Parliament . "
The Committee also criticised the head of MI5 , Jonathan Evans , for his failure to appear before the committee .
" It is unacceptable that the Director General of the Security Service refuses to appear before it to give public evidence – despite giving public lectures and media interviews – that would allow the Committee to make judgements about the necessity and proportionality of counter - terrorism measures , " the report said .
The committee also criticised the Government 's narrow definition of complicity in torture as " significant and worrying " .
It said that in light of details published in the case of Binyam Mohammed , the case for an urgent independent inquiry into the allegations of complicity in torture was now " irresistible " .
Independent
Belfast Telegraph
" More of this is true than you would believe , " we 're told , just a few minutes into the movie version of The Men Who Stare At Goats , which opens today .
But how many of the film 's outlandish military research projects really happened ?
Turns out there 's plenty of material in the movie which sticks quite close to the truth – though reality is a bit more complicated .
( Warning : minor spoilers ahead . )
Psychic spies ?
True .
The non-fiction book which serves as the movie 's basis features Colonel John B. Alexander .
He served as a Special Forces commander in Vietnam and spent decades promoting the use of psychics and " remote viewers " for national security .
( That is , when he was n't pursuing his interests in - linguistic programming , UFOs , or non-lethal weapons . )
In 2007 , our own Sharon Weinberger interviewed Col .
Alexander in some depth on the military use of witches .
" They were doing palmistry , crystal ball kinds of stuff , " he said .
Danger Room also noted Col .
Alexander 's long - running feudwith Armen Victorian ( alias Henry Azadehdel , alias Habib Azadehdel , alias Cassava N’tumba and others ) , orchid smuggler , conspiracy theorist and all - round spooky character in the intelligence world .
Moving into the further reaches of the fringe we find earlier work , such as Boeing 's 60's psychic experimentswhich concluded that certain subjects could force a random number generator to produce a specific number by sheer willpower .
By 1985 an Army reportdeclared that " psychokinesis could , with continued research , have a potential military value for future military operations " and as recently as 1996 the phenomenon of eyeless vision was being investigated .
Military psychics may still be in business : a 2007 report suggested that the 9/11 attacks had been predicted some years beforehandby Remote Viewers .
In the post - 9/11 world where every option seemed worth exploring , it 's not implausible that some psychic spies were reactivated .
Drug experimentation ?
True .
Troops were doused with everything from concentrated cannabis oil to LSD – at times , without their knowledge .
Researchers would watch as servicemen would then " carry on conversations with various invisible people for as long as 2 - 3 days . "
The CIA was so enamored of acid , the agency had to issue a memo instructing that the punch bowls at office Christmas parties were not to be spiked .
Hippie Army ?
True. Lt. Col. Jim Channon dove deep into the New Age movement , and came back to the military with a most alternative view of warfare – one in which troops would carry flowers and symbolic animals into battle .
In the movie , Channon is played by Jeff Bridges .
His First Earth Battalion is renamed the " New Earth Army . "
But the ideas are the same .
Much of the artwork from the New Earth manual is lifted straight from the Channon original .
Channon has been taking advantage of the publicity for his cause ; this week he has a column in the Guardian newspaper , suggesting ( among other things ) that armies should be used for reforestation and navies to control over - fishing .
The military 's interest in Eastern and alternative practices is once again on the rise .
" Warrior mind training " , apparently based on ancient Samurai techniques , is being taught at Camp Lejeune as a possible treatment for PTSD .
Elsewhere the Army has a $ 4 million initiative exploring other approaches including Reiki , transcendental meditation and " bioenergy . "
The Air Force is looking into acupuncturefor battlefield pain relief .
Sound weapons ?
True .
Unpleasant sounds and repetitive music – including the Barney theme – have been used as real - life psychological warfare and interrogation techniques .
( Some of the bands involved have been less than happy about it . )
Repetitive music takes a long time to be effective , but loud , discordant noise is becoming more common as a method of dispersing crowds .
Danger Room's David
Axe was a test subject for the LRAD sonic blasterand reported " It was like having a hundred nagging girlfriends in my brain screaming at me " , while Sharon Weinberger tried the Inferno blaster and experienced " the most unbearable , gut - wrenching noise I ’ve ever heard in my life . "
Killing animals with telepathy ?
False .
The most outrageous claims in the movie ( and book ) is that military psychics could kill goats by looking at them .
Even John
Alexander says this is n't true .
" As I told Jon Ronson when the book first came out , Alexander writes , ' He [ one of the soldiers ] hit the goat . ' "
Goats are the one of the preferred substitutes for human targets in military testing , and there are rumors of lethal goat - zapping experimentswith the Active Denial System .
Special operations Command use them for training battlefield medicine– first shoot your ( anesthetised ) goat – a practice which is still controversial .
In her review of the movie , Col Alexander 's wife mentions that in real life her husband can disperse clouds by looking at them – " It certainly helped during our cruise to Antarctica ! " – but asserts that he has never used his powers to kill a goat .
( Look at time lapse photography of clouds and cloud - busting becomes less impressive ) .
Psychics are notoriously prone to believing in their own powers and are often convinced that experiments have proven their abilities when the results have been equivocal .
In the * Guardian* , Dr. Phillip Sponenberg suggests that mytonic or fainting goatsplus little self - deception may be behind the supposed success of the goat - staring experiment .
However , as the First Earth Battalion 's manualmakes clear , winning the psychological battle is a big part of the struggle .
If your opponent believes that you can kill them with a look , then they are already half - way to being defeated .
And many martial arts masters know that by overawing their students with displays that might be described as trickery , they can convince them of the value of their discipline .
So it might be best not to take everything quite at face value , as Jon Ronson does in the book and Ewan Mcgregor does in the movie .
... Or maybe they really can kill goats with a look .

The UK is to expel an Israeli diplomat over 12 forged British passports used in the killing of Hamas leader Mahmoud al - Mabhouh in Dubai in January .
David Miliband said there were " compelling reasons " to believe Israel was responsible for the forgeries .
The foreign secretary said the misuse of British passports was " intolerable " .
Israel 's ambassador to London , Ron Prosor , said he was " disappointed " , but Israel confirmed there would be no tit - for - tat diplomatic expulsion .
Mr Prosor said : " The relationship between Israel and the UK is of mutual importance , hence we are disappointed by the ... decision . "
The name of the diplomat has not been released .
Israel has previously said there is no proof it was behind the killing at a Dubai hotel .
' High - quality forgeries '
The foreign secretary said officers from Britain 's Serious Organised Crime Agency ( Soca ) had investigated the matter of the passports .
There can't be a greater violation of trust for one ally to abuse the passports of another ally
Sir Menzies Campbell
Expulsion ' a strong signal '
It had concluded the passports used were copied from genuine British passports when handed over for inspection to individuals linked to Israel , either in Israel or in other countries , he said .
" Given that this was a very sophisticated operation , in which high - quality forgeries were made , the government judges it is highly likely that the forgeries were made by a state intelligence service , " he said .
" We have concluded that there are compelling reasons to believe Israel was responsible for the misuse of the British passports . "
The incident " represents a profound disregard for the sovereignty of the United Kingdom " he said .
He said the fact that Israel was a friend added " insult to injury " .
The BBC's Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen said the expulsion sent a " very clear message " of British disapproval .
" It is a very big step for a government like the British to expel one of the diplomats belonging to one of its important allies , " he said .

It is believed 12 fake British passports were used in the plot to murder Mr Mabhouh - the founder of Hamas 's military wing - in his hotel room in Dubai on 19 January .
The names and details on the UK passports used by eight of the 12 suspects belonged to British - Israeli citizens living in Israel - all of whom have denied involvement in Mr Mabhouh 's murder .
Their passports had been copied and new photographs inserted .
ANALYSIS Tim Franks , BBC News , Jerusalem " Regret " is the official Israeli emotion , not anger , not surprise , and certainly not retribution .
There is a clear Israeli desire to dampen this argument down from one where it could damage the wider relationship .
" It does n't look good , " was the terse verdict of one former senior diplomat .
Other sources suggested this was a " standard dance " Britain had to go through .
But this is not being said with a tremendous swagger .
After all , this is not the first time Israel has been caught with its hand in a sweet jar full of British passports .
On that occasion , more than 20 years ago , Israel promised not to repeat the offence .
That promise appears to have expired .
Israel is already feeling the heat from the US for its continued building on occupied territory .
The Israeli government will not , right now , want to fight on too many fronts .
Mr Miliband said there was no evidence to suggest that any of the 12 passport holders were anything other than " wholly innocent victims of identity theft " .
He said he was amending the official travel advice to Israel to make British nationals aware of the risks of their passports being misused .
He said he had met Israeli foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman in Brussels on Monday and had made clear the UK's " determination to see that this affair should never be repeated " .
He handed him a letter " seeking a formal assurance ... that in the future the State of Israel would never be party to the misuse of British passports in such a way " .
It is not the first time British passports have been misused by Israel .
In 1987 the country was caught forging UK passports for an intelligence operation , and Israel promised it would not do it again .
On that occasion , eight British passports reckoned to be for Mossad agents were found in a bag in a West German telephone booth .
A spokesman for the Palestinian Hamas group said it welcomed the decision to expel the diplomat , but wanted international efforts to track down the killers stepped up .
Dubai police have used CCTV footage to identify 27 alleged members of the team that tracked and killed Mr Mabhouh .
Passports from France , Ireland , Germany and Australia were also forged in the operation , and they too are investigating Israel 's role .
Dubai officials said they were " 99 % certain " that agents from Mossad were behind the killing .
Following his death , Mr Mabhouh 's family said doctors who had examined him determined he had died after receiving a massive electric shock to the head .
They also found evidence that he had been strangled .
Blood samples sent to a French laboratory confirmed he was killed by electric shock , after which the body was sent to Syria .

I can’t find alot of RHCE study or exam tips online , so I decided to write my own .
The list does not contain exam questions , but rather my personal advice on how to do well for the exam .
Hopefully , this can be useful for anyone taking the Redhat Certified Engineer ( RHCE ) exam .
The RHCE exam is performance based .
This means that cramping theory the night before the exam is not good enough .
You have to perform , meaning that you must have enough practical experience prior the exam .
If you are reading this webpage , I assumed that you are already a competent linux / rhel user and is planning to take the exam soon .
1 . Go through redhat prep guide carefully and make sure you what what each point means .
2 . Make sure you know how to troubleshoot the system using different run levels , emergency and rescue mode .
Doing a few more practices before the exam gives you extra confidence .
3 . Do n’t assume you know .
Do it to confirm .
Even if using GUI , make sure you know what each field means .
It is not only about clicking ‘ next ’ and ‘ next ’ .
If something goes wrong during installation or you forget to install some packages , you must know how to do it in command line later .
Check that you are familiar with all yum and rpm commands .
A good Linux Administrator must know how to work without using GUI .
4 . Use ‘ man ’ minimally during exams because time is against you .
You should be able to install any packages and configure it up and running in a short time .
Remember that result is all that matters .
The configuration file for some applications can be confusing and there are often other ways to achieve the same goal .
5 . The reason why RHCEs are valued in the market is because they are able to configure linux servers securely .
Make sure you know firewall , selinux , fcontext , booleans ..etc including all commands associated with it .
6 . If things go wrong , you must know where to look for the right logs .
Check for file permissions , acls , file context , firewall , booleans .
7 . All the changes you make must survive a reboot – all changes have to be permanent .
Many people tend to forget this part .
Reboot takes time .
Try not to reboot if you can .
Even updating partition table does n’t require a reboot if you use the right command .
Rebooting a machine too often tells people that you lack good System Administration skills .
8. Becareful of rumors or sample exam papers floating around .
Remember that knowing your stuff is still the most secure way to pass the exam and practice is the key to success .
9 . In section 1 , try not to jump questions .
Do the compulsory ones , then the non-compulsory questions , one at a time .
You need to secure 80 % for this part to qualify for RHCE .
10 .
In section 2 , do each question quickly .
If stuck , feel free to jump to the next question and revisit the problematic ones later .
Test all answers .
Re-read the questions and make sure you have answered them correctly .
Your solution might work but it may not be what the question is asking for .
Some people kept failing section 2 even if they feel confident that they have done well .
Take this point seriously .
There are 2 parts here , the RHCT and RHCE part .
You need > 70 % for each part to get RHCE .
11 . Try not to over configure or provide solutions that are not asked for .
If a question is asking for A , give A only .
Showing that you are smart by giving B and C as well might introduce complications or extra work for other questions .
For example , if you are not asked to use ldap or kerberos , do n’t act smart .
12 . Devise strategies to know where to look for configuration details rather than memorising it .
Remember that there are sample config files in /usr / share / doc .
For example , it might be a nightmare to memorise dhcp config .
13 . Drink plenty of water and sleep well the day before the exam .
5.5 hrs is no joke ( you get lunch break in between of course ) .
My advice is not to do any last minute reading before the exam .
Do something not related to the exam to help relax .
Nothing can be worst than your brain blacking out or fingers making stupid typos .
I thought this is common sense but many people forget it .
14 . RHCEs have good reputation in the IT industry and many people have faith in them to manage their servers reliably .
Do not degrade the reputation by resorting to using underhand tactics , sabotaging or cheating ( including in the exams ) to achieve personal goals .
There were stories of students sshing into other students machine and doing nasty things when they know they were going to fail …
I wrote the tips based on my personal experience after passing the rhce 5 exam .
I am sure that with enough effort , you should also be able to pass the exam .
To me , experience is still valued more than a certificate .
So do n’t stop using linux even if you passed .
Keep in touch with the latest linux development and open source technologies .
Have good system administration practices .
Welcome to the RHCE family and good luck with the exams ,

For over 80 years Bristol has enjoyed an enviable reputation for expertise in the continual development and improvement of brake pad friction materials .
Today at EFI we are justifiably proud to be the inheritors of these fine traditions and set ourselves the highest standards in maintaining them .
EFI was founded on the 21st March 1986 , having been formed from the demise of Trist Draper , Top Dog and Mintex Don in Bristol by a group of ex-employees .
The company ’s humble beginnings started in a storage building located at Bristol City Docks , the five strong work force initially acquired and prepared machinery for future production , before moving to Chauffeur garages in St. Annes .
With limited resources the company started to produce and supply disc brake pads for the off road market .
As orders increased it was not long before EFI decided to relocate to a small site in Brislington , which opened the opportunity for taking on new employees and move into the car and motorcycle disc brake pad market .
The many years of OE ( Original Equipment ) experience which the directors gained in their previous employment has assisted in the production of brake pads which surpass many other after market manufacturers .
The company ’s growing portfolio of products lead to the need for more space , in 1992 EFI moved to a new site in Brislington .
The site known as Bonville , which houses the factory and head office in 50 000 square feet .
A second site was acquired in 1996 , known as Wilverley and handles distribution in over 15 000 square feet .
In recent years the company has continued to generate business in new markets .
Growth in wind turbine and specialist products particularly with truck and railway brake pads has helped EFI become the largest independent friction manufacturer in the UK .
From its roots in 1986 with zero turnover and a workforce of five the company has evolved over the last fourteen years to the present day where it now has a skilled work force of over 200 .
I 've been writing about Moose in the Modern Perl book draft recently .
Moose is clearly the right way to teach object orientation in the context of Perl 5 , and I 've enjoyed how Moose makes doing the right thing easy .
Yesterday I explained inheritance in the context of Moose and Perl 5 OO .
I 'd already explained Perl roles .
If I did n't have to acknowledge that people reading the book will eventually run across legacy code , I could happily gloss over inheritance as an idea that turns out to be much less useful than it first appears .
I suspect that inheritance seems great to OO novices because it 's spectacular and interesting : code appears seemingly for free out of nowhere !
That 's easy to understand , while the subtle utility of polymorphism and parametric polymorphism require you to have struggled with the problems they solve so you understand their value .
Would so many of us appreciate Moose if we had n't wasted so much time doing things the hard way ?
I spend a lot of time thinking about how to teach people to appreciate and to understand modern
Perl in ways that do not lead them down the dark alleys and bumpy roads where I had to learn to program the hard way .
I 'm very stubborn , and I 'm perfectly comfortable taking apart something to figure out how it works .
( The people who fix bugs in your favorite programming languages likely share this trait . )
I do n't believe that attribute is a necessary precondition for learning to program well .
However , I do wonder if it's more difficult to understand the value of a non-obvious system until you realize the drawbacks of the system you do understand .
I 've seen novices insist that they absolutely must use symbolic references instead of hashes , or that manual iteration instead of list transformation is so much easier , or what have you that I wonder about the diactic value of trying to show people the best general approach as I understand it now first , then mentioning other ways that are n't as good .
Consider an example .
I know better ways to write Test : : Builder because I 've implemented it three times now , in Perl 5 , Perl 6 , and PIR .
I like to think I 'd have listened if someone suggested infelicities in its original design , but only the experience of implementing and using it helped me to understand what it really needed to do .
I wonder .
Is it possible to teach Perl 5 in such a way that novices do n't have to suffer all of the miscues that the rest of us have in the past decade ?
If so , how do I do that ?
( If not , what does that imply about new adoption of Perl 5 and adoption of Perl 6 in general ? )
Maybe I 'm conflating learning a language with learning how to design programs — but how do you separate the two when your goal is merely to teach people how to solve problems ?
The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Friday 26 March 2010
In a panel accompanying a report about a solo swimming attempt on the Atlantic we referred to an earlier successful crossing in 1998 by a 31 - year - old Frenchman , Ben Lecomte , the first person to achieve the feat .
We inadvertently suggested that he took a surprisingly relaxed approach to the task by swimming " in a wetsuit and slippers " .
Flippers , in fact , were his more practical choice
An unemployed teacher from Peterborough stood in scanty trunks and prepared to dive into the murky waters of the Serpentine in Hyde Park , London .
Japanese tourists started snapping photos ; even the ducks seemed intrigued , raising their heads from their wings to see what on earth the 22 - stone man on the lakeside thought he was doing .
" Lovely , is n't it ? " boomed Dan Martin as he padded towards the water in flip - flops with holes in the bottom .
" Still , better than last week .
I cut my finger on some ice when I got in . "
If plunging into a 1C lake at the tail end of the worst winter in more than 30 years seems a daft thing to do , wait until you hear what Martin has got planned for 8 May .
That Saturday , the 28 - year - old will don the same pair of Speedos , cap and goggles , wade into the sea in Nova Scotia , eastern Canada , and start swimming .
With nothing but his ginger beard and a whole lot of chutzpah to keep him warm , he will head out into the Atlantic , over the grave of the Titanic and up towards the Eurasian tectonic plate .
If all goes to plan and the sharks , jellyfish , trawlers or prolonged exposure to cold water do n't get to him , somewhere between four and six months and 3,500 miles later he will emerge in Brest , north - western France .
There Martin will keep going .
On a bike .
Until he reaches Uelen , Asia 's most easterly settlement in Russia .
To get there , he will have pedalled through Siberia in the sort of weather that will make Hyde Park in early March seem like Death Valley .
" People think swimming the Atlantic is going to be the hardest part , but it 's probably the cycling , " said Martin as he prepared to dive into the Serpentine with the nonchalance of a man about to have a relaxing bath .
How so ?
" It can drop as low as minus 80C in the Siberian winter .
Ha ha !
I do n't even like cycling . "
When Martin reaches Uelen he will be on the home straight .
The only complication is that the straight is rather long .
And he is going to run it : one marathon a day , Eddie Izzard - style .
Only when he reaches New York – probably at the end of 2011 , when he will be 30 – will his journey be over .
He calls it the Global Triathlon because he is using the whole of the northern hemisphere as a globe - sized triathlon course .
But what 's the point ?
" I always say it 's just to impress girls in bars , but it 's raising money for a great charity that helps orphans in Nepal , " he said .
" But also I think it 's the great British adventure that can be done , and should be done . "
He stresses donations will not go towards financing this folly .
The estimated £ 200,000 cost of the trip is being met by corporate sponsorship , so any public money goes straight to the Dan Martin Foundation , his own charity for under - privileged children .
Ever since he went public with news of this adventure , he has received messages on a daily basis suggesting he will die doing it .
To avoid that , Martin has been in serious training .
Not that you would be able to tell .
" At 6ft 5 in and 22 stone I 'm not your average athlete , " he said .
" It 's something I 've consciously done .
I need to gain weight for the cold , to get as much stuff between my internal organs and the ocean that 's trying to kill me .
I think I 'll need 7,000 - 9,000 calories to sustain me each day and odds are that is n't going to happen every day at sea .
So it 's a calorie reserve and it helps with the buoyancy .
The benefits of being chubby far outweigh the downsides for the swimming leg . "
Before Martin dreamed up this challenge – after returning from a 22,000 - mile cycling trip from South Korea to Cape Town – he weighed around 14 and a half stone .
In order to gain the weight , he says he has been doing " everything Gillian McKeith says you should n't " .
In the main , this involves putting away at least seven meals a day and guzzling calorific drinks , including beer .
" It was quite enjoyable early on but now I 'm training eight hours a day it 's difficult to keep the weight on .
It 's hard to shove enough food in my face , " he said .
" The plan is to lose about a stone and a half every month for the first 10 months through the swim and the cycle so that I 'm down to about 12 - and - a - half stone for the run . "
At the Serpentine Swimming Club after his training session , the hardy club members quiz him on his preparation .
" You 've done the Channel , then ? " asks one man .
Later , I ask him why not .
" It 's really hard .
All those currents . "

The nitty gritty
Has anyone swum the Atlantic before ?
Yes .
In 1998 , Ben Lecomte , a 31 - year - old Frenchman , became the first person to achieve the feat , completing the course in 73 days .
But he did it in a wetsuit and flippers – the wuss .
What stroke will Martin do ?
" Butterfly !
Only joking – front crawl all the way , " he says .
" It 's by far the most efficient stroke . "
When will he sleep ?
After eight hours of swimming every day , Martin will touch his support boat and the skipper will mark the spot on a GPS device .
The next morning , the boat will return to that exact spot and the challenge will re-commence .
What about going to the toilet ?
" There 's an easy way to go to the toilet in the sea , so I 'll be polluting ever so slightly , " says Martin .
And eating ?
To consume the 7,000 - 9,000 calories needed each day , Martin will drink energy drinks " and maybe a Mini Roll or a banana " .
What about sharks ?
He is going to wear a shark - repellent anklet to ward them off , and will not swim at dawn or dusk , shark feeding times .
" I 'm more worried about a Portuguese Man o' War , " he says .
The jellyfish - like creatures have tentacles that can reach up to 50 metres .
An intro to modern OpenGL .
Chapter 1 : The Graphics Pipeline
OpenGL has been around a long time , and from reading all the accumulated layers of documentation out there on the Internet , it 's not always clear what parts are historic and what parts are still useful and supported on modern graphics hardware .
It 's about time for a new OpenGL introduction that walks through the parts that are still relevant today .
Update : Join the Reddit discussion .
What is OpenGL ?
Wikipedia gives a good overview of the purpose and history of OpenGL , but I 'll give a quick summary here .
In its modern form , OpenGL is a cross- platform library for interfacing with programmable GPUs for the purpose of rendering real - time 3d graphics .
Its use is common in games , CAD , and data visualization applications .
It started in the early '90s as a cross- platform standardization of SGI 's proprietary GL ( " Graphics Library " ) that drove the graphics hardware in their high - end workstations .
A few years later , GLQuake and 3dfx 's Voodoo graphics accelerators pushed 3d accelerators into the mainstream , and OpenGL became a standard alongside Microsoft 's proprietary Direct3d library for controlling graphics accelerators in consumer PCs .
In recent years , the Khronos group has taken stewardship of the OpenGL standard , updating it to support the features of modern programmable GPUs , pushing it into the mobile and online domains with OpenGL ES and WebGL , and streamlining it in OpenGL 3 by deprecating the outdated features that cluttered earlier versions of the library .
Another recent development has been the adoption of general purpose GPU ( GPGPU ) libraries , including nVidia 's CUDA and Khronos ' OpenCL .
These libraries implement dialects of C with added data parallelism features , allowing the GPU to be used for general computation without having to work within the graphics - oriented framework of OpenGL .
However , these GPGPU frameworks do n't replace OpenGL ; since their primary purpose is not graphics programming , they only provide access to a GPU 's computation units , ignoring its graphics - specific hardware .
They can , however , act as accessories to OpenGL.
CUDA and OpenCL both can share buffers of GPU memory with OpenGL and pass data between GPGPU programs and the graphics pipeline .
GPGPU will be outside the scope of these articles ; I 'll be focusing on using OpenGL for graphics tasks .
For these tutorials , I 'm going to assume you 're already a programmer and that you know C , but that you have n't necessarily seen OpenGL or done graphics programming before .
Knowing at least some basic algebra and geometry will help a lot .
I 'm going to cover OpenGL 2.0 , and avoid discussing any API features that are deprecated or removed in OpenGL 3 or OpenGL ES .
If I write enough chapters , I might talk about some of the new features of OpenGL 3 and 4 after I go through the basics .
In addition to OpenGL , I 'll be using two helper libraries : GLUT ( the GL Utility Toolkit ) , which provides a cross- platform interface between the window system and OpenGL , and GLEW ( the GL Extensions Wrangler ) , which streamlines dealing with different versions of OpenGL and their extensions .
Where do I get OpenGL , GLUT , and GLEW ?
OpenGL comes standard in some form or another on MacOS X , Windows , and most Linux distributions .
If you want to follow these tutorials , you 'll need to ensure your OpenGL implementation supports at least version 2.0 .
MacOS X's OpenGL implementation always supports OpenGL 2.0 , at least in software if the graphics card driver does n't provide it .
On Windows , you 're dependent on your graphics card drivers to provide OpenGL 2 or later .
You can use RealTech 's free OpenGL Extensions Viewer to see what OpenGL version your driver supports .
nVidia and AMD 's OpenGL drivers support at least OpenGL 2.0 on all of their video cards released in the past four years .
Users of Intel onboard graphics and older graphics cards are less fortunate .
For a fallback , Mesa provides an open - source , cross- platform software OpenGL 2.1 implementation that works on Windows and almost all Unix platforms .
Mesa is also the most common OpenGL implementation on Linux , where it also works with the X server to interface OpenGL with graphics hardware using " direct rendering interface " ( DRI ) drivers .
You can see whether your particular DRI driver supports OpenGL 2.0 by running the glxinfo command from an xterm .
If OpenGL 2.0 is n't supported on your hardware , you can disable the driver to fall back to Mesa 's software implementation .
n Vidia also provides their own proprietary OpenGL implementation for Linux targeting their own GPUs ; this implementation should provide OpenGL 2.0 or later on any recent nVidia card .
To install GLUT and GLEW , look for the binary packages on their respective sites .
MacOS X comes with GLUT preinstalled .
Most Linux distributions have GLUT and GLEW available through their package system , though for GLUT , you may need to enable your distribution 's optional " non-free " package repositories , since its license is not technically open source .
There is an open - source GLUT clone called OpenGLUT if you 're a stickler for such things .
If you 're a seasoned C programmer , you should be able to install these libraries and get them working in your development environment without any trouble .
But before we get our hands dirty with any code , I 'm going to go over some big - picture concepts .
In this first chapter , I 'm going to explain the graphics pipeline and the dataflow of a rendering job .
In the next chapter , we 'll write a simple " hello world " program that draws the contents of an image file to the screen , showing how the pipeline is put into practice .
Ever since the early days of real - time 3d , the triangle has been the paintbrush with which scenes have been drawn .
Although modern GPUs can perform all sorts of flashy effects to cover up this dirty secret , underneath all the shading , triangles are still the medium in which they work .
The graphics pipeline that OpenGL implements reflects this : the host program fills OpenGL - managed memory buffers with arrays of vertices ; these vertices are projected into screen space , assembled into triangles , and rasterized into pixel - sized fragments ; finally , the fragments are assigned color values and drawn to the framebuffer .
Modern GPUs get their flexibility by delegating the " project into screen space " and " assign color values " stages to uploadable programs called shaders .
Let 's look at each stage in more detail :
The vertex and element arrays
A rendering job starts its journey through the pipeline in a set of one or more vertex buffers , which are filled with arrays of vertex attributes .
These attributes are used as inputs to the vertex shader .
Common vertex attributes include the location of the vertex in 3d space , and one or more sets of texture coordinates that map the vertex to a sample point on one or more textures .
The set of vertex buffers supplying data to a rendering job are collectively called the vertex array .
When a render job is submitted , we supply an additional element array , an array of indexes into the vertex array that select which vertices get fed into the pipeline .
The order of the indexes also controls how the vertices get assembled into triangles later on .
Uniform state and textures
A rendering job also has uniform state , which provides a set of shared , read - only values to the shaders at each programmable stage of the pipeline .
This allows the shader program to take parameters that do n't change between vertices or fragments .
The uniform state includes textures , which are one - , two- , or three - dimensional arrays that can be sampled by shaders .
As their name implies , textures are commonly used to map texture images onto surfaces .
They can also be used as lookup tables for precalculated functions or as datasets for various kinds of effects .
The vertex shader
The GPU begins by reading each selected vertex out of the vertex array and running it through the vertex shader , a program that takes a set of vertex attributes as inputs and outputs a new set of attributes , referred to as varying values , that get fed to the rasterizer .
At a minimum , the vertex shader calculates the projected position of the vertex in screen space .
The vertex shader can also generate other varying outputs , such as a color or texture coordinates , for the rasterizer to blend across the surface of the triangles connecting the vertex .
Triangle assembly
The GPU then connects the projected vertices to form triangles .
It does this by taking the vertices in the order specified by the element array and grouping them into sets of three .
The vertices can be grouped in a few different ways :
Take every three elements as an independent triangle
Make a triangle strip , reusing the last two vertices of each triangle as the first two vertices of the next
, reusing the last two vertices of each triangle as the first two vertices of the next Make a triangle fan , connecting the first element to every subsequent pair of elements
The diagram shows how the three different modes behave .
Strips and fans both require only one new index per triangle in the element array after the initial three , trading the flexibility of independent triangles for extra memory efficiency in the element array .
Rasterization
The rasterizer takes each triangle , clips it and discards parts that are outside of the screen , and breaks the remaining visible parts into pixel - sized fragments .
As mentioned above , the vertex shader 's varying outputs are also interpolated across the rasterized surface of each triangle , assigning a smooth gradient of values to each fragment .
For example , if the vertex shader assigns a color value to each vertex , the rasterizer will blend those colors across the pixelated surface as shown in the diagram .
The fragment shader
The generated fragments then pass through another program called the fragment shader .
The fragment shader receives the varying values output by the vertex shader and interpolated by the rasterizer as inputs .
It outputs color and depth values that then get drawn into the framebuffer .
Common fragment shader operations include texture mapping and lighting .
Since the fragment shader runs independently for every pixel drawn , it can perform the most sophisticated special effects ; however , it is also the most performance - sensitive part of the graphics pipeline .
Framebuffers , testing , and blending
A framebuffer is the final destination for the rendering job 's output .
In addition to the default framebuffer OpenGL gives you to draw to the screen , most modern OpenGL implementations let you make framebuffer objects that draw into offscreen renderbuffers or into textures .
Those textures can then be used as inputs to other rendering jobs .
A framebuffer is more than a single 2d image ; in addition to one or more color buffers , a framebuffer can have a depth buffer and / or stencil buffer , both of which optionally filter fragments before they are drawn to the framebuffer :
Depth testing discards fragments from objects that are behind the ones already drawn , and stencil testing uses shapes drawn into the stencil buffer to constrain the drawable part of the framebuffer , " stencilling " the rendering job .
Fragments that survive these two gauntlets have their color value alpha blended with the color value they 're overwriting , and the final color , depth , and stencil values are drawn into the corresponding buffers .
Conclusion
That 's the process , from vertex buffers to framebuffer , that your data goes through when you make a single " draw " call in OpenGL .
Rendering a scene usually involves multiple draw jobs , switching out textures , other uniform state , or shaders between passes and using the framebuffer 's depth and stencil buffers to combine the results of each pass .
Now that we 've covered the general dataflow of 3d rendering , we can write a simple program to see how OpenGL makes it all happen .
Throughout the course of this tutorial , I 'd love to — let me know if it 's helping you or if anything does n't make sense .
¿ Qué le pasó a Monterrey ?
La gran ciudad industrial de México , la echada para adelante , la que tuvo más desarrollo en los últimos 30 años , la de los ahorradores , los que encaraban al centro con la frente en alto , los que presumían tener controlada su seguridad , están hoy en la peor crisis de su historia .
El narco tomó la ciudad y al inexperto gobernador Rodrigo Medina no se le ocurre mejor cosa que llamar a los ciudadanos a una manifestación , como si encabezar la marcha le permitiera trasladar su responsabilidad a otra parte .
La explicación simplista es decir que la guerra al narco , la estrategia fallida de Calderón , está golpeando a la inocente e industriosa ciudad de Monterrey .
Pero la descomposición social de la Sultana del Norte , como también es conocida , es anterior .
Los valores esenciales del Monterrey pujante de la segunda mitad del siglo XX se perdieron .
La cultura del esfuerzo , el sentido de unidad y esa convicción de tomar el futuro en sus propias manos se fueron transformando en una cultura de consumo y desprecio a lo que no era como ellos , pensaron que el futuro lo tenían no solo ganado , sino merecido .
La ciudad orgullosa se volvió vanidosa .
No es gratuito que la crisis social de la ciudad coincida con la estrepitosa caída de la imagen del fundador de los Legionarios de Cristo , Marcial Maciel .
La gran mayoría de la elite social del Monterrey pasó por las escuelas legionarias que formaron una generación insulsa , pagada de sí misma , volcada al consumo y la presunción , pero sobre todo alejada del pensamiento crítico .
Nada mejor para el aterrizaje del narco que una élite pagada de sí misma y fascinada con su propia imagen .
Lo que le está pasando hoy a Monterrey le sucedió a Guadalajara en los años setenta y ochenta .
La crisis de una generación que fundó su futuro en el pasado , que sentía merecerlo todo por su heredad , puso la cama a la llegada del narco y luego se acostó con él .
El narco se vuelve " intolerable " cuando los muertos tocan a las élites .
En Guadalajara tuvo que caer un Cardenal , en Monterrey dos estudiantes del Tec .
En Guadalajara nadie se acuerda de los otros seis muertos el aeropuerto aquel 24 de mayo de 1993 , cuando murió el purpurado ; en Monterrey nadie habla de los otros dos civiles que cayeron ese mismo fin de semana víctimas del fuego cruzado .
En Jalisco también hubo un gobernador que pensó que la mejor forma de evadir su responsabilidad era sumándose a una marcha contra la violencia .
La crisis de Monterrey no se resolverá fácil ni rápido .
Lo que sigue es el auto exilio de las élites con consecuencias sociales y económicas importantes .
A Guadalajara le costó muchos años entender que el problema no " venía de fuera " sino que fue su propia sociedad la que entró en crisis y el narco no fue sino una consecuencia de ello .
El atajo , la vía rápida , se llama autocrítica : reconocerse en el espejo , y plantearse lo más rápido posible la renovación de su élites .
El asesinato de los dos jóvenes del Tec no es el final de un proceso de descomposición , sino el arranque de un largo camino hacia la reinvención .
Conspiracy and the Paranoid Center
Reason magazine ’s Jesse Walker has coined the phrase “ paranoid center ” to highlight a widespread phenomenon :
The proneness of those on the center , despite their own patronizing dismissal of “ conspiracy theories , ” to moral panics about stuff they barely understand .
Remember all the manufactured media hysteria about “ goths ” after Columbine ( “ … and they watched The Matrix ! ” ) , with every kid in black eyeliner and a duster potentially some kind of homicidal racist ?
And sometimes , the paranoid center ’s paranoid conspiracism is focused on … paranoid conspiracists !
After the Pentagon shooting by John Bedell , a troubled man with a history of mental illness , David Neiwert immediately noted that he was “ inflamed by far - right conspiracy theories . ”
When Joe Stack crashed his plane into an IRS building and left behind a barely coherent manifesto , Josh Marshall laid the attack at the feet of the anti-government Right : “ Ideas , ” he said , “ Have Consequences . ”
But that ’s silly .
Both Stack and Bedell were classic specimens of our native species crankus americanus .
The views of each , as Jesse Walker noted , were “ a personalized hodge - podge . ”
Stack ’s anti-tax views , in particular , apparently owed little to talk radio and Fox News .
The main trigger seems to have been that , as with many middle class people who fall afoul of the IRS enforcement bureaucracy , his life became a horror story of endless hearings and rulings by unaccountable administrative bodies , and endless run-ins with petty tyrants .
Most of his “ manifesto ” amounts to a sort of procedural brief , in excruciating detail , of the IRS ’s irregularities in every single stage of his dealings with them .
If anything , Stack ’s rage was exacerbated by some very left - wing resentments : special tax breaks for powerful churches , multi-billion dollar bailouts for giant banks and auto manufacturers , and the like .
Obsessive attempts by people like Marshall to lay every act of politically motivated violence to the account of the anti-government ideology , are themselves a particularly paranoid and conspiratorial form of reductionism .
They remind me of a recurring argument I heard , growing up in the Baptist church :
That the Baptists were the original New Testament church founded by Christ , and that they ’d existed underground continuously during the period of Catholic hegemony .
To back up this astonishing claim , its advocates had to take every example of a heresy that practiced adult rebaptism and / or congregational self - government , and draw a timeline through them — regardless of whatever doctrinal tenets they held that would be considered abhorrent by modern Baptists .
For example , the radically gnostic Cathari , who on closer inspection could have been shown to believe that all things were lawful for the redeemed and that they were no longer subject to prohibitions against murder or adultery , were included in this hodgepodge “ Baptist ” lineage .
Similarly , every attempt by an unhinged person to blow up or shoot up a government building , regardless of the idiosyncratic nature of his personal grievance , is obsessively combed over for any whiff of an anti-government slant so that it can be attributed to Them , and Marshall or Olbermann can triumphantly proclaim “ See ? Ideas have consequences . ”
In short , both the Baptists and people like Marshall and Olbermann — like conspiracy nuts — attempt to impose meaning on reality by reading a coherent narrative into random and unrelated events .
“ Yeah , man , this guy believed some of the same things that those other guys believe , and then he went out and killed some people !
So their entire belief system must be the same , and he must be listening to their dog- whistle !
The truth is OUT THERE , man ! ”
That reasoning process , by the way , is exactly the same one used by Birchers to prove that anyone who talks about socialism is “ really a communist . ”
This or that word “ really means ” whatever the Communist Manifesto says , so by putting together different people ’s use of different words in concatenation with selected quotes from the Manifesto , one can syllogistically deduce a hidden agenda the size of Texas .
It ’s the same reasoning process that sends Glenn Beck , based on some particular word somebody uses , to feverishly scrawling dotted lines between people ’s name on his chalkboard .
The possibility that a wide range of movements might use similar language in different ways , without it functioning as a secret Masonic handshake , is apparently too nuanced for such people .
Maybe , just maybe , we should consider evaluating ideas on their own merits rather than who they “ sound like . ”
These amazing gems are fan favorites , totally cherished , and the best of the best !

The TGV is mounted with solenoids that strike you ( for bullets ) and vibrating motors ( for the knife slashing sensation ) that respond to cues from the game and let you feel what your character feels on the screen .
Palan hopes to give users a “ 4 - D ” experience , with tactile feedback providing the extra dimension of immersion .
The TGV debuted at the recent 2010 Haptics Symposium to much fanfare and positive reviews .
While this device is still in the early prototype phase , haptic vests may one day be adapted to provide real sensations for military training , movies , and yes , amazing video games .
The TGV is n’t the first vest with physical feedback .
In fact , you can go online now and order one from TN Games for $ 140 .
That system , however , uses compressed air , making its response slower and less precise than the TGV .
Most other haptic vests have relied on just one kind of feedback .
Palan has incorporated both impacts and vibrations , and plans on including more .
The original TGV prototype ( which was tested at UPenn in September ’09 ) also contained heating elements to give wearers the sensation of blood flowing from a wound .
That part of the system had to be removed because of its need for high electric current .
According to Palan ’s website , they also considered adding in features to simulate punches , kicks , ambient temperature , artillery explosions .
Sounds like a full military or disaster relief simulator in the making .
For now , the TGV is most notable for how it points the way to a full - body haptic experience .
Combine many different modes of feedback and you ’ll be able to approximate a much wider range of sensations .
We already have the necessary technology to do haptics today .
All it takes is solenoids , eccentric motors , peltier ( heating ) elements , good programming , and a lot of creativity .
Palan seems to have each of those in spades .
Hopefully he , or one of the many other haptics researchers , will continue to develop feedback suits until they ’re good for more than just a great round of Halo .

Greece backs new round of tax rises and spending cuts
Greece has been hit by a wave of public sector strikes
The Greek government has approved a new package of tax increases and spending cuts to save 4.8 bn euros ( $ 6.5 bn ; £ 4.4bn ) and ease its budget crisis .
The measures include rises in sales taxes , a cut in holiday bonuses paid to civil servants , and a pensions freeze .
The EU had called for austerity measures amid fears that Greece 's problems could undermine the eurozone .
The new package was welcomed by the EU and the International Monetary Fund , but condemned by Greek trade unions .
The new measures include : Pensions freezes
Cuts in public sector pay
A increase in sales tax from 19 % to 21 %
Rises in taxes on fuel , cigarettes and alcohol
Rises in taxes on luxury goods ' Survival ' Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou has likened the budget crisis to a " wartime situation " .
ANALYSIS By Malcolm Brabant , BBC News , Athens
In a country with Byzantine financial practices , one of the more idiosyncratic traits of Greek employment law is the requirement that workers receive their annual remuneration in 14 segments .
The methods vary , but in principle , employees get a full month 's extra wages at Christmas , an extra half month 's salary to help during the summer holiday period , plus another half month 's salary at Easter .
The bonuses carry great symbolic value in Greece , but the European Commission has urged the government to scrap them for civil servants .
Some of the cabinet have been reluctant to do so , not least because of strong opposition from trades unions .
The unions fear that any reduction in the bonuses will not be just for the duration of the crisis but will be permanent .
The main civil service union has called a 24 - hour strike on 16 March .
He told reporters : " These decisions are necessary for the survival of the country and the economy , so that Greece can exit the vortex of speculators and defamation , so that we can breathe and keep on fighting . "
The socialist government has pledged to reduce Greece 's budget deficit from 12.7 % - more than four times the limit under eurozone rules - to 8.7 % during 2010 .
It is also seeking to reduce its 300bn euro ( $ 419bn ; £ 259 bn ) debt .
European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said the plan confirmed that the Greek government was committed to " taking all necessary measures " to cut its deficit .
The German government also welcomed the new austerity plan , saying it was likely to inspire confidence in Athens .
The International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) called it a " very strong package " , AFP news agency reported .
The euro rose against the dollar after it was unveiled .
All the major European markets closed up about 1 % .
The yield on Greek bonds slipped slightly , reflecting greater confidence in the country 's debt .
The US credit rating agency Moody 's said the measures were " a clear manifestation " of Greece 's resolve to regain control of its public finances , the Associated Press ( AP ) news agency reported .
' Shameful '
The BBC's Malcolm Brabant in Athens says the package may have pleased Europe and financial markets , but they have infuriated the Greek trades unions and left - wing politicians .
I will certainly lose money - I estimate it will be 7 % of my salary
Eleni
Teacher in Athens
A teacher 's tale
The head of the civil service union described the wage cuts and tax increases as unjust .
There have been strikes in protest against the government 's cost - cutting plans .
The leader of the influential Communist Party described this latest round of financial pain as " shameful " and called for the working class to rise up against the EU and international markets .
On Wednesday Panayiotis Vavouyios , head of the retired civil servants ' association , said : " It is a very difficult day for us .
These cuts will take us to the brink .
" Brussels is demanding cuts and the government is doing nothing to stop them .
To make poor pensioners pay for this crisis is a disgrace . "
Mr Papandreou is due to meet German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin later on Friday .
Mr Papandreou said his government would go to the IMF " as a last resort " if EU assistance fell short , AP reported .

HERF volunteers in Haiti following the earthquake .
Photo by ©2010 HIP / Kevin Pina .
Marilyn Langlois , board member of the Haiti Emergency Relief Fund , interviewed by Amanda Zivcic , for Links International Journal of Socialist Renewal and Green Left Weekly .
March 1 , 2010
How was the Haiti Emergency Relief Fund formed , and how connected is the HERF to ordinary people in Haiti ?
The Haiti Emergency Relief Fund ( HERF ) was formed shortly after the February 29 , 2004 , coup e'tat as an offshoot of our partner organisation Haiti Action Committee ( both based in the San Franscisco Bay Area ) , which does political advocacy and consciousness raising about Haiti and has long - term relationships with several grassroots leaders in the Lavalas movement that represents the vast majority of Haiti 's population .
Several Haiti Action Committee members have travelled extensively and lived in Haiti , and its co-founder , Pierre Labossiere , is a Haitian currently based in the US who has helped us develop close ties with a broad network of activists in Haiti who have been working for democracy and empowerment of the poor under the leadership of Jean - Bertrand Aristide .
The 2004 coup d'etat , in which democratically elected President Aristide was kidnapped by US marines and the Lavalas government was dismantled with support from the US , France and Canada , ushered in a period of severe repression , during which our partners called on us for emergency support .
What was the role of the HERF initially ?
In the aftermath of the 2004 coup , which was a kind of political earthquake , we realised that material assistance was urgently needed by many of our partners who became political prisoners , or were forced into hiding or exile by the extreme political repression of the coup government supported by the US marines and then the United Nations .
All Lavalas members who had been employed by the Aristide governmnet lost their jobs and many social programs , including a major adult literacy program , were terminated after the coup .
For that reason HERF was created as a fund - raising organisation to provide support to numerous organisations , schools , women 's groups and agricultural collectives to help meet the needs of people and families suffering under the coup government and UN occupation .
In the ensuing years , HERF was additionally called on for support during the major hurricanes that hit Haiti in late 2004 and 2008 .
The damage caused by those hurricanes was tragic , unnecessary and frustrating , because under the Aristide government from 2000 to February 2004 , an extensive disaster preparedness system following the Cuban model had been put into place , but after the coup , that whole system was dismantled .
What is its current role of HERF ?
The current role of HERF is essentially the same as it has always been , except that the scope of the need has grown exponentially , given the magnitude of the earthquake disaster .
Again , it is very disheartening that six years of UN military occupation did nothing to re-establish the effective disaster preparedness system that was dismantled after the coup .
Further exacerbating the situation is the fact that the US military has been controlling the Port au Prince airport and aid distribution since the earthquake , only allowing a relatively small amount to actually reach the people who need it most , while huge stockpiles of food and supplies remain under guard at the airport .
For this reason , HERF has been sending funds directly to our partners on the ground so that they can purchase food , water and basic supplies for people living in many encampments and who have organised themselves to share what little they have as effectively as possible .
HERF has also facilitated bringing in some medical teams and medical supplies to Haiti to work alongside Haitian doctors in makeshift clinics .
HERF is funding a mobile schools project of the Aristide Foundation for Democracy in Port au Prince that hires older Haitian youth from the communities to go to different encampments and teach the younger children for a few hours a day .
How would you describe the current situation in Haiti ?
The reports we get are that people are traumatised and struggling to survive , and are doing so by and large peacefully , with much sharing and community building , despite indications to the contrary in the corporate media , which consistently fails to portray Haitian people with the respect and dignity they deserve .
The trauma is certainly taking a toll , and we have had requests for therapists to travel there , as Haitian therapists on the ground are overwhelmed with the sheer numbers of people needing assistance processing the psychological impacts of the disaster .
Physically , the conditions continue to be deplorable , and will only get worse as the rains come .
Have you had any indication from the people of Haiti as to what they think should be done post - quake , both in the short term and in the long term ?
What we hear is that for the short term , massive amounts of food , water and supplies , including tents , need to be made widely available to all neighbourhoods and encampments and Haitians be allowed to distribute this among themselves .
Given the amount of money donated worldwide to the major NGOs and relief agencies ( in the billions of dollars ) , there should be no problem filling all of these short - term needs .
HERF is small and can only do so much .
There are a few other groups doing good work , but the vast majority of aid is either not getting to the people at all , or is being distributed in a way that is demeaning and disempowering .
Haitians continue to call for the immediate return of Aristide , especially now in this time of crisis .
Aristide has the trust of the people and with his skills as administrator and psychologist , he could do a great deal to help guide the nation through the recovery and rebuilding process .
To date , the Haitian government , clearly under the thumb of the US State Department , has declined to issue him a passport , and he remains in forced exile in South Africa .
Haitians continue to call for an end to all military occupations , including that of the United Nations since 2004 and the current US de facto occupation .
There has been massive resistance to the past six years of UN occupation , with often lethal consequences , as on mulltiple occasions blue - helmet - clad " peacekeepers " invaded poor neighbourhoods populated by vocal demonstrators in pre-dawn hours , killing unarmed men , women and children with impunity .
Another thing grassroots groups in Haiti have called for , and continue to call for , is that the Haitian government and Unitied Nations launch a comprehensive investigation into the disappearance of human rights advocate Lovinsky Pierre - Antoine , who disappeared under mysterious circumstances on August 12 , 2007 , just two weeks after he led a demonstration in front of the UN headquarters in Port au Prince calling for an end to the UN occupation and return of Aristide .
Lovinsky is a co-founder of the Fondasyon Trant Septanm ( September 30 Foundation ) , which supports the victims of the September 30 , 1991 , coup d'etat , which ousted Aristide seven months after his first election to the presidency , and three years of brutal repression ensued .
To date neither the Haitian goverment nor the UN occupying authorities have done anything to investigate the circumstances of his disappearance .
In the long term , Haitians want to re-establish their democracy and determine themselves how the re-building process will unfold .
The Fanmi Lavalas party must be allowed to participate in elections again .
The party was banned from parliamentary elections last spring , sparking a very successful election boycott in which only 3 - 10 % of voters went to the polls in two successive elections .
Haitians want to control their own natural resources and agriculture , and put an end to policies imposed by the wealthy elites in collusion with the US and other international big - money interests that rob the Haitian people of what is rightly theirs .
It has been estimated that France owes Haiti about US $ 21 billion , todays equivalent of the obscene restitution Haiti was forced to pay to France from 1825 - 1946 to " compensate " for the former slaveholders ' losses following the Haitian revolution .
With $ 21 billion and a robust democracy , Haitians could do wonders with their country .
How would you describe the current role of the US in Haiti ?
The US has had varying degrees of control over Haiti 's affairs since its inception , beginning with its refusal to recognise the new republic in 1804 for fear that US slaves might be inspired to follow suit , to the outright US occupation of Haiti by marines from 1915 - 1934 , to the US support for the brutal Duvalier dictatorships under the guise of " anti-communism " , to the US support for two coups d'etat ousting the democratically elected President Aristide in 1991 and 2004 .
What is particuarly shocking now is how the United States ' immediate response to one of the worst humanitarian disasters ever was an entirely military one , with control and containment taking precedence over basic human caring and compassion .
Numerous people in Haiti have told us how bizarre it is to see throngs of armed soldiers patrolling areas where sick , injured and hungry people are peacefully trying to do what they can for each other .
There are many reasons why the US is so intent on controlling Haiti and not allowing Haitians to do their own thing .
In addition to some of the exploitive economic practices I 'll address in a later question , the US and US corporations clearly have their eyes on large untapped reserves of a variety of mineral resources in Haiti and just off - shore , including gold , oil and natural gas .
A further indication that the US has intentions to maintain significant control of Haiti is the fact that it recently constructed a huge new US embassy just outside Port au Prince .
This new US embassy compound in Haiti is the fifth - largest US embassy in the world , in a very small country with a population of around 8 million .
How would you describe the current role of NGOs operating in Haiti ?
Most major NGO 's in Haiti are not really meeting the needs of the people .
They tend to be well connected with major big business and the US / UN occupiers , with well - paid staff and a carefully crafted image of doing a few projects here and there , as long as the recipients of their largesse do n't get political and vocal about calling for the return of Aristide and Haitian democracy .
In the case of the Red Cross , we have heard reports that it has only earmarked about 20 % of the vast sums donated for earthquake relief in Haiti to that purpose , while the rest is being held for other things .
Of the larger NGOs , two exceptions to these questionable practices that I am aware of and that are actually getting aid to people and supporting their needs as much as possible are Partners in Health and Doctors Without Borders .
It 's ironic , by the way , that immediately after the quake , a Doctors Without Borders airplane carrying a medical field hospital was denied landing at the Port au Prince airport five times by the US military .
Can you make any comment on Haiti ’s economy , or economic development ?
What effect have sweatshops , agriculture and tourism had on it ?
What has been the US part in this ?
As I 've indicated above , a major challenge for the Haitian people is that they have not been allowed to fully control their own ecomonic development in a way to meet their needs .
Shortly after the successful revolution and establishment of the Republic of Haiti , the few wealthy elites remaining in the country were quickly co-opted by their couterparts abroad to thwart efforts to take the revolution to the next level and distribute resources more equitably among all the people .
Haitian popular movements have tried reversing this course many times , most recently and powerfully with the rise of the Lavalas movement from 1994 - 2004 , when trade unions were strengthened , the minimum wage was raised and Aristide 's government resisted heavy pressure to privatise state - owned utilities .
In addition , Aristide implemented a massive adult literacy program , expanded public education and built a medical school for the poor .
Prior to and during that time , the US did much to undermine equitable economic development , including dumping US - subsidised rice on the Haitian market which put Haitian rice farmers out of business , operating sweatshops for offshore assembly of items sold duty free in the US , and denying payment of development loans that had been granted to Haiti for entirely bogus reasons .
During the 1950s , a major dam was built in Haiti 's central plateau to provide electricity for a wealthy few while displacing huge numbers of farmers and peasants who ended up relocating in Port au Prince , forming the still impoverished slums of La Saline and Cite Soleil .
The Associated Press reported on February 22 , 2010 , that " in the quest to rebuild Haiti , the international community and business leaders are dusting off a pre-quake plan to expand its low - wage garment assembly industry as a linch - pin of recovery ...
All sides agree that garment - industry wages are too low to feed , clothe and house workers and their families .
Even factory owners acknowledge that reality -- though they deny running sweatshops ... " !
How important is Haiti ’s history ( like the first slave revolt and black republic ) and more recent events ( such as the election and then overthrow of Aristide ) to its political and social development ?
Haiti's history has played a huge role in its current political and social development .
What it boils down to is this : the enslaved people of France 's most lucrative colony , Saint Domingue , had the audacity to do something they were n't supposed to do and no one thought they were capable of doing in an era when European white supremacy was the order of the day .
They rose up and freed themselves , defeating three major European armies ( of France , England and Spain ) , and asserting that they , too , were full human beings intent on participating fully in the course of their own destiny .
This shocked and dismayed the powers that be of the day , and Haitians have been punished for it ever since .
Haitian revolutionaries stood up and challenged an entrenched and deeply racist social structure built on the notion that poor people of African descent are less than human , to be exploited economically in good times and to be feared in times of crisis .
It is a structure designed to protect the wealth of a few , at the expense of our common humanity .
Sadly this racist structure is still intact , as is apparent from the US government 's response to Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005 and again much more so after the January 12 , 2010 earthquake in Haiti .
In both instances , available and urgently needed aid was deliberately withheld from poor black people by the so - called leaders of the " free " world .
Is there anything else you would like to add ?
HERF stands shoulder to shoulder with our sisters and brothers in Haiti in insisting that the resources of the Earth be shared equitably and that all people have a place at the table in deciding their future .
To this end we engage in solidarity , not charity .

I hope everyone had a nice Valentine ’s weekend .
My hubs spoiled me with breakfast , gifts , and flowers .
Since Josh made breakfast , I took control and made dinner and baked his favorite cookies for dessert - oatmeal chocolate chip .
We also relaxed and watched the Olympics and the All Star game .
It was a nice , lazy Valentine ’s Day .
I recently posted my favorite vegetable spring rolls with peanut dipping sauce .
The peanut dipping sauce is the most amazing sauce ever .
I ca n’t praise it enough .
I was craving my peanut sauce the other night , but did n’t have all of the ingredients for spring rolls .
I decided to try the sauce with noodles and veggies instead .
It was just as tasty and super easy to make .
The peanut sauce went perfectly with the whole wheat noodles .
I love the nutty flavor of whole wheat pasta .
I used spaghetti noodles , but soba noodles would work too .
I tossed in broccoli , red and green peppers , carrots , and cilantro .
This meal was ready in a matter of minutes and it was outstanding - a new favorite .
Eating healthy does n’t have to take a ton of time or cost a lot of money .
This meal is a perfect example !
Give it a try this week .
Whole Wheat Noodles with Peanut Sauce and Vegetables Print ReviewSave Recipe Ingredients For Peanut Sauce :
1 small piece of lemon grass chopped
Freshly grated ginger - to taste
1 cup water
½ cup hoisin sauce
3 tablespoons smooth peanut butter
1½ tablespoons sugar
Whole Wheat Spaghetti Soba noodles would work too
Broccoli
Red Pepper Strips
Green Pepper Strips
Carrot Strips
Cilantro
Sesame Seeds Instructions
To make the peanut sauce :
In a small sauce pan , simmer lemon grass in the water for 5 minutes , strain out the lemongrass and add the remaining ingredients to the water .
Whisk well and simmer an additional 5 minutes .
If the sauce does n’t thicken , whisk for one minute over medium heat .
Boil a pot of water and add a little bit of salt .
Add the pasta and cook until done .
Drain and set aside .
Steam or blanch the vegetables .
I steamed mine .
In a large bowl , add the pasta and vegetables .
Toss .
Stir in some peanut sauce .
I did n't measure anything because I was making the dish for one .
If you are making it for several people , make a box of pasta and lots of veggies .
Slowly stir in the sauce and taste .
You probably wo n't need all of it .
When I made it for myself , I probably only used 2 - 3 Tablespoons of the sauce .
It is pretty flavorful .
Just add a little as you go and save the leftover sauce in the refrigerator .
I sprinkled the pasta and veggies with sesame seeds before serving .
This dish is good hot or cold .
You can use whatever veggies you like too .
Enjoy !

" A settlement has been struck , pending approval by a federal judge , between the DOJ , nine states , and ES&S requiring that the private company find a DoJ- approved purchaser of the Diebold / Premier assets . "
Whoa ---
I 'm sure all the potential " DoJ approved purchasers " are taking numbers and lining up .
NOT .
Has anyone informed the DoJ that no such chumps exist ?

Diebold is the company that recorded 16,22 NEGATIVE vptes for Gore in 2000 , in Volusia County ( Datona Beach ) Florida .
GORE HAD 16,000 MORE VOTES BEFORE VOLUSIA COUNTY WAS TALLIED THAN AFTER !!
The whole staff of diedold should be hung .
I believe they are an Israeli corporation , but I could be wrong on that !

Brad , ( I 'm looking for leverage here for more volume and more action by the DOJ ...)
Since these are fabulous news and DOJ has unexpectedly gone in the appropriate direction on this , can you post a link on this article pointing to several of the egregious results or egregious actions by Diebold , ES&S , and other electronic voting machine companies that we can point out to Attorney General Eric Holder that would impel him to criminally go after ES&S and Diebold ?
I would like to see a petition or letter to the DOJ we could sign onto and Twitter to demand investigations and prosecutions .
Is this something you can put together ?
Or at least point us to a list of affronts so we can write to Attorney General Eric Holder at AskDOJ@usdoj.gov
Thanks ,
Pat

Here 's a quick analysis of the possible impact of the USDOJ antitrust decision :
The acquisition by ES&S of Diebold 's Premier Election Solutions has been ( supposedly ) nixed by the US Department of Justice on antitrust grounds .
However , the DOJ erred by not acting promptly to protect the Premier Elections operation from being gutted by ES&S .
The Dept. of Justice claims that the deal flew under the radar so they could n't stop the pillaging of Premier in time .
That 's not the case .
The records will show that the Dept. of Justice had received --- and acknowledged --- formal complaints in time to put a protective halt on the mass firings of Premier employees .
HERE'S WHY THIS ERROR IS SO SIGNIFICANT : The USDOJ failed to act to protect the assets of Diebold 's Premier Elections unit , resulting in the problem that they now cannot mandate full divestiture of Premier by ES&S , and instead have ordered ES&S to remove itself from Premier 's current locations only partially --- or perhaps , not at all .
That 's right .
If the acquisition were to stand , ES&S would have over 70 % market share .
But under the current Dept. of Justice decision , ES&S may still end up with over 70 % market share .
Here 's why : Because ES&S gutted Premier and fired over 100 employees , no other entity can swoop in to acquire an intact company .
According to my sources inside Diebold , the Diebold corporation has no intention whatsoever of taking its Premier Elections unit back .
Diebold Inc. considers the current situation to be ES&S 's problem .
If another entity were to step in and buy the gutted Premier entity , they would not have enough support staff to service the accounts .
We are in the midst of an election year , with primaries coming down the road pell - mell .
Counties with the Premier equipment still need to run their elections .
Under the USDOJ decision , they can choose to sign with ES&S to take over their election support , or they can opt to wait and sign with an " acquirer " --- an entity that does not yet exist .
The expedient action will most likely be to sign with ES&S .
THIS LEAVES THE FOLLOWING POSSIBILITIES : a ) Most or all current Premier voting systems customers may sign with ES&S to support their Premier equipment , because they have elections coming up .
Firm deadlines with no other support available could effectively force counties to sign with ES&S. b)
Hart Intercivic or Sequoia might step in to become the " acquirer " , and under the USDOJ agreement the " acquirer " can scramble around trying to re-hire the Premier employees that were let go months ago .
Hart and Sequoia could use their existing staff to help handle election support pressure , which will be intense .
c)
One or some of the subcontractors , like LHS Associates ( northeast U.S. ) or GBS ( midwest ) could expand into servicing and controlling more states .
They may be licking their chops on this .
In other words , LHS Associates could say " Hey , Pennsylvania , whether or not any " acquirer " shows up to buy ES&S 's divestiture of Premier , we 'll support you with your existing equipment . "
d)
Some crony of ES&S , possibly waiting in the wings all along , could step in and may perhaps have already networked with former Premier employees to take over in the event of an antitrust rollback .
Since we still do n't know who actually owns ES&S , and we wo n't necessarily know who owns some new " acquirer " entity if it is privately held .
Who knows , it could even be the same guys who are quietly involved in ES&S .
e)
A group of angel investment bankers may jump in and theoretically that could be an opportunity for the citizenry to jump on this to form a kind of public utility .
Do n't hold your breath on this outcome , which might be cool but would scare the pants off some of the dirtier players in the elections industry .
BRC VOTING MACHINE ANTITRUST SITUATION , REVISITED
This proposed agreement has similarities to the 1997 deal when ES&S got into antitrust problems after buying a massive voting machine company called Business Records Corp .
Under the antitrust order , ES&S was allowed to service existing accounts and Sequoia was allowed to sell and service new accounts .
The current USDOJ decision allows ES&S to service existing accounts , but only an " acquirer " can sell new Premier equipment ( if anyone even wants it ! )
If any jurisdiction wants to replace more than 50 % of its existing voting system with new Premier stuff , they can't go to ES&S for the new stuff , but have to buy it from the " acquirer " instead .
So , it would make sense for Hart or Sequoia or one of the subcontractors like LHS Associates to jump in to grab the cash on new equipment sales .
Essentially , this would only rearrange the deck chairs , and the US elections industry would remain overconcentrated .
ROLLBACK OF THE NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS
One interesting situation : Former Premier employees and the ES&S employees who were involved with supporting the Premier product line recently will be released from their noncompete and nondisclosure agreements .
The decision does n't seem to cap or limit that requirement , from what I can see .
So the potential for spilling some more beans exists .

Bev ,
Thank you for the analysis .
With all the turmoil Bev describes , is it not possible to create a letter / petition to send to each Registrar of Voters or Secretary of State demanding a replacement of the electronic voting machines with paper ballots and to hand - count them at each precinct ?
Would this not be a propitious time to try this ?
Someone that knows how to get this going viral on the social media might be able to help build volume .
Brad or Bev might write the missive , and we could include the links to each county 's Registrar of voters or Secretary of State or whoever might have the power to make this decision .
Years ago , I had gathered links like this .
I am not sure if I could locate them again .
Still , it 's something we could try .

Oops .
Brad , looks like our messages collided .
I was not aware of a recent campaign from you .
Has the DieboldReturnOurMoney.com campaign been advertised widely ?
How much volume has it generated ?
I wish we could get some national agency like ACLU or PFAW enlisted to say electronic voting / counting are unconstitutional due to total control by a 2 - 3 corporations .

Brad reports : " The DoJ - ordered unwinding of the merger , however , will do little to ensure the accuracy or ability of citizens to oversee their own elections run on unobservable , easily manipulated , oft - failed electronic voting systems which use secret software made by private corporations to count votes in our public elections . "
And that 's why the entire anti-trust issue is a side - show .
Does it really matter whether our elections are entrusted to one crooked company with proprietary source codes which can hide wholesale thefts of elections or five ?
I know Brad favors doing so on pilot project basis , but , for me , the idea of verifiable democracy should not have to wait for the obvious to be proven .
Trash all e-voting systems --- both optical scans and DREs .
Use paper ballots to be hand - counted in each precinct before representatives of all parties and the press and publicly record and submit the precinct - by - precinct count to election central , where the precinct - by - precinct count can be verified and then added as a whole .
I mean , come on !
The simple act of counting is not rocket science !

“ I do n’t answer that question , ” she told me .
A FEMALE LAYSAN albatross is physically capable of laying only one egg per year — that ’s just how it ’s built .
Nevertheless , since as early as 1919 , biologists have periodically found nests of albatrosses ( and similar species of birds ) with two eggs inside them , or with a second egg just outside , as if it had rolled out .
( This will inevitably happen ; there ’s simply not enough room in the nest for two eggs and one Laysan albatross . )
Scientists have a term for the phenomenon of extra eggs in a nest : a “ supernormal clutch . ”
But in the case of the albatross , they never had a watertight explanation .
In the early 1960s , one ornithologist tried to put the whole cumbersome mystery to rest by asserting that some of those female birds must simply be able to lay multiple eggs .
The claim was apparently based on sketchy data , but supernormal clutches were so rare that it was hard to rack up enough observations to disprove the hypothesis .
Real progress was finally made in 1968 , when Harvey Fisher , a dean of midcentury albatross science , reported on seven years of daily observations made at 3,440 different nests on the Midway atoll in the middle of the Pacific .
Fisher concluded that “ two eggs in a nest are an indication that two females used the nest , although at different times . ”
He was describing “ egg dumping , ” whereby , for example , an inexperienced female accidentally lays her egg in the wrong nest .
From then on , egg dumping was a default explanation for supernormal clutches in albatrosses .
After all , Fisher had also declared that “ promiscuity , polygamy and polyandry are unknown in this species . ”
Lesbianism apparently never occurred to anyone — even enough to be cursorily dismissed .
As Brenda Zaun recently told me , “ It never dawned on anyone to sex the birds . ”
Zaun , a biologist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service , was studying a Laysan colony on Kauai 40 years after Fisher ’s publication .
She realized that certain nests there seemed to wind up with two eggs in them year after year ; the distribution of the supernormal clutches was n’t random , as it would presumably be if it were caused exclusively by egg dumping .
On a hunch , Zaun pulled feathers from a sample of the breeding pairs associated with two - egg nests and sent them to Lindsay Young , asking her to draw DNA from the feathers and genetically determine the sexes of those birds in her lab .
When the results showed that every bird was female , Young figured she ’d messed up .
So she did it again — and got the same result .
Then she genetically sexed every bird at Kaena Point .
“ Where it was n’t totally clear , or I worried that maybe I mixed up the sample , I actually went back into the field and took new blood samples to do it again , ” Young told me .
In the end , she genetically sexed the birds in her lab four times , just to be sure .
She found that 39 of the 125 nests at Kaena Point since 2004 belonged to female - female pairs , including more than 20 nests in which she ’d never noticed a supernormal clutch .
It seemed that certain females were somehow finding opportunities to quickly copulate with males but incubating their eggs — and doing everything else an albatross does while at the colony — with other females .
Young gave a talk about these findings at an international meeting of Pacific - seabird researchers .
“ There was a lot of murmuring in the room , ” she remembers .
“ Then , afterward , people were coming up to me and saying : ‘ We see supernormal clutches all the time .
We assumed it was a male and a female . ’
And I ’d say : ‘ Yeah ?
Well , you might want to look into that . ’ ” Recently , journals have asked her to confidentially peer - review new papers about other species , describing similar discoveries .
“ I ca n’t say which species , ” she explains , “ but my guess is , in the next year , we ’re going to see a lot more examples of this . ”
It may seem surprising that scientists sometimes do n’t know the true sexes of the animals they spend their careers studying — that they can be tripped up in some “ Tootsie ” - like farce for so long .
But it ’s easy to underestimate the pandemonium that they ’re struggling to interpret in the wild .
Often , biologists are forced to assign sexes to animals by watching what they do when they mate .
When one albatross or boar or cricket rears up and mounts a second , it would seem to be advertising the genders of both .
Unless , of course , that ’s not the situation at all .
“ There is still an overall presumption of heterosexuality , ” the biologist Bruce Bagemihl told me .
“ Individuals , populations or species are considered to be entirely heterosexual until proven otherwise . ”
While this may sound like a reasonable starting point , Bagemihl calls it a “ heterosexist bias ” and has shown it to be a significant roadblock to understanding the diversity of what animals actually do .
In 1999 , Bagemihl published “ Biological Exuberance , ” a book that pulled together a colossal amount of previous piecemeal research and showed how biologists ’ biases had marginalized animal homosexuality for the last 150 years — sometimes innocently enough , sometimes in an eruption of anthropomorphic disgust .
Courtship behaviors between two animals of the same sex were persistently described in the literature as “ mock ” or “ pseudo ” courtship — or just “ practice . ”
Homosexual sex between ostriches was interpreted by one scientist as “ a nuisance ” that “ goes on and on . ”
One man , studying Mazarine Blue butterflies in Morocco in 1987 , regretted having to report “ the lurid details of declining moral standards and of horrific sexual offenses ” which are “ all too often packed ” into national newspapers .
And a bighorn - sheep biologist confessed in his memoir , “ I still cringe at the memory of seeing old D - ram mount S - ram repeatedly . ”
To think , he wrote , “ of those magnificent beasts as ‘ queers ’ — Oh , God ! ”
“ What Bagemihl ’s book really did , ” the Canadian primatologist and evolutionary psychologist Paul Vasey says , “ is raise people ’s awareness around the fact that this occurs in quote - unquote nature — in animals .
And that it can be studied in a serious , scholarly way . ”
But studying it seriously means resolving a conundrum .
At the heart of evolutionary biology , since Darwin , has been the idea that any genetic traits and behaviors that outfit an animal with an advantage — that help the animal make lots of offspring — will remain in a species , while ones that do n’t will vanish .
In short , evolution gradually optimizes every animal toward a single goal : passing on its genes .
The Yale ornithologist Richard Prum told me : “ Our field is a lot like economics : we have a core of theory , like free - market theory , where we have the invisible hand of the market creating order — all commodities attain exactly the price they ’re worth .
Homosexuality is a tough case , because it appears to violate that central tenet , that all of sexual behavior is about reproduction .
The question is , why would anyone invest in sexual behavior that is n’t reproductive ? ” –— much less a behavior that looks to be starkly counterproductive .
Moreover , if animals carrying the genes associated with it are less likely to reproduce , how has that behavior managed to stick around ?

This is the full text of HR 4872 - the reconciliation package to make changes in the Senate health bill .
The reconciliation bill also incorporates student loan legislation , ending bank subsidies and making direct loans to students .
Pope Benedict XVI has for the first time been drawn into the Catholic sex abuse scandal in his home country of Germany .
His former archdiocese of Munich has acknowledged that , while he was in charge , it dealt with a suspected paedophile priest by transferring him to a different parish where he went on to commit sex offences against children .
The revelation has drawn attention to Benedict 's handling of abuse claims , both when archbishop and later as a prefect of the Vatican office dealing with such crimes , a position he held until becoming pope in 2005 .
Yesterday , the head of the German Catholic bishop 's conference , Archbishop Robert Zollitsch , revealed he was investigating more than 170 allegations of abuse in the church 's institutions .
The scandal broke in January when it was alleged that , over a period of 30 years , priests found to be abusing children had been redeployed to other parishes rather than dismissed .
Zollitsch reported that Benedict had expressed " great dismay and deep shock " when briefed , but had encouraged the bishops to continue searching for the truth .
Hours later however , the Munich archdiocese admitted it had allowed a priest suspected of having abused a child to return to pastoral work in the 1980s , while Benedict , then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger , was archbishop .
The archdiocese said the chaplain , identified only as H , was given therapy for suspected " sexual relations with boys " but then moved to nearby Grafing .
He was suspended in 1985 following fresh accusations , and convicted of sexually abusing minors the following year .
Last night , a Vatican spokesman stated that it was the Munich vicar - general who had approved the transfer and he took " full responsibility " , while the Munich archdiocese said Benedict did not know about the transfer .
However , an American charity expressed disbelief .
" We find it extraordinarily hard to believe that Ratzinger did n't reassign the predator , or know about the reassignment , " said Barbara Blaine , of Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests .
The pope has also faced criticism for a letter he sent from the Vatican in 2001 advising all bishops that all cases of abuse were subject to pontifical secret and must be forwarded to his office .
Germany 's justice minister cited the document as evidence of a Vatican " wall of silence " around abuse cases .
Now that the media has squeezed every last eyeball from the year of frenzied interest in health care reform , it appears that Crazy Republicans are , at the very least , the interim replacement .
A supporting player in the health care drama , it looks like they have become the story now .
On the heels of racial and sexual slurs , spit and brick attacks , and death threats , a new Harris poll that ’s making the cable news rounds cements the notion of the scary conservative who believes that President Obama is , among other things , a Nazi-esque Muslim Antichrist .
The poll has been fairly ubiquitous on cable news shows the past few days .
The numbers are scary , indeed .
67 % believe the President is a socialist , although Harris did n’t do anything to verify that respondents knew what that word meant .
The real sizzler , though , is the 45 % who believe he was n’t born in the US , and the 24 % who say he “ may be the Antichrist . ”
There ’s no way to tell if there ’s any overlap , so it could be that up to 69 % of Republicans believe the President was either born in another country , or that he was born here , but of a jackal .
My first instinct was that the cablers were paraphrasing , and cooking the numbers by including “ not sure ” responses .
Nope , these were straight true / false questions , no “ unsure ” responses .
The poll ’s methodology is not rock solid .
While the sample size is more than adequate at 2,320 ( scientific pollsters frequently use samples in the 500 range ) , the poll is an interactive survey , as ABC ’s Gary Langer points out , “ done among people who sign up to click through questionnaires via the Internet in exchange for points redeemable for cash and gifts – not a probability sample . ”
Others have attacked the way the questions were asked , and they have a point .
For example , if you believe in an Antichrist , end - times theology states that it could be pretty much anyone .
Hell , I ’d probably score higher than 24 % on this poll .
As for “ doing many of the things Hitler did , ” aside from slaughtering millions and admiring his ball , who does n’t ?
Taken literally , it ’s a tough statement to disagree with , especially when you ’ve got Bonus Web Bucks riding on it .
This is not to say that Harris ’ survey is necessarily weaker than others of its kind .
This kind of interactive polling is relied upon all the time for market research and the like .
It ’s just not as solid as other , more expensive polling methods .
Zogby International , for example , uses similar methods .
Even if you grant a pretty wide margin of error , though , people will assume that where there ’s smoke , there ’s fire .
The Republican leadership ’s willingness to flirt with ideas like the birth certificate conspiracy , or their insistence that health care reform is an “ apocalypse , ” will appear to be bearing fruit .
Methodology aside , the battle to paint Republicans as unhinged loons has already been won , as this poll has been splashed across TV and computer screens as a series of bullets , straight to the heart of conservative credibility .
The next stop ?
Gun rights rallies scheduled for April 19 , the anniversary of both the end of the 1993 siege in Waco , and the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing .
Liberal cable hosts like Rachel Maddow are already raising an eyebrow , if not an alarm .
How can conservatives combat the new narrative ?
That ’s a tough question .
Once people start looking at you like you ’re crazy , it ’s tough to shake that impression .
The louder you protest your sanity , the crazier you look .
Their best bet may be to lay low until someone overreacts , and that becomes the new story .
Have a tip we should know ?

Half marathons and marathons can be over in a matter of hours , but runners , both newbies and elite , often spend months training for the 13.1 - and 26.2 - mile races .
Robert Chapman , director of the Human Performance Laboratory in Indiana University 's School of Health , Physical Education and Recreation , and coach of Brook Team Indiana Elite , discusses four common mistakes runners make when preparing for these major races .
Mistake # 1 : Discounting the importance of the weekly long run .
For the half - marathon and marathon , the weekly long run is one of the most important components of training .
The adaptations that take place physiologically and psychologically during the long run are critical in helping the runner complete the race distance , as well as helping the runner achieve a goal time .
Key adaptations that take place with the weekly long run :
Increased storage of muscle glycogen .
Glycogen is the primary storage form of carbohydrates in the body , and the amount of glycogen the body can store is limited .
In a typical person , there is enough glycogen present to fuel about two to three hours of moderate exercise .
When glycogen stores get low or run out , the runner " hits the wall " and will struggle to finish the event .
However , glycogen stores can increase as a result of training , and stores improve significantly as a result of including long runs each week .
Improved psychological ability to handle the race distance .
With each weekly long run , there is an improvement in the runner 's ability to mentally tolerate exercising for long periods of time .
Improved ability to absorb and tolerate the " pounding " the legs will take during the race .
Feet , joints , tendons and muscles are all gradually strengthened over time from the overloading they receive from the weekly long run .
Many runners who fail to finish a marathon do so because of leg pain and discomfort , resulting from the weight - bearing pounding over 26 miles .
Chapman recommends a long run once each week , starting early in training at about 20 percent of overall weekly volume .
From there , athletes in the half - marathon should aim for a minimum long run distance of 8 - 10 miles , ideally completed at least twice before their race .
Marathoners should aim for a minimum long run distance of 15 miles , completed at least twice before the race , with at least two long runs of around 20 miles being ideal .
Mistake # 2 : Selecting a race without considering the weather or lifestyle considerations for training .
Most marathons are held in the spring or fall because of the milder temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere .
Most experts recommend a training buildup of 10 - 16 weeks for most experienced runners prior to a marathon , perhaps a few weeks less for a half marathon .
For athletes who select a spring race , this will mean completing a large portion of their training during the thick of winter -- where cold temperatures , snow and ice , and limited daylight hours can all have a dramatic effect on the quality of training and motivation for completion .
Runners with work and family commitments , who have to train in early morning or evening hours , may find preparation for a spring marathon challenging .
For athletes who select a fall marathon or half marathon , the bulk of the training load will come during the heat and humidity of summer .
For most runners , training in extreme heat is more challenging than training in cold weather , where additional clothing can be worn .
While it may be considerably easier to get runs in during early morning or late evening hours , summer is typically full of family vacations and weekend outings that can make sticking with a rigid training routine more difficult .

In the end , when deciding on a marathon or half marathon , each runner should take a look not just at the time of the year of the race , but the logistics of how well they will be able to complete their training in the three to four months prior to the event .
Mistake # 3 : Failing to " practice " the race day routine .
After weeks and weeks of training , many runners end up failing to finish or meet their goals -- often due to some simple , small detail that was overlooked regarding race day routine .
Here are some examples :
Not being used to running in the early morning , when most races start .
Logistics such as bus departure for the race start , parking , proximity of race to hotel .
Breakfast decisions , such as what and when to eat .
Clothing , shoes , socks -- will they cause chafing or blistering ?
Uncertainty about the sports drink provided by the race and whether it upsets runners ' stomaches .
Shoe choice -- newer or older pair .
Many of these questions can be worked out during weekly long runs , such as clothing and breakfast choices .
Runners also can contact race organizers for details about sports drinks and then try out the drinks during training .
The weekly long run is not just an important component for training adaptations .
It is also a great " dry run " for the race .
Mistake # 4 : Starting the race too fast .
Three athletes who Chapman coaches qualified for the U.S. Olympic Marathon Trials and another won the Columbus Marathon in her debut at the distance .
In all four cases , the athletes executed a " negative split " strategy -- where the second half of the race was faster than the first .
Based on the paces completed in training , runners should have a strong idea of what pace they are capable of executing for the race distance , with slight modifications based on changing race day conditions such as weather .
Once that pace is determined , Chapman recommends a conservative approach , especially if the goal is simply to finish the race .
Even if a runner has a goal time in mind , a conservative , negative split approach will often lead to best performances , typically without the late race discomfort that normally accompanies a more aggressive pacing approach .
Starting out at a conservative pace can often be a challenge with the excitement of the race start , the bands and music , and even fireworks that are present when the gun fires .
However , the most common recipe for disaster in a marathon is going out too fast .
For a plan that puts " competition " as its number one goal , the National Broadband Plan is remarkably light on policies that will produce much of it in the wireline space .
Talk of competition is everywhere , but all suggestions are remarkably general or terribly banal : " more data collection " and " future policy reviews " are everywhere .
Suggestions about how such reviews should turn out is lacking .
But the reviews will still be held , and at some point the consensus - building NBP will devolve into ugly battles of wholesale access , special access ( middle - mile connections ) , and ISP disclosure .
The FCC commissioners know it , and they 're already gearing up for the fights ahead .
All five commissioners issued statements when the Plan appeared , and everyone took on the issue of competition .
" We should be very concerned about the competitive state of broadband service , " warned Mignon Clyburn .
" We need to keep our eye on the ball here because evidence in the Plan suggests that by 2012 only 15 percent of households will have the ' luxury ' of two providers offering the highest speeds of broadband service ( up to 50 Mbps ) .
Seventy - five percent of households will have only one provider offering the highest speed .
And the remainder of households will not have the highest speeds offered to them at all . "
Clyburn made clear she is willing to take bold action , saying that " the Commission must stand ready to act where competition is lacking and be willing to use all available tools to protect consumers and to inject meaningful competition into the marketplace . "
The longest - serving commissioner , Michael Copps , went directly after the lack of competition - creating policies in the Plan .
" Lack of competition could conceivably require us to take actions going beyond what is generally discussed here , " he said .
" I daresay that I do n’t need to remind many people here that competition is not , to my mind , the defining hallmark of America ’s current telecommunications sector .
But it is at the core of our enabling statute .
In competition , and elsewhere , should we find that we lack the tools we need to conduct effective public interest oversight of the evolving broadband network , we may have to invoke other available authorities already invested in the Commission — or , should we lack some authority that we need , we may have to request it . "
The two Republican commissioners see the implicit threats of more government action here , and both rallied to beat it back .
Robert McDowell praised the current deregulatory environment for promoting the robust competition we have today .
" As a direct result of adopting policies that ensured the ’ Net would be regulated only with a light touch , the Internet environment is growing and evolving faster than any individual , company or government can measure .... " he wrote .
" As the Commission and Congress move to consider the ideas offered up by the Office of Broadband Initiative , we should make sure that we first and foremost do no harm . "
" Broadband competition is healthy and vibrant , " added Meredith Baker .
" Under a light - touch targeted regulatory regime in both the Clinton and Bush Administrations , we have gone from a narrowband dial - up world to a multi- platform broadband world by crafting a regulatory framework that promotes facilities - based competition in lieu of prescriptive government requirements . "
In other words , the US has moved towards a cable / telco duopoly ( " facilities - based competition " ) and away from line - sharing rules ( " prescriptive government requirements " ) .
Let 's get ready to rumble
The NBP reminds us that , within a few years , cable will be the only high - speed choice for most Americans unless the telcos start investing in fiber to replace their aging copper networks .
Even now , in a well - off Chicago suburb , I have a single ISP choice if I want anything over 6 Mbps .
Promoting competition might not require a return to line - sharing mandates — but it certainly requires something .
If heavily taxed and highly regulated France can get a complete triple play package of phone , TV , and Internet for € 30 a month , these claims about robust US competition look ... less than robust .
So the big fights are coming .
Baker asks for a " consensus - based broadband policy , " but given the ground commissioners are already staking out , that seems difficult if not impossible once the important proceedings begin in earnest .
The NBP punted on the toughest questions , perhaps in an effort to give its
Plan the consensus that Baker wants , but they will be answered someday .
As for the FCC Chair , Julius Genachowski , he did not take up the line adopted by his Democratic colleagues .
In praising the Plan , he noted that it is " idealistic , but not ideological .
From my time in the private sector , I have personal appreciation for its focus on the vital role of private investment and competition ; and on providing real solutions to real problems . "
Genachowski has been good about making the FCC a collegial place once again , seeking common ground whenever possible and operating in a more transparent fashion .
But , when the " comprehensive review of wholesale competition rules " begins , that approach may be tested to the breaking point .
The Democratic Republic of Congo ’s bad luck is to be rich in resources .
Foreign investors are pouring billions of dollars into large extractive projects such as mines and hydropower dams .
In a classic case of the resource curse , these projects are not promoting the country ’s long - term development , but attracting short - term profiteers , conflict , and corruption .
In the latest example for this trend , the World Bank has just reported huge delays and cost overruns for the rehabilitation of the Inga 1 and 2 hydropower dams .
Other projects are being swallowed by the morass of Congo ’s resource curse at the same time .
The Inga 1 and 2 dams were built on the Congo River in the 1970s and 1980s as part of a failed industrialisation scheme .
Operating at only 40 per cent of capacity , the projects turned into white elephants and contributed heavily to the country ’s spiralling debt crisis .
As International Rivers ’ Terri Hathaway discovered on a visit to the site , the people who were displaced by the dams were never properly rehabilitated , and are still fighting for just compensation after several decades .
In 2003 , the World Bank committed US $ 179 million towards the reconstruction of a transmission line from the Inga dams to Southern Congo .
A few years later , the World Bank , African Development Bank and European Investment Bank approved more than US$ 500 million in funding to rehabilitate the ailing dams on the Congo River .
Rehabilitating existing dams makes sense as long as the use of funds is closely monitored .
In 2007 , International Rivers called on the World Bank to resolve the outstanding social problems of the Inga dams as part of its work on the new project .
Two years later , the Bank informed us that it was indeed gathering information ‘ for an appropriate social development plan for the affected communities ’ as part of the Inga rehabilitation .
The relatively modest rehabilitation of the Inga dams and transmission lines has already run into serious problems .
Around 2002 , US$ 110 million that the World Bank supposedly spent on Congo ’s electricity sector went missing .
Last year , the Bank had to quietly double its lending for the transmission line .
And on 23 February , Reuters reported that the rehabilitation of the Inga dams will be delayed for three years , cost an extra US $ 300 - $ 400 million , and will be scaled back in scope .
In other words , Congo will have to go deeper into debt for a smaller project whose benefits may materialise later .
Without going into details , the World Bank blamed the setback on the poor quality of consultants ’ studies , implementation problems , and the effects of the world financial crisis .
On the very same day , bad news has reached us regarding two other big projects in Congo .
An appeals court in Hong Kong decided that a signature bonus which a Chinese consortium paid when it signed a multi-billion dollar mining and infrastructure project will not go to the DRC ’s government , but rather to a vulture fund in the US .
This fund bought up debt from the 1980s on which the Congo had defaulted a long time ago , and is also trying to lay its hands on the revenues of the Inga dams .
The irony is that US $ 24 million of the Chinese bonus has already disappeared into private pockets .
A commission set up by the Congolese parliament charged that the millions were stolen by representatives of the state ’s mining company and local officials .
Also this week , the World Bank ’s private sector arm announced that it will not make any new investments in the Congo until a dispute over a mining project is resolved .
Last August , the DRC government had cancelled the contract for a US $ 553 million copper and cobalt project in which the World Bank had invested .
‘ If it turns out that contracts cannot be considered binding , that would be concerning to us , ’ a World Bank official said , feigning surprise about the lack of legal guarantees in the country .
As always , the details about such fraudulent schemes will not become public .
But the big picture behind the daily scandals looks familiar .
The elites in poor but resource - rich countries such as the DRC often have no interest in the actual operation of infrastructure or mining projects .
This would require a long - term perspective which they cannot afford .
They rather try to skim off signature bonuses , bribes and other short - term benefits from an investment as quickly as they can .
When new officials assume powerful positions , they also want to take their cuts , and so contracts get suspended , projects are being delayed , legal problems ensue , and the costs go up .
While the Inga 1 and 2 projects are toiling through this morass , power companies , governments and international funders are considering building the huge US $ 80 billion Grand Inga Dam .
This project would divert the Congo River and generate electricity for export to Southern Africa , Europe and possibly the Middle East .
Just imagine the feeding frenzy that a honey pot of US $ 80 billion would unleash within the DRC ’s elite and its international cronies .
The Congo ’s impoverished , war - ravaged population deserves support .
The experience with the resource curse has shown time and again that large , top - down infrastructure and mining projects will not benefit the poor .
Modest investments in decentralised infrastructure and in the economic activities of the local population have a better chance at reducing poverty .
Rural electrification and support for the people affected by the Inga dams would be a good place to start .

Dawn of the Theories of International Politics and Zombies
Longtime readers might recall this August post about how international relations theory would cope with a zombie attack , which in turn prompted further blog inquiries from other disciplines .
The trigger for that post was a mathematical simulation by Carelton University researchers that came to a bummer of a conclusion :
An outbreak of zombies infecting humans is likely to be disastrous , unless extremely aggressive tactics are employed against the undead … .
A zombie outbreak is likely to lead to the collapse of civilization , unless it is dealt with quickly .
Well , hold everything !
Richard Nielson at the Social Science Statistics
Blog alerts us to new research on the matter from Blake Messer :
The latter problem may be less intuitive so I ’ll explain my reasoning : Humans who survive the initial outbreak survive for a reason .
Disproportionately , they were faster , smarter , and stronger to begin with than their fallen peers .
Even if they were n’t , they were luckier and have probably been able to , at least , find a more defensible location than where they started at round zero of the outbreak , increasing their chances of survival simply by virtue of having survived the early rounds of the outbreak .
So , I constructed a computational agent - based zombie outbreak model to test how my assumptions might alter the solution .
His result seems pretty encouraging :
[ T ]he [ Carelton University ] team ’s model leaves something more profound out the equation : human capacity for ex-post organization and response .
When accounting for these things , I can find scenarios of large initial zombie outbreaks that , when followed by quick adoption of strong anti-zombie defense policies may help pockets , or even large fractions of civilization to ward off the impending doom of mass zombie infection !
How exciting !
Phew !!
Sounds like an uprising of the undead wo n’t be as calamitous as we originally thought .
Except that then we get to Gabriel Rossman ’s sociological take :
[ If ] the Romero movies have taught us anything , it ’s that the defensive resources are only effective if they are n’t sabotaged by the internal squabbles of humans .
( If you ’re not familiar with Romero ’s movies , think of what Newman from Seinfeld did in “ Jurassic Park ” ) .
Thus you ’d have to add another parameter , which is the probability in any given period that some jackass sabotages the defensive perimeter , steals the battle bus , etc .
If such sabotage eliminates or even appreciably reduces the “ safe area ” efficacy then human survival in the “ safe areas ” is contingent on the act of sabotage not occurring ….
So a more elaborated model would not only have to add in parameters for spatial heterogeneity , but also human sabotage .
The man has a point .
Indeed , other zombie enthusiasts have made related points :
[ T ]he prospect of a zombie apocalypse actually represents a chance to throw off the constrictive fetters of society , shoot your neighbours in the face , steal some guns and a car , and drive off into the sunrise , taking along only those friends and family you trust and care about the most .
As such , it represents a simplifying of life .
However , part of what needs to be figured out is whether there is any organizational cohesion in the wake of a zombie attack .
As the Carnegie school of political organizations would suggest , organizations exist in part to compensate for the stupidity bounded rationality of individuals .
Perhaps hierarchy and standard operating procedures in the wake of zombie attacks would help prevent the kind of sabotage discussed by Rossman .
And yet .
If bureaucratic conflicts and organizational pathologies hamper effective counter - terrorism policies , imagine the effect they would have on anti-zombie policies .
The bureaucratic turf wars would be significant .
Quelling the rise of the undead would require significant interagency coordination .
In the United States , one could easily envisage major roles for the Departments of State , Defense , Justice , Homeland Security , Transportation , and Health and Human Services .
This does not include autonomous or semi-autonomous agencies like the Federal Emergency Management Agency , Environmental Protection Agency , Food and Drug Administration , Center for Disease Control , and the myriad intelligence agencies .
So the ability of organizations to adapt to an army of the undead is an open question .
Clearly , further research in this area is desperately needed .

The unmanned Progress M-07 M spacecraft , launched from Kazakhstan on Tuesday , completed an automatic docking with the ISS on Friday morning , the Russian space agency said .
It delivered 2.5 tonnes of fuel , oxygen , food , water and other supplies , as well as scientific equipment and personal packages for the astronauts .
The station 's crew includes Americans Timothy Creamer and Jeff Williams , Russians Maxim Surayev and Oleg Kotov , and Japan 's Soichi Noguchi .
Once its cargo is unloaded , the Progress vessel will be filled with garbage and , like its predecessors , will be undocked from the station and burned in Earth 's atmosphere .
This Progress spacecraft is scheduled to be undocked in May .
There are currently two Progress cargo ships and two Soyuz crew capsules docked at the station , the first time so many Russian vessels have been moored there .
The station will have to make room for one more ship , as the space shuttle Endeavour is slated to launch early Sunday and dock with the station Tuesday .
The space shuttle Endeavour stands on its launch pad at Cape Canaveral , Fla. , ahead of its scheduled launch Sunday .
( ( John Raoux / Associated Press ) )
After Endeavour 's 13 - day mission , the space station will be 98 per cent complete .
The shuttle is carrying the Italian - built Tranquility module , also called Node 3 , which will provide life - support systems and living quarters to the station .
It is topped with a seven - window hexagonal dome , called Cupola , which will be used to observe dockings and Canadarm 2 operations .
Astronauts currently use TV cameras and monitors when they 're using the robotic arm , and the module 's large windows will allow them a direct view .
The dome has one large circular window — at 80 centimetres across , the largest ever sent into space — with six trapezoidal windows around it .
The windows are made of four panes of fused silica glass and each has a metal shutter to protect it from space junk and micrometeoroids .
The shuttles ' contribution to the construction of the space station is scheduled to conclude in September with Discovery 's launch carrying the Leonardo multipurpose module .
Further station modules , such as the European robotic arm and the Nauka laboratory , will be carried by Russian rockets .
The White House 's proposed budget announced this week gave a funding boost to the International Space Station , extending its operation until at least 2020 .
Including Sunday 's Endeavour launch , only five more shuttle missions are scheduled .
After that , the fleet is slated to be retired .
RAHWAY -- She was a frosty Venus de Milo , but one Rahway family ’s snow - packed tribute to the Greek goddess of love and beauty was another person ’s pornography .
Maria Conneran and her family worked feverishly to fashion their armless , nude snowlady from last week ’s heap of snow , grabbing attention and photographs on Rahway ’s Colonia Boulevard .
Not all the attention was good , however .

Among the visitors was a patrolman dispatched to the Conneran household after Rahway police received an anonymous complaint " of a naked snow woman , " said Sgt. Dominick Sforza .
She sure was , the family gleefully agreed .
" Curvaceous , bodacious and booty - licious , " said Elisa Gonzalez , a court reporter who built the snow goddess with her daughter , Maria Conneran , 21 and son , Jack Shearing , 12 .
" But she had a six - pack ! " Conneran said .
When the officer arrived , Gonzalez said , he was apologetic and appreciative of the snowlady and her assets .
" He said , ‘ It ’s very good , ’ " Gonzalez recalled .
Despite his appreciation , the officer then asked the family to dress the snowlady .
Nonplussed , they complied with a green bikini top and a blue sarong around her ample hips .
" I thought she looked more objectified and sexualized after you put the bikini on , " Gonzalez said .
Conneran and Gonzalez said the visit from police reminded them of former Attorney General John Ashcroft ’s move to drape a semi-nude statue of the Spirit of Justice when he arrived to lead the U.S. Justice Department .
" ( Our snowlady ) looks like marble .
It looks like a statue , " Conneran said .
" Are you going to go to the Met and cover up all the statues ? "
William Torres , visiting the neighborhood from North Carolina , agreed the snowlady should have remained au naturel .
" They ’re censoring art , " Torres said .
" To me ... that ’s no different from what you see in a museum ... and its lifespan was short anyway . "
Indeed .
On Monday , the family took down the snowlady , because with the return of warmer weather , she was starting to melt away .
The Venus di Milo may be gone , but the Connerans said they will continue their work with the next snow .
This was not their first foray into famous snow sculpture .
Last January , the family created a realistic bust of newly inaugurated President Obama .

Trevor Baylis , the inventor of the wind - up radio , has revealed that he was sexually abused by a curate at an Anglican church as a child .
Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Broadcasting
House , he described how he thought he had been taking part in a " religious ritual " , and called the man responsible for his abuse " absolute scum " .
The Catholic church has been hit by revelations of child sex abuse in a number of countries recently , with the Pope apologising to victims of abuse in a pastoral letter to Irish Catholics .
( CNN ) -- President Obama is expected to sign the final health care legislation into law this week , but while the action wraps up on Capitol Hill , the heated debate over reform shows no sign of cooling down .
With lawmakers back in their districts for the spring work period , the conversation just moves to a different platform .
For Democrats , the two - week recess is an opportunity to highlight the immediate benefits of a law the public is not yet sold on .
Democrats say the health care law provides all Americans with the opportunity to receive health care and prevents insurance companies from denying coverage to those who need it most .
For Republicans , it 's a chance to rally support behind their efforts to repeal what they decry as a " takeover " of the health care system that will saddle future generations of Americans with debt .
What 's the one thing you want to ask your representatives ?
Republicans have made " repeal and replace " their battle cry , and Obama has said he welcomes the fight .
At an event in Iowa City , Iowa , last week , the president scoffed at the Republicans ' strategy , saying , " My attitude is -- Go for it . "
Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann last week introduced a bill to repeal the health care legislation , as did other Republican lawmakers .
" We need to work together , whether we 're Republicans , independents , Democrats , we all have to work together for whatever is in the best interest of the American people .
And repeal most certainly is in the best interest of the people because this bill will lead to economic harm if it 's left in place , " Bachmann told CBS ' " Face the Nation . "
But Tim Kaine , chairman of the Democratic National Committee , said he does n't think efforts to knock down the legislation stand much chance .
" They may want to push forward on a repeal of health care , to tell small businesses you 're not going to get tax credits to pay for insurance , to tell families you now can't keep children on your policy until [ they ] 're 26 , to tell folks that you 're now subject to these abuses of the insurance industry .
I think they'd be unwise to do it .
I think the American public will reject it , " he told CBS .
Despite the opposing messages , both sides say the public supports them .
Republicans say the public opposes the president 's plan , but Democrats insist that people will eventually accept the plan now that it is finalized .
And so far , both sides have a point .
Most Americans disapprove of the health care reform law , but that does not translate into majority support for the " repeal and replace " strategy , according to a CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll released Monday .
CNN Poll : Americans divided over repealing health care law
Meanwhile , polls from both CBS and Quinnipiac University suggest that there has been a slight uptick in approval of the legislation following the vote .
Another survey , a ABC / Washington
Post poll released Sunday , indicated that the public 's overall view of the health care plan has held steady , with 46 percent supporting it and 50 percent opposed .
The percentage of people who said they strongly support the health care legislation , however , increased by 10 points since February , while the percentage who strongly opposed it stayed about the same .
" We 'll find out in November who won or lost this battle , " Sen . Jim DeMint , R - South Carolina , told CBS .
" What I do next is , I 'm trying to replace those who voted for this bill .
I want to repeal it .
And I want to replace it with some real reform that puts patients in charge of their health care again , " he said .
Echoing DeMint , South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said he was looking forward to an election in November " about whether this health care bill is a real fix or a phony political document trying to grow the government . "
Calling the legislation a " giant Ponzi scheme , " the Republican senator vowed that the fight " wo n't wind up just being in Washington . "
Following a week of over - the - top rhetoric stemming from the health care vote , Sen. Barbara Mikulski , a Democrat from Maryland , cautioned that if lawmakers do n't watch their own words , they 'll hurt their credibility .
" If we do n't take ourselves seriously and act in a serious way , we 're not going to be taken seriously by the American people , " Mikulski said .
" I have a suggestion .
Let 's go back to the three R's : respect , rules of engagement that promote decorum , and , No. 3 -- stop the rewards system that enables you to raise a lot of money after using outrageous and bizarre behavior , " she added .
* Vilsack says well - crafted bill could avoid costs
* USDA studying ways to improve carbon offsets
WASHINGTON , March 15 ( Reuters ) - The U.S. agriculture secretary told a farm group on Monday that a well - designed climate bill would provide opportunities for farmers and ranchers to make money in contracts for carbon offsets .
The U.S. Department of Agriculture “ is committed to helping Congress design and implement a carbon offsets market that will provide significant income opportunities to America ’s farmers and ranchers , ” Secretary Tom Vilsack told the National Farmers Union convention in South Dakota on Monday .
Climate bill opponents , such as the 6 million member American Farm Bureau Federation , have said higher fuel and fertilizer costs resulting from the legislation would outweigh revenue from contracts to offset greenhouse gases by planting trees and crops that capture carbon .
USDA chief economist Joseph Glauber said in a memo released by the department on Monday that “ some actions to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions can reduce commodity output . ”
He said converting bare or cultivated land into forests , or afforestation , was one example of where that can occur .
Glauber is working with the Environmental Protection Agency to study ways to improve agricultural carbon offsets .
Offsets would allow polluters to invest in clean agriculture projects such as afforestation and techniques to store carbon in soil , rather than cut their own emissions .
“ USDA and third - party analyses , as well as our experience in implementing conservation techniques , make it absolutely clear that properly structured legislation will avoid unintended consequences and provide enormous benefits to our agricultural economy , and our environment , ” Vilsack said .
Senators John Kerry , a Democrat , Lindsey Graham , a Republican , and Joe Lieberman , an independent , are working on a compromise climate bill .
They could outline the bill next week , but the legislation faces an uncertain future on opposition from lawmakers from energy - rich and agriculture states .

Any analysis of the Q4 GDP report has to start with the change in private inventories .
This change contributed a majority of the increase in GDP , and annualized Q4 GDP growth would have been 2.3 % without the transitory increase from inventory changes .
Unfortunately - although expected - the two leading sectors , residential investment ( RI ) and personal consumption expenditures ( PCE ) , both slowed in Q4 .
PCE slowed from 2.8 % annualized growth in Q3 to 2.0 % in Q4 .

Because the epicentre was under the sea , the sudden jerking of the sea - floor displaced water and triggered a tsumani . "
The American owner of a website that has been targeted by Australia 's Human Rights Commission for racism says he will not remove the offensive content .
In January a Northern Territory man lodged a complaint with the Human Rights Commission about the spoof site Encyclopedia Dramatica .
His complaint about a page featuring racist descriptions of Aboriginals prompted Google to remove the website from Australian search results .
The commission has since tried to prosecute the website 's American owners under Australia 's Racial Discrimination Act .
In a letter to the site 's owners , the commission said it had received 20 complaints from Indigenous Australians .
The site 's owner , Joseph Evers , has blogged that Encyclopedia Dramatica will " never be censored in any way " .
Mr Evers says the site 's owners " laughed " when they discovered they were on the Australian Communications and Media Authority 's list of websites to be banned under the Government 's planned internet filter .
" We will keep publishing this content and our Australian users will be able to view it up until the point that your God - forsaken government blocks it with their soon - to - be- implemented secret list of banned material , " he wrote .
Mr Evers says he has been advised by his lawyer never to visit Australia .
The webpage in question says the article was written by Indigenous Australians .
" This article was written entirely by Australian Aborigines who are satirising racists in Australia in the same way that Sacha Baron Cohen , a Jew , uses the character Borat to satirise anti-Semitism , " it reads .
" So this article is completely 100 per cent not racist at all . "

BALTIMORE — Microbes living under ice sheets in Antarctica and Greenland could be churning out large quantities of the greenhouse gas methane , a new study suggests .
[ partner id =" sciencenews " align = " right " ]
In recent years scientists have learned that liquid water lurks under much of Antarctica ’s massive ice sheet , and so , they say , the potential microbial habitat in this watery world is huge .
If the methane produced by the bacteria gets trapped beneath the ice and builds up over long periods of time — a possibility that is far from certain — it could mean that as ice sheets melt under warmer temperatures , they would release large amounts of heat - trapping methane gas .
Jemma Wadham , a geochemist at the University of Bristol in England , described the little - known role of methane - making microbes , called methanogens , below ice sheets on March 15 at an American Geophysical Union conference on Antarctic lakes .
Her team took samples from one site in Antarctica , the Lower Wright glacier , and one in Greenland , the Russell glacier .
Trapped within the ice were high concentrations of methane , Wadham said , as well as methanogens themselves — up to 10 million cells per gram in the Antarctic sample and 100,000 cells per gram in Greenland .
That ’s comparable to the concentration of methanogens found in deep - ocean sediments , she said .
The species of microbes were also similar to those found in other polar environments , such as Arctic peat or tundra .
The team then put scrapings from both sites into bottles and incubated them with water to see which microbes might grow .
For the Antarctic samples , Wadham said , “ nothing happens for 250 days and then bam !
You get tons of methane . ”
The Greenland samples have n’t been growing for as long and so far do n’t show much signs of giving off methane — but perhaps they just need more time , she reported at the meeting .
Other researchers have also recently found methanogens in icy settings .
Mark Skidmore , a microbiologist at Montana State University in Bozeman , reported at the conference that his team has found methanogens in the Robertson glacier in the Canadian Rockies .
“ It underscores the importance of subglacial methanogenesis , ” Skidmore said .
The studies flesh out a picture of Antarctica as a much more dynamic and watery environment than the frozen , static one once envisaged .
At least 386 lakes have been identified buried beneath the ice sheet , scientists from the University of Edinburgh reported at the meeting .
Plans for major drilling projects are underway for several of them .

Hi-tech GPS enabled phones , more accurate guns and faster cars –
The criminals have taken their favorite cat - and - mouse game with the police on to a whole new level .
Crime - fighting has become tough but law enforcement agencies are not willing to give up , not yet .
From vomit - inducing flashlight to brain fingerprinting , here are the top ten hi-tech ways in which the cops are getting back at the goons .
10 . Automated license plate recognition cameras
All the car thieves out there have to now learn a magic trick as well .
Once they steal the car , they have to make it disappear because taking it out for a run might land them behind bars .
Automated license plate recognition cameras are being used by patrol cars ( even choppers ) to track down auto - related crimes .
These cameras can take pictures of the license plates from a distance .
The pictures are run against a database of stolen vehicles to find possible matches .
9. Brain Fingerprinting
Remember how cops are advised to get into the mind of the criminals to handle them better ?
Well , they are now taking the advice literally .
In brain fingerprinting , the subject is shown pictures on a computer screen .
This person has to wear a headband that will measure cognitive brain responses to the stimuli he watches on the screen .
An EEG ( electroencephalograph ) picks up distinct responses to words , sounds or images that are related to the crime .
The technology has been used to obtain guilty plea from criminals who had refuted allegations of knowledge about their crimes .
Brain fingerprinting revealed that their brains responded to crime - related details shown on the computer .
8. Shoe Printing
Here is another technology that is going to make “ perfect crime ” something that happens only in fiction .
Researchers in UK have made an automated system that compares features on shoe soles of suspects with those of the shoe prints left behind at the crime scene .
Since shoe prints are something that criminals often leave behind , a UK act gives this forensic evidence the same legal validity as DNA and fingerprints .
Shoe prints have been used in the past as evidence but it involved human analysis and interpretation .
The new technology uses image processing to find out about the sole ’s features like logos , circles or ridges .
The results are compared with the prints taken in custody suites for a possible match .
7. Shot Spotting
The time between a gunshot and arrival of police can make a huge difference in nabbing the criminal or providing medical help .
Cops in Washington , D.C. have employed an acoustics - based system called ShotSpotter to drastically minimize this response time .
The gunshot sensor system picks up sound waves of a muzzle blast .
GPS receivers in the system narrow down to the exact coordinates of the spot and forward it to nearest 911 centers .
6. Plant DNA to knock off Counterfeiters
The bad news has arrived for the fakers worldwide .
Scientists have discovered something that is all set to bust the fake brand party .
This little something is no GPS tracking device but a simple code embedded in a plant .
An elite label is now going to use plant DNA in its products to make them distinctly unique .
All that the law enforcement agencies would need are scanners to tell the genuine product from the fake one .
A similar DNA marker was embedded in a bank ’s cash boxes .
When two men tried to tamper with the boxes in bank heist , the DNA strands in the cases helped the police to nab the culprits .
5. 3 - D Technology
Law enforcement agencies have finally found their new crime buster and it comes in the “ avatar ” of three - dimensional technology .
It can pervade all aspects of law , right from nabbing the criminal to bringing him to justice .
It is now possible to create a 3 - D image of a bullet that has been fired and then find a match from previous criminal cases of shoot - outs .
A Forensic Science institute in Connecticut can deftly produce 3D images of crime scene using software called DeltaSphere - 3000 3D Scene Digitizer .
Police in Japan have employed the technology for facial recognition to fight crimes committed by people of foreign origin .
Three - dimensional images of public places and structures are being stored to help the police foil future terrorist attempts .
4. Property Marking System
No , we are not talking about dogs here .
Humans too , can now mark their property and goods to deter trespassing and forceful entries .
Many houses in the UK are using a generic property marker called SmartWater to deter thieves and burglars .
This water - based solution can be sprayed or painted to mark your prized possessions with a unique chemical code .
In cases of thefts , stolen items can be identified by the chemical “ barcode ” and returned to the actual owner .
3. Vehicle Slowdown System
Car chase movie scene just got shorter .
General Motors has equipped its cars with a unique in - vehicle safety system called OnStar .
Besides being GPS - enabled , the system also comes with a helpful vehicle slowdown feature .
Cops can ask an OnStar operator to transmit a signal to the car being pursued .
The signal restricts the vehicle ’s fuel reserves and slows it down to about five miles an hour .
2. Body Odor to sniff out criminals
You read it right .
It is now possible to use body odor as a biometric identifier to nab a culprit .
A police canine research center in China is creating a unique database of people with criminal records .
The center is collecting body odor of criminals so that they can be later used to match the smell in a crime scene with the help of their ace canines .
1. Vomit Inducing Flashlight
The US Department of Homeland Security has developed a flashlight that is guaranteed to bring a fleeing criminal down on his knees .
What else would he do when he is gripped by a sudden bout of horrid puking ?
The hi-tech flashlight , called the Dazzler , emits LEDs that can have psychophysical effects on a person .
It can cause immediate immobility through extreme physical imbalance like disorientation and nausea .
Now we know why the cops crib about how policing has become a really dirty job .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Women hit hard by the effects of climate change -- drought , floods , sea level rise and crop failure -- gathered on Monday to plan a Capitol Hill push for U.S. legislation to curb greenhouse gas emissions .

Climate “ witnesses ” from the United States , Peru , Senegal , Uganda and other countries aim to tell their stories to members of Congress on Tuesday in a lobbying effort timed to follow Monday ’s International Women ’s Day .
Beyond trying to cap climate - warming carbon dioxide emissions , the women said they want to make the strong link between poverty and climate change , and to stress that poor women suffer disproportionately as a result , so adapting to climate change is key .
“ Nature is disrupted , ” Marisa Marcavillaca of Peru said through a translator .
“ It rains when it should n’t rain .
We have freezing temperatures when we should n’t have freezing temperatures .
Because our yields are down , it is difficult to feed our children . ”
Warmer temperatures in her farming area have spurred plant diseases , and the quality of agricultural seeds has degenerated , cutting into local women ’s ability to earn a living , she said .
Because many women in poor countries are farmers , and because their traditional tasks tend to use lots of water , they are often the first to feel the consequences of climate change , said Rebecca Pearl of the Global Gender and Climate Alliance .
“ WE BLAMED GOD ”
When agricultural productivity drops due to changing climate in Peru , Marcavillacca said , young people in the area are leaving for cities , “ which means that our culture is being dismembered . ”
Constance Okollet of Uganda said she first noted a change in her farming village in 2007 , when floods swept away most homes .
Because her home still stood , she took in neighbors until there were 29 people staying in her house .
“ We did n’t know what was happening , ” Okollet said , wiping away tears at the memory .
“ We blamed God . ”
When the floods returned in 2009 , with “ drastic rain , ” hailstorms and wind , destroying schools , contaminating the water supply and disrupting planting seasons , Okollet learned that human activities are one cause of climate change .
The floods were followed by a eight - month drought .
“ We want reduced emissions , ” she said .
“ Let them have some plans for adaptation so that we get our seasons back . ”
Vore Gana Seck of Senegal said she lives in a fishing village where the beach has shrunk from a width of about 50 yards ( meters ) to about one yard , due to sea level rise .
Ground water is becoming salty as the waters rise , making the soil saline and hard to cultivate , Seck said .
Sharon Hanshaw of Biloxi , Mississippi , did n’t think about climate change until after Hurricane Katrina ravaged the U.S. Gulf Coast in 2005 .
“ Everything I knew changed , ” Hanshaw said .
“ When I went back ( home after the storm ) , you do n’t see no replica of life -- and that ’s climate change ...
It does n’t matter if you ’re in a foreign country or in the United States . ”
Hanshaw and others want global action to cut greenhouse gas emissions , looking for progress at an international climate meeting in Cancun , Mexico , in December .
So , Giles Bowkett asked me on facebook “ Why Perl ? ” .
This is the long answer .
I ’m a Perl hacker .
I have been for around 16 years now .
Around 5 years ago , prompted by the Pragmatic Programmer and Adam Turoff , I started looking at Ruby , and Ruby on Rails and sort of fell into maintaining Typo .
Why ?
I was getting hacked off with Perl .
I was coming to the end of my tenure / tether as Perl 6 Summarizer : watching a language that I still want to use before I die taking forever to get done gets wearing after a while , especially when you ’re spending 8 hours a week summarizing the activities of a development community that , in parts , was verging on the toxic ( it ’s way better now ) .
I was also getting annoyed by small niggles in the way Perl 5 works .
This was in the days before Moose .
Stevan Little was just starting work on what became Class :: MOP ( as a prototype of Perl 6 ’s metaobject protocol ) and way before the days of Devel : : Declare .
Ruby seemed to be , as Matz has described it , “ Perl , done right ” .
All the things that were pissing me off about Perl were so much easier in Ruby .
I ’ve joked , in a Ha Ha , only serious kind of way , that I left Perl for Ruby because I got fed up of unrolling @_ , but there ’s more to it than that .
“ Objects everywhere ” fits my head .
The language is dynamic .
Ruby code had less boilerplate in it .
Oh , and Ruby on Rails was looking very cool , even if David Heinemeier Hansson did n’t seem to have a clue about RESTful / Resourceful principles ( he has rather more of a clue now ) .
The community looked vibrant .
What ’s not to like ?
I was a very happy Ruby programmer .
It ’s a great language .
If you have n’t taken it out for a spin round the block , you should give it a try .
A Perl 5 rennaissance
While I was away on my failed attempt to become a maths teacher and then my Ruby sojourn , Perl 5 was waking up .
If Perl 6 were declared a failure tomorrow by the people who are actually working on it ( as opposed to the people who are n’t working on it , but bitch about it anyway - see some of chromatic ’s more intemperate posts about those people ) , then it will still have had value for the way it ’s inspired members of the Perl 5 community to nick the good bits and make them happen in Perl 5 .
Stevan finished Class :: MOP and it got used as the basis for Moose , which is essentially a layer of sensible defaults which sits on top of the insanely configurable and slightly more agnostic Class : : MOP , which in turn sits on Perl ’s weird reduced instruction set object orientation .
Moose even got fast enough that it ’s usable in polite company ( it was always faster than Ruby ) , so people did .
It grew an ecosystem .
Another , more recent development , is Devel : : Declare .
Devel : : Declare is , in accordance with the long history of Perl , completely batshit insane .
What it does is lets you trip the perl parser up and , while it ’s standing there looking at the pretty birds flying around its head , you can run ahead and rewrite the code that it ’s about to parse .
Well , I say run , but what I mean is hobble ahead wearing narrow blinkers and mittens .
You can accomplish amazing things in such circumstances , but it ’s not fun .
Devel : : Declare enabled my current favourite module on CPAN : MooseX :: Declare , which I ’ve talked about here :
An introduction to MooseX : : Declare from Piers Cawley on Vimeo .
MooseX :: Declare lets me kill boilerplate .
Instead of writing :
package Something ; use Moose ; has an_attribute => ( is => ' rw ' ) ; sub a_method { my ( $ self , $ with , $ parameters ) = @_ ; ... }
I can write :
use MooseX : : Declare ; class Something { has an_attribute => ( is => ' rw ' ) ; method a_method ( $ with , $ parameters ) { ... } }
which makes me happy .
This is being done by a module which is written in Perl .
It relies on a couple of modules that are implemented in C , but the bulk of the work is done in Perl itself .
So , that ’s addressed one of the annoyances that led me to Ruby .
What about ‘ objects everwhere ’ .
I got used writing things like :
5 . times { | each | ... }
Surely I ’m not going to able to write :
5 -> times ( sub { ... })
in perl ?
Well …
use Moose : : Autobox ; sub Moose :: Autobox :: SCALAR :: times { my ( $ count , $ block ) = @_ ; 1 -> to ( $ count ) -> each_key ( $ block ) ; } 5 -> times ( sub { $_ -> say} ) ;
Bingo !
I ’d like to be able to write 5 -> times { $ _ -> say } but ca n’t quite manage it .
Give PerlX :: MethodCallWithBlock a little more time though …
So , while I was away , most of the issues I had with Perl , issues that had driven me into the arms of Ruby , had been addressed .
It ’s not about the bike
The new Perl tech is great , but all it does is removes barriers .
I was n’t attached to the Perl language by some huge bungee cord which was crushing me against these barriers while I sojourned in Ruby land , all the while pining for Perl .
I was loving Ruby .
It ’s a great language .
What I am attached to is the group of friends I ’ve made in the Perl community over the years .
Many of whom I ’ve never actually met face to face .
I felt like such a curmudgeonly old fart in the Ruby community ( more specifically , the Rails community ) .
Everything ’s shiny and new and awesome .
And , I suppose when you ’re coming to the language from something like PHP , it is shiny and new and awesome .
But it gets wearing after a while .
And the arrogance ?
My dear !
The arrogance !
Admittedly , some people have a lot to be arrogant about - I still cheer DHH ’s “ Fuck you !
slide , but others … not so much .
The kind of “ Look Ruby is uniquely suited to writing DSLs ! ” bullshit1 that sends chromatic off in fits of apoplexy annoyed me too , especially when I was looking at the kind of examples they were presenting as exemplary and remembering Perl from 5 years before that did the same thing but with cleaner language - like interfaces .
Coming back to Perl may well be a straightforward retreat to competence .
I may be rationalizing like mad .
But right now , it feels like I left Ruby because the ruby community , in the West at least , is n’t a fun place for me to be .
The sexism is just the icing on that particular cake .

SPRINGFIELD – Two Springfield police officers were fired Tuesday following an internal probe into allegations that one beat a man involved in a domestic quarrel with the patrolman 's niece , and the other trumped up a report to hide it .
Patrolmen Danilo Feliciano and Pedro R. Mendez were dismissed by Commissioner William J. Fitchet after an independent hearings officer found they had violated departmental standards .
Feliciano , 39 , was in January charged in Westfield District Court with assault and battery on Rolando E. Rivera , 19 , who had been in a rocky relationship with Feliciano 's niece , according to court records .
She filed a report with police stating Rivera threw a cereal bowl and a cell phone at her during an argument .
Mendez , 40 , authored a report related to the incident , which took place at Rivera 's School Street apartment on Sept. 24 , when police went to investigate the alleged domestic incident .
In court filings , Rivera said Feliciano and other officers " beat me up very bad " and threw bleach in his face after he had an argument with his girlfriend .
As a member of the gang - focused street crimes unit at the time , it is unclear what Feliciano was doing at the scene .
Mendez , a then - member of the special victims unit , drafted a report portraying Rivera as the aggressor .
It states he had to punch Rivera several times to defend himself after Rivera came after him .
Rivera was charged with assault and battery , assault on a police officer and resisting arrest ; he has pleaded innocent and those charges are pending in District Court .
The police report did not identify any of the other officers present , aside from Feliciano and Mendez .
Rivera ’s lawyer , Perman Glenn III , has said five or six other officers were at the scene .
Rivera ’s application for a criminal complaint against Feliciano stated “ Danny Feliciano and other officers ” had gone to his apartment .
Sgt. John M. Delaney , executive aide to Fitchet , said the hearings officer found that Feliciano and Mendez violated the department ’s abuse of force and improper conduct standards .
“ Commissioner Fitchet acknowledges the need for sworn police officers to be accountable for their actions , ” Delaney said .
“ The task of dismissing two police officers was extremely unpleasant but necessary . ”
Kevin B. Coyle , a lawyer for Feliciano and Mendez , said they will appeal the firing .
“ We ’re very disappointed with the commissioner ’s decision , and we do n’t think the evidence supported this result , ” Coyle said .
In his application for a criminal complaint against Feliciano , Rivera said he had a boot print on his back and his head was “ busted open , ” records show .
Feliciano pleaded innocent at his arraignment in Westfield .
His case was continued last week for a pre-trial conference in May .
Glenn , who has been a frequent and vocal critic of the police department , applauded the decision to fire Feliciano and Mendez .
“ I think that they got it right this time , ” Glenn said .
“ However , there is still much more to do in disciplining police officers who inflict serious injuries on Springfield ’s citizens . ”
Police brutality allegations still linger against patrolman Jeffrey M. Asher , who was caught on amateur videotape beating a drug suspect with a flashlight in November .
Police said the suspect , Melvin Jones III , was trying to flee and made a grab for an officer ’s gun .
That incident sparked criminal and internal probes , and talks about reviving a police commission versus a civilian review board to assess brutality claims .
Asher has been out on sick leave since the videotape surfaced in early January , Delaney has said .
Another patrolman , Derek V. Cook has remained on the job for more than two years while assault and battery charges are pending against him in District Court for a 2008 incident in which he was charged with roughing up two of his supervisors on duty .
Cook , 40 , attacked Lt. Robert P. Moynihan after a tense exchange during roll call on Feb. 2 , 2008 at headquarters at 130 Pearl St. , according to police reports .
Cook was charged with assault on Moynihan and with a second count for allegedly throwing recently retired Sgt. Dennis M. O’Connor across the room when O’Connor attempted to intervene .
A month ago , Delaney said the Cook case had n’t been acted on within the department because the charges are pending in the District Court .
“ The case has been laboring in the court system .
We want to make sure the case is disposed of before conducting a ( departmental disciplinary ) hearing , ” Delaney told The Republican .
Mendez became a member of the force in 1996 , and Feliciano in 2001 , records show .
Glenn said he also thinks disciplinary action against the other officers at the scene is warranted .
The dispute was investigated through witness testimony during an all - day hearing on March 15 conducted by Richard C. Morrissey , retired assistant clerk - magistrate of the Springfield District Court .
Glenn also said he will seek dismissal of the charges against his client .
Staff writers Ted Laborde and Peter Goonan contributed to this report .

In spite of increase of state forces harassments the struggle expand .
In addition to the " regular " Bil'in , Nabi Saleh , Ni'ilin , Ma'asara , and Sheikh Jarrah , Beit Omar seems to join the weekly schedule .
Beit Jalla that seems to be less in the focus lately , got a regional convergence this week .
Jafa ( annexed to Tel Aviv ) had this Saturday another joint struggle - this time around escalation in repression of Palestinian citizens by police .
during the week we had prison / court support actions for Israeli activist ( contesting a verdict of one month in jail for bogus assault on gendarmes in a joint action ) and with Bil'iners held in the Ofer concentration camp for bogus claim of incitement and collecting military means ( used grenades thrown at us in demonstrations ) .

BEIT JALLA
The first week of March - weekly demonstrations and more
05/03/2010
In the early morning on March 2 , 2010 , Israeli bulldozers started uprooting ancient olive trees in the garden of a Palestinian family in the town of Beit Jala , North - West of Bethlehem , in order to make room for the construction of yet another section of the Apartheid Wall .
Wednesday morning , the family , which had already lost a significant portion of its lands when Israel seized them to build the by - pass road  60 that connects the equally illegal settlements , found the little playground for the children in the garden destroyed and three olive trees directly in front of the house chopped off .
A red cross was painted two meters away from the front door to signal where the Wall is designed to pass .
The remaining olive trees had been marked with yellow - tags , to be uprooted another day .
More markings on remaining trees and on the ground announce that soon , the family might lose the rest of its remaining land including the sight of its destroyed playground , and live immediately facing the massive gray concrete Wall .
Between March 2 and March 3 , the bulldozers uprooted an overall of 70 olive trees on the lands of the family and their neighbors , rapidly creating facts on the ground before lawyers could challenge the most recent of a series of confusing orders designed to legalize the ongoing land theft under Israeli law .
According to Israels most recent plan , this section of the Wall would seize another 280,9 dunams of Palestinian land on the property of 35 families .
On March 3 , the al - Maasara Popular Committee and the Holy Land Trust in Bethlehem mobilized a group of Palestinian , international and Israeli activists to attempt to physically stop the bulldozers from continuing their work .
" Today , the Israeli authorities have uprooted more trees to build yet more of the Apartheid Wall .
Tomorrow morning , we would like to meet early and stop the bulldozers .
Please , be on time at the Orthodox Club ( up in Beit Jalla ) .
For more information or directions , call M "
" Dozens of soldiers , security personal and border police officers spent two hours pushing and dragging the activists up the hill and away from the operating bulldozers , and finally produced an order to arrest anyone remaining on the familys land after 9a.m .
On March 4 , a group of activists was again mobilized to arrive in the early morning hours to protect the remaining olive trees .
One activist chained himself to an ancient tree marked for removal , while others formed clusters around this and other trees .
As soldiers and police officers gathered on the scene , activists chanted slogans against the Wall and the occupation and replanted two uprooted trees .
After a few hours , the activists learned that a legal decision had been reached that effectively prohibits any further uprooting until the next court order is ruled .
Expecting this impending order , activists continue to prepare for further intervention in case that the bulldozers resume their work .
Beit Jala , March 4 2010 Beit Jala , March 4 2010
Already when driving on route 60 , we saw the intimidating bulldozers riding on the side of the road on their way to another day of " putting facts on the ground " as chiefs of the Israeli government call it .
As we arrived in Beit Jalla , a heart - breaking scene came into view - a huge pile of sawed trees and olive and lemon branches spread all across the yard of the house next to the wall 's path .
A yard it cannot really be called anymore - the grass is turned over , two children 's swings were uprooted and put aside , and the only thing left standing is a brick oven , with mounds of dirt and mud all around it .
10 olive trees were cut down here already yesterday .
A red X on the front floor of the house marks the path of the wall to pass here , which will seize the whole yard area and cut the only access driveway to it .
It 's hard to imagine how life would look like in this place in a week or two .
We were 45 protesters - 25 Palestinians , 15 international activists and 4 Israelis .
We descended to the works path trying to stop the bulldozers .
A group of twenty soldiers prevented us from doing so , and began pushing us up the hill without showing a closed military area order as they are required .
While the bulldozer 's claws were uprooting trees one after the other , we explained to the officers that their actions violate numerous international laws , as well as the fact that they may not tell us to move without the order .
We were pushed up the hill a few more meters to where we sat on the ground demanding to see a printed order before we move any further .
At 08:53 they brought the papers and the officers declared the area will become a " closed military zone " within 7 minutes .
One of them held two stun grenades with a nasty grin on his face .
We reminded them again that constructing the wall on West Bank lands is a crime according to international law , as well as the settlers - only road which it " protects " and that they still may put down their guns and join us .
A bearded IDF captain told us that the only law he follows is the biblical law .
Rabbai Arik Ascherman referred him to to read the chapter in the book of Deuteronomy which refers to uprooting of fruit trees .
At 09:00 precisely they started pushing and dragging us up the hill again .
2 Israelis and one international activist were detained for a few minutes and were released shortly thereafter .
Two Arab TV network reporters stationed on the upper road to report the events .
Two young women from Beit Jalla were prominent among the protesters .
As one of the officers told on of them them " Min fadlak , ruch min hon " ( Please go away from here ) , she replied wisely " Min fadlak , ruch le- Israil " ( Please , go back to Israel ) , with her finger pointing north - west .
When we left , the bulldozers were still working with all their might .
Tomorrow another group will go there .
For details call Y . "
REPORT :
Below , please see Shai 's report about today 's action against the resumed construction of the Apartheid Wall on the lands of 35 families in the Palestinian town of Beit Jala .
When constructed , the Wall will seize 280,9 dunums of land owned by families of the Beit Jala municipality .
Today is the second day that Israeli bulldozers uprooted olive trees to make way for the Wall .
The bulldozers started their work only a day after a list with the names of the affected families was released , not respecting the 40 period that is due , according to the municipality 's lawyer , to appeal the order .
For more information , including on tomorrow 's action ( 3/4/10 ) , call Mahmoud or Mar .

BEIT OMAR
Bait Omar Weekly Demo Against the Occupation and The Apartheid Wall
On Saturday , March 6th , about 40 Palestinians , Israelis , and Internationals protested in Bait Omar ( West Bank ) against the Israeli occupation and Apartheid Wall .
This weekly demonstration was held in opposition to the decision of the Israeli government to declare the Ibrahimi mosque in Hebron and Belal mosque in Bethlehem Jewish National Sites .
The demonstration , organized by the Bait Omar National Committee , started at Bait Omar and proceeded to block road 60 , the main route that connects Bethlehem , Jerusalem , and Hebron .
Participants also removed parts of a wire fence , that allows the IOF to impose curfews , and limit the movement of Palestinians in and out of Bait Omar .

IDF keeping tabs on Israelis protesting separation fence
By Amira Hass
The Israel Defense Forces says it is using information on Israelis who
demonstrate against the separation fence in a bid to deny them entry at
nearby checkpoints .
Israelis and others demonstrate every Friday at the
villages of Bil'in and Na'alin .
Friday
We were about 20 Israelis by the Anarchists Against the WAll initiative , a dozen or so internationals , a contingent from West bank Jinin city , dozens of Bil'iners , and few of the neighborhood .
We marched at noon as usual from the center of the village towards the gate in the separation fence .
Three protestors appropriately dressed up and with makeup represented Mahatma Gandhi , Martin Luther King , Jr. and Nelson Mandela to commemorate their nonviolent creativity against occupation , oppression and colonialism .
The struggles of Gandhi against oppression and occupation in India , Martin Luther King , Jr. against racism in the USA and Mandela against the apartheid in South Africa are all similar to Bilins ongoing struggle against occupation here .
At the gate , as usual , the tear gas grenades were thrown on us immediately when people started to shake the gate .
Due to unfriendly wind direction we had to withdraw fast to a distant point near the road .
About 20 of us - Israelis and internationals , continued to the Demonstration in Sheikh Jarrah .

" This week 's demonstration in Bil 'in marked the Global Week against racism in the world and coincided with many popular events against racism and oppression against the peoples and territories - in particular the Palestinian people .
The demonstration begun after Friday prayers and marched from the center of the village , then continued to the western gate of the wall .
Over one hundred people participated in the march , including a group from the PFLP ( The Popular front for the Liberation of Palestine ) and a delegation from the Freedom Theater in Jenin .
The demonstration was headed by people dressed up as three prominent figures in the global struggle against racism and occupation : Mahatma Gandhi , Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther King .
Palestinian flags were raised as the participants chanted slogans condemning the wall and the occupation .
As the march reached the wall it was met with a shower of tear gas , rubber bullets and sound bombs , then clashes broke out between demonstrators and occupation soldiers .
The demonstration lasted for hours as troops deliberately fired tear gas towards crews of journalists from Palestine TV and other stations to discourage the footage from the International Week Against Racism - and the Popular Committee 's condemnation of Israel 's racist and immoral practices - from being broadcast .
In response , the Popular Committee stressed the need for cohesion , national unity and solidarity and highlighted that it was in the public interest for everyone involved in anti-racist struggles to stand shoulder to shoulder with each other . "

MAASARA
" The Popular Committee ( al - Ma'sara ) and others call on all internationals to meet us tomorrow morning at 7a .m. for a protest action in Beit Jalla "
Friday demonstration in Ma'asara
Some twenty Israeli and international activists joined fifty Palestinians in this week 's Friday demonstration against the Wall in Ma'asara .
Demonstrators marched through the village towards the route of the wall , and were stopped by an army reserves unit which blocked the road with barbed wire several hundred meters deeper into the village than usual .
The group composed mostly out of officers presented a closed military zone order , barring the march to pass the wire .
Several demonstrators crossed the line anyway , but decided not to try and push further in an attempt to avoid the violent army attacks which have become common in these non-violent demonstrations lately .
And so , standing by the barbed wire , demonstrators carried speeches in Arabic , Hebrew and English .
Amongst the speakers was Fatah Central Committee member Abu - Zaki .
The Samba band played its new drums , sent in solidarity from their Turkish counterparts , and slogans were chanted in defiance of the occupation and in favor of the un-armed and united Palestinian struggle .
The demonstration ended after about an hour , with no unusual events .
Earlier in the week , however , a prominent member of the popular committee of the village was attacked upon reaching a military checkpoint .
Mahmud Zwahre was beaten by soldiers , and told that demonstrations must cease .
NABI SALEH
This week , another 150 people strong demonstration marking international Women 's Day and protesting ongoing land grab was held in Nabi -Saleh .
The demonstration was attacked by the Army with tear - gas and rubber - coated bullets while still inside the village and from great distance for no apparent reason .
Nine other people were injured , including two journalists and an eighteen year old woman who was hit in the neck with an aluminum - made tear - gas projectile .
Nabi-Saleh , March 5 2010 Nabi-Saleh , March 5 2010
Ehab Fadel Barghouthi ( 14 ) was shot with a rubber - coated bullet that struck him in the forehead above his right eye and entered his skull .
He was shot by Border Police officers who took over the rooftop of a house in the outskirts of the village and were in no immediate danger .
According to eye witnesses , the boy was standing twenty meters away from the house when he was shot , after which he immediately collapsed .
He was evacuated to the Salfeet hospital unconscious , and from there transferred to the Ramallah hospital .
Numerous eyewitnesses confirm stone - throwing did take place at the time of the shooting , but all affirm Barghouthi did not partake in it .
Nabi-Saleh , March 5 2010 Nabi-Saleh , March 5 2010
The village is home to some 500 people .
Since demonstrations in the village began , nine of its residents , roughly two percent of the Nabi Saleh 's population , have been arrested on protest - related suspicions and dozens were injured .
NI 'ILIN
In Ni'ilin , some 100 demonstrators marched from the village to the wall .
The march was led by demonstrators holding signs condemning the Israeli government 's decision to declare the Ibrahimi mosque in Hebron and Belal mosque in Bethlehem Jewish National Sites .
After failing to convince the soldiers at the gate to allow the village farmers to reach their lands , confrontations between some of the village youth and the soldiers erupted .
The soldiers kept firing tear gas projectiles but did not manage to suppress the demonstration .
After less than an hour of such confrontations , more than 20 soldiers invaded the village fields chasing the demonstrators closer to the village .
The soldiers stormed the fields shooting tear gas projectiles , and occasionally 0.22 live rounds .
After confrontations continued at the village border for several hours , the demonstration was declared over .

Sheikh Jarrah is a unique community in East Jerusalem .
The plight of this community is emblematic of the larger Palestinian struggle for Justice .
The Palestinians of Sheikh Jarrah enjoy no respite from settler harassment .
There is no settlement in the distance creeping towards a Palestinian village .
The settlers have evicted the Palestinians and now occupy their homes .
This is a call for global direct actions .
The organizers of the weekly demonstrations in Sheikh Jarrah are asking for global solidarity as they plan for massive demonstrations in Jerusalem and wider Israel .
They are calling for demonstrations and vigils at Israeli consulates and embassies abroad .
The Global Intifada has put out a modified call .
As many of you may not have access to Israeli consulates and embassies , we ask you to occupy everything .
If you 're a student , occupy your administrative offices and demand divestment from any company who profits from the occupation in conjunction with demanding justice for Sheikh Jarrah .
If you 're not a student , occupy any and all halls of governance .
Demand that they pass resolutions of condemnation of the occupation of Palestine and promise to withdraw support for it , in conjunction with demanding justice for Sheikh Jarrah .
If you are unable to occupy anything , get out of the sidewalks and into the streets .
Demand Justice for Palestine and Justice for Sheikh Jarrah .
If you are afraid of the streets , let loose your barbaric yawp from the corner and tell people of the injustice that pervades the lives of Palestinians and those living in Sheikh Jarrah
In August 2009 , the Al - Ghawis were evicted from their home after the Israeli court accepted forged Ottoman - era land claims from a right - wing Zionist settler organization .
The land claims cited that Jewish people owned the land in the late 19th century and therefore should legally be in possession of people with a Jewish heritage .
The Al - Ghawis have lived on the street opposite their home .
The family lives on a tent on the sidewalk , watching settlers enter and exit the house they called their home for nearly fifty years .
The live in their tent in act of protest and are determined to stay there until they are allowed to return to their home .
The Al - Kurds have had the front partition of their home annexed on the First of December 2009 .
The back partition of their home is set to be usurped in the following weeks .
22 other families are facing illegal eviction the coming months .
Despite this horrendous attempt to ethnically cleanse Sheikh Jarrah , there is resistance .
Israeli activists commenced weekly demonstrations in the community .
In the beginning they mood was jubilant ; drums and chanting which called out the racism and injustice of the settlers actions .
But these demonstrations were escalated by police violence .
Over 100 people have been arrested demonstrating or participating in acts of nonviolent direct action and civil disobedience .
The state forces who tried to force the called demonstration further from the usual place near the street entrance the occupied houses are on ( not allowed to get nearer ) got a back fire from the highest court of justice .
The court ordered the police to allow the demonstration in the usual place and in addition 300 demonstrators were to be allowed a short visit into the street itself .

The district , known as “ Nine - Five , ” is poor and tough , a place where young , unemployed Africans and Arabs often stand around “ holding up the walls , ” to use the Algerian expression .
In these neighborhoods , Mr. Soumaré has become a symbol of progress .
Even Le Monde newspaper called Soumaré a “ rising star ” following his calm mediation between police and locals during a major riot in 2007 after a police car killed two French Arab and African children and protesters shot and injured four police .
But now the unusual candidate finds himself in the midst of a fiery controversy .
Ruling party figures have alleged that he has a repeat offender arrest record and requested that he withdraw from the race .
Minority groups mainly see this as a craven attempt by the old guard to defame and topple their young star .
Meanwhile , Soumaré and the Socialists plan charge ruling party figures with slander .
The allegations aired by Francis Delattre , a member of the ruling party and a small town mayor who is not running against Soumaré , contain one clear conviction for theft and minor assault when Soumaré was 19 , which he previously acknowledged .
Several other alleged arrests are inconclusive .
Moreover , the information about the cases was likely obtained illegally and one charge is a mistake – which Delattre apologized for on Wednesday .
Rarely , if ever , has a top candidate in France been accused of repeat offenses or for street crimes .
Unsurprisingly the allegations have opened a debate over Soumaré ’s merits and raised questions about race in a system that has previously avoided it , except on the far right .
Charges usually involve favoritism and corruption .
Prior to the arrest allegations , Delattre had gone after Soumaré , saying he looked “ like a soccer player ” not a politician , angering minorities .
' Delinquent or slander victim '
Commentators in the media and on the Internet lit up on the left and right in turgid discourse over crime , reform , and legitimacy – but increasingly over defamatory politics not seen in quite this way before in secular France .
“ Delinquent – or slander victim ? ” is the question for Rue89 , a French web news site .
“ Everybody knows Soumaré is a new kind of candidate that French people are n’t used to , a young black guy from the suburbs , ” says Christelle Edey , a Socialist candidate in the neighboring 93 banlieue .
“ He ’s attacked because he is black .
After everything is said , we have one of five charges confirmed , from 1999 , when Soumaré was young , and he has said he made a mistake . ”
Axel Poniatowski , a UMP candidate , countered on French radio that , “ voters and citizens should know this candidate has committed theft and assault . ”
The Socialist Party , after two days of silence to review the case , has come out strongly behind Soumaré -- who went on French radio Tuesday saying that “ when I was young I made mistakes … I committed a crime … I ’ve changed since then , and that should be an example .
I ’ve moved from a petty criminal to an active citizen . ”
As of mid-week the Delattre revelations appeared to be backfiring somewhat – as ruling party UMP leaders distanced themselves from what increasingly appeared a racially motivated mud fight .
Man of the people
Soumaré got into politics after the sudden spurt of support for right - wing nationalist Jean - Marie Le Pen in the 2002 national elections , and he rose swiftly in Socialist ranks after mediating the 2007 riots .
Since then , however , he has allegedly provoked the police by backing the families of the two boys killed when a police car ran into their bike .
The officers have been acquitted but the families have appealed the decision , which Soumaré has supported .
Police have said that he has taken on a role almost like the families ' spokesman , which has not pleased the police .
Frederic Lefebvre , the UMP ruling party spokesman , on Thurday said that " When the French people go to the polls , they must remember that there are two conceptions of security in our country . "
He said the UMP chose as its candidate for Val d’Oise a former police captain , “ and " the Socialist Party , chose someone who has been sentenced . ”
Views from the Soumaré 's district might be summed up by a 31 - year - old Algerian man , Tafiq , who grew up in the area .
He says that he is “ completely sympathetic ” with someone who escaped the downward spiral of a neighborhood , “ where if you put your head up even slightly the police will cut you off at the legs . ”
Pointing to the current cover of the magazine Marianne , containing a photo of Georges Freche , a former Socialist party boss from the south who is defending a host of racial and ethnic slurs he made , Tariq said , “ That man gets on the cover of Marianne to explain himself , but Soumaré will be attacked and never given a voice . ”
The French media , at least on the center and the left , picked up the Soumaré case after blogs and Facebook pages lit up with chatter about the case this week .
Speaking of the UMP , the left daily Liberation editorialized that , “ They aimed low and missed … it was already sleazy to rummage into Ali Soumaré ’s past and dig up convictions and try and discredit him , thanks to a civil servant ’s probably illegal indiscretion . ”
Le Figaro , on the right , ran a poll asking if Soumaré was “ a good candidate , ” with two thirds answering in the negative .
Despite a secular and egalitarian tradition in France , only seven of some 860 members of the French and Assembly come from non-white backgrounds .

This morning 's roundup of the latest venture capital news and analysis across the Web :
Google appears ready to throw in the towel in China , the Wall Street Journal reports , a decision that has broad implications for all technology companies doing business there .
The search company is likely to make a decision to close its Chinese - language search site within weeks , according to a person familiar with the situation .
Comments on Fridayby Chinese Minister of Industry and Information Technology Li Yizhong reinforced expectations ...
I ’d like to begin by showing you a picture and asking you what you see .
Good .
With that in mind , have a look at this one and tell me what you see .
Here ’s another , and this one , you ’ll note , has a similar shape to it .
Now let ’s shift gears a tad .
What do you see here ?
And here ?
And finally here ?
Okay , on the assumption that I ’m working toward a point , what do you imagine that point might be ?
If you guessed that it has something to do with how maps change over time , good job .
Specifically , I ’ve been thinking about how borders are temporary , malleable things , and that even the best maps , even the most productive and stable arrangements in history have changed as a result of incremental economic expansion or violent overthrow or amicable separation or brute intimidation .
For our present purposes , we Americans need to understand that nothing about the current configuration of the United States was ordained at the dawn of time .
Our borders have changed multiple times just in the last century , and while those changes have always involved growth , history teaches us one lesson we ’d do well not to forget : empires come and empires go .
It ’s only logical , then , to consider the possibility – indeed , the probability – that at some point in the future the US might well contract .
Or break up .
Or something .
The question is n’t if , but when .
And how .
And in response to what forces .
And finally , what does the political map overlaying the North American land mass look like at that point ?
There are any number of theories out there .
For instance , a Russian economist predicts that our current economic mess will fracture us thusly :
The science fiction game Shadowrun has all kinds of fun carving up the former US , merging parts of the Northeast and Upper Midwest with Canada and , of course , reviving Dixie as a nation state .
David Eriqat ’s Eight Countries of the Former United States argues that what we have now is no longer tenable given cultural and economic realities , and he suggests that what comes next might look roughly like this :
I ’m not 100 % sure of the rationale behind this version of the future , but the author is apparently a retired US military and intelligence guy .
Then there ’s Joel Garreau ’s Nine Nations of North America , which does n’t predict the future so much as it sets out to describe the present .
Still , if you ’re the sort who thinks that coming shifts will be dictated by shared cultural and economic interests , this map provides plenty of food for thought .
And so on and so on .
A lot of people have contemplated the breakup of the Union and there are any number of ideas as to how it might all play out .
So with that in mind , let me ask you to consider one more map , one that reflects a particular contemporary reality .
Any idea what you ’re looking at ?
In recent months my colleague Wufnik has done a couple of outstanding analyses on the secessionist chirping we keep hearing from the nutbag wing of the American political landscape .
In a post last August he explained the problem of “ giver states ” vs. “ taker states ” – that is , those who contribute more in federal taxes than they receive back in services vs. those who contribute less than they receive .
As it turns out , most of the worst anti-gummit , anti-tax , pro-teabag secessionist bitching comes from people in taker states .
Put less charitably , they hail from places that are n’t pulling their weight , an inconvenient fact that certainly runs counter to the uncritical ideologies of self - reliance and the incessant bootstrap rhetoric that characterizes so much of what these folks have to say for themselves .
So , about that map above : the red states are the takers and the blue states are the givers .
Rhode Island , in purple , gets exactly much back it receives .
Interesting picture , huh ?
Wuf ’s follow - up post looked at how various state governments are acting out a little bit , asserting their state ’s rights and all .
And again , those acting up tend to be takers .
Now we have another round of state government uprising , as 14 states are suing the federal government over the health care bill .
There are n’t many surprises to be had here , either .
13 of the attorneys general filing suit are Republicans ( the lone exception being the gentleman from Louisiana , a state whose leaders tend to be so dumb and corrupt as to make partisan affiliations more or less meaningless ) .
Also , a majority of the states are takers : Virginia , Alabama , Idaho , Louisiana , Nebraska , Pennsylvania , South Carolina , South Dakota and Utah .
The remaining litigants hail from giver states , but even here we see some unusual circumstances .
Florida and Texas are the two “ least giver ” states – that is , they ’re the two donor states that lie closest to the break - even mark .
Washington ’s AG is regarded as something of a loose cannon , it seems , and his participation in this action has outraged the state ’s governor ( and , one suspects , much of its generally progressive citizenry ) .
Colorado is an odd case under any circumstances – take away Denver , Boulder and perhaps some of the ski country and what you have left is dangerously close to a teabagger paradise .
Futurism is an iffy business under the best of circumstances , but I feel safe offering the following conjectures :
It ’s almost certain that we have n’t heard the last from our anti-taxes - by - god countrymen .
It seems entirely likely that we ’ll continue hearing yarping about secession , and
given the effectiveness of the right wing ’s finely - tuned noise machine , it ’s possible that this meme will gain in strength and credibility .
Our economic woes are far from over , regardless of what a variety of econopundits might be saying , and
hard financial times are likely to fuel anti-government and anti-tax sentiment .
The rabble - rousing is likely to continue emanating from Taker Nation .
At some point , it ’s safe to say that the American empire will contract in some fashion .
If these predictions hold true , and if some form of political realignment happens while I ’m still alive , I have to admit that a break along something like giver / taker lines would n’t trouble me terribly .
I would n’t expect such a divorce to be without its painful moments , to be sure , especially since my home state and some people I care a lot about w0uld likely wind up on the other side of that line .
But if the result found me living out my days in a nation that placed a greater collective value on education ; that was socially more progressive than punitive ; that operated according to a sense of equity favoring justice and opportunity over raw Darwinism ; that asserted an economic logic where the public interest was deemed more important than base profit ; and that functioned according an ethical code that drew its inspiration from something more enlightened than the rankest , most reactionary readings of the Old Testament , well , I have to be honest : that would n’t be the worst thing that ’s ever happened to me .
The Chinese government has attempted to restrict access to the Hong Kong–based servers where Google is offering uncensored search results to mainland China users .
On Tuesday , according to The New York Times , mainland China users could not see uncensored Hong Kong–based content after the government either disabled certain searches or blocked links to results .
Citing business executives " close to industry officials , " The Times also reports that China Mobile - the country 's largest wireless carrier - is under pressure from the government to cancel a pact with Google that puts the web giant 's search engine on the carrier 's mobile home page .
The carrier is expected to end the pact - though it does n't have an agreement in place with a new search provider .
The paper goes on to say that China Unicom - the country 's second largest carrier - has postponed or even killed the launch of phones based on Google 's Android mobile operating system .
But this launch was delayed by Google itself in late January , after the company first announced its intention to stop censoring search results in China .
" We are postponing the availability of Google mobile applications on Android devices from operators in China , " a company spokeswoman told The Reg earlier this month .
The company did not immediately respond to questions about whether this policy has changed or will change in the future .
In mid-January , after alleged Chinese hackers pilfered unspecified intellectual property from the company , Google said that it had decided to stop censoring search results and that it would enter into discussions with the government to determine a means of doing so .
Google did not discuss the specifics of the talks , but according to Xinhua , China 's state news agency , a Chinese official now says that the government spoke with Google on two occasions : January 29 and February 25 .
But it was n't until yesterday , March 22 , that Google announced that it would redirect Google .cn visitors to its its Hong Kong - based engine , Google.com.hk , where it would provide uncensored search results in simplified Chinese .
A government official overseeing the internet bureau of the State Council Information Office responded by calling the move " totally wrong . "
" Google has violated its written promise it made when entering the Chinese market by stopping filtering its searching service and blaming China in insinuation for alleged hacker attacks , " he said .
" This is totally wrong .
We 're uncompromisingly opposed to the politicization of commercial issues , and express our discontent and indignation to Google for its unreasonable accusations and conducts . " ®
Update
Google has responded to say that its stance on Google - branded Android phones in China has not changed .
" Android is an open source mobile platform , so anyone - including operators in China - can bring Android - powered devices to market , " the company says .
" Given all our issues in China , we have postponed the availability of Google mobile applications on Android devices from operators in China until further notice . "
Full - circle ringing is when the bell rotates through 360 degrees at a time .
One churchgoer , who asked to remain anonymous , said : " I think the people who complained are being miserable .
It 's not an unpleasant sound .
When the people moved in next to a church what did they expect to hear ? "

Magneto was messing with my Mom 's car keys
As the new year every - CG - artist - nightmare began , here is simple holiday hint .
Let ’s steel some bokeh pictures from internet , or take a photo of some bright defocused lights .
Cut them with a circle masks in AE or PS and make an equal images sequence ( i did 10 pictures ) .
Setup the multi / sub object material in 3ds max for 10 ID ’s , with additive transparency .
Put the white - to - black gradient ramp texture to the opacity slot using the second UV channel .
Put the bokeh images sequence into the diffuse slots using the first UV channel .
Let ’s make the particle flow system based on some interesting complex geometry , e.g. some twisted helix splines .
Set proper number of the vertices in the Birth operator , and also set location : selected in the Position Object operator .
Use Mesh select over all splines to convert splines to mesh vertices .
Add Material Dynamic operator with prepared multi/ sub object material to the PFlow event .
Let the Shape Facing operator , oriented to the Target Camera define particles shape .
And now the main part of the tutorial – add the Script operator with the following script :
on ChannelsUsed pCont do
(
pCont.useTime = true
pCont.useScale = true
pCont.usePosition = true
pCont.useMapping = true
)
on Init pCont do
(
)
on Proceed pCont do
(
count = pCont.NumParticles ( )
tarpos = $ Camera01.Target.position
campos = $ Camera01.position
for i in 1 to count do
(
pCont.particleIndex = i
pCont.setParticleMapping i 2 [ abs ( ( distance campos tarpos ) -( distance campos pCont.particlePosition ) ) /500,0,0 ]
— all the particles get the UV coordinates at 2 - nd UV channel here .
— UV coords depends on the distance to camera ’s focus “ sphere ” .
pCont.particleScale = abs ( ( distance campos tarpos ) -( distance pCont.particlePosition campos ) ) /
5
— here is the dependence of the particle ’s scale defined
— “ focused ” particles are small , as they moving away from the focus – they are becoming bigger .
)
)
on Release pCont do
(
)
This script will define particle ’s scale and transparency depends on camera ’s focus .
Now you can animate the geometry or the camera and render the particles with scanline .
Do n’t forget to cache all the particles for viewport / render using the Cache operator .
This setup renders pretty fast as opposed to mental ray ’s or vray ’s honest dof .
And we have fast bokeh effect with the ability to inceract with scene geometry .
Here is the scene
P.S. While i worked with the script there were a couple of obstructions , which took several hours to break .
And after finding the proper solution , i found that exactly same solutions were already described at the second disc of CG Academy Particle Flow Scripting .
So if this theme is interesting for someone – i advice to look through .
My respect to Bobo !
That is all .

Can you clarify more , what exactly does it say ?
Does it have an actual key ?

There is no real way to proove that im right , except that i have a happy friend .
I would never troll people about this , as i had to wait 2 weeks for 2nd wave to hit before getting in myself , i just thought it would be nice to let people know that they should tell their friends etc. to check their beta mails IF they already have beta access .

MillerCoors is yanking the caffeine kick from its popular Sparks alcoholic drinks .
The beer giant is backing away from combos of alcohol and stimulants in the face of allegations by a number of state attorneys general and consumer groups that it was targeting underage drinkers , the WSJ reports .
The joint venture of SABMiller and Molson Coors Brewing will voluntarily tone down the formula of Sparks to remove caffeine , taurine , guarana and ginseng , and it has agreed not to produce alcohol - caffeine combos in the future , MillerCoors said in a press release .
The company highlighted its willingness to " listen to societal partners and consider changes to our business to reinforce our commitment to alcohol responsibility , " and noted the agreement with the AGs contained no finding that MillerCoors acted unlawfully or marketed Sparks to youngsters .
Here 's something I bet you thought you 'd never see !
According to GOP aides , the resolution would require the House to hold an up - or - down vote on the Senate healthcare bill .
What ?
Republicans demanding an up - or - down vote on healthcare ?
Huzzah !
But what could possibly be going on here ?
We need more context .
House GOP leaders will try to force the House to vote on the Senate ’s healthcare bill .
Rep. Parker Griffith ( R - Ala . ) , who defected from the Democratic Party last December out of frustration on healthcare , will offer a resolution barring Democratic leaders from using the so - called “ Slaughter solution . ”
Ah , I get it now !
Republicans think they deserve to have an up - or - down vote on the Senate bill , but the Senate does n't !
Why are we going through this self - executing rule exercise in the first place ?
Because Senate Republicans wo n't allow an up - or - down vote on making the changes contained in the fix bill .
If they 'd agree to an up - or - down vote on that , then the House could drop the self - executing rule ( scary ! ) plan and the use of reconciliation ( nuclear ! ) completely , and we could just have a good ol ' fashioned who 's - got - the - most kind of vote .
Which Republicans would then lose .
Which is why they instead find themselves shamelessly screaming for up - or - down votes on healthcare , after all this time dedicating themselves to preventing exactly that .
You really can't make this stuff up .
Hello all !
Hope you are well , and want you to know I miss you guys a lot .
On my side , I have been looking for a job since I am back .
It is good to be back home , but I still do n’t have an apartment , and I am usually very busy .
Recently , I scanned my passport to keep a record of it before I request a new one from the French consulate in NY .
If you like colorful stamps , you may enjoy it .
Posted on February 26th , 2011 Nicolas
On Saturday , February 12 , I reentered the Manhattan Island after 456 days on the road .
My trip took me through 37,000 miles of adventures I would never forget .
But in the immediate , as I was driving through the Georges Washington Bridge , I could not completely unwind , since there was pressing matters to take care of .
As I entered New York State , I could not really just drive around .
In fact , I had to be very discreet , as my registration and inspection had expired months ago .
So it is with very little fuss that I crossed the city , dropped my dad in a hotel and continued toward Brooklyn after stopping twice on the way to see some friends .
When I got to my old neighborhood , I stopped to the auto shop I used to spend time at , and also the place where I got my vehicle ready for this extraordinary trip .
Everybody was doing well , and it was great to see a lot of old friends .
Next , I went back to my old house , and met with my landlord , Jay .
He was aware I was coming back , and had space in the driveway for my truck .
It is where it is going to stay for few weeks , the time for me to settle down and get the paperwork sorted out .
All my belongings are there as well , in the basement since 2009 .
I do n’t really want to open boxes as long as I do n’t have an apartment , so even now , two weeks after coming back , I am still wearing my expedition - style clothes as I roam the streets of Manhattan .
I did shave my beard as people were looking at me a strange way , I thought .
Jay gave me some mail which arrived a while back , and it turned out that I was in a more complicated position that I thought .
Apparently , I broke a new record without even knowing it .
It seems that some papers did n’t go through after I left , resulting in some problems with the Department of Motor Vehicle .
Consequently , as I was driving happily in exotic regions , my driving license was suspended .
Which probably makes me the only man in history who drove around the world with a suspended driving license …
As night was falling , I took the subway back to Manhattan where I met a small group of people to have drinks in the Lower East Side and celebrate the successful expedition .
In the few weeks following these events , I have been of course readapting to the life in the city , but also working hard to prepare my future .
I am staying at Sergio ’s apartment for few weeks , and from there I am straightening my administrative status , and trying to find a job .
I think I may be too exigent in my job search as of now .
After everything I saw in the last months , I need something that will be very challenging and exciting .
I ca n’t work just for the money , I need more .
As promised , I will let you know when something comes up .
I sent my Carnet de Passage back to AAA , which will allow me to get back the huge guaranty I had to leave in order to be able to cross borders .
I have been reconnecting with my past in the last two weeks , spending time with people who matter to me .
Of course it is strange to be back here , but I can already tell that I am still in love with New York , which is a relief .
After all , I need a place I can call home .
I will be busy in the next few weeks , and months .
First of all , I have to find this miracle job .
Then , I will update this website so it is easier to navigate through the different places I have been to , now that the chronological order matters less .
Dan – the friend who spent some time with me in Peru – gave me a hard drive with the video he shot while we were traveling , and I would love to make it available on this website as well .
In the upcoming time , there will be more maps and details on such expedition preparation , so it will be helpful for travelers .
Also , I would love to work on a book .
But it is going to be a side project , something I can work on once I have a job .
So please keep checking here for new content .
There will be other updates , and I would love if you guys could stick around .
My apologies for not updating the website earlier .
Apologies also to the hundreds of people who emailed me but still did n’t receive a reply .
I will be working on it soon !

Wrestling with a multibillion - dollar budget deficit , Arizona decided Friday to close nearly all of its state parks , including the famed Tombstone Courthouse and Yuma Territorial Prison .
The State Parks Board unanimously voted to close 13 parks by June 3 .
Eight others had already been closed , and the decision would leave nine open -- but only if the board can raise $ 3 million this year .
The action represents the largest closure of state parks in the nation , although several other states are considering similar moves .
“ It ’s a dark day for the Arizona state parks system , ” said Renee Bahl , the system ’s executive director .

“ We have 65,000 acres around the state and the majority of them are closing . ”
The Arizona parks receive about 2.3 million visitors per year who bring about $ 266 million into the state , Bahl said .
“ It ’s unfortunate that a short - term recession is having an impact on our future , ” Bahl said .
Arizona is n’t the only state struggling to support its parks .

In May , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger proposed closing 220 of California ’s 278 state parks to help close a multibillion - dollar deficit but backed off after protests .
This month , Schwarzenegger proposed to expand oil drilling off the Santa Barbara coast to provide up to $ 140 million for state parks in place of state funding , said Jerry Emory , the director of communications for the California State Parks Foundation .
Louisiana and Iowa may close parks due to budget problems .
Other states have transferred their parks to local control to save money .
In Idaho , Gov. C.L. “ Butch ” Otter has proposed disbanding the state parks department , saving $ 10 million by selling the headquarters and shifting management of 30 state parks and recreation programs to another agency , said Jennifer Wernex , spokeswoman for the Idaho Parks and Recreation Department .

Phil McKnelly , the executive director of the National Assn. of State Park Directors , lamented the decision to close parks amid a recession .
“ This is the time when people need to be getting out and releasing stress , ” he said .
The Arizona State Parks budget has gone from $ 26 million in the 2009 fiscal year to $ 7.5 million as the legislature has struggled to close its budget gap .
Some local jurisdictions that depend on the flow of tourist dollars have mobilized to protect their parks .

The town of Camp Verde came up with $ 18,000 of its own money to keep Ft. Verde State Historic Park operating .
For Mike Scannell , the Camp Verde town manager , closing the fort -- one of the best - preserved Army forts from the period of the Indian Wars -- simply was n’t an option for the community of 12,000 .
“ We clearly had to do something , ” he said .
Closing the park would have dealt a “ catastrophic ” blow to Camp Verde ’s economy , Scannell said .
“ It ’s a real important part of the history of the town . ”

But even with the extra funds , the town was able to only delay the closing of the park by a month , from Feb. 22 to March 29 .
The town plans to use the time to come up with a funding plan to keep the fort open permanently .

Stimulus Jobs in China ?
Senators Angry About U.S. Money Going Overseas Sen. Schumer wants to stop an stimulus program paying for Chinese wind turbines .
March 4 , 2010  --
A war is emerging between Congress and the White House over high - profile stimulus programs that lawmakers claim are n't serving the American people .
Senate Democrats lashed out at the Obama administration on Wednesday , saying its stimulus wind energy program creates jobs overseas instead of in the U.S. , and they 're calling for the administration to put a stop to it .
" Today , we are demanding the Obama administration suspend this program immediately , " said Sen. Chuck Schumer , D - N.Y .
The program has already spent $ 2 billion , funding enough projects to power 2.4 million homes .
Any wind farm created in the U.S. is eligible for stimulus money to put up wind turbines , regardless of where those massive structures are made .
Each turbine costs about $ 3 million , and reaches 40 stories into the sky .
An investigation by ABC News and the Investigative Reporting Workshop found that 79 percent of the program 's money has gone to foreign companies , money that Schumer said was " federal tax dollars , the stimulus , which was sold as jobs in America . "
The senators are especially alarmed about a project highlighted by ABC News in West Texas that uses turbines manufactured in China .
The Texas wind farm is eligible for up to $ 450 million in stimulus funds .
The company that is helping to finance the wind project , US - REG , issued a statement Wednesday saying that the majority of jobs created by the project will be for Americans .
" A minimum of 70 percent of each wind turbine [...] will be wholly manufactured in the United States and made entirely of American steel .
It is incorrect to assume that the hundreds of additional jobs created aside from the direct construction and operation of the Texas plant would be outside the U.S. , " said Cappy McGarr , managing partner for the U.S. Renewable Energy Group .
The frustrated senators are concerned , though , that some of the money is also paying for manufacturing jobs in China , and they are pushing a bill requiring that stimulus projects create jobs in the United States .
They want the wind energy program stopped before the Chinese turbine manufacturers can collect any money .
In a statement Wednesday , the Energy Department insisted that the wind program does create jobs in the U.S. and said that " suspending it now would cause immediate layoffs of American workers at American manufacturing plants . "
They did say , though , that the Obama Administration is willing to work with Congress to make improvements .
But the law change may threaten artists who do not get their work classified by Commonwealth censors .
The artist Bill Henson had his contentious work judged by film censors before going to exhibition .
The artist Polixeni Papapetrou , whose photograph of her six - year - old daughter on the cover of Art Monthly caused a storm last year , did not have her work sent to censors .
She criticised the law change yesterday and asked whether she could be prosecuted if her work were judged by authorities as child pornography , saying : '' I think they 're barking up the wrong tree .
I really think they should be going after those people who exploit children .
'' I do n't know of any artists who exploit children and if they do they should not be protected by any legal defence . ''
The law change received cautious support from the executive director of the National Association for Visual Arts , Tamara Winikoff , who said artists were working with the director of public prosecutions on '' protective protocols so that art experts are consulted and can advise on whether the material had been produced by a genuine artist ' ' .
'' While the removal of artistic merit may seem to make artists more vulnerable to constraints on their freedom of expression , police and the ODPP need to establish the material in question is such that a reasonable person would find it offensive in all the circumstances , '' Ms Winikoff said .
Asked if parents who submitted a photo of their children naked for public exhibition now needed to get those photos classified , Ms Winikoff said : '' That 's a matter of their own judgment . ''
She said : '' It 's really very rarely artists ' work can be considered to be in danger of being child pornography . ''
Mr Hatzistergos said : '' There will be no further artistic purpose defence .
It is anomalous to describe something as child abuse material and then to have a defence of artistic purpose .
Instead , the definition of child abuse material will take into account the context in which the relevant material was produced or came into existence . ''
Under other changes to the law , witnesses as well as child abuse victims will be able to give evidence by video link and those they accuse will not be allowed to cross -examine them .
How do I move an Image ?
OTTAWA — Women have only seen a small part of the action in the Conservative government ’s “ Economic Action Plan , ” according to a new study of how the sexes are faring in federal stimulus spending .
As the federal government prepares to roll out a new budget on Thursday , a new study by a Queen ’s University professor argues that men are seeing a disproportionate share of the benefits of Ottawa ’s record spending over the past year .
According to Kathleen Lahey ’s analysis , women have only received about 7 to 22 per cent of federal infrastructure spending , because they are under - represented in the construction , manufacturing and engineering industries .
By Lahey ’s calculations , women are also not getting as much as men out of the billions Ottawa has committed to corporate , GST and personal - income tax cuts .
And though women represent around 50 per cent of the population , they ’re only seeing roughly a third of the enhancements to the employment - insurance program , according to Lahey ’s study .
Lahey says that the top question for the government this week should be : “ What will budget 2010 do to ensure that women receive fair shares of the benefits of these costly initiatives ? ”
Prime Minister Stephen Harper ’s office rejects the suggestion that its budgets are friendlier to men .
“ Our government is fully supportive of gender equality , ” said Andrew MacDougall , a spokesperson for the Prime Minister ’s Office .
“ Canada ’s Economic Action plan was a recession - fighting plan to help all Canadians who needed it .
We extended EI for all , we brought in tax cuts for all , we extended skills training for all and we invested in nearly 16,000 infrastructure projects that will benefit all Canadians . ”
But there was n’t much talk of women in Wednesday ’s Speech from the Throne , beyond talk of rewriting the words to the national anthem to make it more gender - neutral , as well as a mention of improved benefits for sole - support single - parent families , which are overwhelmingly headed by women in Canada .
Lahey notes that the loss of Canada ’s fledgling national child care program – scrapped by the Conservatives when they came to power in 2006 – also stands as a major loss for Canadian women in federal spending priorities .
She notes also in her study that of the $ 9.4 - billion spent to date on stimulus , only $ 572,475 – or 0.00006 per cent — has gone to upgrading women ’s shelters , while nearly triple that amount has been committed to upgrading three animal shelters in Canada .
Lahey based her calculations on the four - year period from when the Conservatives came to office in 2006 to the present .
In her analysis , the infrastructure spending has been most disproportionately unfair to women , while personal tax cuts have been the most advantageous , though women only saw 40 per cent of those benefits , Lahey argues .
Just this week , the federal minister in charge of the Status of Women , Helena Guergis , was at the United Nations in New York , boasting of economic progress being made by Canadian women , in part because of government efforts on that score .
Guergis told the UN , for instance , that women represented 47.2 per cent of the workforce in 2009 , and that in 2007 , women earned 61 per cent of all university degrees diplomas and certificates compared to 55 per cent in 1998 .
She also said that women are starting small businesses at twice the rate of men , and women ’s average incomes have increased almost 17 per cent since 2002 .
Lahey was one of a number of contributors to a report that went earlier this month to the UN , to counter Guergis ’s assertions of women ’s progress .
In that report , compiled by feminist and labour activists , the authors argue that there has been a “ systematic erosion ” of women ’s rights in Canada over the past few years and that the country has actually moved backwards in this realm .
The UN is currently taking stock of women ’s progress in all nations which took part in the 1995 Beijing conference on women .
Canada was among those participants .

EPT in Berlin Bewaffneter Raubüberfall auf Europas größtes Pokerturnier
Mehrere maskierte und bewaffnete Männer haben das größte europäische Pokerturnier überfallen .

Now , the unique nature of Sean ’s gate is it does n’t open up to another space - time but to two — a day in the past on one side and a day in the future via the other .
In this case , when applied to my diagrams , if you look through the front ( or right side ) you will be looking to the past by one day .
If you walk around and look through the left ( or back ) you will be seeing the future by one day .
He has indicated that this gate is a time machine that we discover , so we are left to understand that we are talking about a physical construct of some type and not just a natural wormhole that we have discovered .
He uses the word “ gate ” and never mentions wormhole , and he also indicates that it is a time machine .
I emphasize this because it is not unknown for physicists to call wormholes , or CTCs , time machines because they fear writing about time travel in any other form .
So I want to hold Sean to his words and by doing so , point out that if the gate is a time machine , somebody built it , which means that you could keep going backward in time to when it was first placed there , which is the point where the first inconsistency shows up — the fact that there is a time machine at all .
First let me explain this important point and I will then move on to how it relates to CTCs .
When discussing time travel to the past , in particular , and paradoxes , nearly everyone focuses in on some inconsistent plot element like murdering your grandfather or your teenage mother falling in love with you so she never weds your dad ( the same paradoxical result ) .
Because of this , the idea is that some event creates a paradox that would be illogical and so indicates that time travel is impossible or that some mysterious force of coincidences comes together to prevent such things from occurring in the first place .
Hence , Discover magazine 's claim that Sean 's article constitutes new rules for time travel because Sean 's initial premise is that CTCs could provide time travel without inconsistency .
What is constantly ignored here is that the first , initial inconsistency , as in all time travel scenarios , is the arrival of the time traveler to begin with .
It 's October 1914 , on the Western Front and suddenly , during the Battle of Ypres , amongst the drifting smoke and explosions , a glowing ring of light opens up on the trenches and out steps a determined looking young man , armed with an Uzi .
Just then , a mustached German Gefreiter , acting as a runner , races by but not noticing the phenomena that is happening just above him and to his right .
The man fires his Uzi at the soldier , gunning him down in a hail of bullets , and then just as suddenly vanishes into the portal of light , which blinks out .
Stunned , near - by soldiers of the Barvarian Regiment List [ 6 ] , scramble to his side .
" Gott im Himmel !
Adolf ist durch den Engel des Todes getötet worden ! "
Of course this is the classic , " what if you went back and killed Hitler ... " scenario , albeit with a unique twist , but the importance here is not that it is inconsistent with the historical record but the mere act of opening a path to the past , in most cases , would be inconsistent with the historical record .
What you do is n't the determining factor , its the mere act of changing space - time to enable you to do anything , that is the determining , inconsistent factor .
This simple fact renders all other arguments , concerning paradoxes and keeping stories consistent within CTCs , moot .
Now the idea that CTCs simply repeat the same thing over and over ignores the fact that there is a starting point .
After all , if the CTC is truly closed then you ca n’t get into it in the first place .
It ’s similar to Stephen Hawking ’s chronology protection conjecture [ 7 ] , which is also wrong ( and which he has since abandoned so I wo n't waste space going into all the obvious reasons it was never right , here ) but it is correct on this one angle - if you do produce a causal link to the past then that link will be destroyed by the sudden eruption of feedback .
If a space - time were to actually go back and curve to an exact previous point , in time and space , then any energy from that time , and near that region , could flow through that CTC back to where it began , repeatedly , and destroy the CTC in an explosion .
I am reminded of galactic jets that are seen erupting from the center of supermassive black holes and wonder , since time and space are said to break down inside of black holes , could these jets in some instances be the result of brute force CTCs being created and exploding ?
It used to be believed that you might be able to fly into a black hole and avoid the singularity but we know now , from Hubble Space Telescope photography , that the tremendous gravitational forces and radiation exceed the tolerances for any technology that we could imagine .
I pointed this out in my 2009 article Space Shuttle Endeavor Crew Flunk Kid's Youtube Question [ 8 ] ( the short title ) concerning how a member of the shuttle crew answered that " We do n't know " when a British kid asked via Youtube what would happen if you flew into a black hole .
The right answer is that , due to the conditions that I cited , there is no flying into a black hole .
If the forces just near the accretion disc are powerful and hot enough to turn matter into gas , a flight even past the accretion disc is impossible , let alone into the hole itself .
But it can not be disallowed that such rampant and brutal forces , that are exerted within such a celestial body , could be capable of tearing CTCs into existence which would violate causality and explode as Hawking predicted .
I am differentiating between the type of CTC that allows for time travel and that which would result from the out of control forces stemming from a black hole , thus my use of the term brute force .
However , outside of topic of black holes , descriptions of CTCs encounter the problem of describing what happens to that entry point .
Any CTC must have an initial beginning .
If it pinches off soon after it is formed , there may not be enough energy to destroy the loop .
If it does remain open too long , the energy would be joined by more and more , and eventually the CTC would be destroyed as it would be inside a black hole .
But such ideas ignore quantum mechanics which tells us that you only get one outcome per measurement which means there is no going back to the same exact moment in the same exact time , in the same exact space , at least not in the exact same space - time , which means that we must be talking about parallel universes here and , in fact , all discussions on time travel lead to that simply by the act of the time machine being switched on .
Arguments that parallel universe time travel is n't really time travel are inconsequential inside a physics discussion .
The point is to discuss physics and not sheer fantasy .
Whether they are mentioned outright or left unspoken , as Sean has done , the point at which parallel universes come into play can be seen in every physics time travel scenario .
Despite being mute on the subject , Sean 's own design betrays his silence , as I will illustrate .
Figure 3 shows how Sean 's gate is set - up .
The top illustration shows Today with the right side of the gate leading to Yes. ( yesterday ) and the left leading to Tom. ( tomorrow ) .
Yes . leads to the space - time Yes .
Today where yesterday is the current day and the day you came from is in the future .
Likewise , Tom. leads to the space - time Tom .
Today where that future day is current and the day you came from is in the past .
Each time I go through the opening in the same direction , I go further by one day into the past or future , depending on my direction .
I have corresponding arrows that point directly to the space - time configuration that each path through the gate would lead to .
So , I can keep going backward in time by going through the front of the gate , over and over again .
Before I proceed I want make a clarification .
He specifically states that " When you pass through it in one direction , it takes you exactly one day into the past ; if you pass through in the other direction , it takes you exactly one day into the future . "
There is no mention of having to wait before you go through the gate , although he mentions waiting later as part of his scenario with a time traveler .
That being the case , that every time you pass through the gate you arrive the day before in the one direction and the next day in the other , then it is possible to go back to the gate 's beginning .
That means I can finally arrive the day before the gate was put there , but if I ’m there the day before , how did I emerge to that past and can I get back ?
The answers to those questions simultaneously reveal another aspect of Sean ’s gate that he failed to see , but I will answer the questions first .
When I go through the opening and arrive the day before the gate was there , there will obviously be an opening through which to walk through because the purpose of the gate is to open up to the past in one direction and the future in the other .
But I arrive before the gate is in place , how did I get there ?
Obviously there was an opening to pass through .
Notice I said opening and not gate ?
Let ’s put you in my place instead .
Imagine that you are about to go through the gate and arrive the day before it was put in place .
You ’re standing there and you see this door frame looking device ( an arbitrary shape since Sean describes none ) and inside the device , just as Sean described , is the day before .
Note , he says that you have to pass through , but what happens when you turn around and look at the gate ?
Do you actually see the gate ?
If you ’re arriving the day before it was created , how could you ?
There is no gate there on that day .
Do we have a paradox here ?
No , we do n't .
There are no paradoxes in time travel .
What we have is the discovery of a long series of assumptions that are in Sean ’s article .
First of all , how does this gate function ?
This is an important question because as a research and development engineer I want to know how things work or if they can be built .
British physicist John Gribbin , in his article , Why Time Travel Is Possible [ 9 ] closed it by saying , " self - consistency is a consequence of the Principle of least action , and nature can be seen to abhor a time travel paradox .
Which removes the last objection of physicists to time travel in principle -- and leaves it up to the engineers to get on with the job of building a time machine . "
If we engineers are going have the job of building a time machine we have to understand intimately how such a device could be possible .
That means we have to understand the physics .
As a conceptual theorist that is also my job .
So if a physicist like Sean is going to suggest such a device , the first thing I 'm looking at is how it 's supposed to operate .
Because I have an intense interest in the nature of time and temporal mechanics , my scrutiny will be on a different level than that of a casual reader or your typical PhD physicist , who treats the subject more as a curiosity that arises from certain applications of general or special relativity , instead of being an integral part of the next step in Man 's understanding the universe .
Now , Sean 's gate functions by opening a hole in space - time to one day in the past in one direction and one day in the future in the other .
Notice , we ’re talking about a hole that you pass through .
Ever walk through a doorway into another room and , on one side of the doorway , there is this ornate frame but on the opposite side , there is just a plain wall ?
Sure you have .
If nothing else , the front entrance to most homes is like that .
Well , that ornate door frame is like the gate .
When you pass through and turn around you would n’t see the gate because it would n’t exist in that space - time of the day before it was created , but the opening that it caused would .
This situation also reveals something else — that we ’re talking about parallel universes here , automatically .
Why ?
Because if the gate opens up to the day before it was created and yet it did n’t exist the day before it was created — that ’s a paradox itself unless it opens to a parallel day before it was created .
From an engineering point of view , the gate is generating some kind of field that has created this hole is space - time , and in some way has stabilized it .
This revelation creates a whole new state of affairs .
For example , the way that Sean describes the gate , it would be possible to go through the openings that it caused , not only past the time it was created ( something that most physicists refrain from suggesting because they only like to consider time travel via CTCs or CTLs when not derived from time dilation on speeding rockets through space ) but into infinity in either direction .
Those familiar with the theoretical aspects of rotating black holes will recognize this concept of being able to travel to an infinity of parallel universes as depicted in certain Penrose maps [ 10 ] .
So Sean ’s gate would actually open to a parallel past where the gate itself did n’t exist .
Even if you began the day after and went back to the first day that it was operational , you still would n’t see it on that day because the day that the gate first connects to is the day before it existed and that is only possible in a parallel universe .
In other words , the past timeline is never linked to the one where we see the gate first being activated .
I 'll explain a different way .
Going through the gate the day it is activated and you arrive in the space the day before it is activated , imagine just hanging out there for 24 hours .
What happens then ?
The hole will still be there but , will the gate suddenly materialize around it ?
No .
Here 's why - you are in a space - time where a hole opened where there had never been one before .
The day that hole opened by the activation of the gate is not the same day and place as the original day before the gate was activated because on that day there was no hole .
No hole , no linear link to the exact day that the gate was activated , no ever seeing the gate suddenly appear on that side .
Ever .
But what about the future side ?
Now that ’s a different story but only in as far as the appearance of the gate .
Going to the future you would be able to turn around and see the actual gate because it could exist in the future .
However , it would also be a parallel future .
Why ?
Because of something that Sean seemed so concerned about — free will .
Determinism .
If the gate takes you one day into the future it is also possible to visit the future and then return and destroy the gate .
If you do , how could you have visited the future ?
By now , you know the answer
So to review before going further -
1 . The front of the gate actually leads to parallel paths where the opening exits but not the gate itself .
2 . The back of the gate leads to parallel futures where the gate does exist .
The way Sean wrote it is that you go through the gate and you see another one as if it has a copy in each version of space - time in the same exact spot .
However it can't be in the exact same spot without adhering to the arrangement that I just described which in turn would not allow for Sean 's exact scenario .
You can see now why that would n't work .
The reason he wrote it that way is because he was trying to figure out a way to write a CTC into his story to prove a point .
We 'll see later that this was even more problematic than I 've revealed so far .
It also leads to all kinds of false assumptions and erroneous results , as you are seeing now .
Another element that Sean missed is the issue of copies .
You ’ll remember that he mentioned the time traveler aligning himself with his past self .
In the future direction you could see a copy of you because the day that the time machine was switched on it connected to the future next day .
Unless something changes that future , you could be there as well to greet yourself coming through from the past .
He only briefly mentions it when he first introduces the gate idea , but not in as far as when the time traveler comes along .
However , the idea of the time traveler aligning himself with his past self is wrong because there is no past self that we see of the time traveler .
Again , the futures are parallel because of free - will .
Someone could cause the gate to shutdown cutting off access to the future but then how could the future have been there with the gate ?
All time travel involves parallel universes .
You have to finish doing the work to see them , but the presence of paradoxical solutions is indicative of your not being finished with the work .
And unlike what Sean says , it 's not just free - will but randomness that can be introduced .
Any type of random event could alter the future that was connected through the gate .
For a better understanding of this it is important to notice this other unknown element of Sean 's model - the three clocks .
There 's essentially a clock running at all times on the gate , the yesterday side and the tomorrow side .
You can cheat time in either direction by going through the gate but you can also just wait like the time traveler did before he went through again .
Multiple clocks ( of this nature ) means multiple universes because they could lead to multiple outcomes that are not consistent .
There 's nothing in physics that rules time travel out , and we know , at least from the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics , that there 's only one outcome observed per measurement .
If time travel is n't ruled out then , but there is a constraint on multiple outcomes , those alternate outcomes must only be possible in parallel universes .
There 's no escaping it .
So what about the time traveler and his closed CTC ?
First of all , unlike what Sean stated , the time traveler 's life is not and could not only be made up of his going back and forth through the gate .
Biology alone prevents that , another indication of not doing the work this subject requires .
What I mean is the the time traveler was obviously born , raised , etc .
Also , each time he goes through the gate he 's doing it again , but for the first time .
Let me explain .
According to Sean , the first time we see the time traveler is when he is existing the backside of the gate , returning from one day in the future .
Sean has us decide to wait 24 hrs and then be surprised when the time traveler , who has spent this whole time loitering around the gate , just walks around and enters the front to go back to the past .
What does this really mean ?
Remember those clocks I was talking about ?
When we saw the time traveler first arrive from the future there was a future version of ourselves that had just seen him enter the front of the gate to exit when we saw him .
24 hrs later , those versions of ourselves are on their next day in the future , 48 hours ahead of where we were when we saw the time traveler first pull his stunt .
Sean makes the mistake of assuming that we will see the very same event repeat , and we will be the original witnesses , but we are n't .
The original witnesses , ourselves 24 hours ahead , are then 48 hrs ahead of where we were when we first saw the time traveler .
I can prove it easily - if we first saw the time traveler when he came from the future , then we can't be the same ones that saw him leave the future .
I can prove that too - when Sean has us see him exit the next day and go to the past , we already knew he had done that before but were surprised to see how he had done it .
Once you have space - time geometries that introduce copies you have parallel universes in the mix .
We know those copies of ourselves are real because that 's where the time traveler came from .
This also raises an additional issue - if anyone is a copy in this scenario , it 's not him .
After all , he 's the one time traveling .
We saw him come from the future and we saw him go to the past the next day and at any point along that timeline of events he was without a duplicate of himself , the way that Sean wrote it .
When he was in the future , he was with our copies .
Then he leaves and comes to the past to be with us .
Then the next day , he returns to the past .
Unlike Sean 's characterization , the time traveler is n't aligning himself with any copy - he 's the constant original .
This is where we get to the next level of erroneous assumptions .
Sean says that the time traveler must align with his past self , but that would be impossible .
Sean also says that we see only one time traveler .
In reality , that would not be true either .
At some point , the time traveler must have arrived at the gate for the first time .
He goes through to the past and hangs out .
Depending on when he returns , to the future , if he would , he could run into a copy of himself .
For example , if he returns at the same instant that he left , he would pass himself .
Then if he turned back around he could hang out in the past with himself , at least using the logic that Sean uses , he could .
Guess what ?
That would be yet another erroneous assumption .
The reason is that it is easy to think of going back and forth from past to future through this gate but what that neglects is the attention to the fact about those clocks I mentioned and the fact that the gate is always open and not selecting specific dates .
It 's an engineering thing and here 's how it works -
1. It 's Tuesday .
Time traveler goes through gate to Monday for the first time and stays for 24 hours .
2 . The opening to the gate stays open during that time .
24 hours passes on the other side as well .
3 . On that other side of the gate it is now Wednesday and he is not on that other side .
4 . Sean would say that if the time traveler walked around and went through the gate on the past side , he would merge with his past self , who had been through the gate the first time .
However , this is where his copy shows up to go through the gate for its first time .
There is no merging , and we also see that now the time traveler has a copy because I did n't forget to add that first event of time travel for him .
Another mistake in this scenario is the whole issue that the time traveler has created some kind of CTC .
Remember what Sean said about determining the nature of time by making assumptions ?
This is where specifically , such an approach goes awry .
In fact , as you will see later , this whole affair has gone terribly awry ( yes , it gets worse ) .
Sean assumed that the time traveler would leave the gate area and then we would see him on the next day to make his entrance through the front .
Instead he hung around the gate until the next day and then went through at the exact time that we saw him emerge through the other side , the day before .
Because of this , Sean says there is a CTC .
What 's the difference between his hanging around and going , say a mile down the street and waiting to the next day , and then coming back ?
Nothing .
OK , the difference is a mile trip in either direction , but we still have the same individual doing the same act .
The reason why it is the same individual is because we do n't see another version of him showing up to go through to the past .
The idea of him hanging around the gate to go through again is n't the point .
The point is that we never see another version of him showing up to go through first .
As a result , the description only appears to suggest a CTC but it is only the world - line of the time traveler that suggests this , and not the space - time geometry of the gate itself .
Just as the paradoxical etchings of M.C. Escher [ 11 ] prove , an idea on paper does n't make it real .
I understand fully that there are going to be those who will protest and insist that CTCs cause causality to break down , but I would argue back that the point is what caused the CTC in the first place ?
Causality can't be broken before there is an alleged cause .
As I 've already pointed out that a CTC must have an entry way or it's of no consequence , and probably could n't exist anyway , allow me to reiterate that the gate is the thing that is manipulating space - time , not the time traveler .
In other words , you , as the guardian , could simply run the time traveler off and prevent him from using the gate .
No more CTC effect .
At all .
Sean was attempting to use this feature of the story to create a case for some unnamed force that would prevent such actions that would lead to inconsistencies .
He claimed that there was a vexing problem to figuring out what it was that forces us to make consistent choices in time travel scenarios .
The reason that it is such a vexing problem is that there is no such thing .
The solution is the many - worlds model .
Logic dictates it .
The math reveals it and the geometries describe it .
It is impossible to construct , design , conceive or imagine a time travel scenario where parallel universes do not emerge as a solution .
CTCs themselves are the obvious elements of such a solution .
Where is everyone else when someone amongst us decides to go into a CTC ?
The same place we were before .
Where are they ?
Are they in the same space - time continuum as we are ?
No ?
Well , what would you call it then ?
That 's right .
And as for what a CTC actually is , it is a curved region of space - time that returns to a point in its past , but in a parallel universe .
How can I say this with such certainty ?
By introducing a video camera .
Upon approaching the CTC , if a person begins to video their experience , when they arrive in the so - called point of origin , back in time , they may very well run into themselves but that encounter will not be recorded in the video when they first entered the curve if they play it back .
It will be for their copy 's video but not the original person .
I 'm imagining a region where it takes some time to complete the journey back , even if it 's only minutes .
Once they hit that point that they had entered before , they will see themselves but of course that moment will not be recorded when the video is played back , showing their initial entry , because when they first entered they did n't see themselves .
Meanwhile , because of free - will , i.e. randomness , this time traveling person can do something else once they arrive back at that entry to the CTC because it is connected to a point in space - time which is also connected to another space - time .
In other words , if there 's a way in , there is also a way out and that way out will lead to an actual parallel universe .
Imagine a roundabout on a street and you will see what I mean if you then imagine it rotating ( to imitate the curvature in space - time ) so that you end up at the same point that you entered but now , instead of in the future ( at the normal rate of elapsed time ) you are in the past and seeing yourself entering the roundabout .
Again , you did n't see yourself doing that when you first entered and so…well , you know the answer by now .
Now , what if it 's like walking up to a mirror - a configuration where the travelers would see themselves approaching the point of entry as if they were about to leave , just as they were actually entering ?
That one , because the connection or gate or what have you , could be blocked or the travelers prevented from going all the way in , which would leave a different kind of paradox ( where did the copies of the travelers come from then ? ) and would be the result of travelers from a parallel universe initiating the action first , instead of the other way around .
Now , I will reveal the biggest error , one that completely destroys everything about Sean 's example .
It even invalidates the things that I 've said about how the Sean 's gate would work .
Why ?
Because on closer inspection I realized that under no circumstances could a gate configuration , as he describes , work .
I left the previous deconstructions and analysis in because I am also trying to show the kind of thought processes and scrutiny that temporal mechanics demand if you want serious , accurate solutions .
It just turns out that in double checking my work I saw the fatal flaw that killed the entire idea , and it goes right back to the way that I described Riemann slits working in Figure 1&2 .
Sean describes a single gate performing double duty - linking a day in the future on one side and a day in the past on the other .
A single gate would not be able to perform this function .
A single gate would appear as it does in Figures 1 & 2 .
When creating a Riemann slit in space - time there is a front and back to it .
In other words , you can walk around it , 360 degrees , at its destination point , as well as its point of origin .
That means that an opening to the past must be an opening to the past on both sides of the gate in in the space of its origin only .
Sean 's gate functions like a spiral through time .
If you keep walking through the right side , you keep going back a day in time .
If you walk through the left , you go to the future by a day each time .
In reality , regardless of which way you walk , you can only go in one temporal direction and once you go there you can only return from whence you came .
There is no going further in either direction .
In order to have the type of geometry indicated by Sean , you must have two gates - the second which would connect to the future , and to accomplish the type of operation Sean describes .
These two gates must be separated by some distance , so that their separate operations do n't interfere , but could still function as a single gate and , in fact , fit perfectly into Sean 's basic design .
Or so I thought ...
I 've already given you a clue as to the ultimate dead end to this idea .
Placing the two gates close together results in the following configuration in regards to space - time linkages :
1 . The past gate has a face that allows you to enter from the front .
The face on the opposite side is not seen and faces the hidden face of the other gate .
2 . The future gate has a face that allows you to enter from the back of this arrangement .
As already stated , its opposing side is hidden and faces the hidden side of the past gate .
3 . Entry into either gate places you in exactly the type of configuration as Sean describes as when you are in the past or future and walk around to the opposite side of where you entered - you will be able to look through and see beyond the hidden side of the gate through which you came and see the space between it and the second gate .
For easier understanding , take two exact coins and place their opposing sides together , with some space between them .
Heads is the front / past side , and tales is the back / future side .
Like I said , or so I thought .
What wo n't work is the repetitious going back and forth , from past to future .
Let me explain .
Sean 's configuration allows you to go to the past and then return the next day .
Or even keep going to the past .
The reality is that it wo n't work , not even with the version I created , because each gate only allows you to go the past by one day or the future by one day but not both .
The problem is that Sean just arbitrarily came up with this idea without working out the details of the space - time geometry he was actually describing .
Remember how I said that a Riemann slit connects to the other destination so that you can walk around it and look back through ?
So if our time traveler walks out the past gate , he can return through that gate just as described - back to the future because that 's what 's in the interior of that gate .
In other words , as far as the story goes , you only need one gate - but it wo n't work both ways like Sean has it - it will just work the way a Riemann slit would .
For a trip to the future , you would use the future gate and the return would obviously allow you to go back to the past but there would be no going further either .
The time traveler scenario would then work like this :
1 . We see the time traveler exit the past gate opening .
2 . He waits around 24 hours and then goes back through the past opening and arrives a day in the future .
Huh ?
Right .
Remember the clocks ?
24 hours has gone by both outside and inside the gate .
By going through again he only returns to the future he came from which is now 24 hours ahead .
He can't go back to the past again by going back through the gate - he 's already in the past it connects to .
The same would hold true if he were to try a trip to the future through the future gate .
Each gate opens to mutually exclusive space - times .
So that means there is not even the chance to describe a CTC in any form using Sean 's idea .
At least not as anything more than a rhetorical exercise .
But physics , especially trying to explain advanced concepts , should be more than merely rhetorical .
It should be accurate , especially when being used to describe " new rules " .
Sean closes his article by saying , " The alternative answer to the puzzles raised by closed time - like curves is probably that they simply cannot exist " .
I would suggest , instead , that the puzzles cease to exist once you truly understand CTCs .

Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown is leveraging Rachel Maddow ’s non-existent run for Senate to raise money for his campaign .
Maddow has unequivocally said that she ’s not running but continued to have fun at Brown ’s expense Thursday with a tongue - in - cheek campaign ad produced for the Massachusetts senator .
While the ad ’s premise was an attack on Maddow , it actually took some shots at “ creepy ” Brown in the process .

“ Far left wing pundit Rachel Maddow claims she ’s not running for Senate in Massachusetts against Scott Brown , ” the ad began .
In fact , Maddow has unambiguously confirmed that she ’s not challenging the senator .
“ I have the best job in the world .
I ’m not running for office , ” Maddow said Wednesday .
“ I made clear — on TV even — that I ’m not running .
I never said I was running .
The Democratic Party in Massachusetts never asked me to run .
I ’m not running , ” she said .
The attack ad was n’t taking no for an answer .
“ How long do you intend to duck this issue ? ” the parody asked .
“ Senator Scott Brown knows where he stands and he ’s not afraid to follow up on any ridiculous wafer - thin internet rumor to raise money — I mean , to defend the people of Massachusetts , ” the ad continued .
But Maddow was n’t joking in a full - page advertisement that ran in Friday ’s Boston Globe and Boston Herald .

Maddow writes :
Do you remember when Mitt Romney ran for President after being our Governor and he went around the country insulting Massachusetts , talking about what an awful state we are ?
To have our new Senator raising money around the country by saying how terrible one of his Massachusetts constituents is , kind of feels the same way to me .
On her Wednesday show , Maddow personally phoned residents of Massachusetts .
“ I think he ’s being a creep here , ” she said .
This video is from MSNBC’s The Rachel Maddow Show , broadcast March 25 , 2010 .

The report also calls for access to pro-bulimia websites to be blocked Children are being increasingly exposed to sexual imagery and their parents have limited opportunities to stop it , a report for the Home Office warns .
The report calls for tougher regulation of sexual imagery in adverts and a ban on selling " lads ' mags " to under - 16s .
It also recommends selling mobile phones and games consoles with parental controls automatically switched on .
Author Dr Linda Papadopoulos said there was a clear link between sexualised imagery and violence towards females .
Her report said the material children were being exposed to included the growth of lads ' mags and pornography on mobile phones , through to big - name fashion brands using sexual imagery to advertise clothes targeted at young teenagers .
' Distorting perceptions '
The report said this " drip - drip " exposure was distorting young people 's perceptions of themselves , encouraging boys to become fixated on being macho and dominant , while girls in turn presented themselves as sexually available and permissive .
One outcome had been the rise of sexual bullying in which girls felt compelled to post topless or naked pictures on social networks , it added .
Both the images we consume and the way we consume them are lending credence to the idea that women are there to be used and that men are there to use them
Linda Papadopoulos
' Why can't I look like that ? '
Send us your comments Home Office report in full " Unless sexualisation is accepted as harmful , we will miss an important opportunity to broaden young people 's beliefs about where their values lies , " said Dr Papadopoulos , a psychologist .
The report 's 36 recommendations include calling for games consoles , mobile phones and some computers to be sold with parental controls already switched on .
This would allow families to automatically filter which on - demand services and online material their children can use .
Other recommendations include : A ban on " sexualised " music videos before the TV watershed
A ban on Jobcentres advertising positions in lap - dancing clubs and massage parlours
Internet service providers to block access to pro-bulimia and pro-anorexia websites
The creation of a website where parents can report any " irresponsible marketing " they believe sexualises young children .
Dr Papadopoulos said there should also be symbols to show when a published photograph had been digitally altered - such as pictures of celebrities manipulated to make them appear thinner .
She also recommends giving the Advertising Standards Authority the power to act against sexualised imagery appearing within commercial websites , such as provocative photo - shoots used by clothing chains targeting teenagers .

Dr Papadopoulos said : " The evidence gathered in the review suggests a clear link between consumption of sexualised images , tendency to view women as objects and the acceptance of aggressive attitudes and behaviour as the norm .
" Both the images we consume and the way we consume them are lending credence to the idea that women are there to be used and that men are there to use them . "
The review forms part of the Home Office 's broader attempts to have a louder public debate about how to combat violence against women and girls .
Both Labour and the Conservatives are examining the issues .
Tory leader David Cameron said earlier this month that he would clamp down on irresponsible advertising targeted at children .
He also mooted the idea that parents should be able to complain about offensive marketing tactics used by companies , via a specially set - up website .
Such moves were needed to stop children being " bombarded " with inappropriate material , he said .
Home Secretary Alan Johnson said : " We know that parents are concerned about the pressures their children are under at a much younger age , which is why we have already committed to a number of the recommendations in this report .
Parental control " Changing attitudes will take time but it is essential if we are going to stop the sexualisation which contributes to violence against women and girls . "
Deputy Children 's Commissioner for England , Sue Berelowitz , said the report was excellent , but said responsibility did not only lie with the media .
" Parents need to be stepping in and taking control , they need to be imposing good boundaries , they need to know what their children are watching , people need to be really careful about children having private access to the internet in their bedrooms , " she told BBC Radio 4 's Today programme .

Frank Furedi , professor of sociology at Kent University , said society as a whole and adults were to blame .
He said : " The whole of society is hypersexualised - sex becomes the common currency through which adults make their way in the world and continually send a signal to children that sex is all that matters .
" One of the big problems that we are faced with is that increasingly adults have lost the capacity to draw a line between their own attitudes and those of children and increasingly we 're recycling adult attitudes about sex through the prism of children . "

Greece skirted disaster this week by persuading investors and politicians that it is finally on track to fix its finances .
But even before the dust settles , the government is setting the stage for a potential conflict with Germany , France and other European governments that may raise doubts about the sustainability of the euro project .
In the last two days , Greece ’s finance minister has threatened to turn to the International Monetary Fund for a bailout if Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and other European politicians resist pledging aid to help Greece cope with its newfound frugality .
Asking the fund for help could create a new round of financial and political turmoil by sending the message that Europe cannot resolve its own problems , analysts said .
“ It would be damaging for the euro zone going forward because it would sow seeds of doubt about whether this is really a currency union , or just a group of countries that share a currency , ” said Simon Tilford , the chief economist of the Center for European Reform in London .
Policy makers and leaders of many countries that use the euro see Greece ’s troubles as a problem within the family .
They want a homegrown political solution to show that Europe can fix internal economic crises without outside help .
Flow Analysis & Time - based Bloom Filters
Working with large streams of data is becoming increasingly widespread , be it for log , user behavior , or raw firehose analysis of user generated content .
There is some very interesting academic literature on this type of data crunching , although much of it is focused on query or network packet analysis and is often not directly applicable to the type of data we have to deal with in the social web .
For example , if you were tasked to build ( a better ) “ Trending Topics ” algorithm for Twitter , how would you do it ?
Of course , the challenge is that it has to be practical - it needs to be “ real - time ” and be able to react to emerging trends in under a minute , all the while using a reasonable amount of CPU and memory .
Now , we do n’t know how the actual system is implemented at Twitter , nor will we look at any specific solutions - I have some ideas , but I am more curious to hear how you would approach it .
Instead , I want to revisit the concept of Bloom Filters , because as I am making my way through the literature , it is surprising how sparsely they are employed for these types of tasks .
Specifically , a concept I have been thinking of prototyping for some time now : time - based , counting bloom filters !
Bloom Filters : What & Why
A Bloom Filter is a probabilistic data structure which can tell if an element is a member of a set .
However , the reason it is interesting is because it accomplishes this task with an incredibly efficient use of memory : instead of storing a full hash map , it is simply a bit vector which guarantees that you may have some small fraction of false positives ( the filter will report that a key is in the bloom filter when it is really not ) , but it will never report a false negative .
File system and web caches frequently use bloom filters as the first query to avoid otherwise costly database or file system lookups .
There is some math involved in determining the right parameters for your bloom filter , which you can read about in an earlier post .
Of course , as is , the Bloom Filter data structure is not very useful for analyzing continuous data streams - eventually we would fill up the filter and it would begin reporting false positives all the time .
But , what if your bloom filter only remembered seen data for a fixed interval of time ?
Imagine adding time - to - live ( TTL ) timestamp on each record .
All of the sudden , if you knew the approximate number of messages for the interval of time you wanted to analyze , then a bloom filter is once again an incredibly fast and space - efficient ( fixed memory footprint ) data structure !
Time - based Bloom Filters
Arguably the key feature of bloom filters is their compact representation as a bit vector .
By associating a timestamp with each record , the size of the filter immediately expands by an order of magnitude , but even with that , depending on the size of the time window you are analyzing , you could store the TTL ’s in just a few additional bits .
Conversely , if counting bits is not mission critical , you could even used a backend such as Redis or Memcached to drive the filter as well .
The direct benefit of such approach is that the data can be shared by many distributed processes .
On that note , I have added a prototype Redis backend to the bloomfilter gem which implements a time - based , counting Bloom Filter .
Let ’s take a look at a simple example :
require ' bloomfilter ' options = { : size => 100 , # size of bit vector : hashes => 4 , # number of hash functions : seed => rand ( 100 ) , # seed value for the filter : bucket => 3 # number of bits for the counting filter } # Regular , in - memory counting bloom filter bf = BloomFilter .
new ( options ) bf . insert ( " mykey " ) bf . include ? ( " mykey " ) # => true bf .
include ? ( " mykey1 " ) # => false # # Redis - backed bloom filter , with optional time - based semantics # bf = BloomFilter .
new ( options .
merge ( { : type => : redis , :ttl => 2 , : server => { : host => ' localhost ' }} ) ) bf . insert ( " mykey " ) bf . include ? ( " mykey " ) # => true sleep ( 3 ) bf . include ? ( " mykey " ) # => false # custom 5s TTL for a key bf .
insert ( " newkey " , nil , 5 )
Storing data in Redis or Memcached is roughly an order of magnitude less efficient , but it gives us an easy to use , distributed , and fixed memory filter for analyzing continuous data streams .
In other words , a useful tool for applications such as duplicate detection , trends analysis , and many others .
Mechanics of Time - Based Bloom Filters
So how does it work ?
Given the settings above , we create a fixed memory vector of 100 buckets ( or bits in raw C implementation ) .
Then , for each key , we hash it 4 times with different key offsets and increment the counts in those buckets - a non-negative value indicates that one of the hash functions for some key has used that bucket .
Then , for a lookup , we reverse the operation : generate the 4 different hash keys and look them up , if all of them are non-zero then either we have seen this key or there has been a collision ( false positive ) .
By optimizing the size of the bit vector we can control the false positive rate - you ’re always trading the of amount of allocated memory vs. collision rate .
Finally , we also make use of the native expire functionality in Redis to guarantee that keys are only stored for a bounded amount of time .
Time - based bloom filters have seen a few rogue mentions in the academic literature , but to the best of my knowledge , have not seen wide applications in the real world .
However , it is an incredibly powerful data structure , and one that could benefit many modern , big - data applications .
Gem install the bloomfilter gem and give it a try , perhaps it will help you build a better trends analysis tool .
Speaking of which , what other tools , algorithms , or data structures would you use to build a “ Trending Topics ” algorithm for a high - velocity stream ?
REGINA , Saskatchewan , Feb. 12 ( UPI ) -- A Canadian man in Regina , Saskatchewan was fined $ 50 Friday for sniffing and touching cakes in a supermarket bakery department .
Alexander Rodrigue , 23 , was also ordered to make restitution for the cakes and stay away from the supermarket for four months , the Regina Leader - Post reported .

He had previously pleaded guilty to a mischief charge relating to the June 15 incident in which staff claimed he had been licking the cakes , the newspaper said .
However , at his sentencing , Rodrigue told the judge he had not licked the cakes , but admitted to sniffing and touching them , but did not explain why .
If he pays the fine , the offense wo n't be recorded as a conviction , the report said .
As the fierce debate on President Obama ’s plan for health care reform comes to a head , Americans should be thinking carefully about what happens if Congress fails to enact legislation .
Are they really satisfied with the status quo ?
And is the status quo really sustainable ?
Here are some basic facts Americans need to know as Congress decides whether to approve comprehensive reform or continue with what we have :
HOW REFORM WOULD WORK : Let ’s be clear , the changes Mr. Obama and Democratic leaders in Congress are proposing are significant .
But , despite what the critics charge , this is not a government takeover .
And the program is not only fully paid for , it should actually reduce the deficit over the next two decades .
Under the new system , all people would be required to have health insurance or pay a penalty .
If you are poor or middle class you would also get significant help through Medicaid coverage or tax credits to pay the premiums .
The legislation would create exchanges on which small businesses and people who buy their own coverage directly from insurers could choose from an array of private plans that would compete for their business .
It would also require insurance companies to accept all applicants , even those with a pre-existing condition .
And it would make a start at reforming the medical care system to improve quality and lower costs .
The upcoming 4.0 reference release of Apple 's iPhone OS will deliver new support for running multiple concurrent third party apps , and allow users to switch between them using a windows management mechanism similar to one made popular on the company 's Mac OS X operating system .
The technology , detailed by people familiar with Apple 's plans for the new firmware , will finally allow users to launch multiple apps in the background and quickly switch between them , as AppleInsider exclusively reported earlier this month .
Currently , a running app must be quit when the user returns to the Home screen .
Apple initially avoided an app model supporting multiple apps running at once to help preserve battery life and simplify the user experience .
Other platforms that do support the launching of multiple apps , including Android and Windows Mobile , require users to manually manage system resources and kill off performance robbing background tasks .
Today 's iPhone 3.x firmware is a fully preemptive multitasking operating system , but it artificially restricts apps ( other than specific ones bundled with the system by Apple ) from running in the background .
Iconic Expose
Those familiar with the design of iPhone 4.0 said that the user interface will resemble Apple 's desktop Expose feature , in that a key combination — reportedly hitting the Home button twice — will trigger an expose - like interface that brings up a series of icons representing the currently running apps , allowing users to quickly select the one they want to switch to directly .
When a selection is made , the iPhone OS zooms out of the Expose task manager and transitions to that app .
Apple patented the Mac OS X Expose concept in 2005 , but the desktop implementation relies upon scaling each application 's widows so that they all fit into the screen in a single layer without any overlap .
On the iPhone , scaling down several screen views to fit into the relatively small display would be problematic , and apps never have multiple windows , so the new mechanism currently presents just each app 's icon .
This renders the feature more similar to the basic Command + Tab app switcher than Expose itself as a desktop feature , but people who 've been privy to pre-release builds of the iPhone 4.0 OS say it exhibits several characteristics of the Expose brand .
Two other features seen in pre-release builds of iPhone 4.0 are a global mailbox view and the ability to add individual contacts to the iPhone 's home screen , such as a button that will call " Mom " or " Dad " directly .
Since the software remains under active development , there 's always the possibility that either or both of these enhancements could be chopped in the coming months .
Multiple apps without broken security
Controversy over " multitasking " within the iPhone OS has been brewing ever since Apple launched iPhone 2.0 with the ability to run third party software titles .
While often reported as being a technical flaw , the iPhone OS really has no problem with multitasking .
The system 's phone , SMS , email , iPod , voice recorder , Nike + , and certain other bundled apps can continue in the background while the user launches another app .
However , third party titles obtained from the App Store ( including apps from Apple , such as Remote or iDisk ) can not be launched at the same time .
This is currently only possible after jailbreaking the system , where the iPhone OS security model is compromised via an exploit , allowing the user to launch and run multiple apps .
This also opens the door to both malware and widespread piracy , both of which have been contained by the default security system put in place by Apple .
At the same time , Apple 's signed app model in iTunes with its mandatory certificate security mechanism means that iPhone users will be able to run multiple apps from the App Store without fear that their software will spy on them , pop up ads , or send out spam .
Other platform vendors do not mandate rigid security for their software libraries , with Android permissively allowing users to install apps from any source , something that will likely serve as a welcome mat for malicious hackers once that platform gains enough visibility .
Notifications pay off on the way to multitasking
Rather than immediately jumping to a multitasking environment for the iPhone , Apple introduced a system - wide push notifications service to enable third party apps to appear to respond to outside updates ( such as incoming messages or news alerts ) even when they were not actually running .
The company has worked to refine this mechanism before moving to a fully multitasking model , which means that existing apps with notification support wo n't necessarily need to be launched in the background just to continually poll for updates .
Additionally , third party apps that are running in the background will be less likely to drain performance and battery compared to other platforms because the notification mechanism is more efficient than having multiple apps each polling a remote server for their own updates .
For example , RIM 's BlackBerry OS has long offered multitasking support for apps but the company only recently opened up its push delivery infrastructure to third party developers .
As a result , most of the relatively small library of BlackBerry apps are designed to inefficiently poll a server for information rather than avail themselves of the BlackBerry 's famous push messaging features .
Budget 2010 : reaction from around the UK

He said : “ We can confirm that on 28 January this year during rough weather and at night , HMS YORK and an Argentine ship were operating in the same locality in international waters around 50 miles from Falkland Island Territorial Waters .
After a friendly dialogue by radio they each continued with their own exercises . ”
* Virginia to file lawsuit after Obama signs bill into law
* AG : Congress lacks power to force insurance purchases
NEW YORK , March 22 ( Reuters ) - Virginia ’s attorney general said he plans to sue the federal government over the healthcare reform legislation , saying Congress lacks authority to force people to buy health insurance .
Attorney General Kenneth Cuccinelli , a Republican , said on Monday that Congress lacks authority under its constitutional power to regulate interstate commerce to force people to buy insurance .
He said the bill also conflicts with a state law that says Virginians cannot be required to buy insurance .
“ If a person decides not to buy health insurance , that person by definition is not engaging in commerce , ” Cuccinelli said in recorded comments .
“ If you are not engaging in commerce , how can the federal government regulate you ? ”
Cuccinelli said he plans to file his lawsuit in federal court in Richmond , Virginia , after President Barack Obama signs the bill into law , which he is expected to do .
The bill requires most Americans to have health coverage , and provides subsidies to help lower - income workers afford it .

No Republican voted for the bill , which passed the House on Sunday night by a 219 - 212 vote .
( Reporting by Jonathan Stempel ; editing by John Wallace )
( CNN ) --
Some people check their appearance in any mirror , window or computer screen they can find , but not out of vanity .
It 's because they hate the way they look so much .
An obsession with one or more bodily features , normally in the face , indicates a condition called body dysmorphic disorder .
This mental illness , which leads some patients to seek multiple plastic surgeries , is not uncommon ; 1 to 2 percent of the population is thought to have it .
But most people who have the disorder do n't get a diagnosis ; they just think they are ugly , said Dr. Jamie Feusner psychiatrist at the University of California , Los Angeles .
Some celebrities have BDD , but few have been public about it , Feusner said .
He and colleagues have treated celebrities at UCLA , but can not disclose which ones .
" Everyone else would consider them attractive -- they do n't consider themselves attractive , " he said .
It turns out that people with this condition have abnormal brain function when it comes to looking at pictures of their own faces , according to a new study led by Feusner and published in the Archives of General Psychiatry .
When viewing themselves in photographs , patients with BDD underutilize parts of the brain used in seeing the face 's overall shape and size , he said .
" If you just see the pieces of your face , and not seeing how they fit into the whole , then it 's going to look distorted , " he said .
" That 's how we interpret the findings . "
Researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging to look at the brains of participants as they viewed photographs of their own faces and familiar faces .
Subjects viewed pictures that were high spatial resolution ( showing details such as skin blemishes ) , and low spatial resolution ( showing the general shape of the face ) , and unaltered .
The findings showed that when the BDD patients viewed normal and low - resolution photos of themselves , they had abnormal brain activity in visual processing systems .
Also , the part of the brain that helps guide behavior and maintain emotional flexibility , the frontostriatal systems , had unusual activation patterns .
" What we think may be happening is that they may be seeing details , perhaps even seeing details normally , but that they 're not able to contextualize it , " he said .
Although the sample size is small -- 17 patients with BDD and 16 healthy people participated -- for a functional imaging study a 32 - person subject group is reasonable , experts say .
The study is " groundbreaking " in its demonstration that patients with BDD are too focused on the details are n't able to see the whole picture when they see themselves , said Sabine Wilhelm , director of the BDD Clinic and Research Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital , who was not involved in the study .
This can be observed anecdotally in treatment , but this study confirms it at the level of brain processing , she said .
Feusner 's previous research found that when BDD patients viewed the faces of other people -- not their own faces -- the brain 's left hemisphere , associated with categorization and details , was more more active .
Healthy individuals used the right hemisphere , the part of brain that processes more holistically .
It is too early to directly apply the findings to treatment , but one possibility is that patients with BDD could be retrained to see their own faces , he said .
Treatments available today for BDD include medications called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors , also used for depression and anxiety disorders , and cognitive behavioral therapy , Wilhelm said .
She also sees implications for treatment in the study 's findings .
" What we need to do in cognitive behavioral therapy treatment development is to really enhance efforts at teaching patients how to see the big picture , " she said .
Many people with BDD will try to have what they perceive as flaws -- pimples , scars , birthmarks , or other features -- surgically or dermatologically removed .
But plastic surgery almost never fixes their unhappiness about their appearance : 81 percent are dissatisfied with results of cosmetic treatments , Wilhelm said .
" The problem is really on the inside , it 's not what they really look like , " Wilhelm said .
Besides seeking surgeries , other symptoms include frequent camouflage with makeup , compulsive picking of skin , and asking for reassurance from others , she said .
People with BDD may also check their reflection to the point of endangering themselves while driving while looking at themselves in the rearview mirror , she said .
The likelihood of attempting suicide or being hospitalized is high among BDD patients .
Not enough research has been done on the subject to determine whether BDD is the results of genes , environment , or some combination thereof .
It is unclear which of these pathways led to the brain abnormalities found in the study , Feusner said .
Some brain patterns seen in BDD are also associated with obsessive compulsive disorder , although BDD is probably not a form of it , Feusner said .
People with OCD tend to recognize that their fears and behaviors are excessive , whereas BDD patients are more delusional and are convinced that the ugliness they perceive in themselves in real .
BDD is also different than eating disorders because it is purely about an imagined appearance and not eating habits , Wilhelm said .
But Feusner does suspect a connection between BDD and anorexia , and his next project is a brain imaging study comparing patients with the two conditions .

Letting the internet make you appear like you care .
I learned a new word recently – “ SLACTIVISM “ . ( ref )
Slacktivism ( also written as slactivism ) is a combination of the words Slacker and Activism .
The word describes “ feel - good ” measures in support of an issue or social cause , that have little or no practical effect other than to make the person doing it feel satisfaction .
The acts also tend to require little personal effort from the slacktivist and are mainly online activities .
There are examples of slacktivism all over the internet , and once you become aware of the term they tend to be frustratingly easy to spot .
I use the word ‘ frustrating ’ here , as in my experience , I find that the biggest slacktivists are also the ones that tend to tell you about it as many times as possible .
It is the “ look at me and how much I am doing to help , are n’t I great ? ” scenario .
Those who participate in “ slacktivist ” campaigns , relish in an illusion of having a meaningful impact on the world without demanding anything more than joining a Facebook group or changing your Twitter avatar to show a colour or a badge .
Recent examples of this include :
– adding your bra colour to Facebook to highlight breast cancer .
– making your twitter avatar green to support Iran
– blacking out your avatar to support anti-internet censorship
Even “ Earth Hour ” protests against non-government action against climate change has elements of slacktivism .
It is unfair to label ALL online activity as Slactivism , or indeed , to dismiss Slacktivism as totally useless .
There are situations where online activity & awareness has assisted in producing results .
My issue with all this is when I see people jump on the latest bandwagon , promote their activity to all their followers , but then promptly return to playing Farmville , or asking the lazyweb for recommendations on products .
Also , many people participate without actually understanding the issues involved .
I am sure you can all find someone who updated their Facebook status to their bra colour without realising what it was actually for .
I even know some men that did it , as it was just the latest meme going and they wanted to appear that they were part of it all .
Online protest or awareness campaigns do have merit and can help cause the desired effect .
Even so , it is important to decide if the online medium is the right audience for the issues .
An example of this is the current Anti-Internet censorship filter campaign going on in Australia .
The participants in this are very active & are giving it a good go , which I applaud them for .
They are standing up for what they believe in .
However , there is the chance this campaign may fail and I am not the only one who thinks so .
The campaign is being conducted online , and uses mechanisms that promote Slacktivist activities , in a negative way .
For example , this article “ Why the anti-filter campaign is failing ” supports this view .
It also raises one point that I personally feel is relevant .
The article suggests that this campaign needs to target “ the mass of reasonably - minded , moderate , everyday Australian voters that are needed to effectively influence the process . ”
This means that having the campaign conducted ONLINE via Facebook , twitter , etc , where it targets supporters already aware of the issues involved , is somewhat wasted ( ie : “ preaching to the converted ” ) .
The funny thing is that the ‘ Stop Internet Censorship ’ website states , as part of their Critical components of a campaign methods , that they should
“ Target the audience that matters [ Do n’t preach to the converted ] ” : ( found here )
As well , these same components state :
“ Offline protests will not form part of any campaign run by Stop Internet Censorship ”
I believe that to have any chance to succeed , the message needs to get offline and into print , radio or television to target the irregular internet users and influence their votes .
And I really WANT the campaign to succeed in every way possible .
But , at present , it comes across as just a big slacktivist group hug , after which everyone who did nothing more than black out their avatar and re-tweet some links & hashtags , will be the first to angrily tweet “ We tried so hard !
How could we have done any more ? ”
Well , the answer is easy and applies to any campaign .
JUST DO MORE .
I would prefer to see those involved in any campaign , not matter what it is , actually trying to do something positive to compliment there online activities .
– Make a donation to the cause they want to support .
– Use all relevant types of media to support it .
– Write a letter to their relevant politician .
– Make a PERMANENT change to their daily activities or way of life , which helps the issue .
– Advise others of actual support mechanisms to help the cause .
– Take part in activites for the cause , which are online AND offline .
Now , do not misunderstand me here .
I believe in the great and powerful beast that is the Internet , and I feel it should be harnessed and used where ever possible to change our lives for the better .
It is far too easy to sit back , click a link and think you have made a difference .
Next time you decide to support a cause , why not take a moment to think about what you are doing and determine if your activities will actually help ?
Decide if you REALLY want to support the cause and effect change .
Or is it all just for show ?

Would n't one of these look great in your backyard ?
Would n't one of these look great in your backyard ?
Millions of people tuned in to watch the Olympic closing ceremonies in Vancouver this past Sunday .
If you were among them , you might have thought , " What a nice tribute to Canada . "
Or , " It 's great to see the athletes of the world come together . "
Or , " I really need one of those giant inflatable beavers . "
If the last of those sentiments applies to you , good news !
According to the Ottawa Citizen , for just five grand , one of those huge rodents can be yours .
It 's an even better deal considering that 's 5,000 Canadian dollars , making it only $ 4,846.88 U.S.
( If you want the 35 - foot - tall moose , it 'll cost you a little bit more . )
Dynamic Displays created the oversized beavers , moose , Mounties and foam hockey players that appeared during the closing ceremonies .
Now the Windsor , Ontario - based company is selling them off at what can only be considered bargain - basement prices .
Especially when you consider that the " G.I.B. " -- as those on the Giant Inflatable Beaver Facebook fan page refer to them -- have amassed nearly 5,000 fans since making their debut on the world stage .
One might think that the next step for a beaver of such global fame would be , say , the Macy 's Thanksgiving Day parade .
Instead , you can set it up in your own backyard .
However , what the story leaves out is that you 'll also have to drop $ 100,000 for a giant inflatable dam .
One of the most common scams on the internet now is phishing .
Phishing is the act of trying to obtain private information ( such a password , credit card number , date of birth , social security number ) while pretending to be a reputable entity .
This is often seen now in spam emails that come in , supposedly from your bank .
The email looks official , and explains that something has changed on your bank account that needs your authorization .
Perhaps it says you have changed your password , and now you just have to confirm it .
For a certain percentage of people the first reaction is , “ Hey , I did n’t change anything … what ’s going on here ? ”
So they click the link that supposedly goes to the bank ’s login page .
Click the image below to see it full size .
If you have an online banking account at Bank of America , you will agree that this looks virtually identical to the genuine BOA website .
The only thing is , when you click on that link in the middle of the page to sign on to your account , you will actually be entering your user name and password on the web page of the scammer .
As soon as you do that , he has access to your bank account (s ) .
It can happen very quickly ; what ’s worse , you may not even realize you have been duped for a while .
This gives the thief time to clean out your account before you even know what is going on .
This same scam is done by using fraudulent websites that look like Paypal , or your eBay account , or any other popular finance - related site .
How do you avoid this ?
Remember this one thing : your bank , or any other reputable institution , will not send you an email asking you for your personally identifiable information .
If you think you have actually received an email from your bank , do n’t click on any links in the email .
Just open up Firefox or IE and manually type in the bank ’s web address .
From there , you can safely log in to your account and see if there are any notifications that require action on your part .
The bad guys are working 24 / 7 to figure out new ways to deceive you and separate you from your money .
Always be aware and verify everything .

Holly Farrell / ABC
It ’s been an unusually tough month for the people who make school lunches .
Sunday , six million people watched a sneak preview of ABC ’s “ Food Revolution , ’’ a reality series in which the British chef Jamie Oliver storms the kitchens of Huntington , W.Va. , to improve the town ’s collective diet .
( The series begins Friday at 8 p.m. )
Mr. Oliver was driven to tears after a humiliating rejection by both pizza - loving students and the women of the lunchroom , or the “ lovely girls ” as he calls them .
The cafeteria workers ended up looking so bad that the national School Nutrition Association followed up with a press release in its defense .
That was n’t the only public thrashing .
Students in Chicago showed up at a Board of Education meeting to demand better food .
A blogger from the Midwest who is spending a year eating and publishing photos of awful - looking food at her school cafeteria caught the attention of national news reporters .
Meanwhile , in Washington , where Michelle Obama ’s anti-obesity campaign continues to point a finger at the school lunch line , a Senate committee on Wednesday cut by more than half President Obama ’s proposal to spend a record $ 10 billion more on child nutrition programs over 10 years , including school food .
Although school food directors and the growing ranks of lunch room reformers are disappointed with the numbers coming out of Washington , people who have been working with the Department of Agriculture and Congress to improve school food say the bill ’s $ 4.5 billion increase is an historic improvement .
“ It ’s critical we get started , ” said Senator Blanche Lincoln , a Democrat from Arkansas , chairwoman of the Senate committee on agriculture and the architect of the bill .
Senator Lincoln said critics need to understand that the legislation proposes the first real increase over inflation that the school food program has had in several decades .
And in the current economic climate , any money is a victory .
“ We ’d all like to do more and we ’re going to try but we ’ve got to get started , ’’ she said .
“ If we just separate and go to our separate fox holes we do n’t get to the end product . ”
The Child Nutrition
Act comes up for financing every five years .
It pays for school food and other nutrition programs for lower - income children .
It ’s also the mechanism legislators can use to change the rules that govern those programs .
The bill headed to the Senate floor would increase by about 6 cents the $ 2.68 that schools can get for each lunch — far less than the $ 1 a lunch increase a coalition of school food reform groups have been campaigning for .
But Margo Wootan , director of nutrition policy for the Center for Science in the Public Interest , an advocacy group , said the bill was still worth supporting .
She has been fighting to improve school nutrition standards for 17 years .
“ This is the strongest child nutrition reauthorization bill I have ever seen , ” she said .
“ We ca n’t go from candy bars to apples in one fell swoop . ”
In addition to the increase in financing , Ms. Wootan and Department of Agriculture staff members said a number of less obvious changes in nutritional rules and financing for special programs will improve what is served in schools as soon as next year .
For example , milk is the biggest single source of saturated fat on the lunch line .
The bill would allow only skim and 1 percent milk to be offered , banning whole and 2 percent .
And schools will be required to make sure children have water with their meals .
At least $ 40 million is available for farm - to - school programs and school gardens .
Another $ 10 million will go toward pilot programs intended to add organic food .
And millions more have been added to train cafeteria staff members .
One of the biggest changes involves food sold in places other than the cafeteria , like vending machines , sporting events and hallway fund - raisers .
The law would give the Department of Agriculture power to set limits on nutrients like sodium and fat in all food sold on campus as well as setting limits on the number of bake sales and other food - based fundraisers .
“ We want to make sure there ’s consistency , ” Senator Blanchard said in an interview .
“ This is not only about providing nutritional food for our children but teaching them good life skills and what the right choices are . ”
If Congress acts before the summer break , some of the nutritional changes could make lunch better as soon as next fall .
The Department of Agriculture is also overhauling all school nutritional guidelines in an effort that is separate from the Child Nutrition Act but is intended to work in concert with the changes it will bring about .
The new meal standards , which have n’t been updated for 15 years , are being written by Agriculture Department staff now .
Based on a report from the Institutes of Medicine , they will require more fruits , vegetables and whole grains and — for the first time in the national school food program ’s history — limit the amount of calories in each meal .
“ Look at the regulations now , ” said Renee Hanks , food service director for the South Colonie School District in Albany .
“ The U.S.D.A. requires so many carbohydrates that we ’re throwing whole wheat bread at them .
We ’re throwing extra crackers at them .
If they are n’t out and active they ca n’t handle all those calories . ”
But , she warned , adding new requirements for more expensive foods like fresh fruit had better come with more money .
Changes to the bureaucratic process might free up some money in school budgets , analysts said .
For example , the amount of paperwork needed to assure certain lower - income children qualify for a free lunch will be reduced , and the cost of a meal for children who pay full price will probably increase .
Extra training money already included in the proposed legislation should also help school kitchens operate more efficiently .
But whether more money will be added before the final bill is approved is in question .
Officials at the Agriculture Department and various advocacy groups are n’t hopeful .
Even if more money for the bill does appear , it will likely go toward the parts of the act that pay for hunger programs , not school lunch .
That does n’t mean the conversation is necessarily over , said Rochelle Davis , founding executive director of the Healthy Schools Campaign , a national nonprofit organization that advocates for healthy school food .
All the new nutritional requirements mean nothing if school districts cannot pay for them .
Accepting the small increase in school food financing and calling it a victory lets Congress off the hook , she said .
“ Look at the agony our country is going through over health care and the struggle to handle a sick nation , ” she said .
“ We just have to connect the dots and get people eating right and get people moving .
Healthy school food is a logical part of that . ”
An earlier version of this post referred incorrectly to the varieties of milk that would be allowed in school cafeterias under legislation in the Senate .
Skim and 1 percent milk would be available , not just skim milk .
There is one question that no one who denies manmade climate change wants to answer : what would it take to persuade you ?
In most cases the answer seems to be nothing .
No level of evidence can shake the growing belief that climate science is a giant conspiracy codded up by boffins and governments to tax and control us .
The new study by the Met Office , which paints an even grimmer picture than the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , will do nothing to change this view .
The attack on climate scientists is now widening to an all - out war on science .
Writing recently for the Telegraph , the columnist Gerald Warner dismissed scientists as " white - coated prima donnas and narcissists … pointy - heads in lab coats [ who ] have reassumed the role of mad cranks …
The public is no longer in awe of scientists .
Like squabbling evangelical churches in the 19th century , they can form as many schismatic sects as they like , nobody is listening to them any more . "
Views like this can be explained partly as the revenge of the humanities students .
There is scarcely an editor or executive in any major media company – and precious few journalists – with a science degree , yet everyone knows that the anoraks are taking over the world .
But the problem is compounded by complexity .
Arthur C Clarke remarked that " any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic " .
He might have added that any sufficiently advanced expertise is indistinguishable from gobbledegook .
Scientific specialisation is now so extreme that even people studying neighbouring subjects within the same discipline can no longer understand each other .
The detail of modern science is incomprehensible to almost everyone , which means that we have to take what scientists say on trust .
Yet science tells us to trust nothing , to believe only what can be demonstrated .
This contradiction is fatal to public confidence .
Distrust has been multiplied by the publishers of scientific journals , whose monopolistic practices make the supermarkets look like angels , and which are long overdue for a referral to the Competition Commission .
They pay nothing for most of the material they publish , yet , unless you are attached to an academic institute , they 'll charge you £ 20 or more for access to a single article .
In some cases they charge libraries tens of thousands for an annual subscription .
If scientists want people at least to try to understand their work , they should raise a full - scale revolt against the journals that publish them .
It is no longer acceptable for the guardians of knowledge to behave like 19th - century gamekeepers , chasing the proles out of the grand estates .
But there 's a deeper suspicion here as well .
Popular mythology – from Faust through Frankenstein to Dr No – casts scientists as sinister schemers , harnessing the dark arts to further their diabolical powers .
Sometimes this is n't far from the truth .
Some use their genius to weaponise anthrax for the US and Russian governments .
Some isolate terminator genes for biotech companies , to prevent farmers from saving their own seed .
Some lend their names to articles ghostwritten by pharmaceutical companies , which mislead doctors about the drugs they sell .
Until there is a global code of practice or a Hippocratic oath binding scientists to do no harm , the reputation of science will be dragged through the dirt by researchers who devise new means of hurting us .
Yesterday in the Guardian Peter Preston called for a prophet to lead us out of the wilderness .
" We need one passionate , persuasive scientist who can connect and convince …
We need to be taught to believe by a true believer . "
Would it work ?
No . Look at the hatred and derision the passionate and persuasive Al Gore attracts .
The problem is not only that most climate scientists can speak no recognisable human language , but also the expectation that people are amenable to persuasion .
In 2008 the Washington Post summarised recent psychological research on misinformation .
This shows that in some cases debunking a false story can increase the number of people who believe it .
In one study , 34 % of conservatives who were told about the Bush government 's claims that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction were inclined to believe them .
But among those who were shown that the government 's claims were later comprehensively refuted by the Duelfer report , 64 % ended up believing that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction .
There 's a possible explanation in an article published by Nature in January .
It shows that people tend to " take their cue about what they should feel , and hence believe , from the cheers and boos of the home crowd " .
Those who see themselves as individualists and those who respect authority , for instance , " tend to dismiss evidence of environmental risks , because the widespread acceptance of such evidence would lead to restrictions on commerce and industry , activities they admire " .
Those with more egalitarian values are " more inclined to believe that such activities pose unacceptable risks and should be restricted " .
These divisions , researchers have found , are better at explaining different responses to information than any other factor .
Our ideological filters encourage us to interpret new evidence in ways that reinforce our beliefs .
" As a result , groups with opposing values often become more polarised , not less , when exposed to scientifically sound information . "
The conservatives in the Iraq experiment might have reacted against something they associated with the Duelfer report , rather than the information it contained .
While this analysis rings true , the description of where the dividing line lies is n't quite right .
It does n't describe the odd position in which I find myself .
Despite my iconoclastic , anti-corporate instincts , I spend much of my time defending the scientific establishment from attacks by the kind of rabble - rousers with whom I usually associate .
My heart rebels against this project : I would rather be pelting scientists with eggs than trying to understand their datasets .
But my beliefs oblige me to try to make sense of the science and to explain its implications .
This turns out to be the most divisive project I 've ever engaged in .
The more I stick to the facts , the more virulent the abuse becomes .
This does n't bother me – I have a hide like a glyptodon – but it reinforces the disturbing possibility that nothing works .
The research discussed in the Nature paper shows that when scientists dress soberly , shave off their beards and give their papers conservative titles , they can reach to the other side .
But in doing so they will surely alienate people who would otherwise be inclined to trust them .
As the MMR saga shows , people who mistrust authority are just as likely to kick against science as those who respect it .
Perhaps we have to accept that there is no simple solution to public disbelief in science .
The battle over climate change suggests that the more clearly you spell the problem out , the more you turn people away .
If they do n't want to know , nothing and no one will reach them .
There goes my life 's work .
Here ’s a very brief piece I bashed out for the Guardian newsdesk today on the Wakefield finding , the further reading below will be more helpful if you ’re interested in the story .
Ben Goldacre , The Guardian , Thursday 28 January 2009
In medicine , “ untoward incident inquiries ” tend to look for systems failures , rather than one individual to blame .
It ’s certainly clear that Andrew Wakefield and his co-defendants failed to meet the high standards required of doctors in research .
The GMC have found he was “ misleading ” “ dishonest ” and “ irresponsible ” in the way he described where the children in the 1998 paper came from , by implying that they were routine clinic referrals .
As the GMC have also found , these children were subjected to a programme of unpleasant and invasive tests which were not performed in their own clinical interest , but rather for research purposes , and these tests were conducted without ethics committee approval .
These tests were hardly trivial : they included colonoscopy , where the child is sedated , and a long tube with a camera and a light passed through the anus and deep into the bowell ; lumbar puncture , where a needle is placed into the spine to get cerebrospinal fluid ; barium meals and more .
It ’s plainly undesirable for doctors to go around conducting tests like these on children for their own research interests without very careful external scrutiny .
But there is the wider context : Wakefield was at the centre of a media storm about the MMR vaccine , and is now being blamed by journalists as if he were the only one at fault .
In reality , the media are equally guilty .
Even if it had been immaculately well conducted – and it certainly was n’t – Wakefield ’s “ case series report ” of 12 children ’s clinical anecdotes would never have justified the conclusion that MMR causes autism , despite what journalists claimed : it simply did n’t have big enough numbers to do so .
But the media repeatedly reported the concerns of this one man , generally without giving methodological details of the research , either because they found it too complicated , inexplicably , or because to do so would have undermined their story .
As the years passed by , media coverage deteriorated further .
Claims by researchers who never published scientific papers to back up their claims were reported in the newspapers as important new scientific breakthroughs , while at the very same time , evidence showing no link between MMR and autism , fully published in peer reviewed academic journals , was simply ignored .
This was cynical , and unforgivable .
Then , after Tony Blair refused to say if his son had received the vaccine , the commentators rolled in .
Experts from Carol Vorderman to Fiona Philips from GMTV have all shared their concerns about MMR with the nation .
Less than a third of all broadsheet reports on MMR in 2002 mentioned that the overwhelming evidence showed no link between MMR and autism .
The MMR scare has now petered out .
It would be nice if we could say this was because the media had learnt their lessons , and recognised the importance of scientific evidence , rather than one bloke ’s hunch .
Instead it has terminated because of the behaviour of one man , Andrew Wakefield , which undermined the emotional narrative of their story .
The media have developed no insight into their own role , and for this reason , there will be another MMR .

The Cardiff ESRC report is good ( and I do n’t want to incite copyright theft or anything , but for god ’s sake , someone put it on Scribd , this is good publicly funded research , but Cardiff and ESRC change their web address for it every five minutes , I do n’t think they really understand how the internet works ) :

Lastly , I recommend reading the GMC ’s findings for yourself , if you ’re interested in this stuff , as the details of what they got up to , the ethics committee dodginess , and the mis-statements around who the children were , is pretty bad .
The document annoyingly has n’t appeared on the GMC website – even though this is a massive news story today – but someone has resourcefully uploaded it for free public access here :

Advertisement Odeon has reversed its decision to boycott Tim Burton 's new 3D film version of Alice in Wonderland following talks with Disney .
The cinema chain had vowed not to show the film in the UK , Irish Republic and Italy over Disney 's plans to release the film on DVD at the end of May .
Actor Michael Sheen , who plays the White Rabbit , said the row had been " a storm in a mad hatter 's tea cup " .
" I 'm glad they 've resolved it , " he told the BBC .
Earlier , Burton had called Odeon 's decision not to screen the film as " upsetting " .
It was nonsense .
It did n't make any sense
Helena Bonham Carter on the row " I feel terrible about it , " the director told the BBC's Breakfast programme .
" To me it does n't make anybody look good . "
Burton added that he hoped " something is going to be worked out " , but had not been involved in talks , which are understood to have lasted late into Wednesday night .
His partner , Helena Bonham Carter , who stars as the Red Queen in the film , was more forthright .
" It was embarrassing and awful , " she said , adding that her children had been without their father " for the last nine months " because of the demands of making a 3D film .
" Then just to be told , ' we 're not going to show it in 3D ' , it felt like being in Wonderland .
It was nonsense .
It did n't make any sense . "
" It was not a happy household for the last few weeks , I can tell you that . "
' New benchmark '
Odeon made its original decision in response to Disney 's plan to reduce the period between a film 's debut and its DVD release from the standard 17 weeks .
The cinema chain said the plan would " set a new benchmark , leading to a 12 - week window becoming rapidly standard " .
In a statement following talks with Disney , Odeon said : " The Odeon and UCI Cinema Group is pleased to announce that , following detailed negotiations with the Walt Disney Company Ltd , an enduring agreement has been reached encompassing all the different aspects of both companies ' commercial relationship .
Please turn on JavaScript .

" As a result of this agreement , Odeon is pleased to confirm that it will be able to continue with its plans for significant investment in new cinemas , in digital technology , in 3D capability and the other exciting developments designed for the increased enjoyment of all its customers . "
Neither side would disclose terms of the agreement , but the Cineworld and Vue cinema chains , which will also be screening the film , had previously agreed to a 13 - week gap between opening night and the DVD release .
Mia Wasikowska , who plays
Alice in the film , said the cast had been " aware " of the dispute , but " let the studio handle it " .
" I 'm glad that it 's over , " she added .
Burton , Bonham Carter , and Johnny Depp , who stars as the Mad Hatter , all attended the premiere on Thursday at London 's Odeon Leicester Square .

Because we really probably should post it even though no - one has the time to take it properly to task .
I suspect we ’d have said something similar to The Sixth Axis ’ Open letter to ITV .
You have to feel for C&VG ’s Tim Ingham , who even by appearing on the show is pretty damn brave .
Putting aside the research seemingly pulled from thin air , the latter - day attempt to link the Bulger killing to videogames is openly disgraceful .
Watch and despair .
UPDATE : C&VG
Uncover some interesting stuff about the vehemently anti-violent entertainment Julie Peasgood .
She voice - acted in the old , terrible game Martian Gothic .
The word you ’re looking for is “ Hypocrite ” .
It does n’t mean that she ’s particularly judgmental of large , African water - dwelling mammals .
As the Sixth Axis note , if you want to compose a polite complaint to ITV , here ’s their contact details .
I stress , polite .
The latest ratings are again horrible for CNN , so bad , in fact that the network has fallen behind CNBC ( which is also struggling ) in terms of news network ratings .
In an interview with TV Guide , CNN President Jon Klein argued that the network was in a fine position because unlike rivals , CNN was sticking to straight , hard news , and that that was proving to be move valuable than the slanted entertainment of the network 's rivals .
Said a Fox News spokesperson in response :
We do n’t respond to presidents of fifth - place news networks .
The last time we looked , Jon was losing to the Weather Channel , so call us back when he and CNN regain relevancy . ”

Over the past couple of years I ’ve become a big proponent of creating secondary sources of income for your family – finding things that you can do in your spare time to make money to pad your bottom line .
If you ’re trying to get out of debt , or trying to fully fund your retirement , it makes it a lot easier if you have more than just your day job income .
Since I think that making extra money is such a great idea , I decided to take a whole week to talk about ways to create extra income .
I ’ve asked the staff writers on the site to write posts this week talking about ways that they would suggest to make extra money .
Some of the ideas may overlap , but by the end of the week I hope that we ’ll have given you an extra 25 - 30 ideas of ways to make a bit extra for your family every month .
So , without further ado , here are 11 ways that I have used , or plan on using to make extra money for my family .
11 Ways To Make Extra Money
1. Start A Money Making Blog :
Of course this first idea is the one that I ’ve used most successfully , creating almost $ 40,000 in extra income for my family last year through this blog .
I was able to find a high paying niche ( personal finance ) , write about topics that convert well into paying Adsense ad clicks , and over two years I was able to produce enough content to consistently bring in decent traffic .
You can do the same thing , I ’ve detailed how I did it in my e-book that I launched last week called “ Blueprint For How To Make Money With A Blog “ .
2. Turn A Hobby Into Extra Income :
My logo design website was another large source of income for our family last year .
I started doing design work through my day job , enjoyed it , and started doing it as a hobby at home as well .
Then I started doing a few logos here and there for friends .
Only then did I realize that I could charge others to create the graphics for their sites .
It snowballed from there to where it is now – creating almost enough money to pay my mortgage every month .
Take a hobby that you ’re good at , and turn it into an income producing asset !
3. Buy Things Cheap , Resell Online : A lot of times you can find items at your local thrift store , or at garage sales at a bargain price .
Things like vintage dishware , brand name clothing , antiques and more can be found for a steal and resold via ebay , craigslist or other online classifieds .
While you ’re at it you can also sell things around your house that you no longer need !
4. Tutoring :
If you ’re a born teacher you can make some money on the side by teaching at a local tutoring center , or tutoring kids for families that you know .
5 . Do Stock Photography :
This is n’t for everyone , but for the artistic minded who already have a nice camera , you can make extra money by selling stock photography .
Making money this way is n’t easy , and you ’ll need to be taking some pictures specifically to be used as stock photos .
Once you ’ve built up a large enough portfolio it can be turned into a nice income stream .
Check out sites like “ Improve Photography ” to read stories of others who are doing the same .
6. Participate On “ Get Paid To ” Sites : Use offers sites and apps like Drop , Rakuten and Swag Bucks to make a little bit extra in your free time .
Purchase things you were going to buy anyway through GPT sites , and refer other users to the services .
I make about $ 100 extra every month through these services .
7. Write An E-book On A Topic You ’re Familiar With :
If you ’re extremely versed on a certain topic try writing an e-book for others who want to learn about that topic .
Last week I launched my first e-book talking about how I make money with my blog .
My good friend Craig Ford over at MoneyHelpForChristians.com just released an e-book today that gives all the nitty gritty details you need to know for people who hope to go on a short term missions trip .
Find a topic you know a lot about , and write an e-book about it !
8. Get A Part Time Job :
If you ’re trying to pay of your debts or fund a particular savings goal , you might think about getting a part time job for a while .
Work at a local coffee shop , at your local retail store or delivering pizza !
You do n’t have to do it forever , but do it for a while !
9. Start A Side Business To Fill A Need : I ’ve had several friends who have seen a need in their area , and started side businesses to fill that need and make a bit of extra cash .
One friend is a teacher and he started a lawn mowing business in the summer since he had the summers off .
Another friend realized that a lot of homes in his neighborhood had dog waste in their yards , so he started a business picking up dog doo and charging a fee .
You ’re only limited by your creativity !
10 . Sell Your Blood Or Other Specimens : Selling your body fluids can result in a bit of extra cash every month .
Depending on what you ’re selling it can result in $ 20 - 30 to hundreds of dollars .
11 . Be A Freelance Writer :
You can write for your own blog , but often people will pay you to write for their blogs as well .
Get freelance writing gigs and make some extra cash .
How much you earn will depend on your experience , how well you write , and how much you write .
In addition to writing for other sites , write content for sites like Associated Content , Quora or Hubpages .
The Extra Money Series Continues
Stay tuned – for the rest of the week we ’ll be posting on ways to make extra income for your family .
Tomorrow we continue the “ Ways To Make Extra Money ” series with a post from Craig Ford .
Do you have ways that you make extra money for your family ?
Tell us about it in the comments !
Ever prodded at an injury despite the fact you know it will hurt ?
Ever cook an incredibly spicy dish even though you know your digestive tract will suffer for it ?
If the answers are yes , you ’re not alone .
Pain is ostensibly a negative thing but we ’re often drawn to it .
Why ?
According to Marta Andreatta from the University of Wurzburg , it ’s a question of timing .
After we experience pain , the lack of it is a relief .
Andreatta thinks that if something happens during this pleasurable window immediately after a burst of pain , we come to associate it with the positive experience of pain relief rather than the negative feeling of the pain itself .
The catch is that we do n’t realise this has happened .
We believe that the event , which occurred so closely to a flash of pain , must be a negative one .
But our reflexes betray us .
Andreatta ’s work builds on previous research with flies and mice .
If flies smell a distinctive aroma just before feeling an electric shock , they ’ll learn to avoid that smell .
However , if the smell is released immediately after the shock , they ’re actually drawn to it .
Rather than danger , the smell was linked with safety .
The same trick works in mice .
But what about humans ?
To find out , Andreatta recruited 101 volunteers and split them into three groups , all of whom saw coloured shapes .
The first group received a moderately painful electric shock six seconds before the shapes flashed up .
The second group were shocked eight seconds after the shapes appeared and the third group were shocked fourteen seconds afterwards .
This last time gap should have been long enough to stop the recruits from forming a link between shock and shape .
Later , everyone saw the shapes without any accompanying shocks .
When asked to rate their feelings , most people felt negatively towards the shapes , particularly those who had been shocked just afterwards .
That seems fairly predictable , but Andreatta wanted to find out what they really thought .
To do that , she flashed the shapes up again , paired them with a loud burst of noise , and measured how strongly they blinked in response .
This is called the startle reflex ; it ’s an automatic response to fear or danger , and it ’s very hard to fake .
The strength of the blink reflects how fearful the recruits were feeling .
Sure enough , those who saw the shapes before they were electrocuted showed a stronger startle reflex than usual .
To them , the images meant that something bad was about to happen so when the noise went off , they reacted particularly strongly .
But the recruits who were shocked before the shapes appeared actually showed a weaker startle reflex .
It seems that despite their ratings , the lesson they had taken away was that the presence of the shapes was a positive omen .
Other studies have found that rewarding experiences can soothe the startle reflex – in flies , a sugary liquid works and in humans , news of a monetary windfall will do the trick .
Andreatta thinks that some of her volunteers behaved in the same way because they had come to associate the coloured shapes with the rewarding feeling of pain relief .
For the moment , despite my introductory paragraph , it ’s not immediately obvious how this relates to our daily lives .
Andreatta suggests that the pleasant after - effects of otherwise scary or painful affairs might explain why we ’re so drawn to dangerous or terrifying pursuits like rollercoaster rides or bungee jumping .
More importantly , it could affect the way we think about mental disorders like addiction or anxiety .

SEOUL , South Korea ( AP )  North Korea 's military threatened South Korea and the United States on Friday with " unprecedented nuclear strikes " as it expressed anger over a report the two countries plan to prepare for possible instability in the totalitarian country , a scenario it dismissed as a " pipe dream . "
The North routinely issues such warnings .
Diplomats in South Korea and the U.S. have repeatedly called on Pyongyang to return to international negotiations aimed at ending its nuclear programs .
" Those who seek to bring down the system in the ( North ) , whether they play a main role or a passive role , will fall victim to the unprecedented nuclear strikes of the invincible army , " North Korea 's military said in comments carried by the official Korean Central News Agency .
The North , believed have enough weaponized plutonium for at least half a dozen atomic bombs , conducted its second atomic test last year , drawing tighter U.N. sanctions .
Experts from South Korea , the U.S. and China will meet in China next month to share information on North Korea , assess possible contingencies in the country , and consider ways to cooperate in case of an emergency situation , South Korea 's Dong -a Ilbo newspaper reported earlier this month , citing unidentified sources in Seoul and Beijing .
The experts will also hold follow - up meetings in Seoul in June and in Honolulu in July , it said .
The North Korean statement Friday specifically referred to the March 19 newspaper report .
A spokeswoman said the South Korean Defense Ministry had no information .
Gen. Walter Sharp , the top U.S. commander in South Korea , says the possibility of turmoil in the North is of real concern , citing the country 's economic weakness , malnourishment in both the military and general population , and its nuclear weapons .
" The possibility of a sudden leadership change in the North could be destabilizing and unpredictable , " he said in testimony before the House Appropriations Committee hearing earlier this week .
South Korean media have reported that Seoul has drawn up a military operations plan with the United States to cope with possible emergencies in the North .
The North says the U.S. is plotting to topple its regime , a claim Washington has consistently denied .
Last month , the North also threatened a " powerful — even nuclear — attack , " if the U.S. and South Korea went ahead with annual military drills .
There was no military provocation from North Korea during the exercises .
China , Japan , Russia , South Korea and the U.S. have been trying to persuade North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons in six party talks .
The North quit the negotiations last year .
The fate of the North 's nuclear weapons has taken on added urgency since late 2008 as concerns over the health of leader Kim Jong
Il have intensified .
Kim , who suffered an apparent stroke in 2008 , may die within three years , South Korean media have reported .
His death is thought to have the potential to trigger instability and a power struggle in the North .

Sony has announced their annual batch of digital discounts on the Playstation Network throughout the spring season will continue this year , beginning with Gravity Crash ( PS3 ) and Everyday Shooter ( PS3 or PSP ) , both 50 % off through the next week .
The two titles are available now for just $ 4.99 ( down from $ 9.99 ) via the PSN .
Each week , new discounts on games , bundles , and other DLC from PS3 and PSP products will be offered up .
On top of that , each purchase will net buyers a voucher for one of five special avatar costume pieces for use in PS Home .
Although the Male avatars costume has been described as a “ stylish bee outfit ” , a phrase I ’ve never knew could exist prior to today .
South Australia 's south - east is one step closer to becoming the birthplace of clean , geothermal power in Australia after the official opening of the Salamander - 1 geothermal well in the Otway Basin near Penola .
The federal Minister for Resources , Energy and Tourism , Martin Ferguson , unveiled a plaque commemorating the pioneering status of the well on Friday .
He says it will test the potential of the region for geothermal development , with expectations that up to 1,500 megawatts could be available .
" The central importance of this project is that it is not only potentially base load power , it 's also in such close proximity to the grid , which also reduces the cost of actually putting it into the energy system of Australia , " Mr Ferguson said .
" So I simply say that the potential breakthrough here in the next 18 months is so important . "
Panax Geothermal 's managing director , Dr Bertus De Graaf , says the Salamander - 1 drilling rig continues to meet all expectations and is on schedule to meet its March target depth of 4,000 metres .
He says testing will then take place to determine the quality of the resource .
" The tests comprise a number of short flow tests as well as injection tests , " Dr De Graaf said .
" The combination of that flow in the well and injecting the well , with certain measurements you make on the pressures or whatever , eventually is going to determine the quality of the reservoir . "

The recent Marine operations in and near Marja brought into sharp relief a fact that contradicts much of what people think they know about the Afghan war .
It is this : Forget the fables .
The current ranks of Afghan fighters are crowded with poor marksmen .
This simple statement is at odds with an oft - repeated legend of modern conflict , in which Afghan men are described , in clichés and accounts from yesteryear , as natural gunmen and accomplished shots .
Everyone who has even faintly followed the history of war in Central Asia has heard the tales of Afghan men whose familiarity with firearms is such a part of their life experience that they can pick up most any weapon and immediately put it to effective work .
The most exaggerated accounts are cartoonish , including tales of Afghan riflemen whose bullets can strike a lone sapling ( I ’ve even heard “ blade of grass ” ) a hilltop away .
Without getting into an argument with the ghost of Rudyard Kipling , who was one of the early voices popularizing the wonders of Afghan riflery , an update is in order .
This is because the sum of these descriptions does not match what is commonly observed in firefights today .
These days , the opposite is more often the case .
Poor marksmanship , even abysmally poor marksmanship , is a consistent trait among Afghan men .
The description applies to Taliban and Afghan government units alike .
Over the years that Tyler Hicks and I have worked in Afghanistan ’s remote and hostile corners , we have been alongside Afghan , American and European infantrymen in many firefights and ambushes .
These fights have involved a wide set of tactical circumstances , ranges , elevations , and light and weather conditions .
Some skirmishes were brief and simple .
Others were long and complex , involving as many as a few hundred fighters on both sides .
One result has been consistent .
We have almost always observed that a large proportion of Afghan fire , both incoming and outgoing , is undisciplined and errant , often wildly so .
Afghans , like most anyone else with a modicum of exposure to infantry weapons , might be able to figure out how to make any firearm fire .
But hitting what they are aiming at , assuming they are aiming at all ?
That ’s another matter .
There are exceptions .
The Taliban snipers in Marja were one recent example .
We will revisit them here soon .
Now and then a disciplined Afghan soldier or police officer also bucks the trend .
Credible accounts of Northern Alliance fighters in the 1990s and early 2000s chronicled impressive shooting skills among seasoned Panjshiris .
But the larger pattern is firmly established and consistent with the experience and observations of countless soldiers and Marines we have passed time with , including many people who have trained and fought beside Afghan security forces during the past decade .
Today At War will share a few observations about inaccurate Taliban rifle fire .
Naturally , this will deal with what can be assessed of incoming fire ; we do not embed with Taliban units and thus we have no chance of an unfiltered side - by - side look at their marksmanship habits .
( Watching videos that the Taliban and their sympathizers post on the Internet or circulate in bazaars has its limits ; these are self - selected excerpts chosen in part to show Taliban prowess .
Taking them at face value would be much like trying to measure the American Army ’s performance in the field by watching a recruiting ad , or like sitting through some of the cheery PowerPoint presentations that officials in capitals serve up for visitors . )
The next post in the series will discuss several factors that contribute to poor Taliban marksmanship .
A post soon thereafter will address the shooting skills and habits of Afghan soldiers and police officers .
That third post will cover more fully what can be seen of outgoing fire , accounts that are possible because Afghan government shooting is readily observable , at least for those who log enough weeks in rural firebases or on patrol .
Let ’s start with a few rough numbers .
During the month and a half we spent in Helmand Province , Tyler and I combined firsthand observations with queries to officers commanding Marine rifle companies we worked beside .
Three of these companies had been engaged in what , by the standards of the Afghan war , was heavy fighting .
Here is what their experiences turned up .
Before the full offensive into Marja began , the Marine ground unit engaged in the most regular fighting with the area ’s Taliban was Bravo Company , First Battalion , Third Marines .
The company served for a little more than two months on what Marines call the “ forward line of troops . ”
In this capacity , it rotated platoons through positions several miles to Marja ’s east , a pair of lonely outposts on the steppe overlooking Route Olympia , which was the road leading into Taliban turf .
The Taliban had an interest in watching for American movement along this road , and the Marines patrolled constantly near it .
Thus the tactical climate was violent and busy .
The insurgents harassed the outposts and frequently skirmished with Marine patrols .
In this contest , the Taliban also had the sort of local advantages common in guerrilla war .
They knew the network of irrigation canals and used them as trench lines .
They littered the fields and small terrain features with hidden bombs rigged to pressure plates .
They deployed spotters with radios on motorcycle patrols , which tried to find the Marines and relay word of their movements and activities .
They also chose when to fight , and often opened fire on the Marines in the late afternoon , when the sun was low in the sky .
Why ?
Because Marine patrols originated to the Taliban ’s east , and as the Marines walked generally westward across the flat steppe toward the area where the Taliban hid , the Marines were walking into the angled sunlight , which illuminated them perfectly for the Taliban , but forced the Marines to look into hard light , and squint .
This was an environment in which small - arms clashes were almost inevitable , and in which the Taliban would often get to fire the opening shots .
It should have been a place where the Taliban might succeed .
What did the numbers show ?
By early February , when Marine units began massing for the push on Marja , Capt .
Thomas Grace , Bravo Company ’s commander , estimated that his platoons had been in at least two dozen firefights , often in open terrain .
Some of the fights lasted several hours .
At least one lasted a full day and into the night .
How many of the company ’s Marines and the Afghan soldiers who accompanied them had been shot ?
Zero .
Farther west along Route Olympia is an intersection known as Five Points , so named because several dirt roads meet there .
The juncture provides access to northern Marja .
Marine Expeditionary Brigade - Afghanistan , the command that planned the attack on Marja , deemed this essential terrain for securing the region .
In January , another unit — Charlie Company , First Battalion , Third Marines — was assigned to fly in by helicopter and seize and hold the intersection .
This happened in February , a few days before the larger assault began .
It prompted a determined Taliban response .
Once the Taliban realized the Marines had leapt by air over their outer defenses , they clustered near Five Points and fought Charlie Company intensely , especially in the first few days .
During this time , according to the company commander , Capt .
Stephan P. Karabin II , his Marines were in about 15 firefights .
Again the Taliban had certain advantages .
They knew the ground well enough that their fighters stashed small motorcycles in canals that had been drained .
After ambushing the Marines , they sometimes dropped into a dry canal , ran through the maze , jumped on their bikes , started the engines and blasted away at speeds that no one pursuing on foot could hope to match .
Smart tactics .
But the Taliban did not always run .
They often held their ground and fought , perhaps feeling protected by the canals that did contain water , which typically separated them from the Marine patrols they chose to fire upon .
To change the character of the fighting , Captain Karabin ordered his Marines to patrol on foot with their .50 - caliber machine guns .
These would be lugged along in pieces , and when a firefight began , the Marines assigned to them would put them together , mount the weapons on their tripods , load belts of ammunition and open fire .
( A M2 Browning machine gun and tripod weighs nearly 130 pounds ; this does not include the weight of the ammunition . )
The heavy guns tilted the fighting more fully in the Marines ’ favor .
But the fact that M2s were used this way said something about how the Taliban fought ; some of this fighting was pitched .
How many of Charlie Company ’s Marines were struck by Taliban bullets in these engagements ?
Once again , none .
Neither of these companies was spared casualties .
Four separate bomb blasts killed two Marines from Bravo Company and wounded nine Marines from Charlie Company .
But the Taliban ’s rifles were another story .
Together the two companies were in about 40 firefights against the main guerrilla force in a nation that is considered , by the conventional wisdom , to be a land of born marksmen .
And not a single bullet fired by the Taliban found its mark .
Obviously , American and Afghan soldiers do get shot , which brings us to the third Marine company , which suffered the effects of more accurate fire .
As Charlie Company was fighting at Five Points , Kilo Company , Third Battalion , Sixth Marines , was inserted at night by helicopter into three landing zones in northern Marja , where it was soon met by what may have been the stiffest Taliban resistance of the offensive .
For nearly 10 days , Kilo Company was engaged in small - arms fighting .
In the first four or five days , the fighting was widespread , often with several firefights occurring simultaneously as different patrols and different platoons on different missions were locked up in skirmishes at once .
On the second day of fighting , one skirmish alone , between two platoons and large groups of Taliban fighters , lasted off and on from early morning until night .
Within a week or 10 days , eight of the company ’s Marines had been shot , two fatally , and two Afghan soldiers had been shot as well , including one who died .
This is a large number compared with the experiences of the other two companies , but it is a small number when set against Kilo Company ’s size , and when considered in the context and the volume of Taliban fire .
First , about the size .
In all , Kilo Company had on the order of 300 men assigned to it , including engineers , dog handlers , bomb disposal and intelligence specialists , interpreters and an Afghan infantry platoon .
( Note : Embed rules forbid precise descriptions of unit and team sizes , so the numbers of the various units that made up Kilo Company on this mission are mashed together here and rounded . )
Now the context .
On many days , Kilo Company ’s patrols would be ambushed while crossing flat , open ground , with no vegetation concealing the Marines ’ movements and no place to take cover without running a couple of hundred yards or more .
Often many Taliban gunmen would open fire simultaneously , and a large number of rounds would fly into the area where the patrol walked .
Rounds would snap and buzz past helmets .
Rounds would thump all around in the dirt .
But usually no one would be struck .
It happened again and again .
When Marines did get hit , it often appeared that the fire came from PK machine guns or the local contingent of snipers – not the riflemen who make the Taliban ’s rank - and - file .
One day , after a few hours of fighting in which the Taliban had not yet hit any Marines , a corporal from Second Platoon stood upright , exposing himself above the waist and looking over a wall as bullets flew high overhead .
He did n’t flinch .
“ What ’s everybody ducking for ? ” he said .
He cupped his hand to his mouth and shouted an expletive - laden taunt at the Taliban gunmen shooting from concealment on the opposite side of a field .
The editors would never allow the corporal ’s words to be printed here .
But they amounted to this :
You guys ca n’t shoot .
Yes , some of this was probably adrenaline and undiluted cockiness , the kind of behavior that Marines can thrive on .
But this cockiness was not just attitude .
It reflected a discernible truth .
Much of the incoming fire was not coming close .
( Later in that same fight , some of the fire did come close , as at least one sniper arrived on the Taliban side ; we ’ll show video of that soon ) .
But at this point in the battle , any number of adjectives might be applied to the Taliban fighters on the far side of the open ground .
They were resourceful , organized , clever , brave .
In the main , however , they could not shoot .
For those of you who have served in Afghanistan , or been exposed to gunfighting there via other jobs , your input would be welcome .
One of the company commanders shared his insights in an interview soon after the fighting at Marja tapered off .
In the annals of the Afghan war , Afghans are supposedly crack shots , some of the best marksmen on earth .
Captain Karabin , a veteran of the war in Iraq , summed up neatly a rifle company ’s experience that pointed otherwise .
“ I used to say in Iraq that I ’m only alive because Iraqis are such bad shots , ” he said .
“ And now I ’ll say it in Afghanistan .
I ’m only alive because the Afghans are also such bad shots . ”
Important ourTunes info :
If ourTunes can see hosts , but the connection status says " Failed " , this is most likely because of the iTunes 7 .
Apple changed the authentication protocol used to connect to iTunes , so that ourTunes no longer works .
We 're working on this now , and hope to have a fix soon .
If ourTunes does n't see any hosts , make sure you 're not on a wireless network , that seems to give it some trouble .
If that does n't fix it , we 're sorry , we 're working on it .
You need to be on a network with other people who have iTunes sharing turned on for ourTunes to be at all useful
The search box is not enabled unless ourTunes sees at least one host
As for updates ... we 're swamped with work this quarter and probably wo n't be updating OT until mid-december ... this means passworded hosts are on hold for now ..
We 're also going to be really bad about responding to emails .. sorry , sorry
about responding to emails .. sorry , sorry
If you want to look at the ourTunes source , download the .jar and unzip it , either with the " jar " program that comes bundled with java , or rename it to a .zip and just use a standard unzip program .
All the source files are in there .
If you like it -- give us beer money , we 're broke college students
ourTunes has now hit over 3,000,000 downloads -- woo !
If you like it -- give us beer money , we 're broke college students if something 's broken , you can email us ( We 're going to be really bad about responding , though )
