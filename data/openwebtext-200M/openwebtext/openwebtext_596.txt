SmashingApps and Poverty posters ?
I know you are surprised to see this but let me tell you the reason behind this .
a few days ago , I got a chance to visit and explore Blog Action Day website and it was really inspiring for me that as a blogger I should help them to spread the word about their mission .
I found the way that if I write a post about poverty in a way that my visitors will not get bored as well and I will also get success to convey their message to the millions of visitors coming to Smashing Apps .
I really like this statement on Blog Action Day website
“ the blogging community effectively changes the conversation on the web and focuses audiences around the globe on that issue ”
Tip :
You can make sure everything you type is clear , effective , and mistake - free with Grammarly ,
It scans your text for common and complex grammatical mistakes , spanning everything from subject - verb agreement to article use to modifier placement .
Then I decided to be the part of this campaign .
As I told you above that I was searching for the topic that will not make visitors to be bored so I decided to convey Blog Action Day message with the magical images related to poverty .
Yes , they are trying to create the awareness about the real problem exists in this world and many of us really do not realize in the way it is .
Here , I listed some collection of images which are posters , photographs , etc and in all of the pictures below you will see the severeness of poverty and how billions of children are effecting with this .
It ’s a time we should not forget our role and let ’s help them or at - least create some awareness from that platform which we have .
I hope at the end of this post you will realize that we live in 2 separate worlds .
Spread the word and be a part of this campaign .
Click on the images to go from where the images has been taken .
If you know more images which should be listed here , please do n’t forget to share with us via comment and tell us what are you feeling when you are watching this collection ?

483 . THE MAFIA , THE CIA AND GEORGE BUSH ( PART I )
Former reporter for the " Houston Chronicle , " Pete Brewton tells of one of the
most momentous stories of the past 50 years and how it has been suppressed by
the establishment media and the Congress .
Pete 's book " The Mafia , CIA and
George Bush , " shows the incredible complexity of the relationships in the
operation of the destruction of hundreds of Savings and Loans at the hands of
the CIA and the Mafia , stealing many billions of dollars in the process , and
leaving the taxpayers to bailout the banks .
Big names at the state and
national levels of power are involved , including Lloyd Bentsen , the Bush
family , and power brokers in Houston .
People such as Kenneth Keating and Don
Dixon , who are mentioned prominently in the press in connection with the S &
L debacle , were merely front men or " cutouts " for the main movers .
Keating
and his ilk only took millions ; the CIA and the Mafia looted billions .

Are you capable of taking a perfectly good 158 - year - old company and turning it into dust ?
If so , then you may not be earning up to your full potential .
You should be raking it in like Richard Fuld , the longtime chief of Lehman Brothers .
He took home nearly half - a- billion dollars in total compensation between 1993 and 2007 .
Last year , Mr. Fuld earned about $ 45 million , according to the calculations of Equilar , an executive pay research company .
That amounts to roughly $ 17,000 an hour to obliterate a firm .
If you ’re willing to drive a company into the ground for less , apply by calling Lehman Brothers at ( 212 ) 526-7000 .
Oh , nevermind .
I ’m delighted to announce that Mr. Fuld ( who continues to lead Lehman since it entered bankruptcy proceedings this week ) is the winner of my annual Michael Eisner Award for corporate rapacity and poor corporate governance .
The award honors the pioneering achievements in this field of Mr. Eisner , the former Walt Disney chief .
Pink Considers Adoption To Help Reduce Her Global Footprint
Like us on Facebook :
The current article you are reading does not reflect the views of the current editors and contributors of the new Ecorazzi
We feature Pink a lot here on Ecorazzi …and for good reasons .
Between her work as an animal advocate and environmental supporter , Pink proves time and time again that she has Mother Earth ’s best interest at heart .
Most recently , Pink confessed that she would rather adopt than give birth .
Her reason : there are too many people in the world already .
Pink told Star Magazine : “ I do n’t know if I need to have my own ( children ) .
I rescue dogs , so I would probably rescue kids .
I feel like with global warming and all , why produce more ?
Foster parent .
Adoption . ”
If Pink did decide to adopt she would be joining celebrity moms like Calista Flockhart , Sheryl Crow , Michelle Pfeiffer , Edie Falco and many more who have all made the decision to enjoy parenthood without adding to the growing population .

CBS News :
Even though his campaign is no longer suspended , John McCain is staying in Washington this weekend to keep working on the bailout legislation .
He will not be visiting Capital Hill , however , preferring to work out of his campaign office .
" He can effectively do what he needs to do by phone , '' said senior adviser Mark Salter .
" He 's calling members on both sides , talking to people in the administration , helping out as he can . ''
WTF ?
The financial crisis was SO important that he had to " suspend " his campaign to come to Washington , but now he can contribute to the negotiations over the cell phone , but he 's going to stay in Washington instead of going out to campaign ?
Does any of this make sense ?
I 'm curious , will any of his suggestions for this bailout include a federal spending freeze he advocated last night ?
Has he considered the ramifications ?
Will the unworkability of the Republican plan make McCain blink ?
If you do n’t use JavaScript and not interested in learning it , you can stop reading now .
What always disappointed me in books on JavaScript is the fact that authors seldom separate JavaScript from Web programming .
Thus , most books on JavaScript provide the description of features ( syntax , built - in objects ) and then jump to DHTML , DOM , AJAX and JavaScript libraries , producing a thousand - page tome .
The impression that one can get from these books is that JavaScript looks much like Java but does n’t have “ proper ” inheritance , though the latter can be emulated .
There is even a book which exercises in implementing GoF patterns in JavaScript .
A notably different view on JavaScript is presented in a recent book by Douglas Crockford called “ JavaScript : The Good Parts ” .
The first difference is that it ’s just about JavaScript itself .
The second difference , implied , is the size of the book — it ’s just about 150 pages , so you can grasp it in a weekend .
The most outstanding difference , though , is that it describes JavaScript as “ Lisp in C ’s clothing ” .
In fact , it is .
As JavaScript ’s designer Brendan Eich recounts , the language was initially designed as a functional one with Self - ish prototypal inheritance , and it was wrapped in Java - like syntax due to Java ’s positioning as a language for the Web , back in middle 1990 -s .
If you are interested , here is a link to Mozilla ’s CVS with experimental JavaScript implementation in Common Lisp .
So , Douglas explains JavaScript from this very point of view , in somewhat different way .
As an example , he advocates against the common practice of using the new operator for creating new objects .
Why ?
Because if you forget to specify new , the code will still “ work ” , producing hard to debug invalid behavior .
And how properly create new objects then ?
Read the book !
Personally , I deal with JavaScript since 2001 , mostly using it as an application scripting language .
And , nevertheless , I discovered lots of new stuff in this small book .
Apparently , most of book ’s material flies around in the Web , I just was too lazy to pick it up .
But I think , most of us are .
The anthrax in the letters to Leahy and Daschle was ground into an extremely fine powder .
As USA Today noted :
The finely prepared Daschle - letter spores … were ground so fine that they apparently drifted across offices and contaminated other letters in the mail .
As the Washington Post noted , the anthrax was :
1.5 to 3 microns in size and processed to a grade of 1 trillion spores per gram — 50 times finer than anything produced by the now - defunct U.S. bioweapons program and 10 times finer than the finest known grade of Soviet anthrax spores .
In addition , the anthrax sent to Daschle and Leahy was so advanced that no one at Fort Detrick had ever seen anything like it before .
As described in a 2001 CBS article :
“ When technicians at the Army biodefense lab in Fort Detrick , Md. , tried to examine a sample from the Daschle letter under a microscope , it floated off the glass slide and was lost . “
( Grinding the anthrax into a fine powder makes it disperse more widely , and ensures that it will get straight into victim ’s lungs , so as to be lethal ) .
So how does the FBI explain how a lone vaccine scientist , Bruce Ivins , could have produced something that most of the top anthrax bioweapons experts with their own labs could n’t produce ?
An accident .
( Article continues below )
Specifically , the official FBI explanation for how the anthrax was milled so finely is that :
“ Post Office sorting machines crushed the dried anthrax in mailing envelopes , making them very powdery . ”
Uh-huh .
Maryland Congressman and PhD physiologist Roscoe Bartlett hit the nail on the head :
Memories Are Made of This
New memory study records the activation of human brain cells deep inside the living brain .
The mystery of what happens in our brains when we remember something is fascinating not only from a scientific perspective but also because the experience of recall can be so , well , memorable .
Thinking backwards we become sensory time travellers ; recalling sights , sounds , events , emotions – all in the blink of an eye .
But what happens in our brains when we travel backwards ?
For years scientists have told a story that goes roughly like this : when we experience something – say riding a bicycle for the first time – a network of neurons in the brain are activated .
Then , later on , when we recall that first experience , that same network , or something like it , is activated again .
There is some round - a- bout evidence that this is exactly what is going on , but nothing direct .
That is , until now .
A US and Israeli research group have provided the strongest evidence so far that this story is accurate by recording individual neurons inside the living human brain .
Brain surgery for epilepsy
Recording the firing of individual human brain cells for experimental purposes is tricky as it ’s obviously highly unethical to cut people ’s heads open just so that scientists can satisfy their curiosity about how memory works .
In this case though participants in a study carried out by Gelbard - Sagiv et al. ( 2008 ) , reported in the prestigious journal Science , were undergoing brain surgery anyway and so agreed to an experiment .
The volunteers all had epilepsy which had not responded to drug treatments .
So , as a last resort they had consented to surgery , the first stage of which involves implanting electrodes into the brain in order to locate the exact source of the seizures .
The probes were inserted into the medial temporal lobe , near the hippocampus , an area of the brain central to memory and how we remember events .
To treat their epilepsy effectively patients must then wait until they have a seizure so that neurosurgeons can locate the exact area of the brain that they need to treat .
It was during this time that the experiment was carried out .
Experiencing , then recalling , The Simpsons
The experiment involved showing the thirteen patients short clips ( 5 to 10 seconds ) of famous people , characters or animals who were engaged in some activity .
For example some of the clips were from the comedy shows The Simpsons and Seinfeld .
They then recorded the activity of any neurons that were in range of the probe .
In total the researchers recorded the electrical signals of 857 individual neurons which they found specifically responded to one or other of these clips by increasing their firing rate , either singly or multiply .
This is the memory trace being laid down in the brain .
Then participants were given a task to distract them after which they were asked to freely recall any of the clips they had seen earlier .
Two very cool things happened .
The first was that when participants recalled a particular video , say the clip from The Simpsons , exactly the same neuron ( or neurons ) increased its firing rate as had been activated when they watched the clip in the first place .
This is a nice finding but be careful about interpreting it – it does n’t mean that there ’s one neuron or a series of neurons that responds to The Simpsons .
What it does mean is that , for whatever reason , this particular neuron was activated by this particular scene , almost certainly with a network of other neurons across the brain .
But because researchers were only measuring a tiny proportion of the brain ’s neurons , they only saw the activation in one or sometimes a few neurons .
The second thing they noticed was that the neurons began to fire about 1.5 seconds before participants were conscious of remembering the particular clip .
Effectively the researchers could predict which clip the patients were in the process of remembering before they actually said they became aware of it .
Resurrection of past neuronal activity
This study provides strong evidence that memory works through the reactivation of specific individual neurons in the hippocampus .
Effectively things that happen to us activate networks of neurons in the brain , and when we recall past events at least some of these same neurons fire again .
One of the authors of the study , Dr. Itzhak Fried , describes it like this : “ In a way then , reliving past experience in our memory is the resurrection of neuronal activity from the past ” .
Calling memory a ‘ resurrection of neuronal activity from the past ’ might not sound like a terribly poetic description for one of our most profound experiences , but it ’s a phrase memory researchers will be very happy to hear because it suggests they ’re on the right track .

The emerging market for budget netbook computers is seen as a big opportunity for Linux , which appeals to hardware manufacturers because of its lower licensing costs and better flexibility than Windows .
It can also be tailored to work well with unusual form factors and limited specs .
Although Linux seems like a perfect fit for these products , consumers have been slow to warm up to the platform and may not yet be ready to leave the world of Windows behind .
Nat Friedman — Novell 's chief technology officer for Linux — recently told IDG that netbook devices will significantly boost Linux market share , but statistics recently disclosed by hardware vendor MSI and published by Laptop Magazine indicate that return rates for the company 's Linux - based netbooks are roughly four times higher than the return rates for Windows devices .
This could be alarming for Linux vendors , as it's an indicator that customers used to Windows are n't getting what they expected .
One of the reasons I find these high return rates so surprising is that the MSI Wind ships with Novell 's SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop ( SLED ) , which offers one of the best and most polished desktop Linux experiences around .
SLED is in a totally different class from the funky Xandros remix that ships with the Eee .
It 's not a mediocre distribution that has to be hacked in order to be useful ; it 's a top - notch , consumer - oriented platform .
What 's behind the returns ?
We did some digging and found a number of issues playing into the high return rate .
First and foremost are hardware compatibility problems and serious integration issues .
For instance , some users are reporting that the drivers for the built - in webcam and WiFi hardware do n't work properly on Wind Linux netbooks .
On the surface , this can be ascribed to a basic failure to perform adequate quality assurance testing , but it also reflects some of the challenges faced by OEMs without extensive experience tailoring the Linux platform to their products .
MSI is not unique ; as I encountered a few minor configuration issues with my new Ubuntu - based Dell Mini 9 .
For example , I ordered it with an 8 GB drive , but the main partition is only 4GB , and the second half of the drive is empty , unpartitioned space .
That seems like a pretty bad configuration failure .
But the issue goes beyond configuration issues .
Many users complain about usability .
There are a lot of misconceptions about Linux usability , and many critics fail to recognize the real source of the problems and limitations .
The standard desktop environments and the default applications for common tasks are all generally pretty good .
People like to nitpick , but usually concede that these are usually just as easy to use as the equivalent software on other platforms , if not better .
The real usability problems that new users experience with Linux mostly relate to hardware configuration and system management tasks that are on the periphery and are n't supported very well by mainstream distributions .
Many of these issues are easy for experienced Linux users to work around or overlook , but can create a very bumpy ride for switchers .
The most serious of these real - world usability problems are the result of fundamental infrastructural weaknesses in core components of the desktop stack .
One example of an area that is particularly painful on mobile devices is Xorg 's traditionally poor support for display hotplugging .
This problem is finally being addressed with XRandR , but there are still some kinks to be worked out before the problem is solved .
There is real progress on this front , and the work is starting to pay off .
Within the next year or so , getting external displays and projectors to work with Linux - based netbooks will become a lot easier .
Right now , it 's an impediment .
Software installation
Software installation is cited as another problem area , but this particular issue is widely misunderstood by critics .
The package management systems in modern Linux distributions provide an impressively high level of usability for software installation .
In many cases , it 's as simple as launching an " Add Software " tool , selecting the desired program from a searchable list , and then clicking an Apply button .
The program and all of its dependencies will be installed automatically .
It boils down to a discoverability issue—users do n't realize that it even exists because the paradigm is so alien to them .
When a completely new Linux user attempts to install a new piece of software , they usually go to the program 's web site and get confused when they discover that the web site does n't provide a universal point - and - click installer .
There are several ways in which the Linux community is working to solve this problem .
The desktop distributions are all beginning to converge on PackageKit , a uniform wrapper layer for package management systems that could help abstract away a lot of the distribution - specific aspects of package management that are exposed to the end user .
Providing a more consistent package management experience across distributions would really help simplify things and might make the concept easier for users to understand .
Package management systems also need to be made more visible and easily accessible to end users .
This is something that Ubuntu does better than others .
The one - click install feature in SUSE has the potential to be a great solution for this problem , too , but many users do n't know to look for it , and many open source project web sites do n't support it .
It does n't do Windows
The biggest obstacle is the most glaring : Linux netbooks do n't run Windows software .
Although there are n't any numbers to back this up , I suspect that is one of the most significant factors leading to returns .
Unfortunately , I do n't think that there is any way for Linux distributions to solve this problem .
Some readers will inevitably insist that I 'm wrong and point to Wine as a viable solution , but it just does n't work consistently enough with nontrivial applications outside of the core selection of apps that receive widespread testing .
The only real solution in this case is for hardware makers to do a better job of educating consumers .
I contacted Friedman and asked him to share his perspective about the high return rates of MSI Wind computers .
He is n't surprised and does n't view the setbacks as evidence of failure .
Instead , he contends that the minor problems are the inevitable symptoms of widespread mainstream adoption .
" I do n't know what the exact return rate is , in either case , but the fact is that thousands of netbooks with Linux preloaded are shipping every month , and most of those to new Linux users , " Friedman told Ars .
" That there are some hiccups on what is essentially the first large - scale consumer rollout of Linux desktops to new Linux users is not a big surprise .
" In a lot of cases I think people do n't understand that they are buying something different from what they 're used to .
They buy a tiny $ 400 netbook and expect the full functionality of a laptop or desktop .
If they have Windows on the machine , it 's more familiar .
So maybe they 're less likely to return in that case . "
Although some of these early Linux - based netbooks are off to a rocky start , the quality of the products is increasing incrementally , and the latest models offer better platform integration and more reliability than their predecessors .
Some vendors have n't encountered problems at all , and their Linux models are n't returned at a higher rate .
Asus , for instance , recently told The Guardian 's Jack Schofield that 40 percent of Eee units are shipped with Linux , and they do n't have higher return rates for Linux - based products .
Opportunities for Linux in the mobile Internet device arena are huge and could redefine the platform 's role in the consumer market .
The problems faced by hardware makers that are currently attempting to sell Linux - based netbook devices show that it will not be easy for Linux to flourish in this crucial space , but some hard work by Linux vendors could help turn the opportunity into a victory .
La divisa estadounidense se vendió hasta en 12.70 pesos , 80 centavos menos respecto al cierre del viernes pasado
El peso mexicano se apreció un 5.39 % respecto al dólar estadounidense en sus cotizaciones de la jornada anterior .
Al cierre de operaciones bancarias de este lunes , el dólar libre se vendió hasta en 12.70 pesos , 80 centavos menos respecto al cierre del viernes pasado , mientras que el mínimo a la compra fue de 12.05 pesos en bancos de la capital mexicana .
El euro fijó su mayor cotización a la venta en 17.22 pesos , en tanto que el yen se vendió en un máximo de 0.128 pesos .
El Banco de México ubicó en 12.3743 pesos el tipo de cambio para solventar obligaciones denominadas en moneda extranjera , pagaderas en la República Mexicana .
A rumor has begun to circulate that Bank of America has sent a memo to top tier clients warning them to anticipate a one - week shutdown of banks .
Bank holidays were used following the crash of 1929 to prevent runs on banks during especially panicky time but , as far as we know , no public official has advocated this tactic in our current situation .
In fact , we strongly suspect that this rumor is just nonsense .
Keep in mind that while we trust our source on this , he had not received the memo himself .
Instead , he had been informed about the memo by a friend who claimed to have received it .
We ’re rating this : highly speculative and probably false .
Even if Bank of America had sent the memo , we ’re not sure how they would know in advance to expect a bank holiday .
One possibility might be that Bank of America has merely outlined some worst case scenarios for clients , and included a one week bank holiday among them .
Bank of America called the story " completely unfounded . "
Bloomberg says he is best placed to deal with the finance crisis
The city council in New York has voted to extend the limits on officials ' terms of office , allowing Mayor Michael Bloomberg to run for re-election .
Mr Bloomberg was due to stand down after his second term in office , which under current rules would be his last , at the end of next year .
The billionaire businessman had asked for the law to be overturned .
He said the financial crisis on Wall Street and his record as mayor meant he deserved the chance to re-run .
The 51 - member city council supported the change by 29 votes to 22 .
Approval ratings
Twice during the 1990s , voters voiced their support for limiting city politicians to a maximum of eight years in office .
If the voters do n't like what they 've seen they will vote for someone else , and that 's as it should be
Michael Bloomberg
But the BBC's Matthew Wells in New York says many on the council were also approaching the end of their second four - year terms and the mayor was favoured to get his way .
Now the two - thirds of council members who have had to step down at the November 2009 elections will be able to stand for re-election .
Mr Bloomberg earlier denied that backroom deals had been made , and said the economic downturn was the main factor .
" Given the events of recent weeks , and given the enormous challenges we face , I do n't want to walk away from a city I feel I can help lead through these times , " he said earlier .
" If the voters do n't like what they 've seen they will vote for someone else , and that 's as it should be . "
Mr Bloomberg changed his party affiliation earlier in the year from Republican to Independent , and even toyed with the idea of entering the presidential race during the contentious primary election season .
His business background and strong management of the city 's services have translated into consistently high approval ratings , our correspondent says .

In 1932 , Democrat Franklin Delano Roosevelt was elected president as the nation was heading into a severe recession .
The stock market had crashed in 1929 , the world 's economy was slowing down , and all economic indicators in the U.S. showed signs of trouble .
The new president 's response was to restructure the economy with the New Deal -- an expansion of the role of government once unimaginable in America .
We now know that FDR 's policies likely prolonged the Great Depression because the economy never fully recovered in the 1930s , ...
Palin cut $ 1.1 million from funding for teen moms in need Nick Langewis
Published : Tuesday September 2 , 2008
Print This Email This The Washington Post revealed Tuesday that Alaska Governor and McCain vice presidential pick Sarah Palin , whose 17 - year - old daughter Bristol is pregnant outside wedlock , earlier this year used a line - item veto to cut $ 1.1 million ( 22 % ) in funding which would have at least partially benefited teen moms in need .
" Bristol and the young man she will marry are going to realize very quickly the difficulties of raising a child , which is why they will have the love and support of our entire family , " Palin said in a statement .
" We ask the media to respect our daughter and Levi 's privacy , as has always been the tradition of children of candidates . "
Covenant House Alaska , the affected organization which serves to assist homeless and runaway youth , runs Passage House , a transitional living program with 24 - hour support staff that provides housing , along with up to eighteen months of assistance in building parenting , money management and job skills , with aims to help teen parents prepare for the " real world . "
" We work with parenting teens to help them become productive , successful , independent adults who create and provide a stable environment for themselves and their families , " reads the Passage House webpage .
" Our goal is to assist young mothers in developing skills such as healthy parenting , money management , priority setting , housing acquisition and social skills development . "
" The explicit sex - ed programs will not find my support , " Gov. Palin told Eagle Forum Alaska in a 2006 questionnaire in an expression of support for " abstinence - only " sex education .

Unpopular bailout plan on track in Congress THE ECONOMY IN TURMOIL Sunday target : Democrats insist GOP help carry burden of passing unpopular measure

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Congress would pass a $ 700 billion debt bailout soon and that negotiations were back on track after Thursday 's political theatrics .
Leaders were hoping for a Sunday deadline to calm markets before they open on Monday , but they would not commit to that date .
The San Francisco Democrat made clear , as she has all along , that her party could not and would not pass the unpopular measure on its own .
Democrats refuse to shoulder full responsibility for a bailout engineered by the Bush administration and insist that at least half of the GOP members of Congress join in .
Many Democrats are expected to vote against the plan .
Democrats and Republicans alike are livid that they are being asked by what they view as a discredited administration to spend such an astonishing sum , which will top $ 1.3 trillion when previous loans and bailouts related to the mortgage meltdown are included .
Pelosi , who has begun referring to the " Bush financial crisis , " said she and others were " quite stunned to see a $ 700 billion price tag " on the plan Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson dropped in the lap of Congress last weekend .
But she said that with the major changes that are being incorporated , both parties will swallow hard and pass it , convinced of its necessity by the dire warnings of economic collapse by Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke .
The failure Thursday of Washington Mutual Inc. , which was bought by banking giant JPMorgan Chase & Co. , added to the sense of urgency .
' The Paulson Plan '
" We will not leave until legislation is passed that is signed by the president , " she said .
House Republicans backed off their demand to substitute an entirely different approach .
Democrats said they would incorporate some GOP suggestions in what is now being called " the Paulson Plan . "
Republicans are especially insistent that none of the bailout money be passed through the liberal low - income housing group known as ACORN , which had activists on Capitol Hill this week .
They also are pinning the roots of the subprime crisis on an expansion of the Community Reinvestment
Act by the Clinton administration that required banks to lend money to people with shaky credit , designed to prevent banks from " redlining " poor neighborhoods by refusing loans .
Even with all the changes that both parties want and the administration has agreed to - such as requiring that taxpayers get an equity stake in bailed out companies , limiting executive pay and doling out the money in installments - it will take an all - out effort by both parties ' leaders to pass the bailout .
' Overrated ' warnings
Democratic Rep. Pete Stark of Fremont , a former banker , said he probably will not support it , calling dire warnings of a credit meltdown " grossly overrated . "
" I think we are being railroaded in the same manner we were to vote for Iraq , " Stark said .
" The banks of the Bay Area are in good shape , and they 're bailing out Wall Street for $ 700 billion .
It 's irresponsible and reckless . "
Stark said he has been working to get a third of that sum for universal health care , and that with $ 15 billion , all Californians could have health insurance .
He attributed at least part of the credit tightening that businesses and consumers are feeling now to the recession that economists believe has begun and the unwinding of easy credit that fed the housing bubble .
" I think people will have more trouble getting a mortgage , " Stark said .
" Auto dealers are going to have more trouble shedding their inventory , which is n't worth much anyway if it 's all SUVs .
If we found the whole Bay Area seeing the kinds of foreclosures , say that they have in Stockton , we 'd probably react to that .
But it 's not been that way in Fremont and it's not been that way in Burlingame , or San Francisco .
I think that $ 700 billion would hurt the value of the dollar , which would raise oil prices even further , and probably increase inflation .
I think we 're rushing this through too quickly . "
Rep. Jeff Flake , R - Ariz. , said conservatives have been burned by President Bush before on things such as the costly Medicare drug benefit and are in no mood to swallow such a large government intervention in the economy .
" This thing , ' We 've got to get this done tomorrow , we can't deviate , it has to be exactly like this , ' there were a lot of eyes rolling around the room , saying , ' We 've heard this before , ' " Flake said .
Sen .
Dianne Feinstein , a California Democrat , went to the Senate floor to urge that the modified bailout be passed , despite receiving " more than 50,000 calls and letters , the great bulk of them in opposition to any form of meeting this crisis with financial help from the federal government . "
' No good options '
" None of us wants to be in this position , and there are no good options here , " Feinstein said .
" Nobody likes the idea of spending massive sums of government money to rescue major corporations from their bad financial decisions .
But no one also should be fooled into thinking this problem only belongs to the banks and that it 's a good idea to let them fail . "
She said California 's unemployment rate is already at 7.7 percent , the third highest in the nation , with 1.3 million people out of work , and that 800,000 more foreclosures are expected in the state this year .
" The situation , I believe , is grave , and quick , prudent action is needed , " Feinstein said .
Remember that attack from the Elizabeth Dole campaign against her opponent for a North Carolina Senate seat Kay Hagan ?
Now , the National Republican Senatorial Committee has put it to video .
Wow .
It ’s all absurd , of course .
No one has to be afraid of the Godless .
While many atheists would like to see “ Under God ” removed from the Pledge of Allegiance and “ In God We Trust ” removed from our money —
The Pledge and paper money were both God - free before the 1950s Communist scare — it ’s not the highest priority on our “ agenda ” — we do n’t have one of those .
( We ca n’t even get a thousand people to attend an atheist conference and they think we ’re organized enough to have an agenda ? ! )
The atheists who lobby and have any political voice at all ( albeit a relatively small one ) are focused on stopping faith - based initiatives and protecting religious freedom for everyone .
For example , we do n’t want taxpayer money being used to discriminate against someone because of their religion .
Also , to quote two representatives from American Atheists — one organization and hardly the largest atheist group in the country — is misleading .
Not all atheists agree with them .
Most atheists could not care less about those issues .
And to say that Kay Hagan supports those “ agenda ” items is definitely misleading .
To say that because she associated loosely with someone who might not share the values of most Americans , she must be stopped ?
That ’s what John McCain was doing to Barack Obama with William Ayres .
It implies a much closer connection than actually exists .
It ’s all just a pathetic , last - ditch effort for Dole , who is losing a campaign she thought she would be winning handily .
They ’re Republicans .
I ’m not surprised .
But this time , it ’s not just Elizabeth Dole .
It ’s the party ’s national campaign to elect senators running this ad .
Why anyone who cares about honesty , respect , and equality for people of all faiths or no faiths could vote for Dole at this point is beyond me .
She ’s not worth your vote .
If you ’re in North Carolina , vote for Kay Hagan .
Not because she ’s going to give atheists any special rights or privileges , but because she ’s reaching out to us and listening to us .
Hopefully , she ’ll think about us and factor us into the equation when she makes decisions in the Senate .
That ’s all we want .

Editor ’s note :
As usual , the corporate media did not find this story worthy of notice .
One hour before the final presidential debate of the 2008 campaign , fourteen members of IVAW marched in formation to Hofstra University to present questions for the candidates .
IVAW had requested permission from debate moderator Bob Schieffer to ask their questions during the debate but got no response .
Segment on the protest aired on Democracy Now !
The contingent of veterans in dress uniforms and combat uniforms attempted to enter the building where the debate was to be held in order to ask their questions but were turned back by police .
The IVAW members at the front of the formation were immediately arrested , and others were pushed back into the crowd by police on horseback .
Several members were injured , including former Army Sergeant Nick Morgan who suffered a broken cheekbone when he was trampled by police horses before being arrested .
“ Neither of the candidates have shown real support for soldiers and veterans .
We came here to try and get serious questions answered , questions that we as veterans of the Iraq war , have a right to ask , but instead we were arrested .
We will continue to ask these questions no matter who is elected .
We believe that the time has come to end this war and bring our troops home , and we will be pushing for that no matter what happens in this election . ” said Jason Lemieux , a former Sergeant in the US Marine Corps and member of IVAW who served three tours in Iraq .
A total of 10 veterans were arrested during the action , including Matthis Chiroux , Kristopher Goldsmith , Adam Kokesh , Mike Spinato , Geoff Millard , Marlisa Grogan , Nathan Peld , Nick Morgan , James Gilligan and Jose Vasquez .

So what can YOU do about it ?
My fellow veteran brothers need you .
We need to call the NY police department and ask them why they would trample IRAQ WAR VETERANS exercising their FREEDOM SPEECH in a peaceful manner .
Is this the way members of the military who don the uniform and make an oath to defend the constitution , America , and it ’s people are treated ?
We MUST NOT ONLY hold the Police Department accountable but the Presidential Candidates as well for allowing this to happen .
THIS IS NOT DEMOCRACY , THIS IS A POLICE STATE .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Below are the numbers .
Call now and anytime until November 10th when the court date is set for the detained veterans .
Stay posted for a possible action then .

On Nov 11 , 1998 , I posted the very first screenshot of the NGLayout ( now Gecko ) Viewer application for Mac to MozillaZine .
Today , pretty darn close to 10 years later , I bring you the first screenshot of Chromium 's TestShell rendering pages on Mac .
It does n't look like much , but trust me when I tell you a lot of work has gone into making this happen .
A lot .
Interestingly , I found the original NGLayout URL using the Google 2001 index that we recently unveiled as part of our 10 - year anniversary celebration .

I 've been doing this for too long .
On Monday we the people rallied together to deliver one of the biggest blows to Wall Streets wicked agenda , wounding the banking cartel .
They made every attempt to assemble their congressional pawns but they were not able to align themselves in time .
We proved that when we utilize our collective voice we produce change , we do n't have to HOPE for it , we are change !
Make no mistake , however , they will be back , the bankers have a firm grip , and they will use everything they have to squeeze us into submission .

After they could no longer hide behind lies , Hank Paulson and Ben Bernanke began threatening us .
Last Wednesday our President came on television to instill fear , signaling congress to join the campaign of terror .
They should be arrested , they have hijacked our government , and destroyed it from the inside out .
Now the main stream media has been enlisted to propagandize their Economic Terrorism .
They say the stock market will crash , and your pensions will disappear , your home will be foreclosed on , and ultimately unless this bailout bill passes , America will face another Great Depression .
These are just fear tactics hoping to reverse our victory .
Almost immediately after the votes were in , CNBC began shaking their heads at us .
Their stance was firm : rejecting this bailout does not hurt Wall Street alone it will hurt main street too- omitting the fact that we are already suffering .
The fed has spent about one trillion dollars bailing out wall street so far this year , and those are just numbers we can keep track of .
The total amount of liquidity that has been pumped into the markets is not available to the public .
We do know the fed dropped 180 billion dollars into the markets , last Tuesday , and on Monday 630 Billion more was poured in , that 's almost another trillion in just two days worth of injections .
They add more nearly every day .
The printing presses have been running non-stop , ( that 's why they call him helicopter Ben Bernanke ) and it goes on with or without congressional approval .
Our dollar has already collapsed .
And we thought Google 's work with NASA and private space entrepreneurs was part of a secret plan to escape the Earth before it 's too late .
Turns out the leading internet ad firm has been devising a plan to save those stuck planet - side as well .
In case Google 's work with mobile phones , word processing , web browsers , disease prevention , encyclopedias , email , watercraft , cartography , and humanitarian aide has n't driven home Google 's aspirations to have its hand in absolutely everything , try a new $ 4.4 trillion energy plan on for size .
Google unveiled the first iteration of its Clean Energy 2030 plan yesterday , designed to wean the US off coal and oil for electricity generation over the course of 22 years .
The company said its energy team has been " crunching the numbers " and expects its proposal could cut oil use for cars by 40 per cent , generate billions of dollars in savings , and create millions of well - paying green jobs .
Its initial goal is to stimulate debate and invite the public to take a look and offer comment .
" With a new Administration and Congress — and multiple energy - related imperatives — this is an opportune , perhaps unprecedented , moment to move from plan to action . "
To get there , Google said , the US needs to move immediately on three fronts :
Energy efficiency : " We should start with the low - hanging fruit by reducing energy demand through energy efficiency — adopting technologies and practices that allow us to do more with less . "
Data centers and personal computers must both be made more energy efficient .
Google also recommends the US should adopt California 's aggressive building codes , efficiency standards , and utility programs .
It also calls for homes to be equipped with " smart meters " to provide real - time energy use data to encourage people to use less power .
Find something better than coal : Google believes at least three renewable energy technologies show promise to become price - competitive with coal : wind , solar thermal , and advanced geothermal .
" We must dramatically increase federal R&D and enact measures supporting the rapid deployment and scaling of clean technologies such as long - term tax support and national renewable energy standards , " Google wrote .
Drivin ' too : Electric Bugaloo : " Image driving a car that uses no gas and is less expensive to recharge than buying a latte . "
Google brags that it already owns a " small fleet " of Toyota Prius and Ford Escape plug - in conversions as a part of its rechargeable car program .
But for those kind of cars to catch on outside of the hallowed grounds of the Googleplex , the company said the US needs a smart grid that manages when we charge and how we 're billed .
Google states that much of the US 's current electric grid was developed in the 60s and is " wasteful and not very smart . "
It claims to be doing its part by partnering with General Electric to help accelerate the development of a smart grid and building new power lines .
All - in - all , Google expects the cost of its Clean Energy 2030 proposal will cost about $ 4.4 trillion dollars .
It expects savings of $ 5.4 trillion however , returning a cool $ 1 trillion over the 22 - year life of the plan .
A detailed view of the proposal is available here . ®
JUNEAU , Alaska ( AP )  Alaska may not have a Bridge to Nowhere , but it now has a Road to Nowhere .
The state this week completed a $ 25 million gravel road that was intended to lead up to the bridge linking the city of Ketchikan to its airport on a neighboring island .
The bridge project became the symbol of federal largess , and Congress eventually dropped the earmark for the bridge .
The state still received the money , but Gov. Sarah Palin — who once supported the bridge — last fall killed the project , valued at nearly $ 400 million .
Ketchikan Mayor Bob Weinstein said the 3.2 - mile road now is ideal for road races and hunting , and possibly some commercial development .
But with no bridge to serve it , that 's probably about it .
The bridge has also become a focal point in the presidential race with Palin , now John McCain 's running mate , repeatedly telling crowds she told Congress " thanks but no thanks " for that Bridge to Nowhere .
Palin , however , originally backed the funding until the project became the subject of national ridicule , then she pulled the state 's portion .
The state is considering cheaper designs for a bridge .
State lawmakers made a brief and unsuccessful attempt at securing funding for a bridge during this year 's legislative session .
The two - bridge project would have connected the town 's airport on Gravina Island to Revillagigedo Island , where most of the 13,000 residents of the Ketchikan Gateway Borough live .
The airport is separated from its users by a quarter - mile - wide channel of water , forcing travelers to catch either a ferry or a water taxi .

Numerous reports link Ahmed Wali Karzai to the drug trade , according to current and former officials from the White House , the State Department and the United States Embassy in Afghanistan , who would speak only on the condition of anonymity .
In meetings with President Karzai , including a 2006 session with the United States ambassador , the Central Intelligence Agency ’s station chief and their British counterparts , American officials have talked about the allegations in hopes that the president might move his brother out of the country , said several people who took part in or were briefed on the talks .
“ We thought the concern expressed to Karzai might be enough to get him out of there , ” one official said .
But President Karzai has resisted , demanding clear - cut evidence of wrongdoing , several officials said .
“ We do n’t have the kind of hard , direct evidence that you could take to get a criminal indictment , ” a White House official said .
“ That allows Karzai to say , ‘ where ’s your proof ? ’ ”

Neither the Drug Enforcement Administration , which conducts counternarcotics efforts in Afghanistan , nor the fledgling Afghan anti-drug agency has pursued investigations into the accusations against the president ’s brother .
Several American investigators said senior officials at the D.E.A. and the office of the Director of National Intelligence complained to them that the White House favored a hands - off approach toward Ahmed Wali Karzai because of the political delicacy of the matter .
But White House officials dispute that , instead citing limited D.E.A. resources in Kandahar and southern Afghanistan and the absence of political will in the Afghan government to go after major drug suspects as the reasons for the lack of an inquiry .
“ We invested considerable resources into building Afghan capability to conduct such investigations and consistently encouraged Karzai to take on the big fish and address widespread Afghan suspicions about the link between his brother and narcotics , ” said Meghan O’Sullivan , who was the coordinator for Afghanistan and Iraq at the National Security Council until last year .
It was not clear whether President Bush had been briefed on the matter .
Humayun Hamidzada , press secretary for President Karzai , denied that the president ’s brother was involved in drug trafficking or that the president had intervened to help him .
“ People have made allegations without proof , ” Mr. Hamidzada said .

It ’s still amazing to me how the media have flocked to our fair city .
One visit that I was particularly pleased with was progressive radio talk show icon Ed Schultz , bringing “ Team Fargo ” to the University of Anchorage for a Town Hall meeting .
Sarah Palin was the topic du jour .
No need to say that was there ?
Nobody found us particularly interesting until this whole fiasco came up .
Usually we have to resort to bribing famous people with fishing trips and tales of natural splendour .
And they still do n’t come .
I decided to splurge and get the VIP Passes at $ 100 a pop .
But it made me feel good to shake the man ’s hand , have some finger food , and donate to a worthy cause .
And I needed something to eat after attending both the Palin rally and the anti-Palin rally earlier in the day .
The VIP group of about 30 people were treated to a good progressive pep rally by our illustrious host , who , in another life , wanted to be a football coach .
We ’ll have none of that talk now .
We need him right where he is .
The house was n’t packed , but there was a respectable crowd , and everyone was more than willing to give opinions on the woman who might very well be sitting in the Oval Office some day .
I ’m sorry .
I know that felt as strange to read as it did to write … but that ’s what we ’re dealing with .
Bottom Line : Do Alaskans think she ’s prepared ?
No .
You can tune in to Ed’s Show to hear all about her stances on women ’s issues , foreign policy , wildlife , the environment , her track record as mayor of Wasilla , special ed , family matters and troopergate .
Rep. Les Gara who posted here on that last issue , gave a good recounting of his feelings about the McCain people running roughshod over a bipartisan investigation , and slandering some really well - respected public servants in the process .
The crowd got a little frustrated when he refused to talk about the possibility of impeachment , but that word ca n’t be bandied around without bringing down the wrath of the Republican ticket and it ’s squadron of lawyers and spin-meisters .

And thanks to KUDO 1080 , Alaska ’s progressive talk station for making it happen .

No Hip - Hop Halloween playlist is complete without at least one song from Gravediggaz , who specialized in blood - thirsty throwdowns .
" 6 Feet Deep , " the title track from their controversial debut , spots unsettling vocals and a decidedly moody beat .
" Your world is black .
You drop into a hole . "
03 of 15 Jazzy Jeff + Fresh Prince - " A Nightmare on My Street " Raymond Boyd / Getty Images After seeing Nightmare on Elm Street , Fresh Prince finds he can't go to sleep because he 's been visited by Freddy Krueger .
Freddy asks to be his partner - in - rhyme , but Prince ridicules him and sends him home instead .
" Yo Fred , I think you got me all wrong / I ain't partners with nobody with nails that long .
Look , I 'll be honest this team wo n't work . "
Reality only sets in the end when Freddy decides to kill Jazzy Jeff .
This one gave me shivers when I was a kid .
04 of 15 B.o.B. - " Ghost in the Machine " WireImage / Getty Images Driven by dour piano licks , " Ghost in the Machine " is a dark and creepy track from Bobby Ray .
The reflective grandeur of transcendent emotions overwhelms B.o.B , as he cries out : " I 'm terrified , like I 've seen a UFO . "
05 of 15 Snoop Dogg - " Murder was the Case " Randy Shropshire / Getty Images
No need for ghosts and goblins here , the mere thought of dying is terrifying enough for Snoop .
Hear him testify : " I 'm shaking and they breaking , tryin ' to save the Dogg , pumping on my chest and I 'm screamin ' .
I stop breathing , damn I see demons .
Dear God , I wonder can you save me ?
I can't die , my Boo -Boo 's bout to have my baby . "
Snoop 's plea for mercy gets an even eerier thump from Dr. Dre 's cinematic production .
06 of 15 Ras Kass - " Interview with a Vampire " Imeh Akpanudosen / Getty Images Backed by a gnarly soundtrack , Ras Kass strikes up an intricate conversation with supernatural beings .
Otherworldly sound effects come alive as the dialogue shifts from creationism to Armageddon .
07 of 15 Kid Cudi - " Maniac " BET / Getty Images
Like a full moon rising , " Maniac " gradually unfolds with a gothic vibe .
Cudi and Cage add the perfect the touch of horror with lines about a psychotic disturbance deep within .
" It lives inside of me , eating what 's in its way , " Cage laments .
If you want to turn up the surreal vibe a few notches , set this one to a strobe light .
08 of 15 Bone Thugs N Harmony - " Hell Sent " Daniel Boczarski / Getty Images
There are at least 10 references to Lucifer in " Hell Sent , " which finds Bone Thugs bragging about " taking demons hostages " and starting a riot in hell .
Wish Bone unleashes the fiercest assault towards the end , " A demon told me that Lucifer said meet him at the black hole .
I told him " I 'm a be there ; ai n't no b*tch in my soul ! "
09 of 15 The Notorious B.I.G. - " Suicidal Thoughts " Redferns / Getty Images
Fed up with his personal failures , Biggie gives himself a death sentence on " Suicidal Thoughts . "
His friend ( Diddy , in this case ) attempts to dissuade him , but Biggie is too far down the windpipe to reconsider .
We 'll never know if B.I.G. was really as depressed as the song indicates , but " Suicidal Thoughts " is still one hell of a spooky song 11 years after his real death .
10 of 15 Eminem - " Stan " Theo Wargo / Getty Images
You only need to listen to " Stan " once before realizing that this ill - fated account of a psychotic Eminem worshipper is simply unforgettable .
" Stan " unmasks a vulnerable Eminem , one that turns up the pathos several notches while barely raising his voice .
Dido 's ethereal crooning adds more soot to the tale .
11 of 15 Tech N9ne - " What 's Ya Psycho " Mat Hayward / Getty Images Tech Nina has crafted his share of spooky songs over the years .
" What 's Ya Psycho ? " is a monstrous anthem that can turn a graveyard into a dancehall full of zombie troupes .
12 of 15 Geto Boys - " Mind Playing Tricks on Me " FilmMagic / Getty Images
In " Mind Playing Tricks on Me , " Paranoia gets the best of Scarface as he stands alone in his four - corner room staring at candles , seeing images .
" He owns a black hat like I own .
A black suit and a cane like my own , " ' Face rhymes .
" It 's f***ed up when your mind 's playing tricks on you . "
Turns out he was staring at his own reflection .
The vertically challenged Bushwick Bill then teams up with ' Face and Willie D to fight off a 7 - ft tall enemy .
The giant disappears only for Bill to realize he'd been ferociously pounding concrete the whole time .
13 of 15 Immortal Technique - " Dance with the Devil " Raymond Boyd / Getty Images Darkness permeates " Dance with the Devil " from start to finish , as Immortal Technique tells an elaborate tale of a man named Billy .
Billy 's hunger for social acceptance drove him to commit all sorts of atrocities , including one that involves a close relative .
The song 's hazed - out jazzy vibe , coupled with Tech 's psychopathic recital , is incredibly chilling .
14 of 15 Ganksta N - I - P - Horror Movie Rap N - I - P is a certified psycho who probably deserves his own list .
I mean , has there ever been a hip - hop artist scarier than this guy ?
Sample rhymes : " I ain't gon ' lie , I feel like killing my niece . "
And that 's just the opening salvo on N - I - P's debut LP .
The rest of the track plays out like one sick horror flick , replete with severed heads and holy matrimony with a horse .
Do n't ask , do n't neigh ?
The San Jose ( Calif . ) City Council has unanimously approved Tesla Motors ’ new electric car manufacturing plant .
The plant will produce the $ 60,000 electric sedan that the 5 - year - old company currently has in development .
Tesla plans to move the company ’s headquarters to the new site as well , which will ultimately employ about 1,000 people when it opens in 2010 .
>> More on Tesla Motors at Green Options
Last month , we learned that San Jose had been selected for the much sought after new plant , but the company still needed final approval from the San Jose City Council ; a mere formality considering how hard city officials lobbied for it .
Mayor Reed personally appealed to Tesla officials to locate their proposed $ 129 million , 600,000 - square - foot manufacturing plant in his city .
The city has set a goal of adding 25,000 green tech jobs in 15 years .
“ It ’s a road map for us becoming the center for clean - tech innovation , ” Mayor Chuck Reed said in the San Jose Mercury News .
“ Although we ’re a long way from the end of the road in this incremental plan , we ’re making solid progress , ” added Reed .
Under the sweetheart deal , Tesla would build the plant on public land by the city ’s water pollution control plant .
The company would pay no rent for the first 10 years , then pay $ 1.5 million annually for the following 10 years , with a 2 percent to 3 percent cost - of - living increase triggering after twenty years .
The city estimates that the project will have a regional economic impact of $ 2 billion per year , coming from a combination of tax revenue and spending by Tesla employees .

( CNN ) -- Rain and flooding in Yemen has killed 58 people and left an estimated 20,000 without basic shelter , a local newspaper reported Saturday .
Men try to reach a vehicle carrying tourists stranded in floodwaters in the old district of Sanaa Friday .
Most of the dead were in Hadramout , one of the worst - affected provinces , said Yemen Post Editor - in - Chief Hakim al - Masmari , citing the Ministry of the Interior .
Officials continued to evacuate people from affected areas , but thousands remained stranded in their homes because the extensive rain has prevented help from reaching them , the newspaper said .
The flooding follows several days of rain in the Middle Eastern country that is unaccustomed to more than a few inches of rain a year .
The rain began Thursday as the remnants of a tropical cyclone moved over the area , said CNN forecaster Martyn Jeanes .
The rain continued Friday and into the weekend as the weather system hung over the region , also bringing rain to parts of Saudi Arabia and northern Somalia , Jeanes said .
Better weather conditions were expected Sunday and conditions should be " much improved " by then , Jeanes said .
Thousands of families have fled Hadramout , the newspaper reported .
Some evacuees are being taken to schools , but they can only accommodate about 10 percent of the people , the newspaper previously said .
The Yemeni government promised to send tents as emergency shelter .
More than 730 houses have been destroyed and many infrastructure projects suffered damage from the rains , according to SABA , the Yemeni news agency .
The rains also caused damage to property and agricultural lands and killed a large number of livestock , SABA reported .
Yemeni President Ali Abdullah
Saleh ordered the formation of an emergency committee for the delivery of aid to those who were affected by heavy rains , the news agency said .

Creating a Virtual jQuery Keyboard
For those of us who travel often , we often end up accessing our emails and other confidential web accounts on public computers .
In such circumstances , we are completely at the mercy of keyloggers and other malicious software that track our keystrokes and record our passwords .
Yet , very few websites provide their users with the option of using a virtual keyboard to key in ( at the bare minimum ) their passwords .
Yes , a few banks do it , but considering how much personal information we store in various web applications these days , the safety of these accounts are of no less significance to us .
This tutorial will explain how we can implement a simple virtual keyboard with some ( well , okay , lots of ! ) help from jQuery .
Before I begin , let me show you how it will all look in the end .
Basic HTML and CSS Setup
Ok , let ’s get started .
We start off with a plain , old login form with username and password fields and a login button .
We add a link which will show / hide the virtual keyboard when clicked .
Note :
For the purpose of demonstration , I have actually used a normal text field instead of a password type text field !
< h3 > Login form </ h3 > < form action= " " method= " post " id =" loginform " > < label for =" username " > Username :</ label > < input type =" text " name =" username " id =" username " /> < label for = " pwd " > Password :</ label > < input type =" text " name = " pwd " id = " pwd " /> < a href= " # " id =" showkeyboard " title = " Type in your password using a virtual keyboard . " >
Keyboard </a> < br /> < input type =" submit " name = " Submit " id =" submit_butt " value= " Submit " /> </ form > 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 < h3 > Login form < / h3 > < form action = " " method = " post " id = " loginform " > < label for = " username " >
Username : < / label > < input type = " text " name = " username " id = " username " / > < label for = " pwd " >
Password : < / label > < input type = " text " name = " pwd " id = " pwd " / > < a href = " # " id = " showkeyboard " title =
" Type in your password using a virtual keyboard . " > Keyboard < / a > < br / > < input type = " submit " name = " Submit " id = " submit_butt " value = " Submit " / > < / form >
Next , it ’s time to put in the XHTML for the keyboard in place .
I just wanted to take a very simple approach , and thus ruled out generating the keys dynamically .
I have just the four main rows of the standard keyboard ( each enclosed in a DIV ) , along with their shift equivalents .
So that means , a total of 8 rows , of which at any time ( depending on whether the shift key is pressed or not ) , four of the rows would be visible , and the other four hidden .

I have taken care to represent characters which have special meaning in HTML , like “ The CSS
I have kept the CSS styling very minimal .
Of course , if you want your keyboard to look like a dragon , you can go ahead and all that jazz !
We set the display property of div enclosing the keyboard to be “ none ” initially , as we do n’t want it to show up till the user activates it by clicking on the “ Keyboard ” link .
In addition , we also hide the “ shift ” keys , i.e. the keys which get activated only when the shift button is down .
I have named these rows with a div id ending “ _shift ” .
We will bring them back into view when the user presses the shift key ( we will see later ) .
The rest of the CSS involves basic formatting to make the keys look like as they are on a standard QWERTY keyboard .
# keyboard { position : absolute ; display : none ; border : 1 px solid # ccc ; width : 560 px ; padding : 10 px ; cursor : move ; } # spacebar input { width : 180 px ; margin : 0 auto ; margin - left : 150 px ; } # shift , # shifton { width : 70 px ; text - align : left ; } #row0_shift , #row1_shift , #row2_shift , #row3_shift { display : none ; } #row0 , #row0_shift { padding - left : 20 px ; } #row1 , #row1_shift { padding - left : 60 px ; } #row2 , #row2_shift { padding - left : 70 px ; } #shifton { border - left : 3 px solid # 000 ; border - top : 3 px solid # 000 ; } 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 # keyboard { position : absolute ; display : none ; border : 1 px solid #ccc ; width : 560 px ; padding : 10 px ; cursor : move ; } #spacebar input { width : 180 px ; margin : 0 auto ; margin - left : 150 px ; } # shift , # shifton { width : 70 px ; text - align : left ; } #row0_shift , #row1_shift , #row2_shift , #row3_shift { display : none ; } #row0 , #row0_shift { padding - left : 20 px ; } #row1 , #row1_shift { padding - left : 60 px ; } #row2 , #row2_shift { padding - left : 70 px ; } #shifton { border - left : 3 px solid # 000 ; border - top : 3 px solid # 000 ; }
jQuery
Let ’s now get to the most important part – the JavaScript that controls the behavior of the keyboard .
We will be using two jQuery extensions – one to make the keyboard draggable , and the other to aid in the selection and manipulation of the password field .
I have made some additions to the original fieldSelection JQuery plugin by Alex Brem to suit our additional needs .
vkeyboard.js contains our custom code .
< script type =" text / javascript " src= " jquery - 1.2.6.min.js " ></ script > < script type =" text/ javascript " src=" jquery-ui-personalized -1.5.2.min.js " ></ script > < script type =" text / javascript " src=" jquery- fieldselection.js " ></ script > < script type =" text / javascript " src="vkeyboard.js " ></ script > 1 2 3 4 < script type = " text/ javascript " src = " jquery - 1.2.6.min.js " > </ script > < script type = " text/ javascript " src = " jquery-ui- personalized - 1.5.2.min.js " > </ script > < script type = " text/ javascript " src = " jquery- fieldselection.js " > </ script > < script type = " text/ javascript " src = " vkeyboard.js " > </ script >
In vkeyboard.js , we place all our code within jQuery ’s ready function to ensure that the code runs only after the document is fully loaded .
$ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { // all our code goes here } ) ; 1 2 3 $ ( document ) . ready ( function ( ) { // all our code goes here } ) ;
Let me just walk you through the underlying logic behind the code .
We first add an “ onclick ” event handler which causes the keyboard to toggle ( i.e. show up if hidden , hide if already shown ) when the user clicks on the “ Keyboard ” link .
$ ( " #showkeyboard " ) .click ( function (e ) { var height = $ ( ’ # keyboard ’ ) . height ( ) ; var width = $ ( ’ # keyboard ’ ) .
width ( ) ; leftVal=e.pageX-40 + " px " ; topVal=e.pageY+20 + " px " ; $ (’#keyboard’).css({left:leftVal,top:topVal}).toggle ( ) ; } ) ; 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 $ ( " #showkeyboard " ) . click ( function ( e ) { var height = $ ( ’ # keyboard ’ ) . height ( ) ; var width = $ ( ’ # keyboard ’ ) .
width ( ) ; leftVal = e .
pageX - 40 + " px " ; topVal = e .
pageY + 20 + " px " ; $ ( ’ # keyboard ’).css({left:leftVal,top:topVal}).toggle ( ) ; } ) ;
Next up , we make the keyboard draggable , so that the user can drag it and keep in anywhere on the screen such that it does not obstruct the text underneath .
We do this by calling the draggable ( ) , courtesy of the jQuery UI + draggable plugin .
$ ( " #keyboard " ) .draggable ( ) ; 1 $ ( " #keyboard " ) . draggable ( ) ;
We need to next define a function that toggles between the default rows on the keyboard and the rows which get activated when the “ Shift ” key is pressed .
function on Shift (e ) { var i ; if ( e==1 ) { for ( i=0 ; i< 4 ; i++ ) { var rowid = " #row " + i ; $ ( rowid ) .hide ( ) ; $ ( rowid + " _shift " ) .
show ( ) ; } } else { for ( i=0 ; i< 4 ; i++ ) { var rowid = " #row " + i ; $ ( rowid ) . show ( ) ; $ ( rowid + " _shift " ) . hide ( ) ; } } } 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 function on Shift ( e ) { var i ; if ( e == 1 ) { for ( i = 0 ; i < 4 ; i ++ ) { var rowid = " #row " + i ; $ ( rowid ) . hide ( ) ; $ ( rowid + " _shift " ) . show ( ) ; } } else { for ( i = 0 ; i < 4 ; i ++ ) { var rowid = " #row " + i ; $ ( rowid ) . show ( ) ; $ ( rowid + " _shift " ) . hide ( ) ; } } }
Lastly , we define a function that ’s called whenever any of the keys on the keyboard are pressed .
This function checks if the key pressed is Backspace .
If it is , then it calls the replaceSelection function from the fieldSelection plugin with an empty string as a parameter , to indicate that a backspace operation ( replacing preceding character to the current cursor location by an empty string – i.e. deleting the preceding character ) must be performed .
If the “ Shift ” key had been pressed , then the function sets the “ shifton ” variable to be true to indicate that the shift key has been pressed and calls on Shift ( 1 ) .
However if the shift key has already been pressed , the function deactivates the shift rows by calling on Shift ( 0 ) .
If some other key had been pressed , then we simply insert the character in between the current cursor position .
The replaceSelection ( ) handles the case when some characters have already been selected by the user .
In that case , the selected characters would be replaced by the character that is represented by the key pressed .
$ ( " #keyboard input " ) . bind ( " click " , function ( e ) { if ( $ ( this ) .
val ( ) == ‘ Backspace ’ ) { $ ( ’ # pwd’ ) .replaceSelection ( " " , true ) ; } else if ( $ ( this ) .
val ( ) == " Shift " ) { if ( shifton == false ) { onShift ( 1 ) ; shifton = true ; } else { onShift ( 0 ) ; shifton = false ; } } else { $ ( ’ # pwd’ ) .replaceSelection ( $ ( this ).val ( ) , true ) ; if ( shifton == true ) { onShift ( 0 ) ; shifton = false ; } } } ) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 $ ( " #keyboard input " ) . bind ( " click " , function ( e ) { if ( $ ( this ) . val ( ) == ‘ Backspace ’ ) { $ ( ’ # pwd ’).replaceSelection ( " " , true ) ; } else if ( $ ( this ) . val ( ) == " Shift " ) { if ( shifton == false ) { on Shift ( 1 ) ; shifton = true ; } else { on Shift ( 0 ) ; shifton = false ; } } else { $ ( ’ # pwd ’).replaceSelection ( $ ( this ).val ( ) , true ) ; if ( shifton == true ) { on Shift ( 0 ) ; shifton = false ; } } } )
And … we are done !

As you can see , most of the actual hard work is handled by the jQuery plugins .

Here 's the quote from Obama out of which McCain created his current fear - mongering and outright deceptive ad :
" Strong countries and strong Presidents talk to their adversaries .
That 's what Kennedy did with Khrushchev .
That 's what Reagan did with Gorbachev .
That 's what Nixon did with Mao .
I mean , think about it : Iran , Cuba , Venezuela -- these countries are tiny compared to the Soviet Union .
They do n't pose a serious threat to us the way the Soviet Union posed a threat to us .
And yet we were willing to talk to the Soviet Union at the time when they were saying , ' We 're going to wipe you off the planet . '
And ultimately , that direct engagement led to a series of measures that helped prevent nuclear war and over time allowed the kind of opening that brought down the Berlin Wall . "
What does McCain disagree with in that ?
And do yourself a favor .
Read the quote and then watch the ad .
Now think about what it says about McCain that he would lie this blatantly for power .
We want to hear what you think about this article .
Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com .
John McCain came into the third and final presidential debate needing to somehow wrestle the campaign out of Barack Obama ’s arms .
He did not do it .
There was no single moment that was likely to reverberate in the minds of American voters and change the course of an election that has moved dramatically toward Obama in the last several weeks .
But the 90 - minute debate was a perfect distillation of McCain ’s general election campaign , with all of its inconsistent messages .
He spoke passionately about education and free trade and put Obama on the policy defensive more than in previous debates , but he also spent precious minutes bickering over a domestic radical from the 1960s .
He spoke of his desire to reach peaceably across the aisle , while at times exuding what seemed a barely controlled anger , his jaw clenched as he appeared to show disdain for his opponent .
McCain needed to focus with laser - like intensity on middle - class fears over the faltering economy , the universal concern of undecided voters .
Initially , he did that .
He spoke repeatedly about “ Joe the Plumber ” -- so repeatedly that by mid-debate Obama too was addressing the man who first surfaced this week at an Obama event to question the candidate about taxes .

But soon the Republican was off - topic and into the swamp of cultural issues that voters have said are not important as their retirement savings dwindle and their homes and livelihoods are threatened .
In a race in which millions of dollars have been spent for the votes of American women , McCain managed in a two - question segment to mock laws protecting a woman ’s right to sue for being paid less than a man , and the notion that late - term abortions should be allowed in cases where a mother ’s health is threatened .
“ That ’s the extreme pro-abortion position -- quote , health , ” McCain said .
Early instant polls of voters gave the night to Obama .

“ There was no knockout punch for McCain , and as far as Obama was concerned , at a time of enormous national anxiety and uncertainty he came across as a voice of deliberate and deliberative reason , ” said Mark Petracca , a UC Irvine political scientist who is a Democrat .
Still , McCain had reason to be pleased with parts of the debate .
He appeared far more energetic and focused for much of it , and he touched more on the middle class ’ travails than he did in the previous two debates .
On radio , where his tense demeanor could not be seen , he might have come across more positively , as Richard M. Nixon did in debates with John F. Kennedy .
But on Wednesday , McCain was not helped by television , and particularly not by the networks ’ frequent use of the split screen .
He said repeatedly that Americans were “ angry ” and often looked like the angriest of the lot .
Obama continued with the visage he has perfected in debates this year , a look of amused detachment .
“ The debate was like a Rorschach test , ” said Democratic consultant Chris Lehane .
“ If you like McCain , you probably thought he won , and if you like Obama , you probably thought he won .

“ And since there are more Obama supporters than McCain supporters , then it is a good night for Obama . ”
McCain set a pre-debate goal of separating himself from George W. Bush , and tried repeatedly to do so .
He criticized Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson , the administration ’s point man in the financial crisis , and pounced on Obama ’s suggestion that a McCain presidency would resemble Bush’s .
“ Sen . Obama , I am not President Bush , ” McCain said , in a powerful moment for him .
“ If you wanted to run against President Bush , you should have run four years ago .
I ’m going to give a new direction to this economy in this country . ”
Obama , entering the debate with a widening national lead in most recent polls and with momentum in key states , had far less to prove in the debate .
He sought to hit the same note of cerebral passion that had marked his earlier debate performances .
He , too , returned repeatedly to the difficulties of the middle class , often referring to college as a disappearing dream for some Americans .

With the mien of the front - runner , he could afford to note , as he did several times , issues on which he and McCain agreed .
McCain , tasked with tearing down Obama , was forced into a negative posture that risks alienating voters in times of crisis .
In one response on the matter of free trade , McCain opened and closed with gibes at Obama .
“ Well , you know , I admire so much Sen. Obama ’s eloquence .
And you really have to pay attention to words .
He said , ‘ We will look at offshore drilling . ’
Did you get that ?
Look at , ” McCain said .
He closed by calling free trade with Colombia a “ no - brainer . ”

“ Maybe you ought to travel down there and visit them , and maybe you could understand it a lot better , ” said McCain .
Much of the pre-debate tension hinged on whether McCain would use the debate to criticize Obama ’s connection to 1960s radical William Ayers , now an education professor in Chicago .
McCain has gone after Obama on the Ayers issue in interviews and elliptically at events but did not discuss it in the second debate .
On Wednesday , after moderator Bob Schieffer brought up the nasty tenor of the race , the two candidates launched into a long discourse on the subject in which each blamed the other .

McCain tried to make the case that Obama should not be president because of his past connections to Ayers and the community organizing group ACORN , which Republicans have criticized for voter registration irregularities .
But soon he seemed to decide that voters might not care .
“ All of the details need to be known about Sen .
Obama ’s relationship with them and with ACORN , and the American people will make a judgment , ” he said .
Then he quickly changed course :
“ And my campaign is about getting this economy back on track , about creating jobs , about a brighter future for America .
And that ’s what my campaign is about , and I ’m not going to raise taxes the way Sen .
Obama wants to raise taxes in a tough economy .
And that ’s really what this campaign is going to be about . ”

Poster for the upcoming - directed “ ” film is unveiled .
The film is based on the popular Broadway production , by the same name , and focuses on interview Nixon gave , post - resignation , to English journalist .
Nixon spoke about the Watergate scandal during the sessions , which aired in 1977 .
Oscar - winning director Ron Howard brings to the screen writer ‘s ( “ The Queen , ” “ The Last King of Scotland ” ) electrifying battle between Richard Nixon , the disgraced president with a legacy to save , and David Frost , a jet - setting television personality with a name to make , in the untold story of the historic encounter that changed both : “ Frost / Nixon . ”
Reprising their roles from Morgan ’s stageplay are , who won a Tony for his portrayal of Nixon , and , who fully inhabited the part of Frost onstage in London and New York .
For three years after being forced from office , Nixon remained silent .
But in summer 1977 , the steely , cunning former commander - in - chief agreed to sit for one all - inclusive interview to confront the questions of his time in office and the Watergate scandal that ended his presidency .
Nixon surprised everyone in selecting Frost as his televised confessor , intending to easily outfox the breezy British showman and secure a place in the hearts and minds of Americans .
Likewise , Frost ’s team harbored doubts about their boss ’ ability to hold his own .
But as cameras rolled , a charged battle of wits resulted .
Would Nixon evade questions of his role in one of the nation ’s greatest disgraces ?
Or would Frost confound critics and bravely demand accountability from the man who ’d built a career out of stonewalling ?
Over the course of their encounter , each man would reveal his own insecurities , ego and reserves of dignity - ultimately setting aside posturing in a stunning display of unvarnished truth .
“ Frost / Nixon ” not only re-creates the on-air interview , but the weeks of around - the - world , behind - the - scenes maneuvering between the two men and their camps as negotiations were struck , deals were made and secrets revealed … all leading to the moment when they would sit facing one another in the court of public opinion .
“ Frost / Nixon ” is a collaboration between Imagine Entertainment and Working Title Films , with Academy Award winners Brian Grazer and Ron Howard joining Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner as producers .
Joining Frank Langella and Michael Sheen as the colorful real - life personalities who provide the men counsel is a formidable roster of actors includingand
 W ho and “ whoever  are subjective pronouns ;  whom and whomever  are in the objective case .
That simply means that “ who ” ( and the same for “ whoever ) is always subject to a verb , and that whom ( and the same for whomever ) is always working as an object in a sentence .
As simple and important as that distinction is , many people have difficulty deciding on the proper usage of who and whom in sentences .
The two sentences below illustrate the easy usage in which who is clearly the subject and whom is clearly the object .
In such simple cases , virtually everyone can determine the proper choice :
Who is that masked man ?
( “ Who ” / subject [ subjective case ] )
The men , four of whom are ill , were indicted for fraud .
( “ whom ” / object [ objective case ] )
When “ who ” is not the main subject of the sentence , however , many people become confused .
They tinker and change who to “ whom . ”
It was Thomas Jefferson , I think , who was the third president of the United States .
Notice that who ,  not whom ,  is still the correct form as the subject of the clause that follows .
The proper name , Thomas Jefferson , could be substituted for who to make a perfectly good sentence : Thomas Jefferson was the third president of the United States .
As a ready check in such sentences , simply substitute the personal pronoun he / him or  she / her for who / whom . 
If he or she would be the correct form , the proper choice is who . 
If him  or her would be correct , use  whom . 
This technique of substituting a personal pronoun for the relative pronoun works nicely whenever you have difficulty deciding whether to use who or whom ,  assuming that you have no difficulty using the proper form of personal pronouns .
Even when the word order must be altered slightly , you can use the technique : Mrs. Dimwit consulted an astrologer whom she met in Seattle .
( She met him in Seattle . )
Jones is the man whom I went fishing with last spring .
( I went fishing with him . )
Joyce is the girl who got the job .
( She got the job . )
Whom can we turn to in a time of crisis ?
( Can we turn to her ? )
The delegates differed as to who they thought might win .
( Not whom .
Here the entire clause is the object of the preposition .
Substitution is particularly helpful in cases such as this .
They thought he might win . )
Who is that masked man ?
( subject )
The men , four of whom are ill , were indicted for fraud .
( object )
And , now , for a really tough test ( or , at least , most people trip up on it ) : I decided to vote for whoever / whomever called me first .
Give it to whoever / whomever deserves it .
It 's whoever  in both cases .
Even though you can read the first sentence as  I decided to vote for him ( which would make it  whomever ) , the entire clause  ( he ) called me first is the object of the preposition  for . 
So , it 's whoever . 
It 's the same for the second example : ...he deserves it wins out .
Three easy - to - use rules
so you 'll always get it correct Rule # 1 : Substitute he / him or  she / her :
If it 's either he or  she ,  then it 's “ who ; ” if it 's him  or her ,  then it 's “ whom . ” Rule # 2 : Every verb with a tense in a sentence must have a subject .
And that word is always in the nominative case , so it 's “ who . ”
For example :
In this sentence ,  I decided to vote for whoever called me first :
•  I is the subject of decided 
• he ( whoever ) is the subject of the verb called . 
In the sentence ,  Give it to whoever deserves it  :( [ You ] give it to whoever deserves it . )
• “ he ” ( whoever ) is the subject of the verb deserves . 
This rule supersedes the first rule as it relates to “ who and whom . 
Note : Related to this rule is one that says :
The subject of a clause is always attached to that clause — no matter what .
For example :
Ask whoever reads that book to answer the question .
Break down the sentence thus :
( You ) ask him ( he reads that book ) to answer the question .
In the clause he reads that book ,  you cannot separate the subject he from the clause to which it is attached .
If you remember these two rules — substitute he / him or  she / her ,  and that every verb with a tense must have a subject — you should solve the “ who / whom ” quandary every time .
If you apply those two rules and you 're still not sure , apply the all - important Rule # 3 . Rule # 3 : Give it a sincere and honest effort to determine if it's “ who ” or “ whom . ”
If it takes more than a 30 seconds to figure it out , pick the one that sounds best to the ear ( read it aloud ) and move on .
Why ?
Because even grammarians are likely to squabble over which to use .
But always — always — apply rules # 1 and # 2 before using Rule # 3 .
OK , a quick test .
Pick the correct word :
Ask whoever / whomever comes this way for directions .

Anne Hathaway's Ex Raffaello Follieri Gets 4 - 1/2 Year Prison Sentence
In a Manhattan federal court yesterday , a judge handed down a 4 - 1/ 2 year prison sentence to .
He was also fined $ 1,400 and will serve three years of supervised release after completing his time at either Fort Dix , New Jersey or Otisville , New York .
His next hearing is set for December 12 , 2008 when he will find out which facility will be his new home for the next 54 months .
The wayward ex boyfriend of actress Anne Hathaway could have received up to 265 years in prison after pleading guilty to 14 counts and was ' awarded ' the lighter sentence with the understanding that his lawyer cannot appeal the verdict .
Hathaway assisted the FBI in the hours prior to his arrest .
She has apparently moved on with her life and has been able to put this chapter behind her .
She is even tantalizing us with rumors of a new mystery man .
Follieri made a statement before the court saying : " The most important thing I want the court to know is I was not raised with bad values ... I started off with good intentions .
What I did was wrong and there is no point in making excuses . "
His lawyer followed up by adding : " He started out with good intentions and then sunk and sunk into a quagmire of his own making . "
What 's that old saying ?
' The road to Hell is paved with good intentions ' .
That just about sums it up .

Researchers at UC Santa Barbara have recently reached what they are calling a milestone in experimental quantum mechanics .
In a paper published in the July 17 issue of the journal Nature , UCSB physicists Max Hofheinz , John Martinis , and Andrew Cleland documented how they used a superconducting electronic circuit known as a Josephson phase qubit , developed in Martinis 's lab , to controllably pump microwave photons , one at a time , into a superconducting microwave resonator .
Up to six photons were pumped into and stored in the resonator , and their presence was then detected using the qubit , which acts like an electronic atom , as an analyzer .
The photon number states , known as Fock states , have never before been controllably created , said Cleland .
" These states are ones you learn about in introductory quantum mechanics classes , but no one has been able to controllably create them before , " Cleland said .
Using the same technique , the researchers also created another type of special state , known as a coherent state , in the superconducting resonator .
These states are relatively easily generated , and appear to behave in a completely non-quantum mechanical fashion , but by using the same analysis technique , the UCSB researchers were able to demonstrate the expected underlying quantum behavior .
Hofheinz , a postdoctoral researcher from Germany who 's been at UCSB for the past year working on this project , explained how the resonator works .
" The resonator is the electrical equivalent of a pendulum , " Hofheinz said .
" In quantum mechanics the energy , or amplitude of motion of this pendulum , only comes in finite steps , in quanta .
We first carefully prepared the resonator in these quantum states , and showed we could do this controllably and then measure the states .
Then we ' kicked ' the pendulum directly , a method where the amplitude can take on any value , and appears to not be limited to these quanta .
But when we look at the resonator with our qubit , we see that the amplitude does come in steps , but that the resonator is actually in several such states at the same time , so that on average it looks like it is not limited to the quantum states . "
Hofheinz spent several months in the UCSB Nanofabrication cleanroom fabricating the device used for the experiment .
" This resonator , once you excite it , has to ' swing ' for a very long time , " he explained .
" The first samples I fabricated stopped oscillating very quickly .
We had to work to rearrange the fabrication method to get the resonator to oscillate longer . "
He then fine - tuned the microwave electronics built by Martinis 's group to emit the precisely shaped signals necessary to produce these exciting results .
Martinis , Cleland , and Hofheinz say that their research could help in the quest to build a possible quantum computer , which both the government and industry have been seeking for a long time .
A quantum computer could be used to break – or make – the encryption codes most heavily used for secure communication .
" Harmonic oscillators might allow us to get a quantum computer built more quickly , " Cleland said .
" I think if they really build one of these quantum computers , there will definitely be resonators in them , " Hofheinz said .

Surprised ?
It ’s happening again .
A Milwaukee man is facing foreclosure on his $ 245,000 home because he would n’t pay a $ 50 parking ticket in 2004 .
In what city officials believe is the first case of its kind , the city foreclosed on Tubic ’s house on W. Verona Court after repeated attempts to collect the fine – which over the years had escalated to $ 2,600 – had failed .
“ Our goal is n’t to acquire parcels , ” said Jim Klajbor , special deputy city treasurer .
“ Our goal is to just collect taxes .
. . .
It is only as a last resort that we would pursue . . . foreclosure . ”
I ’m sorry Mr. Special Deputy City Treasurer .
That might not be your INTENTION , but it certainly was your GOAL , because you DID IT .
OK , so the homeowner , a Mr. Tubic , has not paid his parking ticket .
How did he get that parking ticket , anyway ?
Tubic first got the fine for parking his Ford E150 with no license plates in the driveway of the home , which belonged to his parents at the time .
The radiator had broken and Tubic could n’t get his plates renewed unless the van passed an emissions test .
He did n’t have the money to make the repair and had more pressing worries , he said .
His father was suffering from dementia .
His mother was battling cancer , and he was their live - in caretaker .
He needed to shop , cook , clean , maintain the house and tend to his parents ’ needs .
The van repair could wait , he thought .
Then a man from the city showed up and told him otherwise .
It was February 2004 .
Tubic would have to move the van or get license plates for it within 30 days , per city zoning codes , the man said .
Somebody had complained .
His van was without license plates and was parked in his driveway ?!
That ’s it ?!
Where else is he going to park his own van until he fixes it ?
The city park ?
So now it ’s illegal to park your own vehicle on your own property unless your vehicle meets government “ emissions ” guidelines and is registered by the government ??
Argh !
Tubic is a 62 - year old disabled man , on Social Security and “ has been diagnosed with psychological disorders that limit his ‘ ability to understand , remember and carry out detailed instructions , ’ according to documents from the administration . ”
He has degenerative diseases of the knees and spine , and other ailments .
The guy is in poor shape and is an emotional disaster .
The poor guy !
I really have compassion in him .
HOWEVER– even if the guy was a 250 - pound , muscular and wealthy socialite with a Hitler - like moustache , NO ONE’S HOME SHOULD EVER BE CONFISCATED LIKE THIS !
It makes me so angry !
I do n’t want to rehash all the other posts I ’ve written about this subject– you can read more about it on my post , How To Create a Serfdom , which is exactly what the government and their fascist corporations are doing to us .
These tyrants are just DROOLING , waiting for the moment when they can seize our properties , are n’t they ??
Could n’t they have taken the guy ’s CAR , since it was a parking ticket ?
Could n’t they have revoked his license , or something ?
P.S. Tubic did continue to pay his property taxes .
Just remember what Thomas Jefferson said would happen to us if we continue to allow these bullies to keep this up :
“ If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency , first by inflation and then by deflation , the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children will wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered . ”

If Bush , Cheney and their oil buddies ( they only seem to get really excited these days when there 's a bunch of oil or pipelines at stake ) have been making promises the US can't keep , it only serves to create a sort of martyr cause for them to use down the road .

TEOC , Miss . -- Lillie McCain is watching the presidential campaign from a singular perspective .
A 56 - year - old psychology professor whose family spans five generations from the enslavement of her great - great - grandparents to her own generation 's fight for civil rights , Ms. McCain appreciates the social changes that have opened the way for Sen.
Barack Obama to be the first major - party black contender for the White House .
But she also has an uncommon view on another American passage .
Ms. McCain and her siblings are descended from two of about 120 slaves held before the end of the Civil War at Teoc , the Mississippi plantation owned by the family of Republican nominee John McCain 's great - great - grandfather .
In a year when the historic nature of Sen .
Obama 's candidacy is drawing much comment , the case of the Teoc McCains offers another quintessential American narrative in black and white .
For the black McCain family , it is a story of triumph over the legacy of slavery ; for the white McCains , it is the evolution of a 19th - century cotton dynasty into one rooted in an ethic of military and national service .
Last week , I drove past the 22 - acre vacant lot once known as the Ambassador Hotel .
As I looked at the rubble of our lost cause , I pulled over , sat back and gave in to a feeling I can only describe as guilt .
I thought about my connection to the once - iconic hotel , about why places like it are so difficult to save , and about what it takes to be a better , more effective advocate for historic buildings .
I was just a little girl the first time I visited the Ambassador .
My father held my hand and led me down a long hallway before we stopped in front of an ornate facade .
I remember Dad ’s smile as he slowly opened the door to ... the fabulous Cocoanut Grove nightclub !
In the magic of a perfect moment , I looked up and saw a parade of dreams etched across the face of the man I loved more than anyone in the world .
It was at that moment that something clicked inside my little 9 - year - old brain , something that helps me , even today , believe in the ability of the built world to change the trajectory of our lives .
In our battle against the Los Angeles Unified School District ’s decision to tear down the Ambassador and put up a new school , we made many arguments .
We focused on “ reuse ” as an economic incentive .
The LAUSD was n’t buying it .
We hired a team of architects to come up with options that would transform Myron Hunt ’s 350,000 - square - foot building into a series of classrooms , administrative offices and low - and moderate - income housing .
That did n’t fly either .
Neither did the argument that the Ambassador was a national landmark , or that six Oscar ceremonies had been hosted there , or that Judy Garland , Frank Sinatra and even Barbra Streisand broke hearts on the stage of the Cocoanut Grove .
It did n’t matter .
Nothing stopped the Ambassador from becoming another little death of no consequence .
Preservation has always been a hard sell in Los Angeles .
But maybe in the years ahead it wo n’t be as hard as it used to be , considering several new facts .
No. 1 , as my Dad would have said , a building represents an enormous investment of energy -- much bigger than we thought when we were fighting to save the Ambassador .
No. 2 , we now know that construction of new structures alone consumes 40 % of the raw materials that enter our economy every year .
No. 3 , according to the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation , the resources required to manufacture these materials and transport them to a site and assemble them into a structure is the equivalent of consuming 5 to 15 gallons of oil per square foot .
No. 4 , a Brookings Institution study indicates that the construction of new buildings alone will destroy one - third of our existing building stock by 2030 .
And finally , No. 5 , the energy used to destroy older buildings in addition to the energy used to build new ones could power the entire state of California for 10 years , according to the National Trust for Historic Preservation .

We ’ve treated old buildings like we once treated plastic shopping bags -- we have n’t reused them , and when we ’ve finished with them , we ’ve tossed them out .
This has to stop .
Preservation must stand alongside conservation as an equal force in the sustainability game .
More older and historic buildings have to be protected from demolition , not only because it affects our pocketbooks but more important because it threatens our environment .
Let ’s face it , our free ride at the expense of the planet is over .
I ’ll never understand why architecture is considered a second cousin to painting and film .
We ’ve never been married to our romance with architecture .
A building , unlike a canvas or a DVD , is a massive work of art with many diverse uses .
We watch movies in buildings .
We look at paintings on their walls .
We pray in cathedrals .
We live inside places we call homes .
Home gives us faith in the belief of a well - lived life .
When we tear down a building , we are wiping out lessons for the future .
If we think of it that way , we will begin to understand the emotional impact of wasting the energy and resources used to build it in the first place .
As for me , I ’m keeping the door to the Cocoanut Grove open .
I ’m still holding on to my father ’s hand and the memory that grew to inspire my dream of a golden -- now green -- future among structures that stand as invitations to a past we can only imagine by being in their presence .

An interesting abstract from the latest Nordic Journal of Psychiatry : when given otherwise identical case reports of murderers marked either male or female , psychiatrists and psychology students were more likely to declare women ‘ not guilty by reason of insanity ’ .
In contrast , judges showed an interesting same sex bias , in that they were more likely to declare a person of the same sex ‘ legally insane ’ than a perpetrator of the opposite sex .
Evidence of gender bias in legal insanity evaluations : a case vignette study of clinicians , judges and students .
Nord J Psychiatry .
2008;62(4) :273-8. Yourstone J , Lindholm T , Grann M , Svenson O. Forensic psychiatric decision - making plays a key role in the legal process of homicide cases .
Research show that women defendants have a higher likelihood of being declared legally insane and being diverted to hospital .
This study attempted to explore if this gender difference is explained by biases in the forensic psychiatric assessments .
Participants were 45 practicing forensic psychiatric clinicians , 46 chief judges and 80 psychology students .
Participants received a written vignette describing a homicide case , with either a female or a male perpetrator .
The results suggested strong gender effects on legal insanity judgements .
Forensic psychiatric clinicians and psychology students assessed the case information as more indicative of legal insanity if the perpetrator was a woman than a man .
Judges assessed offenders of their own gender , as they were more likely to be declared legally insane than a perpetrator of the opposite gender .
Implications of and possible ways to minimize such gender biases in forensic psychiatric evaluations need to be thoroughly considered by the legal system .

Deputy Sheriff Doug
Cox said in a police report made public this week , that employees discovered the letters at their desks after returning from Labor Day weekend .
Apparently , Republican county election clerk distributed copies of a chain letter referring to presidential nominee Obama as a “ young , black Adolf Hitler . ”
She said she meant it as a joke .
It seems she was caught on video tape dropping off the letter .
One of the workers complained , and surveillance video showed Johnson County Clerk Jill Jackson placing an item one worker ’s desk at 5:27 p.m. on the Friday of Labor Day weekend , Cox said .
“ She admitted to being responsible for the letter , but only did it as a joke , ” Cox said .
Jackson told police she had intended to speak with the workers upon returning to work but forgot .
Doug Lechner , Republican Party chairman , said the letter was unacceptable and taints Jackson ’s ability to appear unbiased in administering this year ’s election .
Jackson ’s position has her overseeing vote counts and training poll workers , which it why this particular incident is upsetting to everyone considering the racial references in the chain letter were so strong .
It is heavy with racial references , criticizing the candidate ’s parentage with such comments as , “ He is proud of his ‘ African heritage ’ ( a father who got a white girl pregnant and deserted her ) ” and asking , “ Where is the pride in his ‘ White heritage ? ' ”
The county prosecutor said she did n’t violate any laws , however , a worker did complain .
As far as any disciplinary action , none has been reported .
If I find out that a reprimand has been imposed , I will post an update .
The Los Angeles Police Department has acknowledged in a confidential report that people have been falsely implicated in crimes because the department ’s fingerprint experts wrongly identified them as suspects .
The 10 - page internal report , obtained by The Times , highlighted two cases in which criminal defendants had charges against them dropped after problems with the fingerprint analysis were exposed .
LAPD officials do not know how many other people might have been wrongly accused over the years as a result of poor fingerprint analysis and do not have the funds to pay for a comprehensive audit to find out , according to police records and interviews .
“ This is something of extraordinary concern , ” said Michael Judge , public defender for Los Angeles County .
“ Juries tend to accord the highest level of confidence to fingerprint evidence .
This is the type of thing that easily could lead to innocent people being convicted . ”
The two cases were used by investigators to illustrate broader problems with shoddy work and poor oversight that have plagued the department ’s Latent Print Unit .
Rhonda Sims - Lewis , chief of the LAPD ’s administrative and technical bureau , acknowledged the findings , but said changes to the unit ’s leadership and protocols were made last year after senior officials became aware of problems .

Internal discipline investigations led to the firing of one fingerprint analyst , who had been involved in both of the mishandled cases .
Three other analysts received suspensions , Sims - Lewis said .
In addition , two supervisors responsible for overseeing the unit were replaced , staff was bolstered and oversight tightened , she said .
“ This is very , very serious , ” Sims - Lewis said .
“ We feel very compelled to take quick action when something like this arises .
Guilty people can be set free and innocent people can be jailed . ”
There are 78 forensic print specialists assigned to the unit , according to the department ’s website .
They are not sworn police officers but among the hundreds of civilians who fill specialty jobs in the department .
After prints are lifted from a crime scene , the specialists run them through automated databases to find possible matches and then analyze those to seek a more precise match .
Two other analysts are then supposed to check the work for accuracy .
Sims - Lewis and other department officials , however , described a poorly run operation , in which records and evidence were left lying around or misplaced , and supervisors “ were stuck in the old way of doing things . ”
Pressed to explain the sloppy work of the unit , Yvette Sanchez - Owens , commanding officer of the Scientific Investigation Division , speculated that “ people were reviewing the work of friends and just rubber stamping it without really reviewing it . ”

In one of the cases highlighted in the report , a man was extradited from Alabama to face burglary charges after an analyst matched his prints to those found at the scene .
The mistake was missed by two reviewers and was caught only when a third reviewer was preparing to testify at the trial .
In the other example , Maria Delosange Maldonado , a pregnant hospital technician , was charged in February 2006 with breaking into a San Fernando Valley cellphone store .
When questions were raised about the accuracy of the print analysis , the LAPD said the prints could not be reexamined because they had been lost .
The audit characterized the fingerprint identification in that case as “ erroneous . ”
Sandi Gibbons , a spokeswoman for Dist .
Atty Steve Cooley , said the D.A. 's office was “ looking into ” the question of what , if anything , prosecutors should do to better guard against faulty evidence making it into a courtroom .
The LAPD ’s internal investigation challenges the widely held view that forensic matches made by fingerprint experts are airtight .
The authors of the internal LAPD report recalled the infamous example of an Oregon man who was linked through faulty fingerprint analysis by three federal agents to the 2004 terrorist train bombings in Madrid .

Jack Weiss , chairman of the City Council ’s public safety committee said there was “ nothing more basic and more bread and butter than fingerprints .
You have to be able to take each one of them to the bank . ”
He said he will hold hearings on the issue and call fingerprint lab employees to testify before his panel .
“ We want to know the extent of it and whether it affects any other cases .
We want to know how far back it goes , ” he said .
Los Angeles police officials had initially planned to hire an outside expert last year to conduct a top - to - bottom review of the unit .
They failed , however , to secure the $ 325,000 to $ 450,000 from city coffers needed for the review .
In - house auditors were used instead , but Sims - Lewis acknowledged that they did not have the expertise required to comprehensively examine the unit ’s past and current practices .
“ We still want outside eyes to come in and make sure we ’re doing things right , ” she said .
The focus of the audit would be improving the operation , officials said , but they also believe it would uncover past errors if any had been made .

Although there is no way to be certain without the full audit , Sim - Lewis said she was confident that faulty work by the unit had not sent an innocent person to prison or freed someone who was guilty .
Mistakes , she said , would have been caught by experts hired by defense attorneys .
Judge , the public defender , disputed that notion and called on the city to hire the outside auditor .
“ Law enforcement should take seriously this matter by investing more in testing and studies , and by focusing more on these people they are sending into court with very powerful evidence . ”

German prosecutors and police today raided the Frankfurt headquarters of state - owned bank KfW , looking into a case suspected criminal breach of trust .
Prosecutors said they had opened an investigation into whether the bank 's executives acted criminally in allowing KfW to transfer € 319 m ( £ 251 m ) to US investment bank Lehman Brothers on the day it went bankrupt .
The investigation has been set up to establish whether executives breached their fiduciary duties – the legal relationship of trust – by failing to prevent the transfer when knowledge of Lehman 's liquidity problems were already in the public domain .
Peer Steinbrueck , the German finance minister and a KfW supervisory board member , and other ministers knew about Lehman 's difficulties throughout the weekend before the American bank went bust on Monday September 15 .
When news of the transfer broke , enraged cabinet ministers forced the resignation of two executive board members of what became labelled Germany 's " dumbest bank " .
The head of risk management also quit .
KfW said today it was cooperating fully with state prosecutors and the federal criminal police ( BKA ) and handing over all relevant documents and information .
The bank led the rescue of industrial lender IKB , one of the first European banks to be hit by the US sub - prime crisis in August 2007 , and handled its subsequent takeover a year later for a knock - down price by Texas - based private equity firm Lone Star .
Mayor Bloomberg criticized the city 's Board of Elections , after BOE officials said Election Day could be chaotic , " This is a joke ... this public is badly served by this agency as any city or state thing I 've seen . "
Yesterday , a number of reports noted concern over whether the BOE would be able to deal with the hundreds of thousands of new voter registrations and Election Day itself , and the BOE has cited under - financing as a reason for possible isues .
Specifically , Board official Frederic Umane had said , " We just hope that people would be as patient when they try to vote as they would be trying to wait for a hamburger at one of the more fancy hamburger places , which I understand the lines can be up to two or three hours . "
However Bloomberg , who is no fan of the partisan BOE , said , " We 've got a check for $ 20 million , just sitting there .
All they have to do is pick it up .
But they 're not getting the money until they tell us what they 're going to do with it .
This is preposterous . "
He further explained , " They keep saying they need more money and they wo n't tell us what they want to do with it .
We keep making suggestions , putting a sample ballot on the web ; they wo n't do it .
What about recruiting poll workers who have to have training before ?
We require training .
They do n't pay any attention to it .
What about poll workers from good government groups , rather then just political parties ?
You know , this is an outrage . "
The BOE 's spokeswoman called Bloomberg 's remarks " unfortunate " since it 's " less than a week before a historic election where we expect unprecedented turnout . "
And Umane told NY1 , " We believed we 're as ready as we could be .
If we had money , we could hire an extra 50 , 70 , 100,000 people to work .
We 've hired an excess of 36,000 people .
We hope most of them show up . "
Not every comedy sketch on " Saturday Night Live " has to do with Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin .
It just seems that way recently , as The Ticket has reported here and here and here .
But there 's an unusual twist this week over another SNL skit .
This one concerns a long , satirical bit about the Washington financial bailout bill including a " President Bush , " a House Speaker " Nancy Pelosi " and a Rep. " Barney Frank . "
Pelosi introduces a series of alleged " victims " of the Wall Street mess , who include two men clearly unqualified to have any kind of mortgage , a well - to - do couple who speculated in condos and lost all but 10 % of their profits and an older couple , Herb and Marion Sandler .
As our blogging colleagues Peter Viles at L.A. Land and Matea Gold Show Tracker have thoroughly documented , the Sandlers actually exist and are prominent supporters of liberal and Democratic causes .
They assembled a vast array of subprime loan packages in their Golden West Financial and sold it to Wachovia Bank for $ 24 billion before the financial bottom fell out .
In the skit , a parody of a C - SPAN news conference replay , the Sandlers express puzzlement over why Pelosi invited them as victims because they 're really delighted with their fortune and laughingly see Wachovia Bank as the victim .
A graphic beneath the Sandlers says , " People who should be shot . "
Monday NBC mysteriously yanked the skit 's video from the network 's website , fueling online rumors the show was caving to pressures from well - connected Democrats .
The video was later reposted and a spokesman explained " upon review we caught certain elements in the sketch that did n't meet our standards .
We took it down and made some minor changes . "
In an interview with Gold , the show 's executive producer , Lorne Michaels , said the Sandlers were distraught but had not demanded the changes .
He noted the " People who should be shot " line was deleted as was a reference to their " corrupt activities . "
But a comparison of the two versions shows that actually a little more than that was cut .
What also was excised was any mention of the involvement of Massachusetts '
Rep. Frank in the Sandler subprime mess .
Frank is the influential chairman of the House Financial Services Committee and an ardent political protector of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , which participated in the subprime problem .
In the original skit Sandler addresses Frank , saying , " And thank you , Congressman Frank , as well as many Republicans for helping block Congressional oversight of our corrupt activities . "
To which Frank replies enthusiastically , " Not at all ! "
All that 's gone in the new version , which Show Tracker has posted here .
That 's too bad for Frank 's Republican opponent in the House election next month for the Bay State 's Fourth District , which includes Brookline and Newton .
Frank 's opponent is little - known Republican Earl Henry Sholley , who could use any embarrassing ammunition like the SNL sketch .
Never mind any grand policy proposals .
Sholley 's still trying to get Frank to agree to simple public debates .
Frank dismisses his GOP challenger , saying he simply can't make the dates Sholley has suggested .
And that 's that .

( Fortune Magazine ) --
The mood in the ballroom at Cipriani Wall Street was exultant as several hundred influential New Yorkers gathered last year at the Women Who Make a Difference gala to benefit the National Council for Research on Women .
Dina Dublon , a PepsiCo board member and former CFO of J.P. Morgan Chase , introduced one of the evening 's honorees , PepsiCo chairman Steve Reinemund , who was about to hand over his post to his chosen successor , Indra Nooyi .
In her remarks , Dublon noted that Reinemund was the first man ever to receive an award from the group , adding that he was " part of our No Man Left Behind program . "
The mostly female audience laughed appreciatively , but the truth behind the jest stirred conversation .
The suddenly pensive diners traded stories about men they knew who had lost their jobs or their marriages or both , and were now basically idle , taking up golf or the piano , writing that novel , doing nothing .
The women spoke about brothers , sons , nephews , and husbands .
" It 's weird how everyone has a story like this , " remarked a woman officer from a Fortune 1,000 company .
" There 's definitely something going on . "
What 's going on is a conundrum with economic and cultural ramifications for both men and women .
From the classroom to the boardroom , American men are losing ground .
It affects affluent white men in the heartland and young immigrants in the Southwest , computer nerds and family guys .
To some extent it 's the inevitable result of greater competition from women - as barriers have fallen , women have achieved according to their potential .
But it raises a critical question :
If the playing field is level , why are so many men tripping up and dropping out ?
Why have they failed to keep up not only with women but with the higher competitive standards of the global marketplace ?
That failure is not just eroding the ability of men to earn a living and become contributing members of society but also undermining the very definition of what it means to be a man .
No wonder that cable reality shows like Ice Road Truckers and Deadliest Catch , which glorify men who do dangerous , physically demanding jobs , have struck a nostalgic chord in the zeitgeist .
America 's gender divide starts in elementary school and progresses through college , where women now earn 60 % of all degrees ( 51 % of the total U.S. population is female ) .
On American college campuses , women now outnumber men by more than two million .
" Women have been making educational progress , and men are stuck , " Tom Mortenson , senior scholar for the Pell Institute for the Study of Opportunity in Higher Education , told the Associated Press .
" They have n't just fallen behind women .
They have fallen behind changes in the job market . "
Those changes tend to favor women , whose innate networking and social skills often give them an edge in the service industry , now the fastest - growing sector of the U.S. economy .
In corporate America the cycle has accelerated because women tend to know their customers : other women .
The ability of women consumers to make or break a brand is being felt in industries from publishing to health care .
Women , armed with advanced degrees and expanding spending power , are increasingly seen as the decision - makers in housing , autos , and technology .
And that power is showing up in paychecks .
While women on average still earn less than men , the gap in some areas has reversed itself .
A study by the Citizens Union Foundation calculated that females between the ages of 21 and 30 earned 117 % of male wages in the same age group ; U.S. Census figures confirm that women in their 20s already make more than their male counterparts in major cities like New York , Los Angeles , Chicago , Boston , Minneapolis , and Dallas .
As many women 's earnings have soared , incomes for men , including those with college degrees , have stalled or declined .
Ronald Mincy , a professor of social policy at Columbia University , has spent a decade tracking what he considers a very ominous number .
" We 've seen no growth in the average hourly earnings of men in 25 years - and that is the biggest , most glaring statistic because as the earnings of men go , so go the fortunes of men , " he observes .
One consequence could be a painful impact on family life .
A pillar of male identity is the ability to work - to earn money and social status to help support a wife and family .
" If you 're a man , " says Mincy , " you ca n't play house if you 're not making enough money at your job . "
Most disturbing of all , perhaps , is the drift of able - bodied unemployed men of all ages who are dropping out of the workforce altogether .
Among American men in their prime working years - between the ages of 30 and 55 - 13 % are not working , up from 5 % during the 1960s , according to the New York Times .
Most of those men , who number about four million , are former blue - collar workers who have been displaced .
But a growing number are college - educated professionals in their 30s and 40s who have been out of a job for years .
While it 's been widely noted that women have innate skills that help them thrive in an organization - communication , multitasking , collaboration - what 's less well - known is how this extends to global competition .
Geert Hofstede , a Dutch psychologist who worked at IBM and now consults at major corporations , has profiled national cultures according to key values , including masculinity .
On that index the U.S. scores relatively high at 62 , compared with countries like Sweden ( 5 ) and Norway ( 8 ) , but lower than Japan , which has the highest masculinity index in the world at 95 .
For Christopher Liechty , a design and marketing executive based in Salt Lake City , " Masculine is primarily competitive and prestige - oriented ; feminine is primarily nurturing , caring , but that means egalitarianism .
Women are more consensus - building . "
Liechty notes that when national gender values are overlaid onto corporations , many of those with the most " feminine " traits , including Scandinavian companies like Nokia ( NOK ) , IKEA , Lego , and Volvo , have an inclusive brand identity that often gives them an edge in today 's global - and increasingly feminine - markets .
The world , it turns out , may be curved after all .
Help for struggling U.S. males will have to take many forms , starting with school .
But one way for men to help themselves is to take a few pages from the female playbook : less hierarchy , more networking ; less aggression , more consensus .
Not all men are swimming against the tide .
" Women are playing a bigger role , but I think it 's a good thing , " says an affable , 34 - year - old software designer in the Washington , D.C. , area , who says he has no problems working for a woman ( but did n't want his name used ) .
" Change is difficult , though , and some guys will have an identity crisis . "
To put it in bluntly male terms , those who fail to adapt may find their next position is at the end of an unemployment line .

Something to chew over : Eating fast makes you fat
Slow down : People who wolf down their food treble their risk of being overweight
If you 're wondering why your waistline is expanding , do n't watch what you eat .
Watch how you eat .
Those who wolf down dinner apparently treble their risk of being overweight .
Scientists suggest the modern manner of eating too quickly - and until absolutely full - is a significant factor in the obesity epidemic .
Such eating habits pile on the pounds much more than expected , even taking into account the amount of calories consumed , the scientists found .
They suspect the joint impact of eating fast and until full overrides signals in the brain which would normally encourage a little more self control .
A study published today in the British Medical Journal Online First blames the couch potato lifestyles of fast food , larger portions , TV dinners and the demise of family mealtimes for contributing to the problem .
Professor Hiroyasu Iso and colleagues from Osaka University , Japan , carried out a study involving 3,200 Japanese men and women aged 30 - 69 years between 2003 and 2006 .
Those participating were sent a diet history questionnaire .
Half of the men and 58 per cent of the women said they normally ate until they were full .
Just under half of men and a third of women said they ate quickly .
The group of participants who said they ate ' until full and ate quickly ' had a higher body mass index or BMI , the scoring system that measures obesity levels .
They also had a higher total energy intake than those who did not ' eat until full and did not eat quickly ' .
Both men and women in this group were three times more likely to be overweight than those who said this was not the way they ate .
Professor Iso said the combination had a ' supra- additive ' effect on the risk of being overweight - more than would be expected if each eating habit was examined in isolation .
' If you eat slowly then there is some feedback from the brain that this is enough , and this helps stop you eating before you are full , ' he said .
' It 's speculation at the moment but it is worth pursuing and fits with modern lifestyles . '
Dr David Haslam , GP and clinical director for the National Obesity Forum , said : ' These kind of studies are very helpful because they 're not about genetic causes of obesity , which people feel they can't do anything about , but human behaviour .
' The great dietary gurus of a century ago stressed the importance of chewing food for a long time and eating slowly , and those messages are even more important today . '
This video , put together by a Romney supporter ( who just has to be banging his head against the wall right now watching McCain ) kinda makes you wonder exactly what McCain thinks he 's bringing to the table that merits the " suspension " of his campaign .
BARTIROMO : Sen .
McCain , has Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke cut interest rates aggressively enough ?
Has Ben Bernanke cut interests rates aggressively enough ?
McCAIN : I 'm not ... I 'm not ... I do n't have that kind of expertise to know exactly whether he has cut interest rates suffiently or not .
I 'm glad that whenever they cut interest rates .
I wish interest rates were zero .
Um , huh ?
Interest rates at ZERO ????
Oh yeah , this is the guy I want negotiating the bailout .
' Course , it might help if he bothered to read the Paulson plan .

The evacuees from Hurricane Gustav had just returned home September 5th when Hurricane Ike began to head for the Gulf of Mexico .
National news covered the track of Ike through the Gulf non -stop in the five days leading up to landfall .
More than a million
Texans sought shelter away from the coast and countless more piled in with family and friends .
The storm came aground on around 1:00 AM on Saturday , September 14th with a category 5 surge of saltwater and category 2 winds of 115 mph .
In the dark of the night 45 , 000 homes were destroyed and millions of residents lost electricity , water , and roofs .
Then Ike turned north , leaving hundreds of thousands more Americans without power in a 200 mile wide swath from the Gulf Coast to the Great Lakes .
And then there was silence .
No hum of air conditioners .
No stereos blasting or people singing off key .
No loudspeaker from the football games on Friday night .
Just an eerie quiet as people emerged from their hiding places to survey the damage .
The Media was not allowed to film people being rescued from rooftops in Texas .
They were prohibited from flying over the small towns and beaches isolated by flooding and decimated by the hurricane .
Local press raged about the conditions , then fell silent in a game of play - nice hoping to be allowed at least limited access .
Not once did the national press report this suspension of the first amendment .
The sound of black hawk helicopters could be heard for miles .
With cable TV down , and electricity at a premium , the primary source of information was local radio .
Listeners tuned in hoping for updates and relevant information which seemed to come irregularly between endless chatter .
If you had an antennae and power you might have been able to tune into the local news .
For seven days after the storm only local news was broadcast .
Not a whisper of Caylee , or OJ , or Palin , nor the economic crises was heard for an entire week .
Most relied on neighbors and friends for information in shared conversations over piles of debris .
Phone service was completely unreliable and is still spotty in most areas .
Sometimes a call would randomly go through only to be randomly dropped .
For a while only text messages got through .
My mother finally tackled the texting learning curve from her closet as the storm raged outside .
It 's hard to express how you are really feeling in a simple text message while water pours into your bedroom .
Nobody can hear you groan .
One day after the storm it rained , re-flooding homes and washing out roads .
People started to clean up the debris and looters targeted homes instead of businesses .
Some people went shopping and ice skating in the Houston Galleria , a surreal bubble of air conditioned normalcy .
Local power trucks went out to assess the damage .
2000 people were rescued off Boliver by the Coast Guard .
Stories began to roll in of residents who had tried to evacuate but found the ferry closed and the roads blocked by water .
Evacuees in remote shelters began to check out , determined to get information on their home towns .
The sound of cars driving around trees in the road began to weave its way back into the landscape .
24 hours after landfall , Ike began to disappear from the national news .
48 hours after landfall CNN and the Weather Channel evacuated Galveston Island and the airwaves fell silent .

Most people thought they would be back to work on that first Monday , but they were largely wrong .
Millions of addresses did not have power .
Elevators did not work .
Trees blocked roads .
A mere 100 traffic lights were working .
A million people had no running water .
Broken glass littered the streets of downtown .
No local shelters had been opened , 14 regional hospitals were closed , and FEMA had not yet begun to distribute ice or water .
Press conferences were relegated to sound bytes and Ike disappeared completely the front page of the most papers .
Thousands who had ridden out the storm were bussed off Galveston Island .
Evacuees who had left before the storm began being bussed back " closer to home and work " .
Employers booked hotel rooms for employees to keep their businesses running .
Stillness fell over 3 million customers still in the dark .
The hum of generators , a distinct growling , failed to drown out the buzz of mosquitoes .
On Tuesday , after President Bush had concluded his tour of the area , an army of repair trucks was finally deployed and PODs were set up .
Rice University resumed classes and students bagged free ice for the neighbors .
City , state and federal teams tried to stay calm with one other , a strained exercise at best .
Local news continued to be purely local .
And inversely , not many locals had power or a TV signal , so they hardly noticed .
Information increased as a premium , Where can I buy gas ?
Are the banks open ?
Where can I charge my nebulizer ?
Sleep with my c-pap machine ?
Find safe drinking water ?
Buy a tarp ?
Or a generator ?
Price gouging ran amok .
Half a million people finally had running water after 3 days , but the sound of flushing toilets and running showers seemed oddly loud by candlelight .
By the first Wednesday after the storm plans were announced , then changed , and changed again .
3.5 million people sought ice and water and gas and more food as they lived without power .
FEMA announced hotel vouchers available online or via phone , the two services least reliable for days to come .
Elderly Houston residents , living in high rise independent living facilities , were discovered left to their own devices without a /c or elevators .
The shuffling of their determined feet in the dark stairwells could be hard as they climbed to check on their friends .
One week after Ike struck less than 50 % of electricity had been restored .
250,000 people lived without water , most had missed a paycheck , and temperatures were rising .
The bars hopped on Friday night .
People clustered on brightly lit restaurant patios sharing a hot meal and telling tales .
Entrepreneurs ran generators and beaconed to patrons who went home to inky black bedrooms and non-perishable pop top snacks .
Normalcy resumed to some degree for those who could get it .
For many it did not .
Suspended somewhere between shelters and flooded homes , people still went back to work if they could .
Jaws were clenched , but the recovery moved forward .
Pride kept words from being said out loud .
The second Monday brought the long run home .
Less than 1000 traffic lights were in working order .
Rush hour resumed and a seven mile drive took four hours .
There was a sort of togetherness among the people .
It was important to be polite .
There was surprisingly little honking .
Miles of drivers hunkered down in their air conditioned cars talking on cell phones and reassuring themselves that this was a sign of normalcy .
Two weeks after this disaster 1.5 million people still go home to no power but that which they provide for themselves .
The blue light of televisions run by generators blares out into the darkness .
The sound of the newscasters voices are more frequently replaced by a game or movie .
Cable is restored with news that never mentions Hurricane Ike .
The remote shelters have all closed .
All evacuees have been bussed back to their city of origin , found the rare hotel room , or bunked wherever they could .
People in Galveston sleep in tents .
FEMA ceased distributing ice and water days ago .
Only two regional hospitals are reopened .
Warnings about mold , vermin , mosquitoes , and " germs " are issued with reminders that medical care is not readily available .
Restoration of power schedules are pushed back for lack of parts .
Debris will not be removed until after Thanksgiving , or New Year 's if we are lucky .
245 , 000 Texans applied for emergency food stamps .
Food banks are distributing four times their normal amount in an attempt to meet demand .
More than 250,000 households have applied for FEMA assistance .
There are no empty hotel rooms for 300 miles .
The scurrying of bugs and rustling rodents amid the debris keeps people up at night .
I like to think that if America knew of the suffering in the south that help might be forthcoming .
That maybe Galveston residents would not be sleeping in tents and fire stations might have the gas they need to go out on calls .
I imagine that children would not be forced to sleep in cars because they can't find a FEMA hotel room .
I would like to believe that the nation would protest the thought of waiting to bring in FEMA trailers until next week or the policy of bussing people " closer to home and work " when those places do n't even exist anymore .
But the rest of the nation does n't know all these things because more reporters are covering OJ and Caylee than the millions of Americans disrupted by Ike .
It 's been three weeks and it will certainly be many more before this is over .
The Texas Guard is rolling out .
Clean up crews and tow trucks rattle down the streets .
Chainsaws replace generators .
But still , the silence is deafening .
Seriously deafening .
As if no one is paying any attention at all .
Click above for high - res gallery of 2011 Chevy Volt
Inside Line kicked up a dust storm yesterday by claiming that the 2011 Chevy Volt could not recharge its batteries while driving using its on - board , range - extending 1.4L gas engine .
40 miles of electric - only drive was it , and then the battery packs become " 400 pounds of uselessness " was what IL said .
They got this impression from a press release issued when the production Volt was unveiled to the public , which stated that the gas engine could only " sustain " the battery pack 's charge and not increase it .
GM got its communications crossed and apparently confirmed IL 's take , but has thought about it some more and today reconfirmed what we initially thought was true , that the Volt 's gas engine can recharge its batteries while underway .
What the Volt 's gas engine can't do is completely recharge the battery pack to its full capacity .
Rather , when load conditions are light the gas engine will send surplus electrons to the battery pack , which will also be receiving extra charge from regenerative braking , as well .
That sounds about right to us , as we 've always been told that constantly charging a battery to its maximum will shorten its life , as the optimum charge range is usually between 20 and 80 percent , not completely drained and not completely charged .
GM is determining right now just how much it wants to let the gas engine charge the Volt 's battery pack , but rest comfortably knowing that your future Volt wo n't be carrying around 400 lbs. of uselessness when the charge runs out .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A false Internet report that Apple Inc ’s Steve Jobs had suffered a heart attack briefly slammed his company ’s stock on Friday and raised fresh questions about the delicate relationship between traditional and new media .
Apple Inc CEO
Steve Jobs speaks at Apple 's " Let 's Rock " media event in San Francisco , California September 9 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Robert Galbraith
The posting on iReport.com -- a citizen journalist site owned by Time Warner Inc ’s CNN -- is the most recent incident in which a faulty online report created brief , but wrenching , confusion among investors .
Apple quickly denied the report about its chief executive , but not before its stock dropped more than 2 percent , hitting a 17 - month low of $ 94.65 .
It later recovered , climbing as much as 4 percent , before closing at $ 97.07 , down 3.03 percent for the day .
The report claimed Jobs was rushed to the emergency room after suffering “ a major heart attack . ”
CNN later removed the posting from iReport.com and disabled the user ’s account .
“ iReport.com is an entirely user - generated site where the content is determined by the community , ” CNN said in a statement .
“ Content that does not comply with Community Guidelines will be removed .
After the content in question was uploaded to iReport.com , the community brought it to our attention . ”
A spokeswoman added that CNN attempted to reach the user -- based on information that was provided at registration -- but was unsuccessful .
The iReport.com site carries a disclaimer stating : “ CNN makes no guarantees about the content or the coverage on iReport.com . ”
The incident highlights the risks involved with mainstream media organizations tapping into what is often referred to as “ citizen journalism , ” the unedited and unfiltered presentation of news by non-professional reporters such as bloggers and eyewitnesses to events .
Reuters is among those that have undertaken efforts in the area of citizen journalism .
While more news outlets are welcoming contributions from their audience , so far there has been little agreement about standards , and they often rely on trust .
To be sure , mainstream media has reported its share of incorrect news , and media experts said that it would be unfair to tarnish a vibrant movement in journalism based on one high - profile incident .
“ Are we going to let one bad apple besmirch the entire orchard ?
That ’s ludicrous , ” said media consultant and Buzzmachine.com blogger Jeff Jarvis .
The report comes about a month after Jobs , who is often perceived as irreplaceable as Apple ’s leader , appeared thin , but jaunty as he introduced new iPod digital music players .
He walked on a stage in front of a screen that flashed “ The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated ” -- a quotation borrowed from Mark Twain .
Before that event , investors had been concerned about the cancer survivor ’s health after he appeared thin at another product launch in June .
In 2004 , Jobs , 53 , said he had undergone successful surgery to remove a rare type of pancreatic cancer .
Volatile trading in Apple ’s shares on Friday may also have been influenced by Barclays Capital ’s report that it slashed its price target on Apple to $ 135 a share from $ 180 .
Jimmy Wales , founder of the user - edited encyclopedia Wikipedia that has emerged as the biggest reference site on the Web , said community - editing helps catch the vast majority of errors or outright falsehoods on such sites .
“ Within the community people know each other and they know when to trust each other , ” Wales told Reuters .
“ Occasionally there are errors that slip through and make headlines . ”
“ The paradox is that it is hard for CNN to move into citizen journalism because the errors are much more believable if it is from CNN than it would be from just any citizen journalist site , ” Wales said .
Last month , a nearly 6 - year - old news story on the 2002 bankruptcy filing of UAL Corp resurfaced on the Internet , briefly crushing the airline ’s shares .
Novell has announced the availability of OpenSUSE 11.1 beta 3 , the latest prerelease of the company 's community - driven desktop Linux distribution .
It offers some nice improvements and comes with the latest versions of popular open source software programs .
This beta release ships with version 2.6.27 of the Linux kernel , which was released earlier this month and includes improved support for webcam devices and the new ath9 k wireless driver .
Another exciting recent release comes bundled with beta 3 : Mono 2.0 , the new version of Novell 's open source .NET implementation , which is compatible with C# 3.0 and has improved support for Windows .
Forms .
OpenSUSE 11.1 beta 3 also includes OpenOffice.org ( OOo ) 3.0 , which was released earlier this month .
As we mentioned in our concise review of OOo , Novell maintains a patch set that is widely used by mainstream Linux distributions because it includes a number of really nice Linux - specific improvements .
Novell is still in the process of adapting these patches so that they work with the new version of OOo , which means that not all of the features are quite in place yet .
One feature that is still missing , for example , is support for native file dialogs in KDE and GNOME .
The beta is available for download from the OpenSUSE web site and is distributed in several flavors .
Users can download a comprehensive installation DVD that has a very broad assortment of packages , or they can download an installable Live CD image with KDE or GNOME .
I tested both Live CD environments and conducted a full installation from the GNOME LiveCD .
The live installer had a few major bugs that will have to be ironed out before the final release .
The most noticeable issue was that I could n't get the YaST configuration utility to work after I completed the installation .
It worked fine when I was running the Live CD , but not when launched from the installed environment .
The installer also prompted me to create a user account twice — once in the initial installer wizard and a second time during the post - install configuration process .
Aside from these glitches , OpenSUSE 11.1 beta 3 delivers a pretty good user experience .
It comes with GNOME 2.24 , which was released last month .
That includes a handful of nice improvements , such as support for tabbed file browsing .
OpenSUSE 's GNOME environment ships with a great assortment of default applications .
One particularly pleasing addition to beta 3 , for instance , is Tasque — a to - do list utility that can integrate with the Remember the Milk web service .
The version of KDE shipped with beta 3 is 4.1.2 .
I consider 4.1 the first KDE 4 release that is really ready for regular KDE users .
It 's usually pretty solid , and it has some great features — like the Folder View plasmoid — that provide tangible improvements over the previous KDE series .
One thing that is particularly exciting about the KDE environment in beta 3 is that it includes Amarok 2.0 beta 2 as the default music player .
The Amarok beta , which was released at the beginning of the month , brought a really big architectural change — a transition from SQLite to embedded MySQL .
I wanted to get my hands on the Amarok beta when it was released , but I had a lot of trouble getting the version in Amarok 's Project Neon package archive to run .
Because of the problems I had with it when it was released , this is the first time that I 've really had an opportunity to give it a try .
It 's coming along nicely , and I 'm impressed with the progress .
Although OpenSUSE does n't provide quite the same level of polish and simplicity as Ubuntu , it does offer some compelling advantages .
OpenSUSE 's unbeatable Mono integration is a big win for many software developers , and the distribution also has great support for desktop search integration via the Beagle indexing system .
The OpenSUSE KDE environment is among the best , which is why we have typically used OpenSUSE as our reference platform for KDE testing .
The 11.1 release is looking really sharp and continues to play to those strengths .
For more details , check out the release notes .
It 's no-questions - asked overtime for data centre staffers again , after Oracle published its latest monster update batch on Wednesday night .
The October update covers vulnerabilities across Oracle 's full software product range which is , of course , extensive .
There are 36 bulletins in total .
Among them are 15 updates for Oracle Database Suite , six involving Oracle Application Server and four involving E - Business Suite applications .
There are a quintet of updates for Oracle PeopleSoft Enterprise and JD Edwards EnterpriseOne and six involving BEA application server tech .
The impact of the vulnerabilities addressed by the update varies , but the majority pose a critical risk .
One of the database vulnerabilities lends itself to remote exploitation without authentication .
Two of the six Application Server flaws pose a similar risk of allowing hackers to launch attacks across the net , without the need to know either user names or passwords .
A brace of Oracle E-Business server security bugs , addressed by the patch batch , also pose a critical danger .
Five of the BEA bugs are also remotely exploitable .
Oracle 's risk and patching matrix provides a comprehensive overview of the three dozen updates .
Although none have been tied to specific hacking attacks or script - kiddie friendly exploit packages , according to security clearing houses such as US CERT and Secunia at least , early patching is still advisable . ®
American Nonsense
September 2 , 2008
McCain ’s bizarre Palin pick did more than just turn the national media feeding frenzy away from Obama ’s remarkable and strong speech , and the great feeling of and commitment to unity the Democrats left Denver with , but also knocked out of the national media–if ever it would reach there , anyway –the excessive actions the Minneapolis police–along with and perhaps at the direction of the federal government–are taking to prevent protests at the RNC .
Glenn Greenwald , I - Witness Video , Feministing , and FireDogLake have been reporting from Minneapolis about the excessive and unprovoked actions of the FBI and the Minneapolis police .
Here ’s Glenn , today :
As the police attacks on protesters in Minnesota continue — see this video of the police swarming a bus transporting members of Earth Justice [ see update ] , seizing the bus and leaving the group members stranded on the side of the highway — it appears increasingly clear that it is the Federal Government that is directing this intimidation campaign .
Minnesota Public Radio reported yesterday that “ the searches were led by the Ramsey County Sheriff ’s office .
Deputies coordinated searches with the Minneapolis and St. Paul police departments and the Federal Bureau of Investigation . ”
Today ’s Star Tribune added that the raids were specifically “ aided by informants planted in protest groups . ”
Back in May , Marcy
Wheeler presciently noted that the Minneapolis Joint Terrorist Task Force — an inter-agency group of federal , state and local law enforcement led by the FBI — was actively recruiting Minneapolis residents to serve as plants , to infiltrate “ vegan groups ” and other left - wing activist groups and report back to the Task Force about what they were doing .
There seems to be little doubt that it was this domestic spying by the Federal Government that led to the excessive and truly despicable home assaults by the police yesterday .
So here we have a massive assault led by Federal Government law enforcement agencies on left - wing dissidents and protesters who have committed no acts of violence or illegality whatsoever , preceded by months - long espionage efforts to track what they do .
And as extraordinary as that conduct is , more extraordinary is the fact that they have received virtually no attention from the national media and little outcry from anyone .
And it ’s not difficult to see why .
As the recent “ overhaul ” of the 30 - year - old FISA law illustrated — preceded by the endless expansion of surveillance state powers , justified first by the War on Drugs and then the War on Terror — we ’ve essentially decided that we want our Government to spy on us without limits .
There is literally no police power that the state can exercise that will cause much protest from the political and media class and , therefore , from the citizenry .
Note that there have been reports of semi-violent protest at the convention by anti-war protesters–apparently not the “ Food not Bombs ” students that have been under police and FBI surveillance for weeks , or the FBI and police raids against them might have actually turned up evidence that they intended to do more than non-violent protests .
It ’s difficult to to sort out what really happened and who is responsible when there is such a provocative and heavy - handed police presence .
I do n’t think that the vast majority of the American population wants , as Glenn says , “ our Government to spy on us without limits . ”
But what the Bush administration has been so effective in doing is creating so many varied crises for Americans to have to focus on –most immediately how they are going to keep a roof over their head , food on the table , and gas in the car –that whether or not they ’re being spied on ( and no one imagines that they could be–their first mistake ) becomes something of an academic question .
But one that should be receiving just a little bit more attention from the traditional media .
The Republican vision of a full on surveillance state of the nation is in full display now in Minneapolis , and it would be a good thing for America to see as it considers casting its vote in November .
Update : Earthjustice e-mails to note an error in Glenn ’s post , reprinted here .
The bus seized is not associated with national environmental litigation organization Earthjustice .

Urgent Action Alert : No More Bailout Votes Till Congress Hears From Some REAL Economists
Is n't it a miracle what can happen when the people actually speak out .
Votes change in Congress .
And please take careful note of this fact -- the stock market was down 600 points BEFORE Congress even voted , and reason is that investors KNOW that Paulson 's plunder plan does not address any of the real problems , and were as afraid it might pass as not .
It was a non-starter , it needs to be torn up and we need to draft a new plan from scratch .
Now it is up to us , we the people , to provide the real leadership that is so lacking in Congress , to push for real and substantial progressive policy change , and the underlying principle must be this , and this is what we need to tell them , with our newfound vocal power .
No More Bailout Votes Until Congress Hears From Some Real Economists .
Action Page : http://www.usalone.net/cindy/ real_economists.php
And here are the tollfree numbers for Congress again , 800 828-0498 , 800-473-6711 , now that we know that they WILL actually listen , at least enough of them , when we DO actually speak out in greater and greater numbers and loudly enough .
They need to hear from us again now , more that EVER , to tell them what they need to do instead .
Please make your calls and send your emails .
And if your representatives voted for the bailout the first time , lambast them , and if they voted " No " , thank them profusely .
And we again thank Cindy Sheehan , who is so seriously challenging Nancy Pelosi for the congressional seat in San Francisco right now , for her own leadership in making this action page happen .
Before Congress does anything else they MUST take the time to hear from some real economists , like Nobel Prize winner Joseph E. Stiglitz , who offers real wisdom in this article from his article last week in the Nation magazine .
Here are some excerpts :
With lack of oversight and transparency the cause of the current problem , how could they make a proposal so short in both ?
If a quick consensus is required , why not include provisions to stop the source of bleeding , to aid the millions of Americans that are losing their homes ?
Why not spend as much on them as on Wall Street ?
Do they still believe in trickle - down economics , when for the past eight years money has been trickling up to the wizards of Wall Street ?
Why not enact bankruptcy reform , to help Americans write down the value of the mortgage on their overvalued home ?
No one benefits from these costly foreclosures .
The Scandinavian countries showed the way , almost two decades ago .
By issuing preferred shares with warrants ( options ) , one reduces the public 's downside risk and insures that they participate in some of the upside potential .
This approach is not only proven , it provides both incentives and wherewithal to resume lending .
It furthermore avoids the hopeless task of trying to value millions of complex mortgages and even more complex products in which they are embedded , and it deals with the " lemons " problem - the government getting stuck with the worst or most overpriced assets .
Finally , we need to impose a special financial sector tax to pay for the bailouts conducted so far .
We also need to create a reserve fund so that poor taxpayers wo n't have to be called upon again to finance Wall Street 's foolishness .
-- End Stiglitz Excepts --
We need open , public and TRANSPARENT hearings so the American people can hear from REAL experts like Joseph E. Stiglitz , and decide in the clear light of day what is to be done with OUR economic destiny , and not in secret back rooms like it 's been done so far , where they confiscate all the Blackberrys to keep us all in the dark .
And THEN they write the legislation .
And they do n't leave town until they do it , because we 're not going to reelect any of them anyway unless they do .
Here is a donations page for also for Cindy Sheehan .
Many of you have donated very generously , but many of you have NOT .
And time is so short .
Cindy Sheehan Donations : http://www.usalone.net/cindy/ donations.php
And what if you do n't have any money ?
No excuses .
Do you have a telephone ?
Does it allow you to place outgoing tollfree calls ?
So after you call Congress , Cindy needs phonebankers , lots of phone bankers , now .
NOW , now .
Use the link on the page above to volunteer .
What Congress is being stampeded into doing , again , is EXACTLY backwards .
Would you buy a " hen protection plan " from one of the foxes ?
There is a real simple solution to this whole mess .
These institutions are in trouble mostly because they were looted by their own corporate executives .
We march an army of forensic accountants in there , and tell those Wall Street pigs that if they do n't find the money fast they are all going to jail .
And then we file negligence and breach of fiduciary duty lawsuits against them all , to recoup every dime that disappeared .
Our dear Secretary of the Treasury Paulson pulled down hundreds of millions all by himself .
And now he wants the American people to make up the difference out of OUR pockets ?
He can practically finance the bailout PERSONALLY .
And if there were any justice in the world he would .
And let them all know , that their job description is NOT ignoring the will of the American people .
Paid for by Cindy Sheehan for Congress
Donations to Cindy Sheehan for Congress are not tax - deductible
Please take action NOW , so we can win all victories that are supposed to be ours , and forward this alert as widely as possible .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Stocks slumped Friday , but managed to end off session lows , as Wall Street joined a worldwide market slump on bets that a recession is imminent - if not already under way .
The Dow Jones industrial average ( INDU ) fell 312 points or 3.6 % .
The Dow slumped as much as 504 points in the morning , recovered to within 112 points of breakeven and then fell back again by the close .
The Standard & Poor 's 500 ( SPX ) index fell 3.5 % and the Nasdaq composite ( COMP ) slid 3.2 % .
Both stock gauges had posted steeper declines in the morning .
Friday 's session capped off a tough week on Wall Street near the end of a brutal month .
The ongoing credit crisis , sluggish profit forecasts and falling commodity prices have all amplified recession fears , and the weakness has n't been limited to the United States .
For the week , the Dow lost 5.3 % , the S&P 500 lost 6.8 % and the Nasdaq fell 9.3 % .
With one week left in October , the major gauges are down between 25 % and 30 % for the month .
The major gauges are down more than 40 % since the Dow and S&P 500 hit all - time highs a year ago and the Nasdaq hit a bull - market high .
All three major gauges are at more than five - year lows .
Investor panic is at record levels , as measured by the CBOE Volatility index , or the VIX .
Some analysts think that the market is nearing a so - called bottom , but no one is willing to call it and jump back in yet , said Jim Dunigan , chief investment officer at PNC Wealth Management .
" In the short - term , everything argues against any significant spike up in stocks , " he said .
Dunigan said that longer - term the outlook is better , as inflationary pressures continue to dwindle , some stocks become good values relative to earnings and the economy eventually recovers .
The main questions for investors right now are about " the duration and severity of the current recession and how long this vicious forced selling will continue , " said Michael Sheldon , chief market strategist at RDM Financial Group .
That so - called " forced selling " due to margin calls has played a big role in the recent volatility .
With a margin call an investor has to either pay back a loan or put more money into an account because a security purchased with borrowed money has fallen to a certain level .
One fast way to raise the cash is to sell something else , such as stock .
Global market effect : Asian markets tumbled overnight , with the Japanese Nikkei losing almost 10 % .
The Moscow market slumped 14 % before the exchange said it was suspending trading until Tuesday .
European markets retreated , with the London FTSE falling 5 % after a big drop in the United Kingdom 's third - quarter GDP added to recession bets there .
( Full story )
" The main culprits that are likely responsible for the selling today ( Friday ) include weak economic growth in the U.K. and possible forced liquidation by hedge funds and other investors , " Sheldon said .
Bets that the Bank of England and European Central Bank will have to cut rates aggressively in the months ahead sent the euro and pound lower versus the dollar .
The dollar slumped versus the yen .
( Full story )
The U.S. central bank is expected to cut rates when it meets next week .
But experts are wondering if the Federal Reserve will lower rates to below 1 % for the first time .

Oil prices continued to slide , with crude plunging to a 17 - month low below $ 65 a barrel despite news that oil cartel OPEC is cutting production by 1.5 million barrels a day starting in November .
The decline is basically the oil market " forecasting a recession , " said Terry Morris , senior equity manager at National Penn Investors Trust .
Jittery markets :
Investors were braced for an even bigger selloff in the early going after Dow Jones industrial average futures fell 548 points - which triggered trading limits .
The nervous environment prompted the New York Stock Exchange to post a statement on its blog confirming that trading would began as normal at 9:30 a.m. ET .
Reflecting the jitters , the CBOE Volatility ( VIX ) index , or the VIX , briefly hit an all - time high of 89.53 .
But the VIX had improved to 79.47 in the late afternoon .
Clearly , there is a lot of nervousness out there , said Joseph Saluzzi , co-head of equity trading at Themis Trading .
However , it was n't clear what created so much more nervousness early Friday versus any other day this week .
Partly it was the U.K. GDP report , he said , which was adding to the reality of how global the problems are .
" Usually , Europe is reacting to us , but today we 're reacting to them . "
On a positive note , a report showed sales of existing homes jumped more than expected in September , with investors taking advantage of lower prices .
The report also showed that prices continue to fall .
Oil , gas and gold : U.S. light crude oil for December delivery settled down $ 3.69 at $ 64.15 a barrel , a 16 - month low .
Prices have been sliding since crude peaked at a record $ 147.27 a barrel on July 11 .
The decline since then has resulted from speculators pulling out of the market on bets that demand is slowing along with the global economy .
Gasoline prices fell another 4.1 cents overnight , to a national average of $ 2.781 a gallon , according to a survey of credit - card activity by motorist group AAA .
It was the 37th consecutive day that prices have decreased .
During that time , prices have fallen by over $ 1 a gallon .
COMEX gold for December delivery rallied $ 15.60 to settle at $ 730.30 an ounce .
Company news :
This week has brought the biggest wave yet of third - quarter corporate results .
About 140 of the S&P 500 companies have reported .
With 41 % of the reports out already , profits are on track to have fallen almost 11 % from a year earlier , according to the latest estimates from Thomson Reuters .
After the close Thursday , Microsoft ( MSFT , Fortune 500 ) reported quarterly sales and earnings that topped forecasts .
But the software leader also warned that sales and earnings for the fiscal second quarter and the full year wo n't meet forecasts due to the slowing economy .
Shares ended with small declines .
( Full story )
In other news , PNC ( PNC , Fortune 500 ) is buying fellow regional bank National City ( NCC , Fortune 500 ) in a $ 5.6 billion deal .
National City 's shares have been hammered over the last few months amid questions about its solvency following a series of bank failures and mergers .
Privately owned Chrysler said it will cut 25 % of its salaried workforce starting next month , and that it could announce other restructuring news in the future amid the auto industry slump .
Market breadth was negative .
On the New York Stock Exchange , losers topped winners 4 to 1 on volume of 1.58 billion shares .
On the Nasdaq , decliners beat advancers 3 to 1 on volume of 2.7 billion shares .
Credit market : Lending rates seized up a bit amid the broad recession fears .
( Full story )
Libor , the overnight bank - to - bank lending rate , rose to 1.28 % from 1.21 % late Thursday , according to Bloomberg.com .
However , that still kept the rate below the Fed 's benchmark lending rate of 1.5 % , which is a good sign for the credit market .
Libor hit a record 6.88 % earlier this month at the height of the market panic .
The 3 - month Libor rate , what banks charge each other to borrow for three months , fell to 3.52 % from 3.54 % Thursday .
The TED spread , which is the difference between what banks pay to borrow from each other for three months and what the Treasury pays , widened to 2.70 % from 2.55 % late Wednesday .
The spread hit a record 4.65 % earlier this month .
The narrower the spread , the more willing banks are to lend to each other .
Lending rates had been improving for more than a week , but have stalled over the last couple of days .
Credit froze in the wake of the housing market collapse , subprime fallout and contraction in the bank sector .
The lack of available credit has punished the already weak economy , making it hard for businesses to function on a daily basis and for consumers to get loans .
Treasury prices turned lower , erasing morning gains .
The decline boosted the yield on the 10 - year note to 3.68 % from 3.64 % Thursday .
Treasury prices and yields move in opposite directions .
At one point , the yield on the 30 - year bond sank to the lowest point in its 31 - year trading history , to as low as 3.87 % .
The yield on the 3 - month Treasury bill , seen as the safest place to put money in the short term , slipped to 0.86 % from 0.95 % late Thursday , showing investors would rather see little return on their money than risk the stock market .
Last week , the 3 - month fell to below 0.2 % .
Last month , it reached a 68 - year low around 0 % , as investor panic hit its peak .
Vidiot sez , " A woman stopped by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers at the border , over a drawing of an SUV in her notebook .
They thought the artist and college professor was an industrial spy and copyright infringer . "
U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers told Zempel they suspected her of copyright infringement .
She was released after more than an hour in custody at the Houlton , Maine , port of entry from New Brunswick , Canada .
Her release came only after she persuaded border guards she was an artist doing a project that involved a crocheted SUV as a statement against America 's dependence on oil and love for big vehicles .

Flight carrying Ron Paul , other Reps. makes emergency landing
A flight with members of Texas ' U.S. Congressional delegation aboard , including former Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul , " took a major nosedive " and was forced to make an emergency landing on Tuesday afternoon , according to a Houston TV station .
KHOU reports that a Continental Airlines flight carrying seven U.S. lawmakers suddenly lost cabin pressure on its way from Houston to Washington , D.C. 's Reagan National Airport .
The flight recovered , was diverted and landed safely in New Orleans , according to one lawmaker 's spokesperson .
Aboard the flight among 117 other people with Rep. Paul were Reps. John Carter ( R ) , Henry Cuellar ( D ) , Nick Lampson ( D ) , Solomon Ortiz ( D ) , Ted Poe ( R ) , and Ciro Rodriguez ( D ) , all representing Texas in the U.S. House .
The airline confirmed that no one was hurt , the report said .

It can be hard to find wrapping paper on the road , so we had to improvise .
East Coast Christmas : Wrapping up the Road Trip
Coast to coast statistics :
Miles driven : 5532 ( San Diego to Miami , scenic route )
Gas used : 183.2 gallons
Fuel efficiency : 30.1 mpg
Cheapest gas : $ 2.73 / gallon ( Chickasha , Oklahoma )
Most expensive gas : $ 4.15 / gallon ( Death Valley )
Our travels , however , are just getting started .
Northern Virginia I lived in Northern Virginia 's Loudoun County from 2000 to 2002 .
It was and still is the fastest - growing county in the nation , due mostly to a cluster of technology companies that grew along with the Internet .
When I first moved there , it was still a rural , almost empty expanse with just a few beachheads of suburbia : a number of residential developments in various stages of construction and a shopping mall that had just opened ( before that , the nearest was 40 minutes away ) .
The rest was farmland and empty fields .
The cable company did n't even offer Internet access .
The 26 months I 'd lived there were like the early stages of SimCity , as a few business districts and artificial lakes popped up and a few highways were extended ; we even got good sushi .
However , this growth was not unchecked .
The region is also home to my favorite Thai place .
Many longtime residents ( e.g. , those who had been there since 1985 ) did not like all these changes .
It seemed like every page of the local paper was dedicated to the battles over whether roads should be built and what their speed limits should be , or letters to the editor lamenting the sale of farms to developers or the decrease in the deer population .
Both sides seemed to harbor a contempt for the other 's culture and values .
The local political offices were mostly staffed with the old guard , and I used to wonder what would happen as more and more new residents arrived .
Would there be a soccer mom uprising ?
Would crates of Starbucks coffee be thrown into the artificial lake in protest of the new property tax ?
As we approached the region from the west , I began to see the results of five years of change .
As expected , things were very different .
Most significantly , the population had doubled in size .
This massive demographic shift did indeed lead to a coup d'etat :
As a result of a major campaign , the County Board of Supervisors was wiped clean and loaded with pro-development types .
I wo n't weigh in on whether or not this was a good thing , but I can objectively say that the effect is noticeable everywhere .
Almost all of the empty fields are gone ; we had to look far and wide to find the first two pictures below .
The horse farm I used to drive past on my way to work is now a residential complex .
Hil and I got lost in an entire neighborhood that did n't use to exist .
Spots that looked like this ... ... and this ... ... now look like this ... ... and this .
The last snow we 're going to see for a long time Taking a Break Afterward , we put our trip on hold to visit friends and family in Baltimore and Richmond .
We had a wonderful time , and would like to thank our hosts for their gracious hospitality .
Thanks , hosts !
That said , we did n't really do any sightseeing , so let 's fast - forward to the Carolinas .
Pedro's Less than a mile into South Carolina is a place called Pedro's South of the Border that Mike 's been talking about as long as I 've known him .
Apparently when he was a kid , his family used to stop off whenever they drove between New York and Florida .
There are countless billboards starting 100 miles away with messages like , " Keep Yelling Kids , They 'll Stop ! "
Mike told me to expect a cheesy and borderline - offensive Mexican - themed roadside attraction , with fluorescent buildings , junk food , a grimy video arcade , and lots and lots of fireworks .
How enticing .
The whole store reeked of gunpowder .
Against my objections , we stopped to see how time had treated Pedro .
It was pretty much a waste of time , perhaps due to the time of year .
( Oops , I said " time " three times . )
Almost everything was closed — we even had trouble finding a bathroom .
The giant fireworks store was open for business , though .
The clientele consisted mainly of tattooed guys in rude t- shirts .
As we were leaving , Mike suggested a round of miniature golf — the course was called Golf of Mexico — but I 'd had enough of this place .
Roger 's Bar -B - Q
Writing this entry made me hungry all over again .
We did n't eat nearly as much barbecue on this trip as we'd hoped , but before we left Richmond I did a little research and settled on Roger 's Bar - B - Q House in Florence , South Carolina .
If you ever find yourself on that stretch of I - 95 , by all means GO !
$ 11 per person buys access to an all - you - can eat buffet featuring perfectly tender ribs , two varieties of pulled pork ( we recommend the spicy kind ) , pork rinds , biscuits , hush puppies , cole slaw , sweet potatoes with pecans , cabbage , greens , and several other items we were too stuffed to sample .
Plus angel food cake for dessert , and as many pitchers of sweet tea as you can drink .
Roger 's more than made up for our disappointment in Memphis .
It 's made of aluminum .
Very high strength to weight ratio .
A Florida Festivus
We arrived at my parents ' home in Florida just in time to celebrate Festivus .
My brother - in - law even supplied a pole .
You can buy them on the Internet , but I 'm not going to link to the site because they charge 38 bucks .
Price - gouging strikes me as very un -Festivus - like ; the whole point of the holiday is to reject Christmas hyperconsumerism .
I recommend that , in the true spirit of Festivus , you just go down to your local hardware store and buy an ordinary length of pipe .
Feats of Strength and the Airing of Grievances are optional .
I 'll Bring Ham for Christmas
We also celebrated Christmas .
Although I 'm new to the holiday , it would be unlike me not to have opinions about it , and one of these opinions is that it 's repetitive to roast a turkey for Christmas dinner when we all just ate turkey last month for Thanksgiving .
Why not feast on something delicious and quintessentially goyish - a glazed ham ?
I mentioned my wish to my mother - in - law , and she agreed to entrust to me the main course of her Christmas dinner .
With the pressure on , I chose to make Alton Brown 's city ham .
In a nutshell : One for the ham , one for me ...
Get a ham ( see notes below )
Score a diamond pattern into the skin
Cook 3 - 4 hours
Take it out and remove the skin , appreciating how the subcutaneous fat has now melted into the meat
Smear it with mustard and brown sugar
Spritz it with bourbon
Pack on a layer of crushed ginger snaps
Send it back to the oven for another hour so the glaze can set
The nice thing about cooking ham is that nothing can go wrong .
Of course , we found a way to make something go wrong .
We knew to get the lower part of the leg , and to make sure it was a city ham ( brined and cooked ) , and to make sure it was n't pre-sliced , but we failed to realize that our ham had already been skinned .
The biggest repercussion was a dramatically shortened cooking time .
The first trip to the oven is supposed to bring it to 130° , and the second , 140° .
I checked it just two and a half hours into the first cooking and it was already at 150° !
I suddenly had visions of Mike 's family struggling to choke down tough , dry ham and I nearly cried ; this is why I ( usually ) never cook anything for guests without a practice run .
Mike told me to finish the bourbon and to keep my tears out of the ham .
We considered our options .
There was no time to get a new ham , since the proper recipe can take six hours , and so we concluded that the show must go on .
We covered our ham with foil , waited till an hour before dinner to put it back , and crossed our fingers .
It was a success !
Apparently ham can take a lot of abuse , and we ended up with juicy , succulent meat covered in a rich , delicious glaze .
Even the kids went back for seconds and thirds , and children never lie about what they like .
We limited their intake of an extra -boozy sauce Mike had made with the pan drippings , but they nevertheless seemed to sleep especially soundly that night .
Ham Ham Ham !
Also , we finally got our pie .
No more Quaker Oats shadow .
Annual haircut I had n't cut my hair since last December ( that 's twelve months ago , in case you 've lost track ) .
After that one , Hilary had said , " You do n't always have to get it cut so short , " which I interpreted as , " You should n't ever get another haircut for the rest of your life . "
I had never gone more than a month or two without one , because my hair turns into a sort of cross between Foxxy Cleopatra and Jay Leno .
This time , I was determined to get past that phase , even if it meant using what the metrosexuals call " product . "
Product did indeed keep the poofiness in check :
By around April , my hair finally turned around and , for the first time in my life , started growing toward the ground .
My plan had worked !
I felt like Columbus must 've in 1492 .
Around this time , Hilary started saying things like , " Although I 'm not asking you to cut it short again , you really ought to get it cleaned up . "
I would have none of this , pointing out that it was now a scientific experiment , and besides , I was n't going to let her renege on the time she told me never to get another haircut for the rest of my life .
The point where I started to reconsider was in July , when we went scuba diving .
As soon as I hit the water , my bangs turned into a sort of hair cloud that kept floating in front of my mask .
I spent the entire dive brushing them away .
I was even wearing a hood , and it did n't help one bit .
We have a lot of diving coming up on this trip , and today was my last chance for an American haircut .
If my bangs reached the back of my head , I could just hold them in a ponytail ( and risk my father taking me out of his will ) , but they were still a few inches short .
There 's no way I 'm going diving with a topknot , so it was time to end the Great Hair Experiment of 2007 .
Before After
It 's not so bad .
A little more Latino than I 'm used to , but that might be good considering where we 're heading .
Camera testing
We have a waterproof housing that fits around our camera .
Before we take it diving , we wanted to try it out in the pool .
The results were impressive :
The seal worked perfectly , the controls were easy to use , and the colors turned out much brighter than we 'd anticipated .
I only hope it works as well in the deeper , darker waters that are to come .
We 're gonna miss this country .
¡ Adios , America !
After Christmas , we returned our car in Miami ( N.B. : the airport Days Inn is a dump ) and boarded the morning flight to Costa Rica .
It will be a long time before we return .

Asking McCain to ' please come over here ' for a final shot , Greenberg pretended to be using a standard modeling light .
The resulting photos depict McCain as devilish , with bulging brows and washed - out skin .
' He had no idea he was being lit from below , " Greenberg said , adding that none of his entourage picked up on the light switch either .
' I guess they 're not very sophisticated , ' she said .
The Atlantic opted not to use the distorted McCain shot on its cover , selecting instead a more straightforward portrait .
' We stand by the picture we are running on our cover , " said Atlantic editor James Bennet .
' We feel it 's a respectful portrait .
We hope we 'll be judged by that picture . '
But Bennet was appalled by Greenberg saying she tried to portray McCain in an unflattering way .
' We feel totally blind - sided , ' he said .
' Her behavior is outrageous .
Incredibly unprofessional .'
Greenberg later decided to use some of the images she was assigned to take to make a political statement .
Her Web site now features a series of Photoshopped pics of McCain in some highly unflattering poses - including one that has a monkey squirting dung onto the Republican candidate 's head .
Another one reads ' I am a bloodthirsty warmongerer , ' with McCain retouched to have needle - sharp shark teeth and a vicious grin , while licking blood - smeared lips . "
And all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in their ears , and brought them unto Aaron .
And he received them at their hand , and fashioned it with a graving tool , after he had made it a molten calf : and they said , These be thy gods , O Israel , which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt .
And when Aaron saw it , he built an altar before it ; and Aaron made proclamation , and said , To morrow is a feast to the LORD .
Exodus , Chapter 32 .
Even those of us who did n’t go into the campaign with an over - rosy view of McCain have been stunned at just how big a lying sleaze - peddler and hypocrite he ’s turned out to be .
In today ’s episode of TPMtv , we take a look at the awful truth …
Full - size video at TPMtv.com .
THERE is a branch of science fiction that looks at the Earth 's neighbours , Mars and Venus , and asks how they might be made habitable .
The answer is planetary engineering .
The Venusian atmosphere is too thick .
It creates a large greenhouse effect and cooks a planet that is , in any case , closer to the sun than the Earth is to even higher temperatures than it would otherwise experience .
Mars suffers from the opposite fault .
A planet more distant from the sun than Earth is also has an atmosphere too thin to trap what little of the sun 's heat is available .
So , fiddle with the atmospheres of these neighbours and you open new frontiers for human settlement and far - fetched story lines .
It is an intriguing idea .
It may even come to pass , though probably not in the lifetime of anyone now reading such stories .
But what is more worrying — and more real — is the idea that such planetary engineering may be needed to make the Earth itself habitable by humanity , and that it may be needed in the near future .
Reality has a way of trumping art , and human - induced climate change is very real indeed .
So real that some people are asking whether science fiction should now be converted into science fact .
Tinkering with the atmosphere or the oceans on the scale required to do this would be highly risky and extraordinarily complex .
But the alternative , getting the world 's population to give up fossil fuels , is proving exceedingly hard .
Geo-engineering , as it has come to be known , may be a way of buying time for the transition to a low - carbon economy to take place in an orderly manner .
In the past , geo - engineering was taboo because many felt that the very possibility of fiddling with the climate would create an excuse to avoid the hard choices a low - carbon economy would impose .
However , the feeling is now growing that if politicians came to scientists for advice on the matter , it would be a good idea for them to have some to offer .
To that end , the Royal Society , Britain 's oldest scientific academy , has published a series of papers in its Philosophical Transactions outlining some of the options , and suggesting a few experiments to test whether they would work .
Transactional analysis
Broadly , these ideas fall into two categories .
One is to remove excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere .
The other is to compensate for the climate - warming greenhouse effect this carbon dioxide and other gases cause , by reducing the amount of sunlight reaching the ground .
The most plausible way to remove carbon dioxide is to increase the amount of photosynthesis going on .
Photosynthesis creates plant matter out of carbon dioxide and water .
But rotting plant matter returns carbon dioxide to the atmosphere .
So , if the gas is to be removed permanently , that rotting has to be avoided .
One widely discussed idea , which the Royal Society 's correspondents re-examine , is to fertilise the oceans with iron .
The growth of plankton in the sea is always limited by something .
It may be light , or a familiar nutrient such as nitrate or phosphate .
In some places , though , iron is the limiting nutrient .
Adding iron to such places should cause a bloom of planktonic algae , thus sucking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere .
Several preliminary experiments have shown that plankton do , indeed , bloom when iron is added .
What is not clear is what happens to the carbon .
For the idea to work , some of it would have to sink to the ocean floor and stay there .
One reason to think this might happen is that during recent ice ages the cold , dry conditions caused a lot of iron - rich dust to blow around .
Supporters of the iron- fertilisation theory believe this dust produced blooms of oceanic algae that then sank to the seabed , taking large amounts of carbon with them , which helped to reduce temperatures still further .
Victor Smetacek , of the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Germany , and Wajih Naqvi , of India 's National Institute of Oceanography , therefore propose conducting experiments that look not only at how much carbon dioxide is sucked up , but also at what happens to it .
In particular , they are interested in the fate of diatoms .
These are single - celled algae which seem to absorb almost all of the extra carbon dioxide captured when the ocean is fertilised with iron .
The crucial question is what happens to these diatoms when they die .
If enough of them sink to the ocean floor and stay buried there , the idea should work .
If they do not , it wo n't .
By reviewing studies of the ooze at the bottom of the sea ( which is often made of the shells of diatoms )
Dr Smetacek and Dr Naqvi reckon the best rate of burial is to be found in the south - west Atlantic , and they propose to carry out an experiment there next year .
The advantage of fertilising the oceans is that it could be done with existing technology .
The disadvantage is the unknown knock - on effects .
Planktonic algae are at the bottom of the food chain .
If more of them are around , the rest of that chain will be affected .
This could be a good thing , of course .
More algae might mean more krill , and that might mean more whales and other large sea animals .
On the other hand , shallow - water blooms caused by nitrate and phosphate pollution often swamp the local environment .
A second idea for scrubbing excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere , alluded to in the Transactions but not much discussed , is to plant more trees .
In principle , any old trees would do — although they die and rot , more forest cover would lock up more carbon dioxide .
However , genetically modified trees might grow faster .
Such trees are being developed to help the lumber , pulp and biofuel industries .
But fast - growing forests could also be planted in order to capture carbon dioxide quickly .
Another possibility that the Royal Society 's writers consider is recycling carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into fuel , by reacting it with hydrogen .
Of course , that would require a supply of hydrogen , and producing hydrogen takes energy — which would have to be generated in a way that produces no carbon dioxide .
Perhaps the most intriguing idea — which was published last year , though not discussed by the Royal Society — is to eject carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at the Earth 's poles , using the planet 's magnetic field .
This may sound absurd , but oxygen already leaks out this way ( the phenomenon is the subject of a paper just published by Hans Nilsson of Swedish Institute of Space Physics ) .
Alfred Wong , a researcher at the University of California , Los Angeles , proposes that a system involving powerful lasers and finely tuned radio waves could encourage carbon dioxide to take the same route .
His calculations suggested that using lasers to ionise molecules of carbon dioxide , and radio waves to get them to spin at the correct rate , would cause those molecules to spiral away from Earth along the lines of magnetic force until they were lost for ever in space .
Reflecting on the future
Space is likewise the destination in the other set of approaches .
Reflecting sunlight back into outer space ( increasing the Earth 's albedo , as it is known ) would also cool the planet , and the Royal Society 's authors consider two ways of doing so .
One , which has been widely touted in the past is , perversely , to increase the amount of pollution in the atmosphere .
Governments have spent the past half - century trying to reduce the amount of sulphur compounds in the air .
These compounds are the main cause of acid rain .
They also , however , have a tendency to form tiny particles that reflect sunlight back into space .
That effect is most noticeable when a volcano erupts explosively , as Mount Pinatubo did in 1991 , or Tambora did in 1815 .
Those eruptions put sulphate particles into the stratosphere , and because that is above the part of the atmosphere where weather occurs , these particles tended to stay there rather than being washed out by rain .
That cooled the whole climate .
The year after Tambora 's explosion was known for a long time as the “ year without a summer ” .
The reverse is also true .
When civilian flights over the United States stopped in the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 2001 , the lack of sulphur - laden contrails led to a perceptible rise in temperature .
Philip Rasch , of the National Centre for Atmospheric Research , in Boulder , Colorado , and his colleagues are therefore exploring the idea of deliberately polluting the stratosphere with sulphate in order to reflect solar heat back into space .
To offset the rise in temperature expected by the middle of the century if things carry on as they are , the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth 's surface would have to be cut by just 1.1 % .
That is still a lot of energy in absolute terms , but the sums suggest it is within reach .
It would require the addition of about 10 m tonnes of finely divided sulphate particles to the stratosphere each year .
These could be sprayed out of special aircraft - borne injectors , or produced by burning high - sulphur aviation fuel .
If aviation fuel were used in this way , and was 5 % sulphur ( between ten and 100 times today 's levels ) , it would require 1 m flights a year to the middle of the stratosphere ( between 15 km and 25 km up ) , assuming an average flight was four hours .
Those flights alone would use up half as much fuel as civil aviation now consumes .
However , you could achieve part of the effect by making civil aviation use dirty , high - sulphur fuel .
It would not be a perfect solution .
Civilian jets cruise at an altitude of 10 km , the bottom of the stratosphere , and any sulphate they released would thus fall to earth faster .
But it would be a lot cheaper than flying 1 m special missions .
Besides polluting the stratosphere , there is another way of changing the atmosphere to make it more reflective .
This is to tinker with cloud cover .
One person working on this idea is Stephen Salter , a marine engineer at the University of Edinburgh best known for seeking to replace fossil fuels with Salter 's duck , a device for turning ocean waves into electricity .
He has also been working on the geo-engineering end of climate change .
Dr Salter and his colleague at Edinburgh , Graham Sortino , together with John Latham , one of Dr Rasch 's colleagues at the National Centre for Atmospheric Research , have been looking into how clouds might be made more reflective .
Their answer is to spray them with seawater .
Particles of salt formed by the evaporation of ocean spray act as nuclei around which the droplets of water that form clouds can condense .
Increasing the number of particles increases the number of droplets .
That does not change the total amount of cloud ( which is controlled by the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere ) .
But having more , smaller droplets does increase a cloud 's reflectivity .
A drop in the ocean
Dr Latham led a team of climate modellers who wondered whether , in principle , this phenomenon might be used to increase the planet 's albedo enough to compensate for projected global warming .
Their answer was that it could , but it would require 1.4 billion tonnes of seawater to be converted into spray each year .
Dr Salter and Dr Sortino then joined Dr Latham in trying to work out how to manage this .
Their answer is a fleet of specially designed ships .
These would be wind - powered — not by sails but by Flettner rotors , which are giant , rotating cylinders that extract energy from the wind using the Magnus effect .
( This is the effect that causes cricket balls to swing in the air , among other things . )
The ships would drag turbines through the sea to provide electricity that would both drive the cylinders and power pumps that sprayed the atmosphere with seawater , suitably broken up into droplets .
Such ships would weigh 300 tonnes .
A fully operational system would require 1,500 of them .
And it would have the advantage of an almost instant off switch .
Stop spraying , and things would revert to normal within a couple of days .
Cui bono ?
That reversibility is important .
Many scientists are understandably nervous about tinkering on a grand scale with the atmosphere and the oceans .
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change — a scientific body appointed by the United Nations to assess the risks of a changing climate — has described geo-engineering as “ largely speculative and unproven , and with the risk of unknown side - effects ” .
Broadly , there are two types of fears .
The first is of technological hubris .
History is littered with plans that went awry because too little was known about complex natural systems .
As with irrigating Soviet cotton fields from the Aral Sea in Central Asia or introducing rabbits to Australia , modifying the climate will have both physical and biological consequences .
Some of these will be unpredictable and some of them may be worse than the harm they were intended to treat .
Critics point out , for instance , that carbon dioxide does not just warm the atmosphere .
It also makes the oceans more acidic .
That is bad because many marine creatures rely on shells made of calcium carbonate to protect themselves .
As every schoolboy knows , if you drop calcium carbonate ( limestone , for example ) into acid , it dissolves .
The sea would not become so acidic that shells would actually dissolve , but the extra acidity would mean making them was harder work , which might upset the oceanic ecosystem quite badly .
For this reason , approaches to geo-engineering that merely reflect heat back into space need to be viewed cautiously .
The other fear is of moral hazard — the possibility that people would see the promise of geo- engineering their way out of trouble , despite its risks and uncertainties , as an excuse to continue to pollute the atmosphere as usual .
It would be a mistake to think of geo- engineering as a substitute for curbing carbon - dioxide emissions — not merely because of the acidification of the oceans , but also because if you ever stop fertilising the oceans or spraying the atmosphere or whatever , the problem will rapidly return .
Nevertheless , Brian Launder of the University of Manchester , who edited the Royal Society papers , argues that the sort of geo- engineering schemes they describe might buy the world 20 to 30 years to adjust .
That breathing space would be useful if something really bad , such as the collapse into the sea of part of the Greenland ice - shelf , was in imminent danger of happening , and the realisation of the danger led to a political agreement that climate change had to be stopped rapidly .
So what now ?
The answer is probably to carry out preliminary trials of the sort proposed by Dr Smetacek and Dr Naqvi .
Correctly done , they should help to indicate what could work , what would not , and what the financial and environmental costs might be .
Local schemes , particularly ocean fertilisation , need not be that expensive .
They would be well within the budget of a small country , a large company or even a tycoon .
Richard Branson , a British businessman , is already offering a prize of $ 25 m for a workable way of removing a billion tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere every year .
And at least one private firm has come in for criticism for attempting to sell carbon credits based on ocean fertilisation .
And yet , the effects of geo-engineering would rarely be restricted to a single country — that is , after all , the whole point .
For this reason , if geo- engineering is to be done properly , it must be regulated properly .
The world needs a way of deciding the size and scope of any project , who takes responsibility for any mistakes , and whether and how to compensate losers — of whom there will be many .
Schemes designed to cool the climate could harm countries such as Canada and Russia .
Global warming may make their northern wastes more habitable and allow them to exploit oil and gas located under what is now an ice - covered Arctic Ocean .
Meanwhile a country such as Panama would prefer a cooler world in which ice continues to seal off the North - West Passage and to prevent competition with its canal .
Some tinkering to suit local needs may be possible .
Ken Caldeira of Stanford University , another of the authors , reckons that it may be feasible to place sulphates in the stratosphere near the poles and thus cool the Earth in a place where global warming manifests itself most strongly , though that would scarcely please the Russians and the Canadians .
Nor does it answer the question of how to decide whose interests such tinkering should serve .
Even its advocates think geo-engineering is not to be approached lightly .
Nor , though , is it something to be ignored completely .
Global warming is such a threat that all the options deserve to be explored .
It would be a big experiment , but it would at least be a planned one — unlike the equally big , but unplanned experiment that is now being conducted by motor cars , power stations , cement factories and logging companies all across the planet .
This baby was born with incomplete arms and an extra appendage connected to the foot , caused by the mother taking Thalidomide during pregnancy .
Courtesy National Cancer Institute View Slideshow 1957 : Thalidomide , a drug developed to help women overcome the symptoms of morning sickness during pregnancy , is first marketed in West Germany .
Forty - six countries approve its use before thalidomide 's terrible side effects become apparent .
Thalidomide is a powerful synthetic tranquilizer , originally developed by Ciba , a Swiss pharmaceutical company .
Unable to make it commercially profitable , Ciba gave up on the drug .
A German company , Chemie Gruenenthal , took over and eventually began marketing thalidomide as a " completely safe " method for warding off morning sickness .
Except thalidomide was n't " completely safe . "
In fact , it was quite the opposite .
Inadequate testing procedures were to blame for what followed .
Had the pharmaceutical labs done a better job of testing thalidomide , they would have discovered that the drug 's molecules were able to penetrate the placental wall , especially during the first trimester of pregnancy when the fetus is largely unformed .
This invasion of the womb resulted in a variety of profound birth defects , including deformed and missing limbs , deafness , blindness , cleft palate and a slew of internal problems .
By the early 1960s , more than 10,000 thalidomide babies had been born .
Although many died in infancy ( an estimated 40 percent died before their first birthday ) , quite a few survived into adulthood .
Now in their 40s , most thalidomide survivors continue suffering from a variety of chronic health problems directly related to their condition .
Thalidomide 's impact in the United States was minimal , because the Food and Drug Administration had held up the drug 's approval for reasons having nothing to do with birth defects .
Thalidomide was finally pulled off the world market in 1962 .
In a reversal of fortune , thalidomide resurfaced 30 years later as an effective drug for improving the survival rate in bone - marrow - transplant patients .
It is also being used to treat multiple myeloma .

In the monitor stakes , bigger was always - until Apple started putting little high - resolution monitors into iPods that were so detailed , you can watch movies on them .
Since then , and perhaps also due to environmental and power - saving constraints , nowadays everything new seems to have higher resolution while being slimmer .
Apple really pushed resolution in yesterday 's notebook announcements , with perhaps the most notable new technology in the entire new MacBook family , across the board , being way better NVDIA video cards driving thinner , higher - resolution displays .
There 's even a new standalone display , the 24 - inch LED Cinema Display with built - in iSight , made to visually complement all the new MacBooks ( more below ) .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
So , what was announced in toto ?
All new , all - metal unibody enclosures for the MacBook and MacBook Pro supporting large glass trackpads .
These are built to handle four new MultiTouch gestures .
Apple 's new consumer notebook , the MacBook , now ships with an LED - backlit display just like the MacBook Pro - in fact , every model is more environmentally friendly than ever before , achieving EPEAT Gold status , according to Apple .
There are two new MacBooks , two new MacBook Pros and two new MacBook Airs .
Let 's start with the cheapest options .
Addressing the criticism that the little ( 13.3 - inch ) MacBooks were not good for graphics - intensive gaming ( or graphics intensive anything , actually ) , the new aluminium MacBooks come with Nvidia GeForce 9400 M graphics chipsets .
This is a huge advance over the superseded integrated Intel graphics of the white polycarbonate MacBooks which drew on system RAM instead of having dedicated video RAM , causing performance lags .
The new ones can now simultaneously drive great big 30 - inch DVI displays !
The 2.0 GHz , 13.3 - inch aluminium MacBook is priced at £ 719 .
Video is handled by an NVIDIA GeForce 9400 M integrated graphics chipset and all the new MacBooks sport the Mini DisplayPort for video output - adapters will be sold separately for driving additional displays , which is now a much more attractive proposition .
There 's also a 5400rpm 160 GB serial ATA hard drive equipped with Sudden Motion Sensor for drop protection .
The other model is a 2.4GHz mode .
It 's otherwise the same , except for a bigger 250 GB hard drive .
Its ticket price is £ 1,149 .
There are build - to - order options , of course - these include the ability to upgrade to 4GB RAM , put in 250 GB 5400rpm or 320 GB 5400rpm hard drive or even a 128 GB solid state drive .
There 's a Mini DisplayPort to DVI Adapter , a Mini DisplayPort to Dual - Link DVI Adapter ( for the 30 - inch DVI display ) and a Mini DisplayPort to VGA Adapter .
You can get an Apple USB Modem , an Apple Remote ( which used to come bundled ) and an Apple MagSafe Airline Adapter .
New MacBook
Pro has two video cards
The Pro laptops have had a real review , too .
They also sport the new aluminium chassis designs and technology .
The oddest new feature is that each Pro now carries two - yes two - video cards , one for saving battery power and one for screaming performance .
You can switch between the NVIDIA GeForce 9400 M integrated graphics processor for better battery life or use the powerful NVIDIA GeForce 9600M GT ‘ discrete graphics processor ' for higher performance .
The 2.4 GHz , 15 - inch aluminium MacBook Pro will hit your pocket for a pretty reasonable £ 1,399 .
That gets you a 15.4 - inch widescreen LED - backlit 1440 x 900 glossy display , 2.4GHz Intel Core 2 Duo with 3MB shared L2 cache , 1066MHz front - side bus , 2 GB 1066 MHz DDR3 SDRAM ( expandable to 4GB ) and new graphics chipsets too .
NVIDIA GeForce 9400 M integrated graphics handles that , with 256MB GDDR3 video memory .
A 250GB serial ATA hard drive runs at 5400 rpm Everything else is what you 'd expect except for the big , new glass Multi - Touch trackpad and illuminated keyboard .
The trackpad is all button , too - no more hunting for that button - bar .
The faster 2.53GHz aluminium MacBook Pro will set you back £ 1,949 .
It ships with 4GB 1066 MHz DDR3 SDRAM , NVIDIA GeForce 9400 M integrated graphics / NVIDIA GeForce 9600M GT discrete graphics with 512MB GDDR3 video memory .
The hard drive is a nice fat 5400rpm 320 GB serial ATA with Sudden Motion Sensor .
But where 's the new 17 - inch ?
There is n't one ( see below ) .
The MacBook Air has had a refresh too , if you want all - new Apple IT contents for your old - style manilla envelope .
Measuring only 4 mm at its thinnest point and 19 mm at its maximum , the Air gets way more graphics power too .
It includes a new NVIDIA GeForce 9400 M integrated graphics chip with faster architecture to provide robust support for 3D games etcetera .
Prices will start at an RRP of £ 1,299 .
The hard drive is bigger at 120 GB ( still a slow 4200 r pm though ) , or a new 128 GB solid state drive .
These should be available in November .
That new monitor
Apple 's Cinema displays are excellent in quality and resolution but look increasingly heavy in this thin day and age .
( Maybe everything will get fat and chunky again after the economy recovers . )
Anyway , the other criticism was no built - in iSight display , so if you bought a Mac Pro tower you were still bereft of a webcam even after forking out the extra for a gorgeous , big Apple display .
Apple has partly addressed this issue with the release of a new 24 - inch LED Cinema Display .
It has a built - in iSight video camera , mic and speakers all housed in a thin aluminium and glass enclosure .
But the catch is , the new Cinema Display is specifically designed for the new MacBook family .
It even has an integrated MagSafe charger , three USB 2.0 ports and the new Mini DisplayPort , making it easy for MacBook users to quickly connect and power their notebooks as well as use their favourite peripherals .
It visually matches the new aluminium MacBooks perfectly .
It will be available in November through the Apple Store and Apple authorised resellers .
The 24 - inch LED Cinema Display requires a MacBook , MacBook Air or MacBook Pro with the new Mini DisplayPort .
( Presumably an adapter will make it work with other Macs ?
We do n't know yet . )
So where does that leave the Apple Mac Pro tower users ?
Wait till the Macworld Conference January 5th 2009 , I say .
Apple needs to unleash some big guns at that .
Retro MacBooks
Yes , not everything 's changed in the notebook stakes .
You may have noticed there 's no new 17 - inch MacBook Pro.
Presumably making an MB
Pro so thin with a screen that big is too hard , at least for now .
So Apple has kept the original - case 17 - inch MacBook Pro , but at least it has been updated with a high resolution 1920 x 1200 LED - backlit display and a larger 320 GB hard drive - For an optional 128 GB solid state drive a là the MacBook Air .
It will come with 4GB 667MHz DDR2 SDRAM , an NVIDIA GeForce 8600M GT graphics chip with 512MB GDDR3 video memory and the rest as usual .
So if you really need a 17 - inch Apple MacBook Pro now , at least it 's more powerful - it just does n't match the other new stuff visually and I do n't know if it has the new trackpad or not , yet .
Also , with the price rises , you may think ‘ how can students afford Apple notebooks now ? '
To address price disparities , Apple has kept a white polycarbonate MacBook in the line - up , but made it more powerful for the price .
The updated 13 - inch white MacBook now has a 2.1GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor and carries a 120 GB 5400rpm hard drive for a recommended retail price of £ 719.00 .
Yes - and no Mac tablet again !
A bitter pill for some , perhaps - my guess is that if Apple can't get it right , it had rather not do anything .
All in all , though , a great looking range of high quality MacBooks with superb video has just become available .
I can't wait to try one ( or two ) .
No cheapie was announced , which did n't surprise me .
I always thought that would be the case going by Apple 's record and outlook - but Apple has narrowed the gap considerably between its consumer notebook models ( the MacBooks ) and the professional notebooks ( the MacBook Pros ) , just like it did by releasing such powerful iMacs .
The Mac Pro towers are still out on a limb , with professional users often opting for all - in - one iMacs instead , and now pro notebook users may surveying the new MacBooks with lustful gleams instead of considering the MacBook Pros .
What is Apple 's grand strategy here ?
I guess all will become clear at Macworld in January .

First things first : they both survived .
The " Showdown in St Louis " between Joe Biden and Sarah Palin might more accurately be called the " Showdowns in St Louis " .
It really was the Tale of Two Debates .
I always wondered what a wolverine would sound like chewing through plywood .
Now I know : like Sarah Palin ' debating ' Joe Biden
Howard Fineman , Newsweek.com
Newsweek : Palin scored points Debate as it happened
In one ring was Sarah Palin battling comedian Tina Fey 's TV impression of Sarah Palin .
In the other was Joe Biden battling John McCain .
They both delivered somewhat uneven performances - but both " won " their individual bouts .
The question is - which one did more to carry his or her boss to victory on 4 November ?
Resisting temptation Mrs Palin 's prerogative was simple : deliver your talking points and pivot to an attack on Barack Obama - regardless of what moderator Gwen Ifill was asking .
The results of this strategy were mixed .
Sarah Palin did manage to keep Joe Biden on the defensive in the debate
For one thing , Mrs Palin 's repeated attempts to bait Mr Biden into making one of his famous " gaffes " or saying something " condescending " - she repeatedly sought to provoke his ire by pointing out instances ( such as Iraq war funding , or the experience issue ) where he and Mr Obama had disagreed in the past - did not succeed .
Not only did Mr Biden resist the temptation to charge her podium a la Rick Lazio , but he delivered crisp , clear ripostes that began with the words " That charge is not true " instead of , say , " Governor Palin is lying " .
( The one time he said " Sarah , " in fact , he immediately reverted to " governor " . )
That said , Mrs Palin did manage to keep Biden on the defensive - especially on raising taxes - for substantial stretches of the debate .
Always a good thing .
Exceeding expectations
Her strongest moments came when pivoting from the topic at hand to some sort of folksy , emotive talking point .
When Ms Ifill asked whether we saw the " worst of Washington or the best of Washington ... play out " in recent congressional jockeying over the bail - out bill , Mrs Palin detoured to the soccer field : Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" You know , I think a good barometer here ... is to go to a kid 's soccer game on Saturday , and turn to any parent there on the sideline and ask them , ' How are you feeling about the economy ? '
And I 'll bet you , you 're going to hear some fear in that parent 's voice . "
To practised ears , this sounded like a line that Mrs Palin had memorised and repeated .
But for voters who had only seen her fumbling through the Katie Couric interviews - or had only seen Ms Fey parodying her fumbles - Mrs Palin surely sounded clear enough , compelling enough and spoke enough common sense to seem like a competent public figure ( as opposed to an incompetent caricature ) .
She ultimately pulled off this trick a couple more times : mentioning her " middle - American " , " Joe Six - Pack " roots or admitting that it was time to stop " finger - pointing " and move past President Bush 's " big blunders " .
It was the main reason she exceeded expectations .
Swing voters
The problem for Mrs Palin , however , is that she often seemed to run out of talking points - at which point her answers would devolve into the confusing " blizzards of words " that ABC News interviewer Charlie Gibson recently endured .
Asked about the causes of climate change , for example , the Alaskan seemed unable to muster an intelligible response .
Palin proved that she 's not an incompetent speaker - and prevented herself from becoming a perpetual punchline
Biden and Palin dodge pitfalls Experts score the debate Send us your comments " I 'm not one to attribute every man - activity of man to the changes in the climate , " she said .
" There is something to be said also for man 's activities , but also for the cyclical temperature changes on our planet ...
What I want to argue about is , how are we going to get there to positively affect the impacts ? "
This is n't to say Mrs Palin crashed and burned .
She did n't .
Over the course of 90 minutes she undoubtedly sounded smart , savvy and spunky enough , often enough , to seem to belong on stage .
But there were simply too many of these " huh ? " moments - especially near the end of the debate - to convince the 60 % of voters who now say that Mrs Palin is not ready to lead the free world that they are wrong ( and that John McCain is right ) .
On Thursday night Mrs Palin proved that she 's not an incompetent speaker - and prevented herself from becoming a perpetual punchline .
But I doubt that she convinced many swing voters that she is qualified to assume the presidency at a moment 's notice .
Heart - rending story I think that this deficit rebounds to Mr Biden 's - and by extension Mr Obama 's - benefit .
Mr Biden did n't have a perfect night .
His performance seemed to veer from muted to blustery , and it took him a while to find his footing .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
But he never seemed arrogant , condescending or chauvinistic .
He never blathered on endlessly .
And he certainly never put his foot in his mouth .
More importantly , Mr Biden did what he came to do - make a clear case against John McCain .
You may disagree with his arguments .
Many will .
But it 's impossible to say he was n't polite , persuasive and well - informed .
In fact , he even out - emoted Mrs Palin , telling his heart - rending story about raising two sons after his wife and daughter were killed in a car accident .
People are " looking for help " , he said , choking up .
" They 're not looking for more of the same . "
Swing voters
Ultimately , partisans will ignore the errors and find much to cheer in each candidate 's performance .
But when it comes to the all - important swing voters , I suspect that Mr Biden may have the edge .
Unlike pundits , undecideds do n't have unique , finely - calibrated expectations for each candidate .
All - important swing voters told pollsters that Joe Biden won the debate Unlike partisans , they are not preconditioned to support the politician who flatters their ideological biases .
They are just looking for the most plausible president - or in this case , vice - president .
Mrs Palin delivered a largely positive performance .
But Mr Biden , I think , was more vice - presidential .
So far , the surveys seem to support this hypothesis .
CNN's " instapoll " gave the debate to Mr Biden , 51 % to 36 % , and 46 % of undecided voters surveyed by CBS News agreed ( 21 % thought Mrs Palin won ) .
Could these stats be wrong ?
Sure .
But even if the voters ultimately decide that the Showdown in St Louis was a draw , it wo n't be enough to alter the basic contours of the race .
Right now , Barack Obama is up by an average of six points and breaking 50 % in some polls - with only 33 days to go .
A tie wo n't do the trick .
In other words , survival is all well and good .
But it 's a far cry from winning on election day .

What are these ?
The great advancement in the technology can be seen in a lot of fields including the various kinds of advanced warfare available today .
Gone are the days when the only warfare used was the swords and other similar things .
Today , science has given various advanced equipments to be used by the people including the bullets .
However , the truth is that there is a lot of threat posed by all such advanced warfare tools .
There are so many people who are continuously in the threat of an attack due to these advanced equipments available .
All this calls for some advanced safety equipments also that can provide anyone safety against the fastest moving bullets .
The good thing is that there are various kinds of advanced body armors available that can help anyone avoid any possible threat from the bullets .
The use of the various body armors has no doubt existed for a long time now .
Some of the earliest body armors were made from the animal skin and later these started being made from the metals .
However with the evolution of the various advanced warfare , these have become very much ineffective to guard anyone against the danger of bullets .
That is the reason there have evolved various advanced body armors that are capable to protect one against the various modern warfare used today .
The best thing about the modern body armors available is that these can be very easily and comfortably worn just like any normal garment .
At the same time these ensure maximum safety to the person against any possible bullet attack .
Moreover , these are very much lightweight making them even more popular to be used by many people .
The bulletproof vest is one such modern soft body armor that has become very much popular due to the great versatility they provide .
There are a lot of threats that can be actually avoided with the help of bulletproof vests .
Wearing the bullet proof vest is very common among the various high profile people who constantly face some danger .
Some of the people best suited to wear bullet proof vest include the politicians , police men , military personnel , business men and various other celebrities .
There are various designs of the bullet proof vests that are available on the online store for you to choose one based on your needs .
Whatever you choose , this is going to be one of the best investments to ensure safety to you at all times .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Citgo Petroleum Corp , owned by the Venezuelan state oil company , is the only oil company so far to ask for emergency crude oil from the U.S. emergency petroleum stockpile in the aftermath of Hurricane Gustav , the Department of Energy said on Tuesday .
Citgo asked for 250,000 barrels of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for its refinery in Lake Charles , Louisiana .
The refinery ’s crude oil supply was disrupted when the Calacasieu Ship channel was closed .
The channel was reopened Tuesday but was restricted to ships with a draft of 16 feet or less .
“ The request is currently being reviewed , ” an energy department spokeswoman said .
“ Once the request is approved they will go into negotiations to deliver and ultimately replace the oil . ”
Hurricane Gustav barreled through the U.S. Gulf oil patch before making landfall in Louisiana , shutting down 100 percent of U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil output .
Thirteen refineries were closed in the storm ’s wake , representing 1 million barrels per day in lost gasoline output and 700,000 bpd in lost distillate output .
It may take two weeks for the Gulf to return to full production , emergency officials said .
Sensors on oil rigs and platforms in the Gulf , however , indicated no major damage to facilities from Gustav , although more checks still have to be made , American Petroleum Institute President Red Cavaney said Tuesday .
Oil prices fell to around $ 109 a barrel on Tuesday as fears of significant supply disruption from Gustav waned .
Crude oil prices have fallen sharply since setting record highs above $ 147 a barrel in July .
At least two other oil companies are assessing damage to oil rigs , refineries and pipelines along the Gulf coast and have said they will request emergency oil supplies if necessary .
Exxon said it was in touch with the Energy Department about oil supply options , including tapping the SPR .
Shell Oil said it was gauging its need for crude oil after Gustav , but it had not asked for any SPR oil yet .
“ We remain in close communication with the DOE .
As we assess the impact of Hurricane Gustav we continue to evaluate our supply options , ” a spokeswoman for Exxon told Reuters in an email .
Some energy experts said the damage from Gustav does not justify releasing oil from the emergency stockpile .
“ These refiners do n’t need the oil , but they may be tempted by the prospect of taking it , storing it , and turning it around in a few months at a profit , ” said one energy trader who asked not to be identified .
“ They could do this because of the shape of the futures curve , with prices running a more than $ 1.00 per barrel premium three months out . ”
Created by Congress in the mid-1970s after the Arab oil embargo , the Strategic Petroleum Reserve now holds more than 700 million barrels of crude oil at four underground storage sites in Texas and Louisiana .
Kevin Kolevar , assistant secretary for electricity delivery and energy reliability , said Monday that with a record amount of oil in the reserve and U.S. petroleum inventories held by private companies at very high levels , the United States can handle supply problems caused by the storm .
“ We are exceptionally well positioned to deal with temporary disruptions in petroleum supply , ” he said .
Scholars & Rogues wants to know : what do you think is the greatest technology in human history ?
Before you answer , what do we mean by “ technology ” ?
I think we all have sort of an operational idea in our heads of what we mean by the term , but if you ’re like most people , odds are pretty good that you ’ve never sat down and tried to articulate a real definition .
A couple pretty smart thinkers had some thoughts on the subject that you might find helpful .
Or challenging .
Let ’s see .
First , Arnold Pacey , a British scholar whose Culture of Technology helps us understand that technology is a lot more than just the machine itself , which Pacey calls the “ restricted ” sense of the term .
The machine – the technical dimension , is only a part of the whole picture .
Have a look at this diagram :
The bottom point is what Pacey calls the “ technical aspect , ” which includes “ knowledge , skill and technique ; tools , machines , chemicals , liveware ; resources , products , and wastes . ”
This lower third of the equation , the “ restricted meaning , ” is what most people – probably you included – mean when they use the term “ technology . ”
However , the “ general meaning ” incorporates the top two corners of the triangle , the “ cultural aspect ” and the “ organizational aspect . ”
The cultural includes “ goals , values and ethical codes , belief in progress , awareness and creativity . ”
The organizational signifies “ economic and industrial activity , professional activity , users and consumers , trade unions . ”
Put another way , the cultural is what people think about it , how they use it , what they believe about it , and so on .
The organizational has to do with official laws and policies governing its development and use .
Consider Pacey ’s example of the snowmobile .
It ’s one machine , one technical apparatus .
However , in some parts of the world it ’s a recreational vehicle .
In other places it ’s used to hunt .
In still others it ’s a work vehicle ( imagine that you ’re working on an oil pipeline in the far north ) .
And if you ’re just west of where I live , in Colorado ’s ski country , it can even be an emergency rescue device .
These distinctions matter when talking about a machine and help explain the difference between technical and technological .
As for the organizational dimension , think about all the ways in official policies ( governmental , corporate , etc. ) dictate how devices are used – or even ban their use ( or existence ) .
Right now you ’re using the Internet .
In the early 1990s the government made some important decisions about the Net , decisions that spurred its development as a commercial , social , educational and entertainment technology .
If the government had instead restricted its use for anything but , say , defense and intelligence gathering , we ’d have a very different Internet today .
That is , the Internet would be , wires and routers and protocols notwithstanding – a very different technology .
Next , let ’s broaden our understanding just a bit more .
In Technopoly , Neil Postman made clear that technologies are n’t always physical things .
One example was education – broadly considered , education is a tool that humans developed to serve a purpose .
( If we get just a little bit cynical , we might decide that education is a tool that can be used for a number of purposes , not all of them necessarily noble . )
So , with these things in mind , we here at Scholars & Rogues want to ask our readers : what do you believe is the greatest technology in human history ?
Feel free to nominate , debate , argue , debunk , whatever .
We look forward to hearing what you have to say .

Envy Casts Releases Rails 2.2 Screencast and PDF
Just two months ago , Gregg Pollack and Jason Seifer of the Rails Envy podcast launched Envy Casts , a micro-publisher in the Rails scene .
In anticipation of the release of Rails 2.2 , they 've released both a Ruby on Rails 2.2 Screencast and a Ruby on Rails 2.2 PDF ( written by Carlos Brando ; translated by Carl Youngblood ) .
They 're $ 9 each , or $ 16 as a package deal for the two .
Reviews follow :
The Screencast
The screencast is a 44 minute audiovisual extravaganza that demonstrates most of the significant new features in Rails 2.2 .
I discovered a lot of stuff I did n't know about , and while Gregg and Jason were still as entertaining as in their first screencast , they 've toned it down a little and focus more on the content this time around .
The diagrams and code examples are great and I found the format to be well suited for learning the material .
If you really want it all to sink in , you can watch the screencast at the same time as using their supplied code samples ( supplied in a separate file ) , as otherwise you get blinded by all of the cool new features and then need to rewatch it anyway !
In conclusion , this screencast is an awesome resource for getting up to speed with many of Rails 2.2's improvements ( though , significantly , internationalization is barely covered ) .
Unless you 're a die - hard follower of the commits on edge Rails , however , you 're going to pick up a whole ton of tricks and ideas from this video .
The PDF
The Ruby on Rails 2.2 PDF is a DRM - free PDF e-book that walks through all of the new Rails 2.2 features , along with a code example or two for each .
Clocking in at 118 pages ( landscape ) , the main bulk of the PDF spans 80 pages of step by step feature summaries of the changes to ActiveRecord , ActiveSupport , ActiveResource , ActionPack , ActionMailer , and Railties .
There 's also a chapter on the Internationalization ( i18n ) features and one covering a few new performance features .
Added to this are two laundry - list like chapters covering the " Bugs and Fixes " in Rails 2.2 and the obligatory " CHANGELOG . "
The main chapters of the book , summarizing the new features along with code examples , are good , and possibly worth the price of entry , although I find the PDF format ( for this sort of content ) and the landscape orientation cumbersome .
I 'd prefer a more accessible format .
The writing is solid and succinct though , and the code examples are as good as you 'd expect .

For a couple of hours , Arika McClure dreams about nothing in particular : elevators , motorcycles , a big empty green - carpeted building made of glass which she is trying to get out of but she keeps getting lost , rooms full of oddness ( not specific odd things , just rooms filled with the mental label , " odd " ) , being back at school , being late for school but her parents can't wake her up , flying across big blue oceans shaped like doughnuts , big eyeballs , Jason Chilton , hot acid , brick walls being pulled down , enormous towers of playing cards --
In the background , a long deep slow - motion voice is shouting something .
It takes a whole minute for one word to come out .
She senses movement .
She 's taken away from the apartment , down the stairs and out of the front door .
She 's stuffed in the back of a big heavy military truck which has pulled up , a black hood is pulled over her head , and for a long time there 's nothing but grumbling of the engine and momentum shoving her from side to side as the truck drives .
After half an hour they get to a big ramp leading down underground .
She becomes tired and irritable and confused as they drive deeper into the Brooksburg Air Base 's underground tunnels .
The tunnels get darker and narrower , quieter and slimier .
The truck seems to become smaller to navigate them .
It closes in around her .
They 've been driving for miles , now .
How long is this tunnel ?
Brooksburg does n't have tunnels , even .
Wait , yes it does .
She heard about them .
Never saw them .
But this is exactly what she imagined they'd be like .
-- pancakes and penny sweets and the smell of being at the beach --
They stop at a checkpoint and turn off the engine .
Two big soldiers - airmen - or is it three ?
- pull her out of the back and drag her through utterly , oppressively black corridors , boots crunching on gravel while she just watches the ground roll past and drags her toes behind them .
" Aaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrriiiiiikkkkkaaaaaaaaaah ... "
Susie .
In the background .
Arika 's so tired .
She just wants to sleep .
She knows the alarm went off .
She 's supposed to be getting ready for school .
But she can't summon the willpower to get out of bed .
She hits ' snooze ' again .
Three ( four ? ) men in dark blue flight suits drag her into a room with a chair in it .
One of those comfortable dentist chairs with an array of dentist 's tools on a tray nearby , which is fine , because dentists are highly trained people who know exactly how to use all of those tools properly without causing you pain --
But this is all a dream .
I 'm still asleep .
-- but big restraints too .
Restraints she can't get out of .
She was driven underground .
She was knocked out by the bullet and they grabbed her and Susie , who she 's supposed to be --
" Susie ? "
-- protecting , and took them to Brooksburg air base --
I 'm still asleep .
How do I know this ?
My eyes are still closed .
In the scary dream there are people holding her down as the dentist comes in .
She 's two hundred and fifty - six times stronger than a regular human and she can't get free or do anything but stare straight forwards at the huge whining drill bit moving gradually towards her face and --
" Arika ! "
Hello .
Arika opens her eyes .
The dream was a rough approximation to the reality .
Four airmen in big blue flight suits just like hers are holding her .
One for each limb .
One of them has a diamond - needled syringe aimed at the back of her left hand .
She knows it 's a diamond - needled syringe because it 's the only thing they 've found that 's sharp enough to puncture through her skin .
On Jason , even they do n't work .
But she 's still in the street .
Broad daylight .
That 's as far as they managed to bring her while she was unconscious .
Susie 's over there on the other side of the road being dragged away .
Being taken away down the street by that Moxon bloke .
I just got a good night 's sleep in about sixty seconds .
I did n't know I could do that .
Arika focuses back on her own situation .
She is being held down and a man is about to inject something into her .
So she pulls her left arm free , grabs the slowly crawling syringe and smashes it .
Like all the men , he has a big dark blue helmet and goggles on , just like the one she discarded in the apartment .
His face is completely covered .
She can't see his expression change .
She can't even see his eyes through the mirrored orange lenses .
But he looks wrong .
In her sixth sense , all four of the people holding her look broken .
They look inside out .
Like optical illusions .
Moxon has his arm around Susie and is holding her head down as if they 're running from gunfire .
In the distance there are a few jeeps approaching .
They 'll be here soon .
They could n't bring the vehicles in without making noise , without giving themselves away .
So they sent a few people ahead on foot .
Moxon and these four .
The man whose syringe she just crushed slaps Arika in the face .
She flinches .
But she 's still accelerated .
So how did he move so fast ?
These men are drawing power .
They 're Powers .
SHIT .
She punches him back .
She twists in mid air , wrenching her legs and remaining arm free .
She whirls upright and punches the next nose she sees , bounces off in the opposite direction to elbow a third man in the face , and then the fourth grabs her by the scruff of the neck and yanks her off - balance .
" Kkiillll hheerr ! " shouts a voice from down the road .
Moxon .
Can they fly ?
Arika plants her feet and launches upwards with the fourth airman hanging on .
At about rooftop level , she glances around .
He 's got something in his other hand .
It looks like a string with a dozen squidgy lumps of dough attached in a row , a big transparent plastic bag full of hot dog buns .
But the string is actually a twisted pair of red and black wires , and there 's a chunk of metal in the piece of dough at the far end .
He has one corner of the wrapper in his teeth .
He 's pulling the wrapping off .
A quick and practiced move .
Arika mentally likens it to soldier pulling a grenade pin with his teeth .
The words plastic explosives bolt through her head .
She starts flailing at him to get him to let go of her scruff .
He lets go , but even once he's got both hands off her he stays with her , which answers her question : yes .
He can fly .
With the string of explosives torn open he whips it at her , over - arm .
She dodges and , at first sight , it looks like he misses , the string going over her right shoulder .
But then the wire connects with her collarbone and it wraps downwards and she feels a series of small impacts on her back .
They stay glued to her .
Sticky bombs .
The man kicks over and dives backwards , letting out wire from a spool in his right hand .
In his other hand there 's a thing with a button .
The trigger .
Arika struggles for a moment but the bombs wo n't come off her back .
So she starts to dive after him .
She could have gone for the wire , but she does n't think of that .
She gets there fast enough to put a fist through the front of his face , but too late to stop him pushing the button .
*
This time she does n't actually pass out .
She feels the series of detonations slamming into her back like cannonballs , a few milliseconds apart .
Boom - boom - boom - boom - boom .
Arika does n't have time to wonder if she has spinal damage .
She spins wildly in the air , propelled by the explosions , and does n't have time to think about broken bones or the asphalt she 's about to hit shoulders - first or the man whose head she just destroyed and whose blood and skin and hood are still wrapped around her hand .
Someone intercepts her before she hits the road .
It 's the sniper .
She can tell because he's got the special rifle , the one which fires bullets four times faster than sound .
Bullets you can't hear coming .
Bullets a girl like her is n't fast enough to dodge .
He cannons into her from below , tosses her over his shoulder and grabs one of her ankles .
Now she 's hanging in front of him and the rifle in his other hand is braced at his shoulder and aimed down into her jaw .
( Not that " up " and " down " really mean anything with the horizon gyrating wildly around them . )
This is his mistake .
Now they 're together - static with respect to each other .
Arika is no longer disoriented by the spin .
She gets her head together a fraction of a second before he fires a bullet through it .
It 's just enough time to put a hand in front of the barrel .
POW .
The bullet takes a chunk of webbing from between her first two fingers and ricochets off her eyelid .
She howls in pain , takes hold of the sniper rifle barrel with the other hand , wrenches it out of the sniper 's hand , whirls three hundred and sixty degrees ( pulling her foot free ) and aims to smack him in the head with it .
He sees the blow coming a mile off and blocks it with the outer right forearm .
He 's slower than she is .
All four of them are slower than she is .
But she 's two hundred and fifty - six times stronger than a fifteen - year - old girl .
And they 're who - knows - how - many times stronger than strong , trained airmen .
And she 's hurt .
And they never taught her any combat .
There are anti-Power weapons , thinks Arika McClure .
There are super soldiers .
They harnessed it .
They can build super soldiers now .
They 're trying to kill me .
Arika swoops around behind the sniper and brings a chop down at his neck .
He twists with her and blocks it again .
She kicks him , retreats a metre , brings the rifle up to her shoulder , prays that it 's still loaded and pulls the trigger .
The sniper is too slow .
He takes the bullet in the left lung .
Blood spurts out of the wound in his suit and falls sideways .
Sideways .
Arika has lost track of the horizon .
They 've descended to just half a metre above the road , and are moving down it at high speed , as if they were fighting while hanging off the underside of a speeding truck .
The dead sniper hits the asphalt shoulder - first and begins rolling , spraying blood in a rough cycloid .
Arika tightens her grip on the rifle , rotates and stabilises on the air , just above the road , as if riding an invisible hoverboard .
She 's aching all over now , and exhausted .
She 's never felt exhausted before .
Not since she was Born .
Way down at the far end of the road she can see Moxon and Susie and the two jeeps .
Susie .
She clutches the rifle in her good hand and starts accelerating towards them .
There were two more of them , she remembers , but this time she is n't lucky enough to look around in time to see the shadow shooting across the face of the nearest apartment block towards her .
All she feels is the impact .
The car weighs two tonnes and lands on her at most of two hundred miles per hour , with the front bumper turned sideways to line up with her torso , hitting her head , shoulder , spine and legs all at once .
Arika ploughs into the road under the weight of the vehicle , tumbles confusedly over and through the shattered wreckage which spins out in all directions from the collision , and rolls to a halt in the middle of the white line , about a block short of where Moxon is now holding Susie at gunpoint .
She lies there for a long moment , taking stock .
She counts off her injuries : the hole in her hand , the bruise on her eyelid , painful sprains in ligaments she did n't even know she had , bones in her shoulder rubbing against each other in ways they should n't be and blood from her forehead wound trickling across her eye and dripping off her nose onto the asphalt under her head .
She wants to sleep .
She wants to go back to sleep until she wakes up in the hospital and it's all better , and for a moment she lets her eyes close .
But a tiny part of her brain screams , You are vulnerable now .
You are vulnerable and people are trying to kill you .
GET READY .
AND DON'T THINK ABOUT IT .
Shaking , Arika manages to lift her head a few inches off the ground and get an elbow underneath her .
There 's a flat shard of metal under her hand .
Big enough and jagged enough to take someone 's head off .
The last two come in from ahead , flanking her .
She does n't see , she just senses the shapes approaching , shapes which should n't exist , which make her feel ill to look at .
Do n't think about it , goes the knowledgeable - sounding little voice in Arika 's head .
She gets herself up to one knee , leans forward as if to steady herself as she stands up , takes hold of the shrapnel , screams and whirls it in a figure - of - eight .
The first slice passes horizontally through the eyes of the man on her left , around and back up through the rib cage and collarbone - the jolt as the blade tears messily through bone and organ almost takes it out of her hand .
She gets a better grip by the time she reaches the man on the right and pulls it cleanlier through his throat and C5 vertebra .
Schrwwrk .
Skharrrrchk .
Arika drops the blade and covers her eyes until they 're both dead .
*
" Ssttoopp oorr Ii kkiillll hheerr , " bellows Moxon from the end of the road .
Digitised , of course .
It 's impossible to give verbal commands to men who are listening hundreds of times faster than you 're talking .
He has a box which records what he says and plays it back at high speed .
And " stop or I kill her " is all he's had time to record since this started ... what ?
Five seconds ago ?
*
Susie Kuang has watched most of this .
She has n't been able to follow it .
Susie has only been dimly aware of dark blue blurs streaking around her field of vision and the incredible noise of the bomb , two gunshots , several hard collisions between fist and bone , and the smash of the Lincoln Continental landing on Arika 's back .
She sees a few corpses tumble out of the air and she sees the explosions of gore after Arika recovers from the car .
It 's not until a few seconds after this that Susie even realises that Arika is the one who has won .
Moxon has n't been trying to keep up with the fight .
He knows how it 's going just from the sounds ; the choreography is all his .
The fact that the gunshots go off at all is a bad sign ; it means the explosions did n't work .
The car impact is bad too , because it implies failure on the part of the sniper .
And the final two wet deaths mean that despite all calculation , the car , too , has failed to kill Arika McClure .
The other reason he does n't try to follow the fight is that he has no time to spare in preparing his backup plan .
While Susie is distracted by the fight he positions her in front of him , facing away , hands up , his gun to the back of her head , barrel buried under her hair , obscured from Arika 's point of view .
At the same time he has recorded his second message and hit the button to broadcast it at high volume .
He hits the button several times to get his point across , and after the fourth try he is certain that Arika has slowed down to regular speed , to talk to him directly .
He waves at the jeeps to stop before they reach him .
Men get out with machine guns and take defensive positions aimed at Arika , now standing over two bubbling corpses with a gout of blood splattered across the whole lower half of her suit .
" You take one step forward and I swear to God she dies , " shouts Moxon , directly , this time .
" This is a conventional nine millimetre Beretta M9 .
It 's not like that sniper rifle .
You can catch its bullets out of the air without raising your heart rate .
But there 's no way you can get from there to here before the bullet gets from here to her head . "
He positions his hand so the trigger finger is n't visible either .
Susie hears what Moxon is saying and tries to stand as still as she possibly can .
" Let her go , " shouts Arika , also not moving .
" I want to let her go , " says Moxon .
" I really do .
The last thing I want is for more innocent blood to be spilled !
That 's the whole purpose of Defense , after all .
To protect innocent people from people who might want to hurt them .
You 're up to a nice round two hundred and twenty - two people today , McClure !
And you 're not even eighteen !
That 's a pretty good record !
Where are you from ? "
" You were trying to kill me !
All you 've ever been trying to do is figure out ways to kill me ! "
" We were trying to stop you from killing more people ! " shouts Moxon .
" We were trying to stop you from hurting yourself even more by hurting people who are close to you !
Do you understand what 'll happen if you let word of this get out ?
Do you know how many civilians would have died today if we had n't had the area evacuated and kept you contained ?
We need to study this --"
" You are a liar ! "
Moxon keeps talking , " How long can this go on ?
A new superhuman every year until there are no humans left to be killed ?
You want to help people .
You want to be on the side of the good guys .
If you let us study you we can make more of you .
We can train you and put you to work .
And save lives . "
" Then put the gun down . "
" I can 't , " says Moxon .
" You know I can 't .
You have to stay where you are .
And we 'll work this out . "
Arika thinks .
She stares at Moxon .
He looked like such a nice guy when they first met .
He 's shorter than she is ( and she almost never sets foot on the ground anyway ) so he felt unthreatening to her and he felt like he had her best interests at heart .
Almost everybody she met on the base was like that .
Some were more irritating than others , but all of them seemed to be well - meaning .
But it was because they were scared of her .
And scared of Jason too .
This is about Power , she thinks .
They wanted Power .
They have that .
Then they wanted the power to kill other Powers .
They just need to be a little faster , and they 'll have that too .
They can just crank out armies of them .
She transfers her attention to Susie , whose hair is in disarray from being dragged down the street by Moxon and who has tears in her eyes and who is trying not to shake as she stands still with her hands knitted on top of her head .
Arika spends a long time trying to think of ways to save her .
She can't come up with anything foolproof .
She could cover the distance in a tenth of second , to be sure , or maybe even faster still , but how good are Moxon 's reactions ?
And he 's looking right at her , waiting for exactly that move .
And still talking , waffling away , stalling for time .
She could hurl the shard of metal at him , but no way in hell is she that good a shot .
Not with Susie in the way .
Stalling for time ...
*
Moxon resists the impulse to dive for cover when he hears the approaching roar , just in case McClure realises what 's about to happen .
He keeps talking right up until the impact , keeping her distracted and listening and thinking at human speeds .
There are bigger missiles ; this one had to be small for agility and most of its interior is occupied by the fastest guidance processor package known to mankind , but even so the explosion is big enough to shatter every window for a three - block radius .
Moxon and Susie are both hurled backwards by the shockwave and hit the ground hard .
Moxon cracks his head on a jeep fender before he stops rolling .
His ears ring .
His insides judder , pummelled by the sound of the blast .
By the time he shakes the stars from his head and locates Susie Kuang again , Arika is there , floating over him , fists clenched , eyes fiery , her hair and the side of her face blackened .
Somehow , he still has his gun in his hand .
He can't think of anything else to do but raise it at McClure and pull the trigger until it 's empty .
She stands there and lets him do it , snatching each bullet out of the air with the same hand , one by one .
They both know it 's not a serious attempt to kill her .
It 's a gesture of defiance .
She screams an ultimatum at him .
He can't hear it .
He 'd still be deaf from the blast even without the gunshots and the impossible thunderclaps from the caught bullets .
And then she turns , picks up Susie Kuang , and carries her away .
*
Unable to think of anywhere else to go , Arika flies back out into the desert , with Susie in her arms .
She gets a few miles out before the adrenaline rush of the fight begins to subside and the pain in her shoulder rapidly becomes so bad that she can't even carry Susie properly .
She sets her down on the plain and stomps away a step or two , refusing Susie 's help , clutching the joint and wincing as she tries to roll it around .
And finally , she breaks down and cries .

I 'm pretty sure they shook hands immediately after the debate was over while Brokaw was giving his closing remarks ... Remember they were standing together in front of his screen ?
I just do n't think the cameras caught it .
After double - checking the DVR , my reader is right .
McCain was n't an asshole at the very end .
My apologies for missing that at first , so I removed the Youtube .

With the economy in the pooper , and oil prices going down , you might think that renewable energy would once again be regulated to the “ also ran ” category .
But NO !
The U.S. wind energy industry installed 1,389 megawatts ( MW ) this quarter , bringing to 4,204 MW the total of wind power projects completed in what is expected to be another record year , the American Wind Energy Association announced today in its 3rd quarter market report .
With even more reported under construction , the industry is on track to surpass the banner year of 2007 , when 5,249 MW were installed , with a total of about 7,500 MW this year ( 7,500 MW would generate enough electricity to power the equivalent of about 2.2 million homes ) .
In welcome news for the economy , the industry is also aggressively expanding its manufacturing base in the U.S. , creating jobs and fostering investment and growth even in a difficult financial climate .
AWEAâ€™s report tallies the opening of eight new wind turbine component manufacturing facilities this year ; the expansion of nine facilities ; and the announcement of an additional 19 facilities .
As a result of recent manufacturing investment , AWEA estimates , the share of domestically made components in wind turbines has risen from about 30 % in 2005 to 50 % today .
The new facilities will create an estimated 9,000 jobs .
â€ œThe convenient truth here is that wind power provides a stimulus for our economy , as well as a climate change and energy security solution , â€ said AWEA Executive Director Randall Swisher .
â€œThe market , in spite of all its turmoil , clearly points to wind power as one of the most attractive energy options available today .
But if we are to keep this momentum going , the new President and Congress will need to put in place what the majority of the American people support but the country still lacks : a long - term renewable energy policy.â€ 
Highlights of the report / project installations :
Texas , reaping the benefits of its excellent wind resource and a proactive transmission expansion policy , added 693 MW – the most wind power capacity of any state in the 3rd quarter .
Texas moved into the 6 GW category , which propels it into the ranks of global leaders .
Only Germany , India and Spain had more wind energy capacity installed at the end of last year .
West Virginia :
The state with the fastest wind power capacity growth was West Virginia , which more than tripled its existing capacity with the addition of a 164 - MW project ; another 100 - MW project is scheduled to come online in West Virginia by the end of the year .
Utah added its first multi-turbine project , the 9 - turbine Spanish Fork project .
The Dakotas : Acciona Energy , a wind turbine manufacturer , brought its first U.S. turbines online at a 120 - turbine project straddling the North Dakota / South Dakota border .
Highlights of the report / manufacturing investment :
In August , Vestas announced plans to further expand its American manufacturing presence with new wind turbine blade and nacelle assembly factories in Brighton , Colo .
( the nacelle is the structure that sits at the top of a wind turbine tower .
It can be as large as a school bus , and houses the generator ) .
When fully operational in 2010 , the blade factory is expected to employ 650 people and the nacelle factory is expected to employ an additional 700 .
In September , TPI Composites opened a new production facility in Newton , Iowa , for wind turbine blades for the U.S. market .
At full capacity , TPI Iowa plans to employ 500 associates , giving the Midwestern city an economic boost .
Based on projections for the remainder of the year , 2008 will mark the fourth year in a row that new wind capacity installations have set records , but that is not expected to continue next year .
With some 8,000 MW already under construction for completion this year or next , the wind industry remains relatively strong .
But because of the late extension of the wind production tax credit and the evolving financial crisis , new construction starts are expected to slow in 2009 .
The steps that the new Administration and Congress take to promote renewable energy will therefore be critical .
Long - term , stable policies are needed to take full advantage of the industryâ€™s role in stimulating job creation and economic development , and to support growth of domestic turbine and component manufacturing , which will be one of the leading sources of new manufacturing jobs in the 21st century .
These policies include a long - term extension of the wind production tax credit ( the recent financial rescue package extended the credit for one year only ) , a federal renewable energy standard , strong climate change legislation , and investment in new transmission infrastructure .

The influence of the Web comic xkcd apparently knows no bounds :
It has now spawned a new and potentially game - changing feature on YouTube .
In this recent xkcd strip , comic creator Randall Monroe suggests that YouTube users would leave better comments -- or , more precisely , avoid leaving stupid ones -- if they first heard their words read back to them out loud .
Recognizing a good idea when one is offered up for free , YouTube developers went ahead and built the feature .
I just tried it : Wrote on one video , " Man , this is lame , " pressed the " audio preview " button , heard a reasonably audible rendition of the phrase read back to me , thought better of my contribution , and hit delete .
" I love that Google had the sense of humor to add this feature , " writes Matt Cutts , the company 's Web spam cop / blogger .
Me , too .
And it's not the first time xkcd has contributed to the betterment of the Internet .
About a year ago , researchers at the University of Southern California presented results from what they called the first full " Internet census " conducted in 25 years : 3 billion pings directed at 2.8 million Internet addresses .
From my post about that effort :
Presenting the census results graphically was a major challenge , one which researchers met through the help of a popular Web cartoon .
These addresses appear in the chart as a grid of squares , each square representing all the addresses beginning with the same first number ( " 128 , " in the preceding example ) .
The map is arranged not in simple ascending numerical order , but instead in a looping pattern called a Hilbert curve , which keeps adjacent addresses physically near each other , and also makes it possible to zoom seamlessly in to show greater detail .
" The idea of using a Hilbert curve actually came from a web comic , xkcd . "
Has a comic strip creator ever won a Nobel Prize ?
What questions would you pose ?
How would you respond differently ?
Use the comments .
P.S. In the last panel when Jesus said the “ right kind of person ” he was refering to the kind of person that repents and accepts Jesus as their personal savior and does n’t need any actual evidence that the whole story is true before they believe it .
Two days ago , Senator John McCain , speaking before supporters and trailing in nearly every poll announced : " My friends , we 've got them just where we want them . "
He said that without laughing .
Really .
Watching America collapse under the yolk of Republican ideologues this past eight years has been a gut - wrenching experience .
One of the ways I have , personally , survived has been through the use of humor .
After all , comedy is the flip side of tragedy , right ?
There are times , however , when I am prone to deep philosophical musings of an almost existential nature .
Admittedly , it 's usually after six boilermakers , a viewing of " Old Yeller " and right about the same time as I find the reading lamp a great conversationalist .
But , hell , I 'll take my philosophical musings where I can find them .
Which brings us to John McCain , the Republican equivalent of the last fifteen minutes of " Old Yeller " on a tape loop ... but with a slapstick pie fight thrown in for good measure .
McCain has taken the seriocomic status of George W. Bush and squared it in record time .
That 's quite an accomplishment , my friends .
McCain and Bush share a common background .
Both are the sons of privilege .
Both have father issues .
Both are borderline average , with doors magically opening for them because of their lineage .
Bush was a screw - up in every business venture he ever touched , was a lousy governor and , probably , the worst President of the United States ever .
His father or his father 's friends bailed him out of nearly every scrape he got himself into .
McCain , the son and grandson of admirals , was , as a lad , a - what 's that technical term I 'm grasping for - prick .
As an adult , he became an older prick .
Because of his military family , he was promoted in the Navy until , finally , he could n't be promoted anymore without half of the service having to don wax lips .
His nickname was " McNasty . "
At Annapolis , he was saved from expulsion by family interference and graduated 894th out of 899 .
Aside from his stint as a POW , his biggest achievement was in crashing three planes because of recklessness and causing a blackout in Spain while hot - dogging it through power lines .
After being assured by the Navy that he was n't going to become an admiral , McCain used his POW status as a neon hairshirt and entered politics .
His voting record shows his interest in one thing : the advancement of John McCain .
McCain would and will say and / or do anything to accrue more power .
I sincerely believe that the biggest difference between Bush and McCain is that Bush has sociopathic tendencies .
He either does n't know or does n't care about what cost his actions may bring to others .
In the middle of the current financial crisis , he claimed that he was glad he was at the helm when it occurred ; never once considering the fact that he and his minions were largely responsible for it .
If Alfred E. Neuman found Jesus , he'd be re-christened " Bush . "
I believe McCain knows what he 's doing .
Maybe , he even regrets it .
That makes him the sadder of the two and , also , the more dangerous .
He has built a career on lies and exaggerations and , now , he somewhat believes them .
Like most spoiled kids , he has lived in a bubble .
Today , he 's not only battling his own demons but the new and ugly presence of reality .
With his Cryptkeeper 's grin and his total lack of empathy for the " regular folks " he champions , McCain has resorted to the kind of campaign ethics Karl Rove made famous - only he 's screwed it up .
McCain exudes the type of cheerful bitterness found in a lot of old Boris Karloff movies ( " They laughed at me at the academy !
Laughed !
But behold my creation ! "
Enter : a blob of jello with the head of a gorilla . ) .
As a young man , he was P.O. 'd because he was short .
( For the record , I am shorter .
I remember a high school science teacher telling my mother he was giving me a passing grade because " You never mess with a short guy .
When you turn your back , they 'll hit you with a chair . " )
McCain married an ex-model , a tall willowy woman .
He called her his " long tall Sally . "
He dropped her after she had a car accident and 23 operations that shortened her stature some five inches .
He then married another willowy beauty , 18 years his junior and heir to a family fortune .
The cocky bantamweight was now , monetarily , a heavyweight .
Politics was the logical next step .
McCain has been forthcoming about his desire to be President for years .
His nomination in 2000 was sandbagged by Bush and Rove and some truly dirty tricks .
He 's never really gotten over that ... no matter how many hugs he and Dubya share .
In 2008 , he 's still short .
Now , he 's old , too .
That pisses him off as well .
He grits his teeth and goes through the self - deprecating " oldster " humor but imagine how much the reality of his life irks him .
In his mind , he 's still the dashing ( crashing ) fly - boy .
In real life ?
He 's a 72 - year - old leaning precariously for his last grasp at the brass ring .
As some people grow older , they maintain their relevance .
Ted Kennedy is a good example .
He has a fire in his belly that belies his age and his ailments .
He has had the same goal for decades : to help ordinary citizens .
McCain , on the other hand , has never been particularly relevant .
He has had the same goal for decades : to help John McCain .
While he waves his years as a POW like a flag , he has pretty much let veterans fend for themselves .
Disabled American Veterans give him a 20 % rating for his stance on veterans ' issues .
Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America give him a D rating .
( Obama has a B +. )
Perhaps his choice of Sarah Palin as a running mate was a way to appear relevant , to show that he 's " with it . "
She 's young , vivacious and winks a lot .
Even his youthful touchstone , however , has focused reality 's spotlight on McCain .
" What happens if he DIES and she becomes President ? "
" Suppose - God forbid , God-forbid , God-forbid - SOMETHING HAPPENS to McCain and she 's the next in line ? "
Slap .
It 's no wonder , then , that McCain 's bitterness , in general , has extended to Barack Obama , a younger , more charismatic and more thoughtful candidate - everything that McCain is not and never will be .
It 's no wonder that McCain has resorted to the type of smear tactics he decried back in 2000 , when they were aimed his way .
His campaign has been playing the fear / race card from the get - go and none too subtly .
Obama is " different . "
He 's " off the streets . "
He may be a Muslim .
He cavorts with terrorists .
He follows anti-American ministers .
He does n't love this country .
This racially - charged rhetoric has lit a dangerous fuse in a segment of the American population ; a population that is already afraid of nearly everything .
The Bush / Rove machine exploited fear as part of a political agenda .
They succeeded .
The American people , however , were n't aware of the political plan .
All they felt was the fear .
And , now , the McCain team is prodding that fear with a sharp stick .
They do n't know enough to back off .
If you wake this sleepy monster up , it 's not going away quickly .
A cursory review of cheezoid horror movies would clue them into that fact .
At a Palin rally , today , someone responded to the word " Obama " with the cry of " kill him ! "
This comes on the heels of such audience participation gems as " off with his head , " " traitor " and " terrorist " and signs reading : " Obama bin Lyin ' . "
McCain advisor Mark Salter dismissed any connection between the campaign and being " responsible for the occasional nut who shows up and yells something about Barack Obama . "
In Virginia , GOP Chairman Jeffrey M. Frederick advised McCain volunteers to stress the connection between Barack Obama and Osama bin Laden , saying : " Both have friends that bombed the Pentagon .
That is scary . "
According to " Time Magazine , " this cheerleading evoked shouted replies from the gathered volunteers of " And he wo n't salute the flag , " and " We do n't even know where Obama was really born . "
When McCain was told about this , he replied : " " I have to look at the context of his remarks .
I have always repudiated any comments that have been made that were inappropriate about Senator Obama .
The fact is that William Ayers was a terrorist and bomber and unrepentant .
I do n't care about that .
But Senator Obama ought be candid and truthful about his relationship with Mr. Ayers ( formerly of the Weather Underground and now a professor ) in whose living room Senator Obama launched his campaign and Senator Obama said he was just a guy in the neighborhood . "
Nice repudiation , eh ?
Last week , at a town hall mob , McCain supporter 75 - year - old Gayle Quinnel said to McCain " Obama is an Arab . "
He took the microphone from her and said that Obama was not an Arab ; he was a family man ( which , in its own way , is a back - handed racist remark ) .
Afterwards , Quinnel , in an interview , stuck to her guns .
" He 's ( Obama ) still got Muslim in him .
So that 's still part of him .
I got all the stuff from the library and I could send you all kinds of stuff on him . "
Quinnel is a McCain volunteer who spends her free time copying and mailing letters to people with " all kinds of bad things about him . "
At a Palin event in Pennsylvania , one older supporter brought a stuffed monkey with an Obama sticker affixed to its head to the rally .
" This is little Hussein , " he smiled while on line to enter the building .
" Little Hussein wanted to see truth and good Americans . "
When Obama supporters across the street yelled " racist , " the man held up the monkey and laughed .
Later , when he noticed TV cameras were on him during the Palin speech , he removed the sticker from the doll , crumpled it and handed the monkey to a young boy nearby .
Since the McCain / Palin duo has started with " the other " rhetoric , overt racism has bloomed on chat spots , including those sponsored by AOL and Yahoo !
One message , since removed from the Yahoo Message Boards , was entitled : " Planet of the Apes IMPORTANT . "
Said the commentator in all his loquacious glory : " Does n't Obama and Michell remind you of the simeans in Planet of the Apes .
People are ' impressed ' with Obama because he is an above average , articulate black guy .
I mean the main reason people worldwide have come to see him is much like when we see a trained chimp .
It is asonishing to think we can take gorillas and make them speak ... with articulation !!!!!!
Obama is a trained monkey ( unevolved but nonetheless trained ) .
That said , his wife looks to be the missing link !!!
She is just a classic , gorilla lipped , blue gum Negro .
Yikes !!!!! "
The writer signed his screed : " joeshitstack . "
Asonishing .
This past weekend , civil rights leader Rep. John Lewis commented that McCain and company were " sowing the seeds of hatred and division " in a way reminiscent of George Wallace .
The McCain crew immediately demanded an apology ... from Obama .
McCain campaign manager Rick Davis sniffed that : " The idea that you 're going to compare John McCain to the kinds of hate spread in the '60s by somebody like George Wallace is outrageous .
Where was John McCain when George Wallace was spreading his hate and segregationist policies at that time ?
He was in a Vietnam prison camp serving his country with his civil rights also denied . "
So , McCain critics ?
POW !
Right in the kisser .
Conservative zombie Jonah Goldberg also denies McCain is playing the race card writing " The most laughable evidence that McCain is sowing hatred stems from the shouts of ' terrorist ! ' and ' kill him ! ' from a few hothead buffoons at McCain rallies .
Of course , rather than foment this sort of thing , McCain went out of his way to chastise his own supporters personally and publicly . "
( NOTE : After just about every respectable commentator on both sides of the political coin cried " foul . " )
Goldberg figures that , if anything , Obama has gotten off easy .
" If Obama were a white Democratic nominee named Barry O'Malley , the GOP would be going after him twice as hard . "
Although , probably without the monkeys .
In spite of the fact that McCain and Palin 's not - so - coded rhetoric is appealing to the folks who found " Mandingo " a truly funny movie , they warn that they 'll continue .
McCain is threatening to bring up the dreaded name " Bill Ayers " in the next debate .
For the record , folks , the Weathermen , later the Weather Underground , was an anti-war group who rioted a lot and planted bombs in public places after calling in warnings .
Ayers was a member , not a leader .
In 1970 , a pipe bomb went off in San Francisco 's Park Station , killing a police officer .
The Weathermen , along with the Black Panther Party , were investigated .
No one claimed responsibility .
The case was never solved .
In fact , the only fatalities connected to the Weathermen were three of their own members , who died in a New York safe house when a bomb detonated prematurely .
When Bill Ayers turned himself in on December 3 , 1980 in New York , all charges against him were dropped .
In other words , bin Laden he ain't .
But McCain will continue to swing at the shadows , staving off the specter of not only his younger opponent but of his own mortality .
Growing old is not optional and it's not easy .
When my late father was in his mid-seventies , he would n't go certain places because the " joints were filled with those damned senior citizens . "
He did n't want to think he was one .
In my Dad 's mind , he was still the virile , curly - haired guy who almost bowled a perfect game and was a star softball player .
Getting older pisses a lot of people off .
Watching McCain in action reminds me a bit of my father in his later years .
He longed for the past .
He did n't feel totally comfortable in the present .
He focused on what might have been .
He watched Fox News and Howard Stern because they made him angry ... and anger kept him going for many years .
Seeing McCain avoid looking at Obama , or referring to him as " that one , " or pursuing various fictions as fact is more than just mere politics .
It 's fear .
Fear of change .
Fear that you 'll be left behind .
Fear that that brass ring will always be too far away to grasp .
Fear of the inevitable .
The title of this screed is cribbed from an old Bertolucci film .
Watching McCain flail away , day after day , saying nothing repeatedly as if the repetition made the nothingness relevant , I 'm reminded of another title - that of a Broadway show .
" Your Arms Too Short To Box With God . "

COMMENTARY
Lots of things that lots of people believed for a long time turn out to be completely off the mark :
The Earth is the center of the universe .
Heat and light are two different things .
Tomatoes are vegetables .
Humanity consists of five or six discrete groups classified by skin color .
That last one is still thrashing about , causing trouble .
But now that a world - class leader has emerged in America who may genetically embody and politically embrace a greater range of the world ’s people , it ’s time for science to step up and put the nail in the coffin of racial taxonomy .
Science has simple mission statement : Ask The Next Question .
It exists to re-invent itself in light of the last answer it got .
When a classification scheme is n’t working , a responsible researcher will bite the bullet and scrap it .
The construct of race was never more than a poor model .
Now it ’s become worse than useless .
It ’s divisive and destructive .
That any of us may choose to see ourselves as a descendent of Africa or Oceania or America or Europe or Asia tells the rest of us nothing at all about how we will individually behave or what we ’ll be good at or where we ’ll fail physically , intellectually or emotionally .
Currently , 21st century computing power offers the means to a much clearer understanding of who we really are .
When powerful search engines can navigate across and drill down through the broad spectrum of our species data , there ’s no need to dump us all into arbitrary buckets based on how we look .
And similar power is applicable to individuals ’ genetics .
Barack Obama is a public figure and , by all accounts , a good sport .
So , just for fun , I ’ve run some permutations of his well - known image using publicly available software developed at St. Andrews University ’s Computer Science Department .
This program computes appearance traits by broad general region .
It ’s like patching a music synthesizer ; you can sculpt the output by spicing the input with various ethnic seasonings and dialing up regional flavorings .
The result : billions and billions of Baracks !
Well , faces at least ; each a convincing portrait of someone you ’d like to get to know .
As recently as perhaps 150,000 years ago , we were all African .
We still are .
Other than that , all that science can definitively declare is that we ’re all Homo sapiens .
There ’s only one living subspecies .
Just one race : Human .
What prevents , say , an Ethiopian Muslim from having a child with a Japanese Jew ?
Tradition ?
Belief ?
Geography ?
Yep , all that and more .
But not biology .
In our genes , modern humans are all of one type .
The notion that there ’s a “ race gene , ” or even a definitive cluster of racially genetic material that might predispose a baby to any trait other than fuzzy placement in a wide range of two types of melanin ( red and brown skin pigment ) , is not now scientifically supportable .
This is bad news for ideologues of all shades , but glad tidings for the rest of us .
It means we ’re free to examine each other as individuals , liberated from assumptions and preconceptions .
But let ’s be clear :
This does not mean that light - skinned folks ( like me ) are now suddenly allowed to ignore racial issues .
Nothing in science excuses “ strategic colorblindness . ”
Social research has shown :
If we avoid talking about race , when it ’s appropriate to do so , we are often perceived as prejudiced .
When race is relevant , you risk being labeled as racist if you fail to address the matter square on .
You ca n’t erase the color lines in societies if you refuse to see them .
Barack Obama says : “ I am the son of a black man from Kenya and a white woman from Kansas .
I was raised with the help of a white grandfather … and a white grandmother …
I am married to a black American who carries within her the blood of slaves and slave - owners — an inheritance we pass on to our two precious daughters .
I have brothers , sisters , nieces , nephews , uncles and cousins , of every race and every hue , scattered across three continents , and for as long as I live , I will never forget that in no other country on Earth is my story even possible . ”
Mr. Obama tells his story on the scale of decades .
But , if we step back just three orders of magnitude in time — to the scale of tens of thousands of years — his story is , in fact , ALL of our stories .
It ’s the story of our sub -species .
And the shorthand of race — while tempting to impulses both bad and good — misspells that story so badly that it wildly skews its most important lessons .
What we — of all shades — tend to see as racial traits are almost always cultural customs or local social patterns .
Stuff we may have been born into , but were n’t born with .
To see what each of us truly brings to the world on Day One , we need to search and sort through the 3 - billion nucleotide base pairs of our genetic resumes .
We are living now just a few moments after the very dawn of genomics .
Imagine the state of astronomy , say , 75 years after Galileo ’s first peek at the mountains on the Moon .
Gene researchers now have great tools .
Not only computer chips but bio-chips and microarrays which facilitate scanning the filigree of your DNA to see what surprises hide in your personal package .
Human genomes have been sequenced — at first at great cost but getting cheaper on a better - than - Moore ’s - Law curve .
The present economic uncertainty may squash this burst of genomic geekery .
Before it does , send your saliva through the mail and a few start - up companies will read you your risk of 1,500 or so different ailments for which genetic markers are known .
If a certain single nucleotide polymorphism on your 19th chromosome is mutated , for example , you could be at increased risk for Alzheimer ’s disease .
But do n’t expect to learn why you cheated on so - and - so years ago .
No one has yet shown the genetic locus of any human behavioral trait in a rigorous repeatable experiment .
And the debate over the so - called “ gay - gene ” — the possibility of genetic predisposition to homosexuality — continues to rage .
It ’s not as simple as it seems .
For one thing , the dream that we ’d easily find a direct link between particular single genes , specific proteins for which they code , and unambiguous conditions that present in the grown - up individual has died .
There seem to be too few genes and way too much variation in people .
So what we ’re seeing is likely the result of how genes interact with one another and with other factors .
Big genomic breakthroughs are clearly needed to tease out these “ multigenic ” relationships .
But already , it ’s clear that nothing in the human genome can be categorized the way your college application insisted on inventorying you :
White , Black , Asian , Latino , Native American .
Now , there is a rough connection between geographic continent of ancestry and predilection for certain inherited diseases .
And of course there are specific diseases associated with ethnic groups whose members are related .
But now that we have the human genome in hand , why not just work to spot the disease pointers directly ?
Invoking the racial proxy has proven to be a slimy slope for science .
Once you start using race as a marker for medical maladies , it ’s hard to explain why skin color would n’t just as likely be associated with various behaviors .
Or intelligence .
A few good scientists have gone horribly bad when they let themselves get snookered by the nomenclature of race .
In Part 2 of Why Race Is Wrong we tell their stories , and examine where science sits on race vs. racism .
Oh , by the way : Tomatoes are essentially berries .
So are bananas .
And holding any individual person up to scrutiny based on racial stereotypes turns out to be much less fruitful than , say , comparing apples to oranges .
And you thought you were the only one who was " afraid of natural bodies of water because there might be shopping carts down there " ( like this guy ) or harbored a debilitating fear of lumpy foods , like this UK toddler who downs more than a dozen yogurts a day to compensate .
Well , maybe you are -- but you can be certain that you 're not alone when it comes to having esoteric phobias ; for every thing , place , activity or concept in the world , it seems , someone 's got a fear to go along with it .
We 're not interested in relatively common fears like hydrophobia or agoraphobia -- this is a list devoted to the weird , the rarely - documented , even the possibly - made - up ; and if you 've got one yourself , please share with us !
We found a lot of these on sites like unusualphobias and phobiac , which encourage user - submitted phobias of the first - person - narrative variety ; always good for a laugh , probably though not definitely true -- and usually not things you 're likely to find in psychology textbooks .
Chronohypochondia : the fear of traveling back in time only to contract a now - curable illness which you die of because your time machine breaks down .
One sufferer explains : " I have a fear that somehow I 'll go back in time and get stuck there , then get some illness that we have cured now ( like polio or the plague ) , and die from it all the time knowing that if I was here in time I would be saved .
So , I 've always wanted to learn how to make penicillin just in case . "
( We suggest you stay away from cheaply - made time machines from now on . )
Classicsphobia : the fear of Renaissance paintings , looming Greek and / or Roman statuary , and Greek gods in general .
One lost soul confesses one of the strangest combination phobias we 've ever encountered :
Hi , I have a very unusual fear , I have a fear of renaissance paintings .
It sound weird I know but thats not all ... along with that I have a fear of statues that are well done ( like big statues of people , mostly the greek statues ) , representations of jesus ... and arches and domes ( I can't stand under them if they are too big . )
I also fear greek gods , very random I know but I fear Poseidon coming out of water when I 'm in the pool or the beach ... and I 'm also scared if i'm under a big sky , by myself ... like a field or a place with no trees or buildings covering the sky ...
I get scared that Zeus is going to come down from the sky .
It 's allllll SO weird , I know , but it has taken over my life because I can't go into many places because of it .
On top of that , I have heard of no one with any of these fears .
Please -- if anyone has anything like what I 've mentioned email me and let me know because that would re-assure me .
Thanks ,
L .
Hyper-specific numerophobia : fear of the number 211 .
I can relate to this a little : when I was younger , for several years I was convinced that the number 333 was stalking me .
It seemed like every time I looked at the clock , it was 3:33 PM ( or , more rarely , AM ) , and it appeared frequently on receipts and the like .
I would n't qualify it as a phobia , however ; more of a compulsion , like this sufferer :
" Somehow I developed the fear of dying while reading a book between pages 208 - 211 , the odds of my death increasing with each number / page .
This has generalized into a fear of the number 211 -- when I pass a digital clock around 2:11 I nervously check to see if the fatal number has passed or not .
If it is 2:11 I 'm compelled to wait till the " danger " is passed , at 2:12 [ before resuming whatever I was doing before ] . "
Garthbrooksautophobia : fear of dying in a car crash while country music is playing on the radio .
I better let the phobiac explain this one : " I have a fear of being in a car crash , and as I 'm dying trapped in the wreckage , the radio gets stuck on a Country & Western Station , and I can't get to the radio to switch it off or change the station .
I do n't want to die like this !
I 've had this phobia since the age of 17 , I 'm now 36 . - R.S. " ( We 're assuming R.S. does n't appreciate country music . )
Beepaphobia : fear of beeps , bells etc .
This one 's downright existential ; sufferers seem to equate the irritating beeps that surround us in modern life ( microwaves , timers , watches , phone rings ) with some kind of existential countdown , signaling the eternal rundown of their personal life - clock .
Here are two separate accounts of this fear :
" OK , I 'm 15 and I have a fear of beeps !
No kidding -- when something beeps ( oven , alarm clock , etc. ) my heart starts racing and I get all nervous and irritated .
rrggg ... it 's soooo annoying ! "
A Chinese - language version of Skype scans users ' chat messages for keywords such as " democracy , " and sends a copy of the offending message to the company 's servers , according to a report released Thursday by a Canadian online human rights group .
That 's despite adamant claims by the Ebay - owned company that its software offers encrypted , safe communication .
Nart Villeneuve of the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab found that a Chinese version of the popular chat and internet phone - call software sent the full text of millions of messages with ' sensitive ' keywords to servers controlled by Skype 's Chinese partner TOM Online .
Captured messages discuss sensitive topics such as Taiwanese independence , tainted milk and the banned Falun Gong group .
Villeneuve used forensic software to watch how the TOM - Skype software communicated , and noticed that the software sent an encrypted message to an unknown server whenever he typed in an English curse word .
Following the electronic breadcrumb trail , Villeneuve found the servers belonged to TOM - Skype .
The servers were not secure and he was able to download both the logs and the key to decrypting them .
He claims to have found millions of communications , including undisguised communications from Falun Gong members .
Political activist groups often recommend using
Skype because the company promises that all messages and phone calls are protected by end - to - end encryption .
While that may be the case , the TOM - Skype software bypasses that protection by checking a text message against a secret keyword list either before or after the message is encrypted .
If found , the software would send an encrypted copy to TOM - Skype 's own servers .
The message is clear , even if the extent of Skype 's complicity is not , Villeneuve wrote in his report , Breaching Trust :
Trust in a well - known brand such as Skype is an insufficient guarantee when it comes to censorship and surveillance .
This case demonstrates the critical importance of the issues of transparency and accountability by providers of communications technologies .
It highlights the risks of storing personally identifying and sensitive private information in jurisdictions where human rights and privacy are under threat .
Villeneuve also found chat messages stored on the servers that had no such keywords , leading him to believe the system also has the ability to target individual users based on their handles .
Since 2006 , the software has been known to hide messages that contain sensitive keywords , but Skype has denied that there are any backdoors or reporting mechanisms in the software .
Skype did not immediately respond to a request about the truth of the report 's accusations or whether Skype knew about or designed the backdoor .
Skype 's president Josh Silverman responded Thursday in a blog post , writing that everyone knows China censors – but that Skype did n't know about the copying of messages to TOM Online 's serers .
In April 2006 , Skype publicly disclosed that TOM operated a text filter that blocked certain words in chat messages , and it also said that if the message is found unsuitable for displaying , it is simply discarded and not displayed or transmitted anywhere .
It was our understanding that it was not TOM 's protocol to upload and store chat messages with certain keywords , and we are now inquiring with TOM to find out why the protocol changed . [...]
Allowing the world to communicate for free empowers and links people and communities everywhere .
Our challenge is to bring this valuable service to people all over , including China , while being transparent to our users and staying within the boundaries of the local laws .
Skype is owned by eBay , which bought the popular online communication company for more than $ 2.5 billion in 2005 .
Hayden Carruth , AM ’ 47 , has the trappings of a successful writer , including the National Book Award for Poetry .
But his long road to literary laurels has had more than its share of agonizing detours .
Hayden Carruth was 33 years old when doctors told him he would never again live a normal life .
He had served in the Second World War , earned a master ’s degree at Chicago , and gone on to edit Poetry magazine , one of America ’s most distinguished literary journals .
In 1949 Carruth , AM ’ 47 , took the bold step — bold for such a young and unknown editor — of defending Ezra Pound , scorned for his pro-Fascist wartime broadcasts , when Pound received the Bollingen Prize .
He envisioned a long career as a poet , critic , and editor .
But this promise seemed lost when he suffered an alcoholic breakdown in New York City and ended up at the White Plains branch of New York Hospital , formerly the Bloomingdale Asylum .
In The Bloomingdale Papers , poems composed during his hospitalization , he wrote :
The diagnosis is
Anxiety psychoneurosis
( Chronic and acute )
Complicated by
Generalized phobic
Extensions and alcoholism .
Fifteen months in the “ loony bin , ” as he calls it , failed to cure him .
His crackup was in part the result of phobias and anxieties that had haunted him all his life , complicated by the alcohol he drank to keep them at bay .
After his release he spent most of the next decade in seclusion , too wracked with fear to venture out .
He continued to write , but it was , he has said , “ like squeezing old glue out of the tube . ”
He never recovered completely , but he did manage to reenter the world .
Drugs helped , as did the friendship of an understanding psychiatrist .
So did music , work , the love of women , and two decades spent scraping a living in northern Vermont .
There , far from the trodden paths of literary advancement , he began to regain his footing and find his voice .
He did it by becoming “ a yokel , a countryman , a guy who split wood and worked in a potato field ” — and a poet of unusual range and power .
His first book of poems ,
The crow and the heart , came out in 1959 , five years after he left the hospital .
Some 30 books followed , mostly poetry but also a novel , an anthology of American poetry , a collection of autobiographical essays , and a volume of letters to the poet Jane Kenyon published last September .
He has published several collections of reviews — work taken to pay the bills but that has earned him a reputation as a first - rate critic .
And he has written a book of essays on jazz and the blues , lifelong fascinations .
His poems explore the landscape of suffering and loss and are finely pitched to what Keats called the “ still sad music of humanity . ”
Carruth is also a poet of the erotic , alert to and grateful for the possibilities of joy .
His poems are technically accomplished — and deeply personal .
He draws upon philosophy , history , and literature while writing about everyday matters , from the hard lives of Vermont hill farmers to his struggles with mental illness .
Gritty and unsentimental , his poems are disarmingly forthright .
Wendell Berry , the Kentucky farmer and poet , has said , “ In his poems mind and heart speak as one , and his work has , in rare degree , the quality of trustworthiness . ”
Yet for many years Carruth earned little recognition .
Vermont named him poet laureate only after he had left for upstate New York .
But at 83 he has accrued a growing band of admirers and earned honors that long eluded him , including the National Book Critics Circle Award and the National Book Award .
Writing in the Nation in 1991 , editor Ted Solotaroff , AM ’ 56 , praised him as “ a people ’s poet , readily understood , a tribune of our common humanity , welfare and plight . ”
Carruth , he said , “ has worked as much in the American grain as any figure of his generation . ”
Carruth today lives in the hilly limestone country between Utica and Syracuse .
He and his fourth wife , Joe -Anne McLaughlin - Carruth , have a small red house perched on a hillside just outside the town of Munnsville , with a wide view of Stockbridge Valley .
He bought the house on impulse in 1988 while on the faculty at Syracuse University , where he taught for a decade after leaving Vermont .
A birdfeeder stands crookedly out front , and daisies and hawkweed flower in a nearby meadow .
Traffic whooshes past , too close , on New York State Highway 46 .
On a gray , drizzly day last August , he rises late and eats breakfast at 1:30 p.m .
This is typical for Carruth , who even as a child suffered from insomnia .
With a raspy but cheerful “ Come in !
Come in ! ” he walks to the door in slippers , baggy shorts , and a sleeveless undershirt .
His green eyes are small and watery , his skin sallow from too much time indoors .
He trails a line of clear plastic tubing that delivers oxygen to his nostrils from a pump humming in his living room — the consequence of emphysema from a lifetime of smoking .
With untrimmed white beard and flowing gray hair , he has an ancient , wild look .
Since open - heart surgery three years ago Carruth has moved more slowly .
He sometimes shuffles up the road , pushing his oxygen tank in front of him , but even this modest exercise is difficult .
He hardly goes anywhere except to accompany his wife to the store , or to visit her relatives in New Jersey .
He gives occasional readings , as he did last fall in Vermont , but spends most of his time at home , watching birds at the feeder , listening to the radio or watching TV , or slouched in a soft chair in the middle of a cluttered study , tapping out letters or other work on his laptop .
Carruth ’s wife , also a poet , hovers near him , a slender woman with thick auburn hair .
Despite a 30 - year age difference , the two are close ; they share their solitude in a town where both feel like exiles .
Carruth ’s poems pay frequent homage to his wife and her predecessors , sometimes in ways too personal for her taste .
“ He just has no sense of privacy , ” she complains .
“ None !
He ’ll tell people anything .
And he thinks that ’s the way you should be in the world . ”
Carruth grins .
Bluntness and candor are old habits .
Women have been an indispensable ingredient in his life .
Whatever pain his relationships have caused — and there has been plenty on both sides — women have led him again and again out of the prison of his anxieties and back into the human community .
He has married them , left them and been left , longed for them , depended on them — and written about them , as in “ Wife Poem ” :
… His last
cigarette , his final gulp of chardonnay ,
and he presses against her warm glow ,
thinking of how he swam as a boy
of twelve in the warm pond beyond
the elms and hickories at the meadow’s
edge .
He turned like a sleepy carp among
the water lilies , under the dragonflies
and hot clouds of the old days of summer .
Rejecting God and religion and what he sometimes dismisses as “ Christian bullshit , ” Carruth seeks no more transcendence than what human love affords .
“ The women in my life got me through , and sex with them got me through , ” he says .
“ I think it ’s more fun than anything else in the world , and more meaningful than anything else .
Now I ’m old and decrepit and I can say these things . ”
Carruth celebrates communion of all sorts .
As singular and outspoken as he can be , he thinks the ideal of American individualism is dangerous and inherently violent .
He knows too well the costs of solitude , and his poems display a respect for ordinary people .
He has a soft spot for animals .
Smudgie — or Miss Smudge , as he calls the cat more formally — was a thin , disease - ridden stray when he took her in a decade ago .
“ She ’s nothing but bones and fur , ” he says , picking her up and stroking her lank body .
“ But she ’s a nice little cat .
And she likes me and I like her , so we take care of each other . ”
Carruth admits to being “ a pessimist , skeptic , and grump . ”
He has written an entire poem against the assumption , perpetuated by the movies , that when someone hangs up the phone the person on the other end hears a dial tone .
He has a sly , often self - deprecatory sense of humor .
In “ While Reading Bash õ ” he addresses the Japanese poet :
Had you air , Bashõ ?
I mean enough to climb those
mountains ?
Or did you
stop every ten steps ,
leaning on your staff and gasping
like a fish ashore ?
Heavy drinking has at times made him difficult company .
And yet he has the gift of friendship .
He has been especially helpful to the young poets he has known .
The Vermont poet David Budbill describes Carruth as “ a temperamental , explosive , cantankerous , wonderful , generous , kind person . ”
On the day after his 83rd birthday , Carruth is in excellent spirits .
His wife brews coffee and serves leftover birthday cake , which he eats with relish .
Sitting at the kitchen table , he talks for hours — by turns gracious , opinionated , and funny .
“ I ’m pumped ! ” he says late in the day .
Carruth , whose grandfather wrote speeches for Eugene Debs , calls himself an “ old - line anarchist ” and a “ rural communist with a small c . ”
On this day he grumbles about President Bush .
In 1998 he declined an invitation to the Clinton White House for a celebration of American poetry , explaining in a letter that “ it would seem the greatest hypocrisy for an honest American poet to be present on such an occasion at the seat of the power which has not only neglected but abused the interests of poets and their readers continually , to say nothing of many other administratively dispensable segments of the population . ”
He has long resisted the notion that politics — or anything else — does n’t belong in poetry .
His poems are democratic in the broadest sense , siding with the weak against the powerful , oppressed against oppressor .
His sympathies extend even to despised creatures like rats and car salesmen .
“ I ’ve always felt sorry for the rats , ” he says .
A cry of protest rings through his work , an echo of what the New Yorker called his “ well - tuned orneriness . ”
He has written antiwar poems protesting Bosnia , Vietnam , Korea , Waterloo , and Troy .
In “ Emergency Haying ” he uses an anecdote about helping a neighbor bale hay to condemn suffering on a much wider scale :
…. My hands
are sore , they flinch when I light my pipe .
I think of those who have done slave labor ,
less able and less well prepared than I .
Rose Marie in the rye fields of Saxony ,
her father in the camps of Moldavia
and the Crimea , all clerks and housekeepers
herded to the gaunt fields of torture … .
… And I stand up high
on the wagon tongue in my whole bones to say
woe to you , watch out
you sons of bitches who would drive men and women
to the fields where they can only die .
For Carruth the world is suffused with sadness .
In a 2003 interview he recalled as a child “ looking at the stars in the summertime … and feeling a tremendous sorrow from simply knowing that they are not permanent . ”
But his awareness of impermanence does not keep him from finding opportunities to celebrate and affirm .
Music , especially jazz and the blues , has given him many .
In Chicago he taught himself to play the clarinet and frequented jazz clubs like the Bee Hive on 55th Street .
After his hospitalization he played the clarinet for hours each day , sometimes accompanying Music - Minus - One recordings .
His essays have celebrated jazz musicians and explored links between jazz and literature .
Calling jazz “ an eloquent articulation of every serious artistic , social , cultural , and philosophical happening in my lifetime , ” he suggests in the poem “ Freedom and Discipline ” that , at some level , poetry and jazz are one :
Freedom and discipline concur
only in ecstasy , all else
is shoveling out the muck .
Give me my old hot horn .
Carruth grew up in Woodbury , a small country town in western Connecticut .
His father and grandfather were writers and editors , and he assumed he would follow in “ the family racket . ”
He studied journalism at the University of North Carolina , Chapel Hill , where he worked for the student newspaper and met his first wife , Sara Hudson , AM ’ 47 , PhD ’58 .
“ He was interesting and full of life and ideas , ” recalls Hudson , professor emerita of English at Auburn University .
“ We were all gung - ho New Dealers .
We had a lot in common that way . ”
They married in 1943 on graduation day and enlisted in the Army , Carruth in the Army Air Corps ( serving in Italy ) and Hudson as a WAC .
After the war they took advantage of the G.I. bill to enroll at Chicago .
“ We just thought it would be more fun to go to school than to get a job , ” Carruth says .
It turned out to be an intellectual awakening .
His earlier literary education had been fusty and antiquarian .
At Chicago he took courses in 20th - century literature , bought literary magazines at the 57th Street bookstores , and made friends with other aspiring writers , such as Henry Rago , a poet and teacher who became one of his closest friends .
Carruth had been writing poems since childhood ; now he began to write more seriously and with a heightened understanding of poetry ’s possibilities .
“ Coming to Chicago , at that time and in that atmosphere , which you ca n’t altogether recover ... was a very liberating experience , ” he says .
“ You ca n’t read Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot and people like that without getting the idea that poetry is really important , and that poetic language is pure and has a certain element of social significance to it , and social influence .
I bought that line completely . ”
Realizing that he was not cut out for academe , he abandoned his studies and went to work at Poetry magazine , which had already begun to publish his poems .
Soon afterward , in spring 1950 , he was promoted to editor .
Poetry had a distinguished record of discovering and championing the best new American poets , and its offices were still a crossroads of literary activity in Chicago .
Yet Carruth felt the magazine had grown staid .
As he would write to his successor , Karl Shapiro , “ Poetry was a pussyfooting magazine for so long it damn near collapsed , & what it needs is a little life . ”
He tried to give it that life .
He expanded its prose section of essays , reviews , and editorials , some of which he wrote himself .
He campaigned in the magazine in support of Ezra Pound and the committee that had awarded him the Bollingen Prize , praising Pound as “ the poet whom nearly all of us would have to nominate as the single living person who has done the most to explore and develop the technical capacities of poetry in English . ”
On a broader , more philosophical level he defended modern poetry and decried “ the enemies of poetry , who are also the enemies of life . ”
Carruth ’s Chicago years shaped his sense of vocation , but they also brought growing difficulties .
His anxieties became pronounced .
He suffered from extreme stagefright and once fled a class he was teaching at a Gary , Indiana , college .
Walking down the street was equally harrowing : several times he collapsed on the sidewalk from the strain .
He began to see a psychoanalyst , but it did n’t seem to help .
“ He was getting worse , ” Hudson says .
“ He said he ’d rather be blind than have what he was afflicted with . ”
Carruth drank a lot — everyone seemed to .
“ We had great parties , and probably too much drinking , ” says Hudson .
His domestic life grew increasingly tumultuous .
When upset , he ’d jump in his car and drive off , sometimes disappearing for days .
“ Hayden is very headstrong and is determined to do , often against his best interest , what he feels he has to do , ” Hudson says .
“ I can only describe it as compulsive .
And it was self - destructive . ”
His job at Poetry also soured .
He clashed with the magazine ’s trustees , who felt uncomfortable with his forays into literary politics .
For his part , Carruth chafed at restrictions : the trustees had insisted that other editors approve any poems the young editor published .
Carruth ’s behavior also offended .
In the middle of the night , Hudson recalls , Carruth called up trustee Marion Strobel and , with his wife imploring him not to , told Strobel he was quitting .
In January 1951 , less than a year after he became editor , Poetry ’s trustees replaced him .
Losing his job was a blow , but a worse one followed .
Months after the birth of their daughter Martha ( a painter who died in 1997 ) , Hudson left him , returning to Alabama with their child .
The split would haunt him for years .
It was , he once reflected , the “ principal and determinative fact of my life . ”
Carruth found a new job at the University of Chicago Press , where he met Eleanor Ray .
When Ray moved to New York he followed , and they both found publishing work .
Their marriage in 1952 was short - lived .
Carruth ’s mental state was fragile , and in summer 1953 he fell apart .
His psychoanalyst found him drunk in his apartment and urged him to seek hospitalization .
“ I had one of my abandonment crises , ” Carruth explains .
“ That ’s a phobic part of my psychopathology .
Nobody knows what started it exactly .
But I ca n’t stand to be alone .
I go completely off the rails . ”
So Carruth entered Bloomingdale .
At first his doctors urged him to write poems as therapy .
He used a portable typewriter , sitting before the window of his small cell .
Two decades later , in 1975 , the University of Georgia Press published The Bloomingdale Papers , which gives an account of the forces that led to his breakdown :
I do n’t mean to say
There were n’t good times .
The bad predominated .
Booze helped immensely .
Work also , but not ,
Unfortunately , writing .
Friends and parties and lovers
Lent ease to my unease
Sparingly .
The doctors kept
The anxious pot aboil .
So passed the years .
The writing therapy failed to cure him .
A few months later , he was transferred to a ward for chronic cases and underwent a series of electroshock treatments .
For the rest of his stay he wrote no more poetry .
Instead he watched the McCarthy hearings on television and played , by his count , 1,500 games of solitaire .
But he kept trying to get his poems published .
On June 26 , 1954 , he sent a batch of poems to Shapiro , Poetry ’s new editor , with an apologetic note : “ I am very sorry to submit to you such unprintable manuscripts , and without any return postage , but that is the best I can do in this place .
I hope you do n’t mind .
Please exercise your judgment severely on these . ”
When he left the hospital he was in worse shape , he says , than when he entered it .
He spent the next five years living in an attic room in his parents ’ house in Pleasantville , not far from White Plains .
In 1999 , in a short essay in The Sewanee Review , he described his state of mind :
Agoraphobia is when a stranger enters the house and you go to the attic and lie down with your face pressed into the darkest corner , under the slanting slats of the roof .
It ’s the scream lurking in your gorge , so ready to burst that the least noise above a cat ’s purr makes you tremble : when the marching band from the high school practices in the street outside you sit in the back of the closet , when the March wind lashes the treetops at night you crawl behind the sofa .
Agoraphobia is when every night at 2:00 a.m. for five years — that ’s 1,825 nights — you go out loaded with Thorazine to walk in the street beneath the dark , blank windows of the houses on either side , and you never get more than a hundred yards from your door .
...
Agoraphobia is when you breathe and eat the dust of oblivion .
Carruth was not especially close to his family .
Although his younger brother Gorton attended the U of C when he did , their paths seldom crossed .
“ He ran his life and I ran mine , ” says Gorton , PhB ’48 , now living in Briarcliff Manor , New York .
It did n’t help that Carruth wrote unflattering accounts of family dynamics .
Of his lifelong smoking habit , which began when he picked up cigarette butts as a nine - year - old , he wrote that it was one way to defy “ the whole mind - set of Carruthian secular and neurotic puritanism ” and “ the fear of talking about it , of talking about anything that might be charged with negative feeling ” :
Cigarette smoking was a way to cross the immense barrier between the Carruths and the rest of the world , which I wanted to do more than anything .
I wanted to be ‘ out there ’ with the others , away from solitude and fear .
I never made it and never will .
Precisely how this dynamic knot of attraction and repulsion evolved over the years and became an ineradicable component of my being , is unknown to me .
I doubt anyone could figure it out except in gross , uninteresting terms .
But I know it is there , close to the heart of my psychopathological life , creative and destructive , a strength , a weakness , a function of the basic energy that has always driven me .
Carruth tried with difficulty to keep up with friends .
“ You do have your beautiful lake , though , which I think of often with great longing , ” he wrote to Henry Rago , who had become editor of Poetry .
“ Someday I hope to see it again . ”
In 1958 he sent Rago some poems but suffered doubt , saying , “ I am timorous about many of these things because I know they are not in the fashionable mode and , aside from my poor talents , may seem simpleminded .
I work as I must , however . ”
Turned down for a Ford Foundation grant , he despaired , “ I begin to perceive that I am pretty much a has - been in this literary business . ”
His most pressing concern was how to make a living .
An office job like those he ’d held in Chicago and New York was out of the question .
His publishing contacts eventually helped him pick up contract work , reviewing books , writing blurbs , ghostwriting , and editing encyclopedias .
He spent four years compiling his anthology , The Voice That is Great Within Us : American Poetry in the Twentieth Century .
Once , desperate for work , he typed manuscripts for $ 1 per page .
This “ hackwork , ” as he called it , occupied his time and energy for the next 25 years .
He resented it but took it seriously .
“ I did a good job , ” he says .
“ I know grammar up and down and backwards .
I had a pretty good vocabulary .
I can fix up people ’s manuscripts — I spent my life doing it , poetry and prose .
And I ’ve done it for money when I could get it . ”
During his isolation Carruth continued his education .
“ On the weekends I read Aristotle , who strains my inexperienced brain fearfully , ” he wrote Rago in 1959 .
“ My aim is to live to be 90 and complete my education at 85 .
This will give me a five - year vacation . ”
Of the hundreds of books he read , Camus struck him most forcefully .
As much as the writer ’s existentialist convictions , he admired his commitment to truth , and resolved to adopt a similar stance : “ I had to say to myself when I was in my 30s , with Camus in mind , that I ’m going to write what I know is honest and true about myself with my own talent , ” he says .
“ I started out writing formal poetry , not only formal in language but formal in attitude , trying to be the big Eliot - type person .
And it was n’t for me at all .
I realized if I was going to get anywhere at all , either in literature or in life , I had to change , and I had to become open , totally . ”
After five years in his parents ’ attic Carruth improved enough to move to Norfolk , Connecticut , where he lived in a cottage that belonged to James Laughlin of New Directions books —
Ezra Pound ’s publisher — whom he ’d met while at Poetry .
He did editorial work for Laughlin , and he met Rose Marie Dorn , a young refugee from Eastern Europe .
In 1961 , at age 40 , he married for the third time .
The couple had a son , David , and when they went looking for a home they concluded that the only place they could afford to buy was in northern Vermont .
They found a house with 14 acres and a creek outside the town of Johnson , near the spine of the Green Mountains , 25 miles from Canada .
Carruth worried that the residents would distrust him because he was college educated and wrote poetry .
But when he proved he could fix machinery and cut wood , they accepted him .
“ I had a lot of friends , many country people , in the town of Johnson and surrounding towns .
I worked on their farms , and they helped me on my place . ”
He helped his nearest neighbor , a dairy farmer named Marshall Washer , do chores in exchange for milk .
He raised a garden , kept ducks and chickens , and sold eggs .
It took him a month each year to cut enough wood to heat his house during the long winter .
As he makes clear in “ Concerning Necessity , ” this was no rural idyll :
ho we say drive the wedge
heave the axe run the hand shovel
dig the potato patch
dig ashes dig gravel
tickle the dyspeptic chain saw
make him snarl once more
while the henhouse needs cleaning
the fruitless corn to be cut
and the house is falling to pieces
the car coming apart
the boy sitting and complaining
about something everything anything
Earning a living meant doing manual labor during the day and hackwork in the evening .
Only after midnight could he turn to poetry .
In his workroom , a one - cow barn he had wired and fitted with a woodstove , he wrote until five or six in the morning before going out to shovel snow or to split wood .
“ It was a hard life , but it was not impossible , ” he says .
And it did him good .
Everything about his life in Vermont — the work , the land , the seasons , the people , his family — seemed to carry him toward “ a gradual triumph over the internal snarls and screw - ups that had crippled me from childhood on . ”
Budbill says that Carruth could n’t ride a bus or read his poems before an audience but functioned well enough with the individuals and small groups he might run into on trips to town .
“ He ’d stand around and jaw with whoever was there , for hours , ” Budbill says .
“ In those kinds of contexts , with ordinary people , in the feed store , restaurants , wherever , he was as gregarious as any human being could be . ”
Vermont also transformed Carruth ’s poetry .
At times his work made writing poetry impossible , and he almost forgot he was a poet .
Yet his poetry became more vital , liberated .
“ I could write poetry about things I really knew something about , ” he says .
“ I could write about simple things in simple language and I wanted to do that .
... I did n’t want to be Robert Frost exactly .
I mean I definitely did n’t want to be Robert Frost .
I did n’t like much of his poetry and many of his attitudes .
But I did want to be a country poet who was appreciated and read as widely as possible . ”
His country poems are among his most popular and highly praised .
Poems like “ Marshall Washer ” describe with intimacy and straightforward affection the land , its inhabitants , and a way of life that was dying even as he wrote about it .
They are cowshit farmers , these New Englanders
who built our red barns so admired as emblems ,
in photograph , in paint , of America ’s imagined
past ( backward utopians that we ’ve become ) .
But let me tell how it is inside those barns .
Warm .
Even in dead of winter , even in the
dark night solid with thirty below , thanks
to huge bodies breathing heat and grain sacks
stuffed under doors and in broken windows , warm ,
and heaped with reeking , steaming manure , running
with urine that reeks even more , the wooden channels
and flagged aisles saturated with a century ’s
excreta .
Carruth has a sharp eye for nature and humanity .
Until recently , his wife says , he carefully recorded the daily weather , including temperature , rainfall , and barometric pressure .
His Vermont poems adopt the voice and point of view of ordinary people , like this old hill farmer in the long poem “ The Sleeping Beauty ” :
... I mind
When them old hooters had plenty eating material
Round these parts , and other folk too .
Course
That were times gone .
You could prevail
With but fourteen head of cows
Then , if you had the makings .
Makings ?
What I call
Makings of a man .
And that means straight out all
The time , with children on the way ,
An orchard , guarding , a fair stand of hay ,
Pigs , chickens , you know — what we meant by farming
In those days .
It ’s all changed now .
In Vermont Carruth was not cut off entirely from literary society .
In summer he had visits from such admirers as Mark Van Doren , Denise Levertov , and Adrienne Rich .
The 1960s back - to - the - land movement also brought younger poets to Vermont .
He encouraged their writing , though their friendships were not primarily literary , says Budbill .
“ It was mostly based on country life , exchanging recipes , helping each other split wood , smoke a pig .
We talked a lot more in those days about pickups and quality of the wood than about poetry and iambic pentameter . ”
By 1979 Carruth was working 80 to 90 hours a week and still earning too little to support his family .
He tried unsuccessfully to find full - time work at a Vermont college or university , and when Syracuse University offered him a professorship in its graduate program in creative writing , he left Vermont — and his wife — for suburban Syracuse and the more conventional academic life of a contemporary poet .
It took him time to get used to teaching .
His anxieties persisted ; too afraid to cross the university quadrangle , he skirted around the edges .
In 1985 he returned to Vermont , but a year later was back in Syracuse .
In 1988 a breakup with a girlfriend led him to attempt suicide .
Still , Syracuse led to a new stage in his development as a poet .
Living on the city ’s outskirts he began writing poems inspired by people he encountered along the commercial strips , poems gathered into Asphalt Georgics ( New Directions , 1985 ) .
And a series of honors arrived .
It was the professorship , Budbill suspects , that finally admitted Carruth “ into the circle of acceptance ” and led to his Collected Shorter Poems : 1946 –1991 ( Copper Canyon Press , 1992 ) earning the 1992 National Book Critics Circle Award .
Four years later Scrambled Eggs & Whiskey : Poems 1991 –1995 ( Copper Canyon Press , 1996 ) won the National Book Award .
The awards have made him feel no less an outsider .
He remains bitter about what he considers his marginalization by the literary establishment .
Yet his admirers have not stinted their praise .
As long ago as 1986 M. L. Rosenthal declared in the New York Times that Carruth “ has now become our elegist par excellence . ”
Joseph Parisi , AM ’67 , PhD ’73 , another of his Poetry successors as editor , admires Carruth ’s perseverance .
“ It ’s a remarkable story of endurance , of tremendous power of will , ” Parisi says .
“ I think it ’s a heroic life myself .
Hayden is a genuine poet who has never been one to play the game , which is what so many writers do now .
Instead of being a smooth , glad - handing , conference - going kind of guy , he kept his energies focused on what was important , which was his work . ”
Writes Pulitzer - winning poet Galway Kinnell , “ More than in the case of any other poet , Carruth responds to Whitman ’s words : ‘ I was the man , I suffer ’d , I was there . ’”
For Carruth struggle has been the stuff of life and poetry .
“ If you ’ve got any courage and any sense of responsibility , you ’ll do what you have to do , ” he observes .
“ I do n’t give myself any extraordinary credit for that .
But the difficulties were there and the difficulties made my poetry better .
I ’m convinced of that . ”
The final adversary , old age , is , and has been , upon him .
He has written about that too , in poems like “ Song : Now that She is Here ” :
Old age is failure .
Natural
Exhaustion , mind and body letting go ,
Words misremembered , ideas frayed like old silk .
Carruth still writes poems , but not often , and none that satisfy him .
He has abandoned his most ambitious project , a four - part epic called American Flats , which was to have begun with the conquest of Mexico .
He ’s too old , he says , tapping his forehead .
More and more thoughts of death crowd his mind .
Most of his old friends are gone , including his Vermont neighbor , the farmer Marshall Washer , who died in 2003 .
What is left ?
In an autobiographical essay , Carruth compares writing a poem to sexual climax .
“ In the ecstasy of composition , ” he says , the poet “ is most himself , yet …at that very moment is also aware of his communion with many others , or with the great Other at the center of humanity . ”
When the poem is finished , he says , the knowledge of communion does n’t vanish .
It remains :
So it is for the old man in his cave of darkness , regretting his arthritis and impotence and failing imagination .
The knowledge of communion is still there .

Study Shows Teenagers Are n't Engaging in Oral Sex Instead of Intercourse
By Kelli Miller Stacy

May 21 , 2008 —
A new government survey detailing sexual activities among America 's adolescents dispels the notion that teens often substitute oral sex for intercourse .
" There is a widespread belief that teens engage in nonvaginal forms of sex , especially oral sex , as a way to be sexually active while still claiming that technically , they are virgins , " says Laura Lindberg , a senior research associate at the Guttmacher Institute , in a news release .
" However , our research shows that this supposed substitution of oral sex for vaginal sex is largely a myth .
There is no good evidence that teens who have not had intercourse engage in oral sex with a series of partners . "
The Guttmacher Institute study analyzed data involving 2,271 teens aged 15 to 19 who took part in the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth ( NSFG ) .
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and others use NSFG findings to study health and plan health education programs and services .
The current analysis paints a vivid picture of teenage sexual activity in the U.S. and clouds perceptions that teens are likely to substitute one type of activity for another .
Instead , the findings suggest that adolescents are more likely to try a range of different sexual activities around the same time .
For example , some may try oral sex right before having intercourse for the first time , while others may have vaginal sex shortly before experimenting with oral sex .
Other findings from the study include :
Half of teens aged 15 to 19 have had vaginal sex .
Slightly more than half ( 55 % ) have had heterosexual oral sex .
11 % have had anal sex .
Teen are much more likely to have oral sex once they have intercourse .
The study showed that only one in four teenage virgins had oral sex .
But six months after losing their virginity , more than four out of five teens were having oral sex .
Within three years of first having vaginal sex , 92 % had engaged in oral sex .
Oral and anal sex do not lead to pregnancy , but engaging in such behaviors puts teens at risk for sexually transmitted infections ( STIs ) , including HIV , chlamydia , and human papillomavirus ( HPV ) , which has been linked to cervical cancer .
A recent CDC study showed that one in four teenage girls is infected with at least one STI .
The researchers say their findings have clear policy implications and criticize abstinence - only programs .
" Counseling and education should take into account total STI risk by addressing the full range of behaviors that teens engage in , including oral and anal sex .
It is crucial that teens receive evidence - based education and counseling about STI risks and protective behaviors for all types of sexual activity , " Lindberg says .
" The federal government 's exclusive emphasis on abstinence - only - until - marriage programs does not give teens the skills and information they need to be safe . "
The Guttmacher Institute study represents the federal government 's first measurement of the commonness of both oral and anal sex .
The study findings are published online ahead of print in the Journal of Adolescent Health .

Google satellite 's eye - opening first picture promises even clearer views of Earth
Google 's new satellite has beamed back its first picture , taken the moment the on - board camera was switched on .
The crystal - clear image promises to make the internet giant 's photographic atlas , Google Earth , even more detailed .
The satellite went live for the first time two days ago following its launch last month from a U.S. air force base in California .
Pin-sharp ... yet GeoEye - 1's picture of Pennsylvania 's Kutztown University campus was taken from 423 miles above
' This image captures what is in fact the very first location the satellite saw when we opened the camera door and started imaging , ' said Brad Peterson , vice - president of GeoEye , the company behind the £ 300 million satellite .
The picture , showing a university campus in Pennsylvania , was shot by the GeoEye - 1 satellite from 423 miles up in space , yet looks like the view from a plane close to landing .
And the resolution will become even more precise , making GeoEye - 1 the most accurate mapping satellite ever - reportedly 50 per cent better than previous generations .
' We expect the quality of the imagery to be even better as we continue the calibration activity , ' said Mr Peterson .
In fact the images will be so precise that only the U.S. government will see them at full resolution - clearly showing objects just over 16in across .
Google , as the satellite 's main sponsor , will have exclusive use of lower - resolution images for Google Earth and the associated Google Maps in a few months ' time .
These will show objects 20in across - but that is a big improvement on the 24in resolution currently used by Google .

Today the Nobel Prize committee announced the Nobel in chemistry would go to a group of US and Japanese researchers who discovered the green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) in jellyfish and transformed it into one of the most powerful research tools in genomics .
Although GFP can make glowing kitties ( above ) , glowing bunnies , glowing monkeys and mice ( below ) , it has far more important applications for medical research .
The eye - catching protein is used as a visual tag , linked to other genes or cells that scientists are tinkering with .
As a result , scientists can literally see the results of their experiments .
Now you can too .

The " brainbow , " with its dozens of glowing colors , was created when scientists mixed a few of the primary colors available from fluorescent jellyfish proteins ( green is n't the only one ) .
They wound up with nearly 100 colors , and used them to tag neurons in the brain so that they could follow the complicated interlinking pathways of each neuron and see the neurological structures of a mouse brain .

Early experiments with GFP created mice like these , which express the glowing green gene in all their cells — not just neurons .
The result is a mouse that glows just like a jellyfish .

Usually , however , scientists link GFP with another gene — if the creature they 've engineered emerges glowing like these monkeys , they know the linked gene is active too .
These monkeys were engineered to have the gene for Huntington 's Disease , and the gene was tagged with GFP .
Because they glow , researchers are certain they have the sought - after gene and can study the monkeys to figure out possible cures for this neurodegenerative disorder .

I am a huge proponent , at all times , of doing nothing .
Remember when everyone was filling bunkers with millet because computers would n’t be able to handle a year with three zeros in it ?
I stayed Calvin Coolidge cool .
After America was attacked on 9/11 , I suggested keeping our armies home .
When John McCain responded to the economic crisis he ’d have to deal with as president by suspending his campaign , I started to think that maybe he ’s my guy after all .
Even though I understand so little about economics that much of my long - term investments are tied up in Costco products , I feel pretty sure that letting Congress give Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson $ 700 billion to buy super - crappy mortgages is not the right call .
Sure , like any American , when I see a photo on the Internet of an adorable little investment bank and find out it ’s at risk of being put to sleep , I want to throw in $ 2,000 to $ 3,000 of my own money to adopt it .
But instead of jacking up inflation , letting the dollar sink further and paying higher taxes so we can keep up cheap borrowing -- which is what this plan amounts to -- I think we need to let those who made bad loans get burned .
We need to accept that credit will dry up and that maybe -- for just a bit -- we ’ll have to stop buying more than we can afford .
Because it ’s not just the Wall Street bankers who over - leveraged their companies who are to blame .
Do you have credit card debt ?
Did you buy a house with less than 20 % down , or with an adjustable - rate mortgage , assuming that skyrocketing equity would let you refinance or flip it ?
Of course you did n’t , because you ’re a super - intelligent reader of my column .
But do n’t you think every single Rosa Brooks reader did ?

Americans have been living beyond our means , and we should have recognized that fact the moment we saw those glass Voss water bottles .
But we can recover from our misbehavior through a little austerity , like having only one house -- perhaps one NBA players could n’t play chicken in .
More than the mistakes made along the way , however , I fear the overreaction to them , a lesson I learned from chief economist Wyle E. Coyote .
So let ’s not stop the short - selling of financial stocks -- the only brake on overindulgence -- as Paulson did last week .
Let ’s not strip Congress of yet another power by giving the Treasury secretary the right to decide where to dole out a large portion of our budget .
Let ’s not encourage more risky loans by making profits private and losses public .
And let ’s not create some bastardized form of communism in which the new rule is , “ From each according to his ability , to each according to the size of the investment bank he owns shares in . ”
And if we really are going to give money to the rich , let ’s at least follow the rules we demand other countries adopt when the International Monetary Fund bails them out : slash spending , balance budgets and eliminate trade restrictions and subsidies .
We also sometimes force them to come here and clean our houses , do our gardening and watch our kids .
I foresee a not - too - distant future when Chinese guys complain about how every time their cheap Google phone breaks , they ca n’t understand the tech - support guy because his Mandarin has a thick Minnesotan accent .
More than 100 of the nation ’s top economists -- from the left and right as well as other countries -- signed a letter to Congress warning it not to let Paulson have his way .
We ca n’t panic at a dropping Dow Jones industrial average , rising interest rates or companies going under ; capitalism means that our over - excitement will lead to some down years after a lot of good ones .
But the best economic system is still one in which $ 700 billion of decisions are spread among all of us , not one guy who used to run Goldman Sachs and who , just this summer , said that the economy was fine .

We ’ve got a basically sound banking system that got a little under- regulated during the Clinton administration .
We just have some unsound banks that I hope will be replaced by ones with much more exciting names , such as Citi :) or the Bank of OMG .
This recession is going to be ugly no matter what we do .
Which is why I suggest doing nothing .

Mobile developers have a new playground to play in .
Today , the Google - led Open Handset Alliance followed through on its promise to make its source code available for free as part of its Android Open Source Project
The first Android - based phone , the G1 , was released earlier this month by T - Mobile and the Android software has been available to beta testers .
Since the operating system is open source , the OHA is touting Android as the first truly open , full - featured mobile platform that lets anyone create a mobile device without restrictions .
However , the news comes at a time when mobile platforms are more open to developers than ever .
Earlier today , Research in Motion announced it will launch a BlackBerry application storefront next March and is targeting the Web as a primary development focus .
The handset maker also announced new tools today to kick - off its first - ever developer conference .
BlackBerry 's storefront announcement follows the runaway success of Apple 's App Store for the iPhone which has attracted thousands of developers and new applications .
Unlike OHA , Apple ( NASDAQ : AAPL ) has tighter restrictions on what applications are approved for distribution .
The OHA is further distinct in making the entire mobile " stack " or software layers necessary to build a mobile device , available as open source .
The goal is to make hundreds or even thousands of Android - powered devices with , different configurations and features , available from a wide variety of manufacturers .
" It 's a challenging time to be a mobile developer with so many platforms to choose from , RIM , Android , Apple , Windows Mobile and Symbian , " analyst Maribel Lopez told InternetNews.com .
" I think the reality is the industry has taken two steps forward and two steps back . "
Lopez , principal analyst and founder of Lopez Research , said the new development platforms means more opportunity for customers to get cool and interesting new devices and applications , while developers get more chances to differentiate what they create .
" At the same time , you do n't have the scale of the PC market , where you create , say , a Windows application that runs on over 80 percent of the hardware out there , " she said .
" It seems like there 's a natural evolution going on as we progress from highly proprietary , locked - down platforms , to now where the developer can decide where best to spend their resources . "
Andy Rubin , senior director of mobile platforms at Google ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) , said the open source model allows greater access to ideas and innovations .
" An open sourced mobile platform that 's constantly being improved upon by the community and is available for everyone to use speeds innovation , is an engine of economic opportunity and provides a better mobile experience for users , " Rubin said in a statement .
Google said it expects an initial wave of Android applications to include location - based travel tools , games and social networking offerings available directly to consumers at low costs .
Choice or fragmentation ?
Analyst Jack Gold said he expects the Android release to have a positive effect on the mobile marketplace .
" It 's going to enable a lot of creativity and that 's a good thing , " Gold , principal analyst and founder of J.Gold Associates , told InternetNews.com .
But Gold also warned that Android 's open source foundation comes with risks .
Companies can use Android as a starting point and add extensions .
So , for example , a company might require that developers support additional features not in the standard Android code .
" In an open source environment , companies can do whatever they want to do , so imagine ten different companies going in ten different directions , " Gold said .
" There are pros and cons to any new platform , " he added .
" With Android , we 'll just have to see how well the community controls itself , managing new contributions to the code base and keeping a level of consistency . "
Oh man , it ’s like Haze all over again , except LittleBigPlanet is n’t a derivative , generic first person shooter .
Despite what we were told yesterday , it does appear that Sackboy is running a little behind , and will now launch on the 31st of October , or perhaps even later , according to rumours floating around this lunchtime .
Which is fine , really , because there ’s loads of other stuff to play in the meantime , but for those of us with review copies and no way to go online until the retail servers go up , the wait is even worse …
We ’ve asked Sony for clarification on this , but right now this is strictly a rumour .
Update 1 : could be as late as Mid-November .
Still no reasons , but rumours abound of a recall …
Update 2 : could be a recall , apparently there ’s a song on the soundtrack that ‘ could be offensive to people with certain religious beliefs ‘ .
Update 3 : we ’re now being told by readers in mainland Europe that the game is being recalled from certain retailers .
Again , this is n’t confirmed yet .
Update 4 : right , we ’re not posting more about this , but we ’ve just seen this , and we do n’t think it ’s right to speculate further .
We ’re told that SCEE will issue a statement shortly , and we think it ’s best that the issue is dealt with via a proper press release .
Update 5 : official press release .
BERING SEA , ALASKA - 53 - year - old crab fisherman Captain Sig Hansen was the victim of a brutal attack early this fishing King crab season .
Hansen , captain of the ship the Northwestern , was walking down the pier to his ship after dropping off a catch when an unidentified mugger struck him .
Hansen took his wallet out to appease the mugger , when the mugger caught sight of his driver 's license .
Shouting , " You goddamn Norwegians !
You 're always taking the best crab from the Hillstrands ! "
The mugger then beat Hansen to the ground , striking him in the face repeatedly , before pulling out a fishing knife and carving the letter " M " into Hansen 's right cheek .
When asked about the incident while recovering in the hospital , Hansen said , " If I ever find the sunnuvabitch who did this , he 's gonna get the treat of a Norwegian toddler pen .
I 'm gonna throw him in a crab pot and sink him where the sun do n't shine .
" No suspects have been named , and police are looking for anyone who might have information concerning the identity and whereabouts of Cpt. Hansen 's attacker .
Determining whether or not hot water can freeze faster than cold water may seem like a no - brainer .
After all , water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius .
And would n’t water hot enough to kill E. coli bacteria ( about 120 degrees Fahrenheit or 50 degrees Celsius ) take a longer path than cooler water at a fall New England beach ( about 60 degrees Fahrenheit or 15 degrees Celsius ) towards a frigid future as ice ?
While a logical assumption , it turns out that hot water can freeze before cooler water under certain conditions .
This apparent quirk of nature is the " Mpemba effect , " named after the Tanzanian high school student , Erasto Mpemba , who first observed it in 1963 .
The Mpemba effect occurs when two bodies of water with different temperatures are exposed to the same subzero surroundings and the hotter water freezes first .
Mpemba ’s observations confirmed the hunches of some of history ’s most revered thinkers , such as Aristotle , Rene Descartes and Francis Bacon , who also thought that hot water froze faster than cold water .
Evaporation is the strongest candidate to explain the Mpemba effect .
As hot water placed in an open container begins to cool , the overall mass decreases as some of the water evaporates .
With less water to freeze , the process can take less time .
But this does n’t always work , especially when using closed containers that prevent evaporated water from escaping .
And evaporation may not be the only reason the water can freeze more quickly .
There may be less dissolved gas in the warmer water , which can reduce its ability to conduct heat , allowing it to cool faster .
However , Polish physicists in the 1980s were unable to conclusively demonstrate this relationship .
A non-uniform temperature distribution in the water may also explain the Mpemba effect .
Hot water rises to the top of a container before it escapes , displacing the cold water beneath it and creating a " hot top . "
This movement of hot water up and cold water down is called a convection current .
These currents are a popular form of heat transfer in liquids and gases , occurring in the ocean and also in radiators that warm a chilly room .
With the cooler water at the bottom , this uneven temperature distribution creates convection currents that accelerate the cooling process .
Even with more ground to cover to freeze , the temperature of the hotter water can drop at a faster rate than the cooler water .
So the next time you refill your ice cube tray , try using warmer water .
You might have ice cubes to cool your drink even sooner .

I recently had the opportunity to ask former US Middle East envoy Dennis Ross this question :
Should the US create foreign policy on the basis of what Israel perceives or threatens to do ?
His answer was startling and ominous .
Dennis Ross is a bright shining lie .
He is the type of brilliant bureaucrat that can lie the US into a war with the credibility of a Colin Powell and the blind dedication of a Douglas Feith .
His war of choice is Iran , and if all goes according to his envisioning , he will be a prominent player in an Obama administration when the first American - supplied smart bomb is dropped in a US - sanctioned Israeli attack on Iran in 2010 .
Ross claims to be an accomplished diplomat , and an objective and dispassionate analyst of the Middle East .
He was in fact an abject failure as Bill Clinton ’s Middle East coordinator1 and is a zealous advocate on behalf of the Israeli government and its American supporters .
As Clinton ’s envoy and negotiator , Ross ’ forte was justifying Israeli non-compliance with their own previous agreements , ( many of which were formal and signed ) and then renegotiating those agreements on Israel ’s behalf .
This tactic directly led to the breakdown of Syrian / Israeli peace talks in 2000 .
Ross ’ duplicitous style also proved extremely deleterious in negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians .
The Palestinians , and even some American diplomats , asked President Clinton to replace Ross because of his dishonesty and bias , but Clinton always refused to do so .
Somehow , in spite of all evidence to the contrary , Ross has been able to successfully cultivate and maintain his false public image as a successful and dispassionate mediator .
A couple of weeks ago , Ross , who is presently advising and campaigning for Presidential candidate Senator Barack Obama , gave a lecture at Colgate University , a small liberal arts school in Central New York .
It was during the question and answer period that I brought up a prominent report in the Israeli press which said former member of parliament and former cabinet minister Ephraim Sneh , speaking for his government , sent identical memos to both Senators Obama and John McCain .
The memos declared that Israel would attack Iran in 2010 unless the “ Iranian nuclear threat ” is negated by a US attack or a regime change in Tehran .
Subsequent to having received the memo , Barack Obama was asked at a campaign stop in Iowa if Israel felt it had the “ green light ” from the US to attack Iran .
Obama chose not to answer the question directly , claiming any answer would be speculation .
Instead the candidate responded , “ my job as President would be to try to make sure that we are tightening the screws on Iran … before Israel feels its back is to the wall . ”
My question to Dennis Ross , a logical choice for a senior foreign policy appointment in a Democratic administration , was whether he believes it was wise for Obama to imply that he would create US foreign policy on the basis of what Israel perceives or threatens to do .
This is especially important since we are apparently talking about a massive Israeli military assault on Iran which could escalate into a wider war and have a grave impact upon American interests and armed forces in the region .
Ross ’ answer was astounding .
He said he sees nothing wrong with Obama ’s statement since the candidate was only stating a fact .
Ross then said if the Israelis want to attack Iran there is nothing the U.S. can do to stop them .
Unfortunately , I did not have an opportunity for a follow - up since a visibly agitated Ross concluded his response with his back toward me and quickly went on to the next questioner .
If I had had a chance for a follow - up , I would have pointed out to Ross that to say that the US cannot stop Israel from attacking Iran is simply not true .
One proof is that the Bush administration prevented such an attack just last summer .
This has been widely reported and publicly confirmed by Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak .
Is Ross saying that although the Bush administration blocked Israel , our Barack will not consider stopping their Barak if Israel chooses to assault Iran ?
Did n’t the American people vote for a less militaristic approach to foreign policy in 2006 , thinking that by electing a Democratic majority in the House of Representatives they were voting for peaceful solutions ?
Is anybody in the Democratic Party listening ?
Ross ’ bellicose stand on Iran actually comes as no surprise to anyone who is familiar with his slavish obeisance to whatever is the current Israeli policy .
Last week Ross wrote that the Bush administration is failing in regard to Iran , opining that we cannot afford “ four more years of US policies that are tough rhetorically but soft practically . ”
In a recent Wall Street Journal article co-authored with Richard Holbrooke and James Woolsey , with whom he has founded the group called United Against Nuclear Iran , Ross and his colleagues beat the drums for war with the usual exaggerated warnings of imminent danger and a dubious list of past and future Iranian transgressions .
In an article in the Financial Times , Daniel Dombey and James Blitz wrote that Ross , working with the Bipartisan Policy Center , a Washington think - tank , has produced a report calling for the Americans and Europeans to bypass the United Nations and impose tougher sanctions on Iran .
In addition to the sanction campaign , the report , which is titled “ Meeting the Challenge : US Policy Toward Iranian Nuclear Development , ” recommends taking military steps such as “ pre-positioning additional US and allied forces , deploying additional aircraft carrier battle groups and minesweepers [ and ] emplacing other war materiel in the [ Gulf ] region . ”
The report further urges that these military actions should be taken by the new President on his first day in office !
During the Oslo peace negotiations , far from being an honest broker , Ross was actually Israel ’s lawyer , working tirelessly to achieve what he believed to be the best possible outcome for his client , then Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak .
After negotiations failed , like any good lawyer , he praised his client and immediately and deceptively placed all fault for the breakdown of the Camp David summit on Yasser Arafat , despite a prior agreement not to do so .
Arafat had been reluctant to participate in the summit since he correctly believed that the timing and the “ make or break ” nature of the planned meeting would be disadvantageous for his side .
The Palestinian leader only agreed to attend when President Bill Clinton promised that neither side would be publicly held responsible if the talks failed .
Ross has been violating that agreement continually and vociferously for the past eight years by unjustifiably blaming the Palestinians for the failure of Camp David .
Mercifully , this was not a part of his stage show at Colgate .
At Colgate , Ross was introduced as a Soviet scholar and diplomat who has been devoted to pursuing peace in the Middle East .
No mention was made of his long association with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy ( WINEP ) which is a prominent pro-Israel think - tank founded by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) .
The introduction did not state that Ross is currently an advisor to Barack Obama and that he is campaigning for the candidate among Jewish voters using a talking point that Obama will stop Iran from threatening Israel .
Finally , the introduction did not mention that Ross is Jewish , with many professional and personal ties to the State of Israel .
Interestingly , Ross himself did not voluntarily allude to any of these very relevant details during his talk , which was mostly about Middle East diplomacy , although some of these facts surfaced during the question and answer session .
Dennis
Ross bristles when he is characterized as a member of the pro-Israel lobby .
He was , however , one of the public intellectuals who were prominent in the vociferous and disingenuous attacks on John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt , two academics whose recent book , The Israel Lobby , angered many in the pro-Israel camp .
Yet Ross differs with many in the American pro-Israel community in that he always seems to side with the current Israeli government even when most members of pro-Israel American organizations such as AIPAC , do not .
Ross will advocate territorial compromise if the present Israeli government supports it .
Thus he was a champion of the Oslo peace process , is a supporter of talks with Syria and was an advocate on behalf of Ariel Sharon ’s disengagement from Gaza .
On the other hand , a vast majority of pro-Israel American organizations and their members are more in tune than Ross is with the settler movement and right - wing Likud party line , and are prone to reject any Israeli negotiation or territorial compromise .
Before I arrived at Colgate , I considered raising some issues during the question and answer session about Ross ’ unsuitability to represent US interests in regard to the Israeli / Palestinian conflict and with the Arab world generally .
In addition to his affiliation with WINEP , a lesser known conflict of interest and one that may be an even greater indication of Ross ’ bias , is his chairmanship of the Jerusalem - based think - tank the Jewish People Planning Policy Institute ( JPPPI ) .
JPPPI is a part of the Jewish Agency for Israel .
The Jewish Agency or the Sochnut ( Agency ) , as it is usually referred to in Hebrew , is an important Israeli quasi - governmental entity which originally was the government - in - waiting under the British Mandate .
Today the Jewish Agency has a more limited role but still is an important well - funded institution in Israeli - Jewish society .
On the subject of Iran , Ross is a fervent and active advocate for Israel and their ill - conceived planned military attack .
Like Vice President Cheney did with Iraq , he ignores all evidence which does not support his preconceived view .
Like Cheney , he even ignores the reports of the U.S. intelligence community .
( The National Intelligence Estimate of 2007 casts doubt on the view that Iran will shortly possess nuclear weapons . )
He also ignores the fact that Israel wants to destabilize Iran because of Tehran ’s support of its enemies , Hamas and Hezbollah .
This may be the main reason for any Israeli aggression against Tehran and not the alleged nuclear threat .
The U.S. Secretary of State Robert Gates has stated that a US or Israeli attack on Iran at this time would not be in the best interests of the United States .
Gates averred that such an attack would play havoc with the price of oil and cause massive Iranian retaliation , possibly coordinated with Hamas , Hezbollah and Syria against US forces and against Israel .
Not everyone in Israel wants to attack Iran .
Interior Minister Meir Sheetrit cautioned that “ Israel must on no account attack Iran , speak of attacking Iran or even think about it ….
[ A] ttacking Iran on our own initiative is a megalomaniacal reckless idea . ”
The current decision - makers in the Israeli government , however , are willing to either ignore or accept the disastrous consequences of an attack on Iran even though they have agreed to delay it .
If elected , Barack Obama probably will have to decide whether the United States will regard Iran ’s “ nuclear threat ” from an Israeli perspective and agree to their planned attack .
If he has to make that decision , let ’s hope Dennis Ross will not be one of his key Middle East advisors .

Back during the spring and early summer , as the price of oil climbed higher with each passing day , it seemed that every energy analyst was saying the price of oil would climb to and stay within the $ 150 to $ 200 range within months , if not weeks .
Of course , this sort of fed on itself , and was a major driver behind escalating oil prices , which eventually topped out at $ 147.11 a barrel on July 11 .
Since then , the price of oil has fallen to $ 107.89 – a drop of over 25 % .
This recent decline , brought about thanks to a stronger dollar , weaker economies and declining worldwide demand , has made many analysts do an about face and predict that oil will now continue to fall and end the year within the $ 80 to $ 100 range .
Maybe if their energy analyst gig does n’t work out , these people can find work as weather forecasters .
It certainly seems to me that these energy analysts are nothing but trend followers , and are unable to look beyond the status quo .
While this in and of itself does n’t make them terrible people or completely incompetent at their job , I do take issue with the fact that their words seem to carry so much weight with the market .
Think about it – much of the inflationary pressures we ’re faced with are due to higher oil prices .
Since it ’s clear at least some of the run up in oil prices can be attributed to analysts ’ predictions , do n’t they have to shoulder some of the blame for $ 4 gas , and the fact inflation is at its highest levels since the late 1970s and early 1980s ?
Now , I ’ll be the first to admit I did n’t expect oil prices to drop this far , but I have neither the access to the same data these guys see , nor does my opinion help to dictate what the world pays for oil and oil - based products .
So , hopefully in the future , either these analysts will keep their mouths shut , or the market wo n’t put so much weight into what these people have to say .
Vince Acors was in Dubai on holiday when he met Michelle Palmer A British man and woman have been sentenced to three months in jail in Dubai after being found guilty of having sex on a beach .
Michelle Palmer , 36 , of Oakham , Rutland , and Vince Acors , 34 , of Bromley , south - east London , were arrested on 5 July .
They were fined 1,000 dirhams ( £ 160 ; $ 350 ) and will be deported after serving their sentences .
Their lawyer says the pair will appeal against the verdict .
A spokesman for the judge said Acors and Palmer would be jailed and then deported for the offences of unmarried sex and public indecency .
He added that they had been fined for being drunk in a public place .
" The sentence of three months is usual in these cases .
We get many cases of this kind , " he said .
Acors and Palmer were not at Dubai's Court of First Instance to hear the ruling but had been ordered not to leave the emirate .
' Not happy '
Their defence lawyer Hassan Matter said the pair were upset but not surprised by the verdict .
" They are not guilty but they were prepared for this , " he said .
I 'm not happy ...
It 's normal for a sentence to be six months to a year for an offence such as this
Faisal Abdelmalek Ahli ,
Senior prosecutor
Case is a warning to others
He said he was hopeful the conviction would be overturned .
" I think I have a chance in the appeal court .
I have 15 days to appeal .
I have to find the reason why the judge gave three months . "
Acors and Palmer will remain on bail until their appeal is heard at the court .
Senior prosecutor Faisal Abdelmalek
Ahli said he was disappointed at the length of sentence .
" I 'm not happy , " he said , speaking outside court .
" It 's very light .
It 's normal for a sentence to be six months to a year for an offence such as this . "
Mr Ahli said he expected Acors and Palmer to serve their full three - month term in a Dubai prison .
" Sometimes people serve half their sentence , but this is so short I expect they will serve it all , " he said .
' Kissing and hugging '
The pair were arrested on Jumeirah Beach hours after meeting at a champagne brunch at Dubai 's five - star Le Meridien hotel .
A police officer told the court he had warned the pair about their inappropriate behaviour , but returned later to find them having sex on a sun lounger .
Palmer , who was sacked from her job in Dubai as a publishing executive after her arrest , said in a statement she and Acors had been " just kissing and hugging " .
Mr Matter said witness statements , including one from the police officer , were " wrong " and medical examinations had proved Palmer had not had sex on the beach .
Friends of Palmer say she has been admitted to hospital in recent weeks suffering from anxiety and depression .
The case has turned the spotlight on the lifestyle of the 120,000 British residents of the United Arab Emirates .
The BBC's Christian Fraser , in Dubai , says there have been concerns lately that tourists are ignoring the emirate 's strict Islamic laws and that the outcome of this case will be a warning that such drunken behaviour will not be tolerated in public .
Pauline Crowe , chief executive of UK charity Prisoners Abroad , said the case served as a timely reminder to people to be aware of local customs and laws because ignorance would not be accepted as a defence in court .
She said : " As this case illustrates , what may seem like an innocent act or misdemeanour in the UK can often land people in serious trouble when abroad . "

What are these ?
* * NOTE **
This page was written in 2008 when we were considering switching from darcs to a different version control system .
Much of what it says may be incorrect or out of date .
The current status is that we have no immediate plans to switch from darcs , although we remain open to the possibility of switching in the future .
In an informal show of hands at a meeting at ICFP '10 showed that there was roughly a 50/50 split for and against a switch .
Darcs has made important improvements over the last couple of years addressing some , but not all , of our concerns , so at least from my ( Simon M. ) point of view , switching is not as urgent as it was .
Switching is also difficult for GHC , because we use several repositories ( GHC , packages , haddock , hsc2hs , etc. ) , some of which are upstream and hence we cannot unilaterally switch them from darcs to something else , but nevertheless we would like a GHC developer to only have to use and learn one VC tool .
We would probably have to mirror these respositories in git or whatever , which would complicate our workflow .
Darcs retrospective , and the future
GHC has been using darcs for version control since the beginning of 2006 .
It has not been all plain sailing , so in this page we will record our experiences with darcs , and attempt to objectively evaluate whether we would be better off with a different version control system .
In the event that we do switch , we need to track exactly what needs to change , so this page will also list those dependencies .
Problems we currently experience with darcs
Conflicts and merging .
This is the biggest problem we encounter , and is also the # 1 ( closed ) priority for Darcs development .
Any non-trivial branch is affected , and essentially the workaround is to discard the history from the branch when merging , and use ordinary diff / patch tools .
Keeping history is possible , but impractical for branches with more than a few patches .
Speed .
many operations are impractical ( annotate , darcs changes < file > ) , and many operations just take " too long " ( i.e. long enough that you go and do something else rather than wait for it to finish , which incurs a context - switch cost ) .
We ca n't use Trac 's darcs integration or darcsweb , for example , because both rely on invoking darcs changes < file > ( for that matter , that 's not completely true for the trac darcs plugin as it does not execute that command on a per - file basis , but rather it loads and caches into its own database the result of darcs changes -v on the " not - yet - loaded " changesets , visiting every patch in the repository just once .
It caches also the actual content of each file touched by any browsed changeset , to compute the unidiff . ) .
bugs : we run into darcs bugs other than the conflict / merging bug on a regular basis .
user interface issues : e.g. in a conflict there 's no way to tell which two patches are conflicting with each other ( ! )
Windows support : is quite flaky still .
( well , it 's certainly better than it used to be , and at least some Windows users do n't consider it to be bad ) .
Current status
On the 23rd July 2008 an IRC meeting on the #ghc channel decided to make a serious effort to replace Darcs , due to all the problems described above .
The logs of that meeting are available in full at http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/attachment/wiki/IRC_Meetings/ghc-metting-2008-07-23.log, but the main conclusions were :
The GHC developers have sufficient problems with Darcs that a change would be beneficial
We want to stick with distributed version control , and have a widely - used and well - supported system , so Mercurial and Git and bzr are the only real contenders
Mercurial and Git and percived as being mostly feature - and - performance comparable , although git is more popular
More investigation of the Mercurial option for GHC is needed , especially in light of reported poor support for Windows with Git .
This work is ongoing
See also [ DarcsConversion ] .
Important workflows
Cherry - picking patches
This is how we maintain the stable GHC branch .
Particular fixes are pulled from the HEAD .
When the desired patches do n't depend on undesired patches , darcs takes care of this automatically , as demonstrated below .
Otherwise , with darcs , the patch has to be merged by hand .

Cherry - picking during record
In this example , we want to record just the fixes we have made , and not the debugging prints .
We want something similar for :
reverting just the debugging prints , and not the fixes
reverting the parts of a change you are working on that turned out not to be right
in the middle of doing a large change , discovering a little bug and wanting to fix and record it

So , you make your lovely patch , it all looks good , so you record it .
Then you do a build to make sure it works , and during the build or testsuite run you find that the patch was n't quite right after all .
You could just add a little 2 - line patch , but that is n't very pleasant :
It 's nice if , as far as possible , all intermediate compiler states are buildable .
Also , people might pull the first patch but not the second when cherry - picking , leading to head - scratching down the line .
It 's much nicer to be able to just amend - record the fix into your original patch .
The same is available for Git .
The command is called git commit -- amend .
You usually checkout the commit you want to edit into a branch , do the changes , then rebase the remaining patches on top of this .
Example coming soon ...
I can't find a way to do this directly with Mercurial .
You can of course do hg rollback and then add a new commit .
The Mercurial Queues extension is also able to do this ( hg qrefresh ) but it is rather complicated to use .
It does n't appear to be possible with Bzr either .
You have to do bzr uncommit and then bzr commit , similarly to Mercurial .
File renames
We often want to cherry - pick a change where the file has been renamed on one branch or the other .
This should work without any extra intervention from the user , and does under darcs .
Git does n't handle file renames well .
Here 's a script to demonstrate the problem :
# Demonstrates problem with git 's cherry picking not commuting around # file renmaes .
rm - rf repo1 repo2 mkdir repo1 cd repo1 git init printf " b
d
" > file git - add file git - status git - commit -m " bd " cd .. git clone repo1 repo2 cd repo1 git mv file file1 git commit -m move printf " a
b
d
e
" > file1 git commit -m " abde " file1 printf " a
b
c
d
e
" > file1 git commit -m " abcde " file1 cd ../ repo2 git remote add -f repo1 ../ repo1 git cherry - pick repo1 / master # cherry - picks the most recent change from repo1 # BANG !!!
Apparently git did n't realise that " file " had been renamed to " file1 " in one branch , because its contents had also changed sufficiently .
In fact , if you add enough other stuff to the file so that both versions are similar , then the merge works , which is deeply worrying .
This goes wrong with git version 1.5.2.5 .
I would n't be surprised if other versions work , but the underlying issue is that git does n't store information about file and directory renames , and has to rely on heuristics to recover the information when necessary .
Converting a darcs repo into a git repo is a lossy conversion - it discards information about renames .
Hg does n't seem to deal with it well either :
rm - rf repo1 repo2 mkdir repo1 cd repo1 hg init printf " b
d
" > file hg add file hg status hg commit -m " bd " cd .. hg clone repo1 repo2 cd repo1 hg rename file file1 hg commit -m move printf " a
b
d
e
" > file1 hg commit -m " abde " file1 printf " a
b
c
d
e
" > file1 hg commit -m " abcde " file1 cd ../ repo2 hg transplant -- source ../ repo1 tip # transplant the most recent change from repo1 # BANG !!!
# # searching for changes # applying b613e5e3dc1a # unable to find ' file1 ' for patching # 1 out of 1 hunk FAILED -- saving rejects to file file1.rej # file1 :
No such file or directory # patch failed to apply # abort :
Fix up the merge and run hg transplant -- continue
bzr manages this example without any difficulty :
#!/bin/sh rm - rf repo1 repo2 mkdir repo1 cd repo1 bzr init printf " b
d
" > file bzr add file bzr status bzr commit -m " bd " cd .. bzr checkout repo1 repo2 cd repo1 bzr mv file file1 bzr commit -m move printf " a
b
d
e
" > file1 bzr commit -m " abde " file1 printf " a
b
c
d
e
" > file1 bzr commit -m " abcde " file1 cd ../ repo2 bzr merge -c 4 ../ repo1 # cherry - picks revision 4 from repo1 bzr diff

Git is the clear winner in popularity terms .
Darcs alternatives still in the running
Mercurial
#mercurial : 118 members
Sample repo available at http://darcs.haskell.org/ghc.hg
Advantages :
Speed comparable to Git
Some operations become feasible ( bisect , annotate )
Many helper tools
Good Windows support
HTTP and SSH sync possible , but unknown how this compares to Git native protocol sync speed
Disadvantages :
Similar problems with bisect support as Git
( Unknown : suitability of command set ? )
No rebase , though this is being added as part of the Summer of Code
Need to run a special server to be able to clone over HTTP ( free hosting service is available , will provide free plans for open source projects , supports HTTPS and SSH , http://www.bitbucket.org/)
Some suggestion that you may get performance problems on OS X due to the pervasive use of hardlinks , which HFS + supports poorly ( see http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/jst/archives/2007/02/more_on_distributed_vcs_perfor.html)
Debian stable ( which e.g. darcs.haskell.org runs ) only has v0.9.1 , which does not include the new repository format that makes case - sensitivity fixes
Darcs vs Mercurial Overview
Commands somehow different in behaviour between Hg and Darcs :
darcs whatsnew -> hg diff / hg status darcs record -> hg commit / hg record ( record extension needed to allow cherrypicking ) darcs pull -> hg pull -u / hg pull && hg update ( hg pull does not modify the working copy by default ) ( automatic merging ) -> hg merge && hg commit / hg fetch ( fetch extension does pull / update / merge in one step , like Darcs ) darcs unrecord -> hg rollback ( works for just the most recent record / push , confusingly different from Darcs equivalent command )
Commands that differ essentialy only in name :
darcs rollback -> hg backout -- merge ( records an inverse changeset , go back as far as you like ) darcs changes -> hg log darcs move < FILE > -> hg rename < FILE > darcs send -o < FILE > -> hg bundle < FILE > darcs apply < FILE > -> hg unbundle < FILE >
Commands the same between Hg and Darcs :
darcs push -> hg push darcs add / remove < FILE > -> hg add / remove < FILE > darcs revert -> hg revert darcs tag -> hg tag darcs annotate -> hg annotate
hg addremove adds untracked files and marks missing files as removed .
hg commit - A does a similar thing at commit time
Misc. differences from Darcs :
Do n't have summary / message split : the first line of the message is the summary
Files are not automatically considered removed if you delete them .
You need to run hg remove -- after < FILE > to remove them from the repo as well
To be able to use all the commands in the example above , you should create a .hgrc file in your home directory , looking something like this :
[ extensions ] hgext .
record= transplant= [ ui ] username = My Name < foo@bar.com >
Other issues :
( Note : not nearly as bad as I first thought , this only applies to the use of an extension called win32text :
There appears to be poor support for Windows with the transplant command http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/bts/issue1077)
The transplant command wiki page http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/TransplantExtension contains the text " Three - way merge does n't cope particularly well with transplanted patches - it will tend to generate false conflicts " , which does n't fill me with confidence .
However , we only want to use transplant to maintain a branch ( e.g. 6.8 ) which we wo n't merge back into the one we are pulling from ( e.g. HEAD ) , so this may be a non-issue

Notes On Conversion
Currently using Tailor .
Problems encountered :
Darcs outputs XML without an encoding header .
Patched Tailor to append Latin - 1 encoding to the XML output .
This will be sent to the tailor author
In hg.py , replace the line self .
_hgCommand ( ' tag ' , tag ) with self .
_hgCommand ( ' tag ' , tag , force = True ) because we seem to be trying to apply duplicate tags at some points .
Do n't know quite how this is possible !
with because we seem to be trying to apply duplicate tags at some points .
Do n't know quite how this is possible !
MUST USE the seperate - subdir mode of Tailor because we have some tricky Darcs patches .
I 've added my scripts to http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/Tailor#preview
No support for author remapping in Tailor yet .
I 've added it and I 'm going to submit the patch to the Tailor author
Git
# git : 388 members
Sample repo available at http://darcs.haskell.org/ghc.git
Advantages :
Speed
Very similar workflow possible : git add -- patch , git cherry - pick , and others
, , and others Some operations become feasible ( bisect , annotate )
Many helper tools
Disadvantages :
Complex command set ?
( Though , it should be possible to find replacements for the darcs commands and be happy . )
Lack of good Windows support ?
file and directory renames are not tracked accurately .
Merging uses heuristics to discover file / directory renames , which sometimes goes wrong .
bisect support would require git modules to also pick the correct version of libraries .
Keeping this in sync is not easy , atm .
uses its own protocol for network transmission ( http works but is slower , however , other hosting services are available , e.g. , github )
Darcs / Git Command Comparison
darcs whatsnew -s git status darcs whatsnew git diff darcs record git add -- patch ( goes through all changes ) / git add - i ( starts with a file - based view )
Git add only marks changes for commit .
This can be nicer if you want to check some things first before you commit them .
git commit ( do the actual commit ) darcs record - a -m foo git commit - a -m foo darcs pull git pull then git cherry - pick / gitk + select patches using mouse .
It 's probably best to have one local branch correspond to the remote branch and then cherry - pick from that .
You can also create local names for several remote repositories .
Bzr
# bzr : 143 members
Sample repo available at http://darcs.haskell.org/ghc.bzr
Advantages :
Fairly fast ( but not as fast as Git or Mercurial - see Benchmark below )
Allows checkout without any history
Portable ( as portable as python , anyhow ) , works on Windows
Merging works correctly based on closest - common- ancestor
Tracking of renamed files / directories merges correctly ( better even than Mercurial )
Revisions form a DAG ( more like a tree with merge - points ) rather than patchsets
Supports convenient " centralised - style " commit - remote - by - default as well as " distributed - style " commit - local - by - default .
Just ' bind ' or ' unbind ' your branch whenever you want .
Simple clear UI
Has rebase
Disadvantages
Revisions form a DAG ( more like a tree with merge - points ) rather than patchsets ( this is a subjective point , which is why it 's in both lists .
Which model do you believe in ? )
Cherry - picking is n't very " native " to the data model .
Support for this is very poor .
UI is rather different from darcs ( which current contributors are used to ) .
Benchmarks
These benchmark figures were obtained with a warm disk cache on a clean tree , using OS X 10.5 :
Annotate Log Status Clone Git 0.936s 0.523s 0.030s 0.580s Hg 0.230s 3.772s 0.178s 9.455s Bzr 2.131s 7.278s 0.312s 49.788s Darcs 47.080s * 2.115s 0.053s 28.276
Footnotes :
darcs annotate fails with Stack space overflow : current size 8388608 bytes . , so you do n't get an answer
** darcs get fails with Unapplicable patch due to the case - insensitivity of HFS+ , so you do n't get a clone **
These figures were obtained with a warm disk cache on a clean tree , using a Windows XP Parallels virtual machine running under OS X 10.5 :
Annotate Log Status Clone Git 1.191s 0.681s 0.180s 3.035s Hg 0.420s 2.844s 0.221s 16.383s Bzr 2.954s 7.731s 0.350s 62.190s
The Bzr clone time is high because it does an actual copy rather than just using hard links , by design ( you can use the shared repository feature instead ) .
However , even on the other commands it seems to be about twice as slow as Hg , which is on average somewhat slower than Git .
Note that this is a very limited benchmark : it does n't even test merging / pulling or the cost of cloning over a network .
HTTP Clone ( darcs.haskell.org )
Git 21 m 23.612s Hg 231 m 11.580s Bzr 77 m 11.526s
All of these clone times can be improved by deploying server - side software of some sort or another .
But it 's nice to just be able to set up a repo by exposing a directory , and these are the sort of pull times you can expect from such a deployment .
Eliminated alternatives
Darcs
#darcs : 39 members
Advantages to staying with darcs :
Community consistency : essentially the Haskell community has standardised on darcs , so it would be an extra barrier for contributors if they had to learn another VC system .
Merging , when it works , is done right in darcs .
Disadvantages to staying with darcs :
Uncertain future : no critical mass of hackers / maintainers .
The technical basis is not well enough understood by enough people .
Reason for elimination : persistent performance and algorithmic problems , see above .

John McCain marching as fast as he can aboard convicted felon Raffaello Follieri ’s “ Real America ” yacht
John McCain has been hammering rival Barack Obama for being little more than a vapid “ celebrity ” and “ elitist . ”
But The Nation has obtained a photo revealing just how star - struck a straight - talking maverick can become when offered the chance to celebrate his birthday aboard a yacht filled with celebrities –even if one of those celebrity types turns out to be an A - list con man .
The photograph finally confirms reports that in late August , 2006 , McCain celebrated his 70th birthday aboard a yacht , the Celine Ashley , rented by A - list con man Raffaello Follieri , now serving a five year jail term , and his then - movie star girlfriend Anne Hathaway .
In the current edition ofVanity Fair , Michael Schnayerson reported that Follieri rented the Celine Ashley for the month of August 2006 .
Montenegro ’s leading daily newspaper , Vijesti , earlier reported that during McCain ’s visit in 2006 he celebrated with birthday cocktails and sweets aboard the Celine Ashley yacht .
In the photograph , taken in Montenegro at the end of August , McCain is shown giddily shuffling up the yacht ramp like an old Tim Conway , heading towards the smiling Follieri and Hathaway .
Just ahead of McCain and shaking hands with Follieri appears to be Rick Davis–McCain ’s top aide and now co-manager of his campaign , who accompanied him on the trip and advised the government of Montenegro .
The yacht that McCain partied on was likely paid for with stolen money .
A few months after McCain ’s yacht party , Follieri strengthened his ties to McCain ’s orbit by retaining Rick Davis ’s well - connected Washington lobbying firm , Davis Manafort , and offering Davis both an investment deal and help in securing the Catholic vote for McCain ’s presidential bid .
Closeup of grinning Follieri shaking McCain campaign chairman Rick Davis ’ hand , while Hathaway looks on proudly .
Follieri , who posed as Vatican chief financial officer in order to win friends and investments , pleaded guilty Wednesday in a Manhattan district court to conspiracy to commit wire fraud , eight counts of wire fraud and five counts of money laundering .
As part of the plea , Follieri admitted to misappropriating at least $ 2.4 million of investor money and redirecting it to foreign personal bank accounts that were disguised as business accounts .
At the time he met McCain , Follieri was adept at collecting friends in powerful places and using those connections to attract investments in projects which later turned out to be bogus .
His ties to Bill Clinton and his entourage have been well - documented ; the charismatic Follieri , whom Vanity Fair has likened to an ambitious nineteenth - century protagonist from a Balzac novel , ingratiated himself to President Clinton and aides by posing as a mega - donor to the Clinton Global Initiative .
He also formed an investment partnership with California business mogul and Clinton donor Ron Burkle to develop surplus real estate properties owned by the Catholic Church , which Follieri claimed to represent .
Burkle later sued Follieri for $ 1.3 million in misappropriated funds .
McCain the Maverick , wearing his “ Real People ” baseball - cap disguise , shuffles up the ramp towards the Follieri - Hathaway yacht .
Yet Follieri ’s ties to McCain ’s orbit have been largely overlooked by the media .
Follieri first met McCain when the Arizona Senator visited Montenegro from August 29 - 31 as part of a Congressional delegation that included Republican senators Lindsay Graham , Richard Burr , Saxby Chambliss , Mel Martinez and John Sununu .
[ We ’ll have more on what else McCain was doing in Montenegro in a forthcoming article in the print edition of The Nation . ]
What , exactly , was McCain doing aboard Follieri ’s yacht ?
Or put another way , was this McCain ’s 70th birthday wish–to spend an evening floating on the Adriatic with one of Hollywood ’s top actresses and her smooth - talking Italian beau ?
An even bigger mystery is how Follieri ’s boat came to be docked in Montenegro on McCain ’s birthday .
According to a journalist in Montenegro , the yacht had been anchored there for several days before McCain ’s arrival , and only sailed away after McCain boarded .
According to Vijesti , locals were told that McCain was meeting “ friends from Florida ” on the yacht .
McCain aides later confirmed the encounter with Follieri , but said it was “ entirely social and nothing came of it . ”
Follieri , they told the New York Daily News , was just a “ passing acquaintance . ”
( Though the McCain campaign promise to comment on the encounter , it did not respond to The Nation ’s request by the time this article was published . )
It must not have seemed that way to Follieri .
According to the Italian newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore , in January 2007 Follieri sent Rick Davis a packet of information on his companies Follieri Capital and Follieri Media , apparently hoping to get financing from Pegasus Capital Advisors , a hedge fund in Connecticut that Davis represented .
“ Follieri ’s proposal to Davis had two dimensions to it–first , as an investment opportunity for Davis ’s fund ; but secondly , there was the political dimension , in which Follieri offered to help deliver Catholic votes to McCain , ” said Claudio Gatti , a reporter for Il Sole 24 Ore , who investigated Follieri for eighteen months .
In February 2007 , according to a recent article in the New York Daily News , Follieri retained Davis ’s lobbying firm , Davis Manafort .
According to the paper , “ on Feb. 27 , 2007 , Davis Manafort partner Rick Gates signed a confidentiality agreement drafted by the Follieri Group .
In the contract … Gates agreed not to disclose any information about Follieri ’s deal to get Clinton pal Ron Burkle to buy Catholic Church properties . ”
( Gates did not respond to repeated requests for comment . )
Two months later , Burkle sued Follieri , who later repaid the $ 1.3 million owed to Burkle ’s Yucaipa Funds .
That fall , the Wall Street Journal exposed Follieri ’s life as a high - society con man .
In June of this year , Follieri was finally arrested and charged .
Following his guilty plea this week , Follieri now faces up to five years and three months in jail .
This article first appeared in The Nation online .
Now that John McCain has bet his shot at the White House on blocking the Hanke - Panke Plan , we might as well step back and ask if there 's a better way .
Answer ?
Yes , there is .
The current Hanke - Panke plan is a lot better than the original one , primarily because the government will get equity in the companies it saves ( and will therefore benefit when the banks snooker the government into overpaying for crap assets ) .
But it still falls short .
It also wo n't likely be as effective as two better options .
Martin Wolf at the FT ( above ) has created an economist forum in which a bunch of luminaries are weighing in on how to do this right .
Wolf observes that the Paulson plan is just a band - aid -- treating a surface symptom instead of the root cause of the problem : our country 's huge debt load .
Wolf also runs through the best solutions proposed by his panel .
The goal of these proposals is the right one : recapitalize banks while having existing shareholders and bondholders take the hit .
This puts the pain where it belongs -- in the hands of investors who made ( bad ) free - market decisions .
And it also puts the banks in a position to lend normally again ( which the Hanke - Panke Plan wo n't , unless the government overpays for the trash ) .
Three solutions :
Force banks to write down assets to market value , stop paying dividends , and raise new equity .
We 've basically tried this , and except for the top firms , it has n't worked : Because no investors are dumb enough to invest .
Force banks to write down assets and then recapitalize them by converting debt to equity .
This hits both bondholders and shareholders , and it costs the taxpayer nothing .
It will also likely be so unpopular with Wall Street -- and , more importantly , investors -- that it would be politically untenable .
Force banks to write down assets and have the government take equity stakes via preferred stock .
This is the way Buffett invested in Goldman ( he was comfortable with the carrying value of its assets ) .
It 's the way the Sweden did it .
It 's also the way any responsible private market investor would invest .
All of these solutions force the banks to deal with their own problems -- instead of forcing the government to hire managers to look after the crap - asset funds .
They also force those who made the dumb bets to take the hit .
Unfortunately , neither yet appears to be under consideration on Capitol Hill .

WASHINGTON ( AP ) — Consumer prices shot up in July at twice the expected rate , pushed higher by surging energy and food costs .
The latest surge left inflation running at the fastest pace in 17 years .
The Labor Department reported Thursday that consumer prices rose by 0.8 percent last month , twice the 0.4 percent gain that economists had been expecting .
It marked the third straight month of oversized inflation increases following jumps of 0.6 percent in May and 1.1 percent in June and left inflation rising by 5.6 percent over the past year , the biggest 12 - month gain since January 1991 .
That inflation surge presents a major problem for the Federal Reserve , which could be forced to start raising interest rates even as the economy struggles to avoid a recession .
The big rise in inflation left consumers even more squeezed .
The Labor Department said that average weekly earnings , after adjusting for inflation , fell by 3.1 percent in July compared to a year ago , the biggest year - over - year decline since November 1990 .

At the San Diego Armed Services YMCA , social workers who counsel military families can barely keep up with the requests that come pouring in .
About two years ago , each social worker dealt with about 16 cases at any given time , said Amanda Cross , senior program director of family outreach .
Now , each of five social workers carries a caseload of 23 .
“ As of last year , we now have a wait list , and we ’ve never had that before in over 20 years of operation , ” Cross said .
With agencies such as Cross ’ in mind , USC is launching a new program to train therapists who understand the difficulties of military families .
Starting next fall , the School of Social Work will offer a military specialization within the two - year master ’s program in social work .

“ There ’s been a lot of problems with post - traumatic stress disorder and other kinds of problems returning service members have , and , at the same time , there is a very limited supply of people educated and prepared to deal with these problems , ” said Marilyn Flynn , the school ’s dean .
The Army recently contracted with Fayetteville State University in North Carolina to create a social work master ’s program at Ft. Sam Houston in Texas , but the USC program is the first military track based at a university , USC officials said .
“ On average , mental health practitioners are 20 years behind clinical trials , so it is important to do this at a research institution , ” she said .
Flynn came up with the idea about two years ago as she read about the growing mental health problems among returning veterans .

Roughly 30 % of service members coming back from Iraq are expected to seek mental health care , and the suicide rate in the Army has grown to its highest rate since record - keeping began , USC officials said .
It is clear that the men and women returning from war -- and their families -- require care that reaches beyond what is normally taught in social work school , said Jose Coll , a social worker and former reconnaissance Marine who is chairing USC ’s program .
“ What we hear all the time is , ‘ They did n’t understand me , ’ ” he said .
Repeated deployments can shake up families in ways that civilian social workers have never studied , he said .
Also , clients use military acronyms that bewilder civilians .

If a therapist does n’t understand the jargon , “ it becomes much harder to build a relationship between the client and the therapist , ” Coll said .
“ Many times , the client never comes back . ”
The USC program will inject military - related material into traditional social work classes , such as talking about self - image and the loss of a limb in a class on loss , grief and bereavement .
But the program also plans to add brand - new classes that deal with PTSD and or explain military hierarchy .
Students will also do 600 - hour internships at places such as the drop - in veterans centers or the jail at Camp Pendleton .
The program also plans to take advantage of the cutting - edge research at other parts of the university , such as the “ virtual humans ” developed at the Institute for Creative Technologies for training exercises .

Instead of relying on traditional role - playing exercises with other students , military social work students will be able to put on a headset and practice with “ Sgt. Justina . ”
Justina , a somber , fidgety , brown - haired girl , was developed to respond like a civilian teenager who has been sexually assaulted , said Albert “ Skip ” Rizzo , a clinical psychologist who is a research scientist at the institute .
Scientists at the institute are planning to dress Justina in military fatigues and adapt her to display a variety of military - related mental health problems .
“ We ’re going to target sexual assaults , PTSD and depression , ” Rizzo said .
Eventually , researchers hope to create a library of 50 to 100 characters for the social workers .

Cross , the YMCA official , said she can’t wait for USC to produce graduates who can jump right into the agency ’s heavy caseload .
“ We used to do a lot of on - the - spot crisis intervention , where they were out of food or they had parenting issues , ” Cross said .
“ Now we ’re seeing a lot of families dealing with anxiety , depression .
There ’s an increase of the actual clinical acuity of cases .
. . .
We have to look for more skilled clinicians . ”

The Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) announced plans to introduce new regulations that would make it more difficult for women to get access to common birth control .
The changes are made to protect antiabortion healthcare workers from providing services that contradict their personal beliefs .
The controversial regulation was considered too broad to redefine abortion in terms of including commonly - used birth control pills , Plan B emergency contraception and other FDA - approved methods of contraception .
Pharmacists , doctors , nurses and other healthcare workers will be allowed to withhold the information about such common methods of contraception without referring patients to elsewhere .
The radical rule is widely criticized by women 's health advocates , family planning advocates and abortion rights activists who consider such regulation to impede family planning and scientific research .
According to government 's definition an abortion is anything that interferes with a fertilized egg after conception .
The regulations can limit all women 's access to information and services related to contraception especially for low - income women .
Federal health officials announced the rule to cancel funding to more than 584,000 hospitals , clinics , health plans and others that do not accommodate workers , refusing to provide services that go against their personal , moral or religious beliefs .
The proposed regulation which could be implemented after a 30 - day comment period will require more than $ 44 million and is said to enforce federal laws protecting health care providers from performing abortions and providing other services objectionable to their values .

Reports have emerged indicating that Motorola is hiring developers with Java and Android expertise in preparation for launching a major mobile initiative on top of Google 's software platform .
This move reflects a new stage n the expansion of Motorola 's mobile software strategy , which increasingly emphasizes the open source Linux operating system .
Motorola was one of the first major handset makers to embrace the Linux platform .
Its earliest Linux - based phones were popular in China , enabling the company to sell over 5 million of the penguin - powered devices by 2006 .
Following that initial victory , Motorola brought its Linux phones to the US with its global launch of the Razr2 in 2007 .
Motorola 's current Linux lineup features eight LiMo- compatible handsets and the company boasts that its total sales of Linux - based phones has exceeded 14 million as of this year .
Motorola VP of software Christy Wyatt talked about the company 's commitment to Linux last month during a keynote presentation at the Open Source in Mobile conference in Berlin .
She says that Motorola is betting big on Linux because the open platform reduces costs and provides a very high level of flexibility .
The rapid pace at which the smartphone market is evolving has forced Motorola and its competitors to look for technologies that can shorten their development cycles .
Wyatt says that Linux facilitates that kind of agile development and can help device makers stay ahead of the curve .
Motorola has been attempting to cultivate a third - party developer ecosystem around its LiMo - compatible MOTOMAGX platform , which was first unveiled last year .
The handset maker 's recently - launched MOTODEV SDK is very promising , but still has a long way to go , according to some early reviews by open source enthusiasts who have experience with other Linux mobile platforms .
Diversity or sharpened focus ?
The revelation that Motorola is investing in Android development has gotten a lot of attention in the past week from pundits and industry analysts .
Some are wondering if Motorola will leave LiMo behind as it embraces Google 's Android platform .
That is certainly a possibility , but I think that the question itself extends from a misconception .
Contrary to what many seem to assume , each handset maker and mobile carrier is n't necessarily going to choose only one Linux - based mobile platform .
Android and MOTOMAGX are very different kinds of platforms — they are n't redundant — and it 's entirely conceivable that Motorola will want to use Android on one kind of device and MOTOMAGX on another .
For instance , Motorola 's current MOTOMAGX phones strongly focus on multimedia capabilities and do n't really compete with the conventional business smartphone market , so it would make sense for the company to continue using MOTOMAGX in that context while adopting Android for new high - end smartphones with touch screens and keyboards .
A glance across all of Motorola 's product lines reveals that it already exhibits a very high degree of platform diversity .
Practically every major mobile platform , including Windows Mobile on the Moto Q devices , is represented somewhere in Motorola 's product landscape .
With that in mind , it seems only natural that Motorola would adopt more than one Linux platform , as the company increases its commitment to Linux .
Looking at Motorola 's affiliations practically confirms that view .
Motorola is a founding member of all three major open - platform initiatives : the LiMo Foundation , the Open Handset Alliance , and the Symbian Foundation .
Motorola will likely use all three platforms to help meet consumer demand for different kind of devices and mobile experiences in different markets and regions .
During the OSiM keynote , Wyatt forcefully argued for the importance of diversity in the mobile software industry .
Motorola does n't want to see the emergence of a single dominant mobile software vendor .
The challenge , however , is balancing the need for diversity against the cost of fragmentation .
To enable development of software applications that can span across a multitude of platforms , she sees web technologies as a potential solution .
Motorola has already taken the first steps in that direction with WebUI , an application runtime for MOTOMAGX devices that is built on top of WebKit and allows application developers to product programs with HTML , JavaScript , and CSS .
It exposes a lot of handset functionality up through the JavaScript layer , including APIs for location , multimedia , and phonebook technologies .
Motorola is clearly expanding its commitment to Linux and appears to be pursuing a strategy around multiple Linux - based platforms .
Motorola has n't enjoyed a major breakout success with any single product in the handset market since the original RAZR , and the company has been struggling to regain some of its former glory .
Producing a diverse range of handsets and experimenting with different platforms could help Motorola find another combination that works .

Seriously .
Can we please have McCain ’s medical records released to the public , because his erratic behavior is now a daily occurrence .
McCain just yesterday – YESTERDAY – said that he was fine with Gwen Ifill moderating .
Now today he is n’t .
And what ’s more , McCain has created a mythical villain who apparently chose Ifill for him .
“ Frankly , I wish they had picked a moderator that is n’t writing a book favorable to Barack Obama — let ’s face it , ” McCain said this morning .
“ They ” ?
I know for the presidential debate , McCain approved the moderators in advance .
He ’s saying that did n’t happen for the VP debate ?
Well , in fact , I ’ve just heard from a source I trust that McCain DID have the chance to object to Ifill back in August , and he did n’t .
So when John McCain says “ they ” he means “ himself . ”
Need more proof that something is n’t quite right with McCain ?
The silicon sample is shown in the resonator used in the experiment .
The team created a system that used both the electron and nucleus of a phosphorous atom embedded in a silicon crystal .
Both the electron and nucleus behaved as tiny quantum magnets capable of storing quantum information .
This allows information to stay intact for over a second , an important threshold in the development of quantum computing .

An international team of scientists has performed the ultimate miniaturisation of computer memory : storing information inside the nucleus of an atom .
This breakthrough is a key step in bringing to life a quantum computer - a device based on the fundamental theory of quantum mechanics which could crack problems unsolvable by current technology .
In the quantum world , objects such as atoms are allowed to exist in multiple states simultane - ously -- that is , they could literally be in two places at once or possess a number of other seemingly mutually exclusive properties .
Quantum computing is seen as the holy grail of computing because each individual piece of information , or ‘ bit ’ , can have more than one value at once , as opposed to current technology which is limited to either 1s or 0s .
This yields unprecedented processing power and thus dramatically widens the scope of what computers can do .
The problem :
How do you isolate a quantum bit from a noisy environment to protect the deli-cate quantum information , while at the same time allowing it to interact with the outside world so that it can be manipulated and measured ?
The team , with scientists and engineers from Oxford and Princeton universities and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , reported a solution to this problem in the Oct. 23 issue of the journal Nature .
The team ’s plan was to devise a hybrid system using both the electron and nucleus of an atom of phosphorous embedded in a silicon crystal .
Each behaves as a tiny quantum magnet capa - ble of storing quantum information , but inside the crystal the electron is more than a million times bigger than the nucleus , with a magnetic field that is a thousand times stronger .
This makes the electron well - suited for manipulation and measurement , but not so good for storing information , which can become rapidly corrupted .
This is where the nucleus comes in : when the information in the electron is ready for storage , it is moved into the nucleus where it can survive for much longer times .
The experiments were made possible by the use of silicon enriched with the single 28 Si iso - tope , painstakingly grown by the Berkeley team into large crystals while keeping the material ultra-pure and free from contaminants .
“ The electron acts as a middle - man between the nucleus and the outside world .
It gives us a way to have our cake and eat it - fast processing speeds from the electron , and long memory times from the nucleus , ” said John Morton , a research fellow at St. John ’s College , Oxford and lead author of the Letter to Nature .
Crucially , the information stored in the nucleus had a lifetime of about 1 and 3/4 seconds , ex-ceeding a recently calculated target for quantum computing in silicon beyond which known error correction techniques could then protect the data for an arbitrarily long period of time .
Without this technique the longest researchers had been able to preserve quantum information in silicon was a few tens of milliseconds .
“ Nobody really knew how long a nucleus might hold quantum information in this system .
With the crystals from Lawrence Berkeley and very careful measurements we were delighted to see memory times exceeding the threshold , ” said Steve Lyon , leader of the Princeton team .
Many different approaches to building a quantum computer are being studied , however one great advantage of the model used here is that it is based on silicon technology , which makes it more compatible with today ’s computers .

OpenDNS is awesome for this purpose ... one thing not mentioned here is it has some halfway decent reporting capabilities too , so you can not only confirm that your kids are being blocked but what they 're being blocked from .
That info gives you a great segue into what should be an open discussion .
I recommend OpenDNS to pretty much everyone , kids or no , as part of installing a secure computer .
As others have alluded to , you can't stop kids from eventually getting where they think they want to go - IMHO your best bet is to be as aware as possible of what they are doing ( and trying to do ) so that you can help them in making sense of what they will be exposed to .
The reporting features of OpenDNS , combined with tracking Google search history is a great way of staying informed .

If pre-convention polls are to be believed , John McCain enters the convention poised to pull in a greater percentage of the Jewish vote than any Republican candidate in the past two decades .
There are many possible explanations — his long record on Israel , his image as an independent political moderate , lingering concerns about Barack Obama — but one factor is certainly the ties that his campaign has cultivated with important Jewish Republicans and moderates alike .
The Forward takes a look at the Republicans who have helped McCain make it to the spotlight in Minneapolis , and who hope to take him beyond .
Mark Broxmeyer
The Israel Hawk
As Mark Broxmeyer roams through the convention , his face may not be well known , but Jewish Republicans bigwigs will recognize his voice .
Not only has Broxmeyer been one of the McCain campaign ’s leading Jewish fundraisers , but he also has been , to this point , the closest thing to a Jewish liaison , which means that he has been the one on weekly phone calls to local leaders , trying to organize events , keep people updated and encourage high spirits .
It ’s a new role for Broxmeyer .
The real estate developer from New York ’s Long Island originally went into politics to protect his real estate interests and mostly stuck to the local level , though he has helped fundraise for Republican candidates both successful ( George W. Bush ) and not ( Steve Forbes ) .
In Washington circles , Broxmeyer has been better known as the national chairman of the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs , a hawkish Israel advocacy group that focuses on American national security and American - Israeli ties .
In fact , Jinsa has numerous ties to the McCain campaign : National Jewish outreach co-chair Fred Zeidman is a board member , and fellow co-chair Eric Cantor is on Jinsa ’s board of advisers .
McCain was also honored with an award by Jinsa in 2006 , with Joe Lieberman as the night ’s warm - up act .
Jinsa was founded in 1976 by Jewish communal leaders who wanted to forge stronger connections with the defense establishment , and it evolved into a center for neoconservative thinkers , including several linked to the current administration , such as Richard Perle , who serves on Jinsa ’s board of advisers .
Broxmeyer emphasized that his work with Jinsa is separate from his role with the campaign .
But he did say that he signed on with McCain out of a sense that the candidate shares his priorities .
“ To me , he ’s an American hero , ” Broxmeyer told the Forward .
“ He ’s always been likeminded on national security , which is where I ’m coming from . ”
Joe Lieberman
The Democratic Apostate
What can one say about Joe Lieberman that has n’t already been said ?
Eight years ago , he was a Jewish hero — the first Jew on a major party presidential ticket and , like most American Jews , a solid Democrat .
But in Minneapolis , Lieberman will have a prime time slot on opening night at the Republican convention , a reward he ’s earned through months of stumping for John McCain .
There may be , in fact , nobody more responsible for McCain ’s impending nomination than Lieberman .
It was Lieberman ’s surprise endorsement of McCain last December , along with a slew of support from New England newspapers , that jump - started McCain ’s moribund campaign and helped vault him to victory in the New Hampshire primary .
Since he endorsed McCain in December , Lieberman has also become the campaign ’s leading surrogate to the Jewish community .
That role has had its own perils : Lieberman is now , according to a recent poll , far less popular among American Jews than Barack Obama , though the accuracy of the poll is challenged by Lieberman aides .
Lieberman has never been a conventional Democrat .
He was first elected to the Senate in 1988 by running to the right of incumbent Republican Lowell Weicker .
Only two years into his first term , The New York Times wrote of him , “ He votes Democratic , sounds Republican and puts a plague on both political houses . ”
He supported not only the second Iraq War under President Bush , but also the first Iraq War under the first president Bush , which was initially even more unpopular with Democrats .
Kenneth Wald , a professor of political science at the University of Florida and the director of the university ’s Center for Jewish Studies , said that the mantle Lieberman wore in 2000 , as a Jewish political hero , never quite fit him .
“ He became one of those symbols that people read into it whatever they like , a bit like Obama this year , ” Wald said .
“ But they , in a sense , looked past whatever information there was about him being more conservative than the rest of the community . ”
Lieberman ’s friendship with McCain was also nothing new .
The two men have served in the Senate for 20 years and have been traveling together to the Munich Conference on Security Policy for the past 10 years .
They started co-sponsoring climate change legislation in 2002 , and in 2007 , their bill , since rewritten , gained a new co-sponsor : Senator Barack Obama .
Aides close to McCain and Lieberman say that the two have a personal friendship .
They ’ve even shared the same spokesman , Marshall Wittmann .
Marshall Wittmann
Maverick Wordsmith
Joe Lieberman may be in unfamiliar territory at the Republican Convention , but for his press secretary , Marshall Wittmann , the unfamiliar is where he is most at home .
Wittmann has made a career out of predictably unpredictable lurches across the political spectrum in Washington .
A former self - confessed Trotskyite , radical Zionist and labor organizer , Wittmann served in the elder George Bush ’s administration , then went to work in the mid-1990s for the Christian Coalition of America , despite being Jewish .
His family , Wittmann has reported , was not pleased .
He has worked in think tanks on both sides of the aisle :
He became a spokesman for John McCain in 2002 , then quit in 2004 to endorse John Kerry and work for the center - left Democratic Leadership Council .
After Lieberman won his Senate race as an independent in 2006 , Wittmann signed on to be Lieberman ’s press secretary — a move that shook Congressional Democrats wary of a potential mole in their caucus .
Wittmann , who was previously one of Washington ’s most quoted pundits , declined to comment for this story , but he must be particularly pleased that two of his political heroes , McCain and Lieberman , have come together for the latest presidential run .
Wittmann has served as a spokesman for both , and it is a sign of his affection for both that Wittmann has made the ultimate sacrifice for them in taking the job :
He stopped being quoted by name .
One can only wonder what he would have said about his bosses ’ most unlikely pairing .
Fred Zeidman
The Ex-Bush Backer
Amid the speeches , the cocktail hours and the dinner meetings at the Republican convention in Minneapolis , Fred Zeidman , national co-chair of Jewish outreach for the McCain campaign , will be searching out other Jewish Republicans with a message : that they are not alone .
“ One of things we really try and do at conventions is find Jews that have not been affiliated before , to let them know that not only can we get a minyan now , but there ’s a lot of us out there , and that they ’re not in hostile territory being Republican Jews , ” Zeidman told the Forward .
Zeidman has already been through some fairly lonely times in this campaign .
When he endorsed John McCain in January 2007 , it was taken as yet another sign that McCain was trying to position himself as the inevitable Republican nominee .
Zeidman was exactly the sort of prominent party fundraiser McCain needed , and an establishment figure in Republican Jewish politics .
“ Fred ’s top - tier in Republican Jewish circles , ” said Jeff Ballabon , a Republican consultant who worked with Zeidman on Jewish outreach for George W. Bush ’s 2004 campaign .
But by mid-2007 , the McCain campaign ran out of money and had to fire much of its staff — including Zeidman ’s son , Jay , who had been hired in late 2006 .
Despite this , the elder Zeidman says his loyalty never wavered .
“ In Texas — it ’s not a famous Yiddish saying — they teach you to dance with the one that brung you , ” Zeidman said .
“ I had made a decision that John McCain was the one I was going to back , and until John McCain dropped out of the race , I would continue to back him . ”
Zeidman has not always been so staunch a McCain backer .
In the 2000 Republican primaries , he backed George W. Bush over McCain .
Zeidman , who grew up in a small Texas town , met Bush in the early 1970s when both were young and single in Houston .
Zeidman backed Bush in his first run for governor of Texas and in every race since .
But Zeidman says that McCain impressed him so much during the 2000 campaign that he made it his business to know McCain and to eventually become a supporter .
Eric Cantor
The Rising Star ?
Eric Cantor is , by all accounts , a staunch Republican , but he also has landed a starring role in the Democratic convention city of Denver .
Cantor , the only Jewish Republican in the House , has spent the week of the Democratic convention in Denver taking shots at the Democrats on behalf of McCain — the sign of a trusted accomplice .
In a curious twist , though , Cantor was not named one of the speakers at the Republican convention in Minneapolis .
In lieu of hard information at press time , this likely means one of two things —
Cantor is either being snubbed or promoted .
Cantor , 45 , is frequently cited as a rising young star in the Republican Party leadership , and he has played a particularly prominent role in this year ’s campaign .
His name has popped up time and again in the interminable speculation over who will be McCain ’s vice president , fueled by news reports that the McCain campaign requested papers from Cantor for vetting .
If Cantor is named to the second spot on the ticket , his speaking role at the convention will be determined later .
More concretely , Cantor was named a co-chair of national Jewish outreach for the campaign and has been one of McCain ’s prominent surrogates .
It ’s the highest profile that Cantor has had in national politics , and many took it as a sign that his time had finally come .
Never mind " The Daily Show " and " The Colbert Report , " the most welcome Comedy Central program this election season just might be " South Park . "
The series has been on a roll for the past four / five seasons , and whether turning an alien invasion into an examination of immigration , or leprechauns into targets of terrorism , " South Park " has been presenting relatively reasoned examinations of cultural issues .
Until , perhaps , last night .
" South Park " has missed out on skewering this summer 's pop-culture events , and last night , the episode was on the attack .
As dark and twisted as " The Dark Knight " was , " South Park " was just as aggressively over the top .
Returning with new episodes as part of its 12th season , " South Park " did n't level its aim at presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain ( fingers are crossed for such an episode to be forthcoming ) .
Instead , the series had Hollywood heavyweights George Lucas and Steven Spielberg directly in sights .
Oh , there was also a paranoid Cartman convinced that China 's Olympic opening ceremony telegraphed an attack on the United States , but Cartman 's mockery of Chinese stereotypes was almost an afterthought after Matt Stone and Trey Parker completely dismantled the worldwide hit " Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull . "
" We all saw it happen , " says the handicapped Jimmy , discussing " The Crystal Skull " as if it 's a personal tragedy .
" Do you remember that scene with Indiana in the refrigerator ?
It did n't make any sense , Stan . "
From there , an excited Stan sits down to watch the latest film in a dream sequence / nightmare , but soon has to warn Indiana Jones that Spielberg and Lucas are nearby .
And then in a series of film parodies , Indy 's pants come off .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Barack Obama is leading his Republican rival John McCain 53 percent to 43 percent among likely voters , according to a Washington Post - ABC News opinion poll released on Monday .
Sixty - four percent of voters now view Obama favorably , up six percentage points from early September , according to the poll taken after Tuesday night ’s presidential debate .
Nearly a third of voters have a better opinion of the Illinois senator because of his debate performance while eight percent have a lower opinion of him , the poll found .
Twelve percent of voters have a higher opinion of Arizona Sen .
McCain after the debate , while 26 percent said they had a worse opinion of him .
The final debate on Wednesday at Hofstra University in Hempstead , New York , will be the last of three face - offs between the two candidates before the Nov. 4 election .
According to the poll , 52 percent of voters now strongly favor McCain , down seven percentage points from early September .
More than half of respondents , 59 percent said the Arizona senator has been mainly attacking his opponent rather than addressing the issues , up from 48 percent who said the same thing in August , the Post reported .
Sixty - eight percent of respondents said Obama has been mainly addressing the issues .
On taxes , an issue McCain has been aggressively highlighting , Obama has gained a significant lead over his opponent .
According to the poll , Obama now leads McCain 52 percent to 41 percent on the question of who is trusted to handle taxes .
In late September , the candidates were near even on that question with Obama ahead of McCain by two percentage points , 48 percent to 46 percent .
The poll of 1,101 adults , including 945 registered votes , was taking Wednesday though Saturday .
The margin of error is plus or minus three percentage points for the full sample and three - point - five percentage points for the sample of 766 likely voters .
What does is it say about John McCain 's choice of Sarah Palin when David freaking Brooks of all people is saying this kind of stuff about her ?
Wow .
[ Sarah Palin ] represents a fatal cancer to the Republican party .
When I first started in journalism , I worked at the National Review for Bill Buckley .
And Buckley famously said he'd rather be ruled by the first 2,000 names in the Boston phone book than by the Harvard faculty .
But he did n't think those were the only two options .
He thought it was important to have people on the conservative side who celebrated ideas , who celebrated learning .
And his whole life was based on that , and that was also true for a lot of the other conservatives in the Reagan era .
Reagan had an immense faith in the power of ideas .
But there has been a counter , more populist tradition , which is not only to scorn liberal ideas but to scorn ideas entirely .
And I 'm afraid that Sarah Palin has those prejudices .
I think President Bush has those prejudices .

Some viewers and interviewees have a hard time telling which Stephen Colbert they are witnessing , a fair confusion given that the man has two Wikipedia entries .
There 's the mild - mannered gentleman actor from South Carolina .
And then there 's the unrepentant loudmouth of The Colbert Report , who harasses politicians like Barney Frank and Bob Kerrey into holding grudges .
" I was taught to be nice , so it 's not in my nature to be a jerk , " Colbert explained over the weekend at The New Yorker Festival .
" But
I do enjoy it . "
You can tell the fake newsman has fun berating alternative journos like Amy Goodman and Naomi Klein during his Comedy Central show , even though he 's informed his audience beforehand that the character he 's playing is a stone - cold idiot .
He seems to have as much fun convincing right - wingers like Bill O'Reilly and Lou Dobbs that he might agree with them , even though the opposite is probably true .
This philosophical flux is what has made Colbert a cultural phenomenon .
In an era where defining the opposition is key to dismantling its energy and support , his ability to slip in and out of the artistic and political traps set for him is the key to his success .
He says he divulges this reality about his alter ego every night , right before his hyper - real show gets rolling .
" I tell people , ' He 's an idiot , ' " Colbert told fans at the festival , where attendees gathered last weekend to hear chats with luminaries like Guillermo del Toro , Junot Diaz , Clint Eastwood , Oliver Stone and Tom Morello .
" I say , ' Disabuse me of my ignorance . ' "

McCAIN vs. THE BASE , PART 487… .
National Journal sets the stage for today ’s Senate vote on a bill banning the CIA from using torture :
Supporters will need 60 votes to advance the bill , meaning they will need some Republicans to cross party lines .
[ Harry ] Reid said Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz. , could be a major swing vote , given his previous support for legislation against torture .
But a spokeswoman for McCain , a Republican presidential candidate who has been trying to bolster support from party conservatives , did not return telephone calls and an e-mail late Tuesday seeking comment .
And why was the famously anti-torture and press - friendly senator avoiding phone calls last night ?
Because he ended up voting against the bill .
But hey — who can blame him ?
It ’s one thing to be against torture in a primary debate where you ’re trying to appeal to independents and crossover voters , but it ’s quite another thing to be against torture after you ’ve won the nomination and need to appease a conservative base that ’s righteously pissed off and not afraid to let you know it .
A base that Joe Klein watched in action last November when McCain told Mitt Romney , “ We ’re not going to torture people .
We ’re not going to do what Pol Pot did .
We ’re not going to do what ’s being done to Burmese monks as we speak ” :
I attended Frank Luntz ’s dial group of 30 undecided — or sort of undecided — Republicans in St. Petersburg , Florida , last night … and it was a fairly astonishing evening .
Now , for the uninitiated : dials are little hand - held machines that enable a focus group member to register instantaneous approval or disapproval as the watch a candidate on TV . …. When John McCain started talking about torture — specifically , about waterboarding — the dials plummeted again ….
Down to the low 20s , which , given the natural averaging of a focus group , is about as low as you can go .
Afterwards , Luntz asked the group why they seemed to be in favor of torture .
“ I do n’t have any problem pouring water on the face of a man who killed 3000 Americans on 9/11 , ” said John Shevlin , a retired federal law enforcement officer .
The group applauded , appallingly .
These are the voters McCain needs now , and these voters do n’t want a president who opposes state sanctioned torture of captive prisoners .
So McCain does n’t oppose it anymore .
Any questions ?
Researchers in Canada report discovery of unusual proteins in a small group of Kenyan sex workers that appear to be associated with resistance to infection with HIV , the virus that causes AIDS .
The discovery could lead to the improved design of vaccines and drugs to fight the deadly virus , which infects an estimated 40 million people worldwide , the scientists say in a new report .
In the new study , Adam Burgener and colleagues note that 140 of more than 2000 sex workers studied in Nairobi , Kenya , appear resistant to HIV infection .
Although evidence suggests that certain biological factors in their vaginal fluid may play a role in resistance , the exact identity of these substances was unclear .
The scientists used a high - tech analytical method to compare differences among proteins in vaginal fluids from HIV - resistant women and those infected with the virus or susceptible to it .
HIV - resistant women had proteins significantly different from other women .
Vaginal fluids of the HIV - resistant women had higher levels of proteins with anti-viral and anti-inflammatory actions .
These proteins could be used as the basis for new medications to prevent infection , the scientists suggest .
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - On Main Street , insurance protects people from the effects of catastrophes .
Traders react in the S&P 500 pit at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange , September 15 , 2008 .
REUTERS / John Gress
But on Wall Street , specialized insurance known as a credit default swaps are turning a bad situation into a catastrophe .
When historians write about the current crisis , much of the blame will go to the slump in the housing and mortgage markets , which triggered the losses , layoffs and liquidations sweeping the financial industry .
But credit default swaps -- complex derivatives originally designed to protect banks from deadbeat borrowers -- are adding to the turmoil .
“ This was supposedly a way to hedge risk , ” says Ellen Brown , the author of the book “ Web of Debt . ”
“ I ’m sure their predictive models were right as far as the risk of the things they were insuring against .
But what they did n’t factor in was the risk that the sellers of this protection would n’t pay ...
That ’s what we ’re seeing now . ”
Brown is hardly alone in her criticism of the derivatives .
Five years ago , billionaire investor Warren Buffett called them a " time bomb " and " financial weapons of mass destruction " and directed the insurance arm of his Berkshire Hathaway Inc BRKa .
N to exit the business .
LINKED TO MORTGAGES
Recent events suggest Buffett was right .
The collapse of Bear Stearns .
The fire sale of Merrill Lynch & Co Inc MER.N.
The meltdown at American International Group Inc AIG.N.
In each case , credit default swaps played a role in the fall of these financial giants .
The latest victim is insurer AIG , which received an emergency $ 85 billion loan from the U.S. Federal Reserve late on Tuesday to stave off a bankruptcy .
Over the last three quarters , AIG suffered $ 18 billion of losses tied to guarantees it wrote on mortgage - linked derivatives .
Its struggles intensified in recent weeks as losses in its own investments led to cuts in its credit ratings .
Those cuts triggered clauses in the policies AIG had written that forced it to put up billions of dollars in extra collateral -- billions it did not have and could not raise .
EASY MONEY
When the credit default market began back in the mid-1990s , the transactions were simpler , more transparent affairs .
Not all the sellers were insurance companies like AIG -- most were not .
But the protection buyer usually knew the protection seller .
As it grew -- according to the industry ’s trade group , the credit default market grew to $ 46 trillion by the first half of 2007 from $ 631 billion in 2000 -- all that changed .
An over - the - counter market grew up and some of the most active players became asset managers , including hedge fund managers , who bought and sold the policies like any other investment .
And in those deals , they sold protection as often as they bought it -- although they rarely set aside the reserves they would need if the obligation ever had to be paid .
In one notorious case , a small hedge fund agreed to insure UBS AG UBSN .VX , the Swiss banking giant , from losses related to defaults on $ 1.3 billion of subprime mortgages for an annual premium of about $ 2 million .
The trouble was , the hedge fund set up a subsidiary to stand behind the guarantee -- and capitalized it with just $ 4.6 million .
As long as the loans performed , the fund made a killing , raking in an annualized return of nearly 44 percent .
But in the summer of 2007 , as home owners began to default , things got ugly .
UBS demanded the hedge fund put up additional collateral .
The fund balked .
UBS sued .
The dispute is hardly unique .
Both Wachovia Corp WB.N and Citigroup Inc C.N are involved in similar litigation with firms that promised to step up and act like insurers -- but were not actually insurers .
“ Insurance companies have armies of actuaries and deep pools of policyholders and the financial wherewithal to pay claims , ” says Mike Barry , a spokesman at the Insurance Information Institute .
“ SLOPPY ”
Another problem :
As hedge funds and others bought and sold these protection policies , they did not always get prior written consent from the people they were supposed to be insuring .
Patrick Parkinson , the deputy director of the Fed ’s research and statistic arm , calls the practice “ sloppy . ”
As a result , some protection buyers had trouble figuring out who was standing behind the insurance they bought .
And it put investors into webs of relationships they did not understand .
“ This is the derivative nightmare that everyone has been warning about , ” says Peter Schiff , the president of Euro Pacific Capital at the author of “ Crash Proof : How to Profit From the Coming Economic Collapse . ”
“ They booked all these derivatives assuming bad things would never happen .
It was like writing fire insurance , assuming no one is ever going to have a fire , only now they ’re turning around and watching as the whole town burns down . ”
" They start playing
around with Linux and start realizing that it's not what they are used
to , " MSI 's Director of U.S. Sales Andy Tung said in the Laptop mag interview .
" They do n't want to spend time to learn it so they bring it back to
the store .
The return rate is at least four times higher for Linux
netbooks than Windows XP netbooks . "
Netbooks are supposed to be the killer category for Linux .
According to netbook vendor MSI though , that 's not necessarily the case .
In an interview with Laptop magazine an MSI exec claims that the return rate for Linux netbooks is higher than it is for regular ( non- Linux ) notebook computers .
Frankly - this does n't surprise me in the least .
I suspect that most retail consumers simply do n't have a clue what Linux is .
So they walk into a retail store buy a cheap netbook open it up and see something different - so they return it .
Linux does not look the same as Windows ( though of course you can make it look pretty close - which is something that Xandros does well ) and it does n't run all the same desktop applications that Windows does .
Certainly there are replacement applications - OpenOffice for Microsoft Office and Firefox for IE - BUT still , if a user has a certain expectation ( and that expectation is Windows ) and they do n't get it ... well what do you expect ?
While the netbook industry has done a great job of pushing price - i'm not so sure they 've done a great job ( so far ) of evangelizing Linux .
Then again , this is the comment of one vendor - so it will be interesting to see if other netbook vendors have had the same ( negative ) experience .
PARIS  President Nicolas Sarkozy of France tried to reassure citizens on Thursday that their savings and the nation ’s economy were safe .
While the global financial crisis will have serious consequences for the French economy , he said , bank deposits will be guaranteed and individual taxes will not be raised .
Mr. Sarkozy promised that the government would move ahead with its reforms , especially in shrinking the bloated state sector , and he called for an overhaul of the world ’s financial system , arguing that an era of unregulated markets was over .
“ A certain idea of globalization is dying with the end of a financial capitalism that had imposed its logic on the whole economy and contributed to perverting it , ” he said .
“ The idea of the all - powerful market that could not be contradicted by any rules , by any political intervention ” was “ a crazy idea , ” he said .
“ The idea that the market is always right is a crazy idea . ”

Given our recent posts about the future of surface computing , especially how it can get you drunk , this seems particularly relevant :
The Interactive Mirror takes the idea of dielectric glass mirrors with LCD panels built in a step farther by adding a touchscreen component .
Sure , it would be neat if in the bathroom of the future you could check stocks and weather by brushing your teeth , but do n’t you want to be able to draw a mustache on yourself as well ?
The video shows a neat range of potential uses for the technology , like “ trying on ” clothes , leaving messages , playing space invaders , and well , just playing .
LitStudios notes that the touch - capable mirror is “ patent pending . ”
This is the first time I ’ve seen a demonstration of the technology , but I ’m surprised that this is ( presumably ) the first time someone has figured out how to do it .
It could be that they ’re getting a specific design component as opposed to the idea of a touch mirror as a whole .
This makes me wonder if the next step would be an interactive mirror with AI built in , that really will tell you that you ’re the fairest of them all … or more likely , so you can ask , “ Do I look fat in this ? ” and get an honest answer .

Vincent Bugliosi is no left - leaning softie or fringe conspiracy theorist , and he does not take facts lightly .
As an LA County prosecutor with a flawless homicide conviction rate , Bugliosi put Charles Manson and his followers on Death Row for the infamous 1969 slayings of actress Sharon Tate and six others .
Of nine nonfiction books — including “ Helter Skelter , ” the story of the Manson case and the biggest - selling true - crime book of all time — it is his 1.5 million - word , 10,000 - source tome affirming the findings of the Warren Commission and dissecting at length the varied alternate theories that the 73 - year - old Bugliosi considers his greatest work .
( “ Reclaiming History : The Assassination of President John F. Kennedy ” is currently being made into a miniseries for HBO by Tom Hanks . )
Like much of today ’s music and culture , computers are foreign to him , in part because Bugliosi associates the machines with “ the country going down the tubes . ”
He keeps up a seven - day work week , doing all his research in libraries and with the help of a secretary , who also types up his handwritten manuscripts for publication .
Last Sunday afternoon in the living room of his clean and comfortable West Pasadena home — meticulously decorated by his wife of 51 years , Gail — Bugliosi lamented the decline of traditional values : “ You ’re watching a movie and all of a sudden there ’s someone sitting on a toilet , ” he said , recalling a scene from Stanley Kubrick ’s 1999 film “ Eyes Wide Shut . ”
“ What ’s happening to this country ? ”
Bugliosi also never imagined the presidency of George W. Bush — the subject of his latest book — a man he believes , for intentionally fabricating intelligence to mislead the nation into war with Iraq , should be put on trial in an American courtroom .
The charge : first - degree murder .
“ I ’ll leave it up to a jury as to the punishment , but it could be the death penalty , ” said Bugliosi .
“ Manson is evil .
I ’m not saying Bush is evil — he does n’t want to kill people .
But he ’s a despicable human being who does n’t care if people die .
And he ’s an extremely arrogant person .
He ’s cold - hearted and could n’t care less about other people ’s suffering . ”
Impeachment is n’t enough
The anger that courses through his book , “ The Prosecution of George W. Bush for Murder , ” which outlines evidence to be used in such a case by any prosecutor in a jurisdiction that was home to a soldier who died in Iraq , was also evident Friday during his testimony at a US House of Representatives Judiciary Committee hearing on Executive Power and its Constitutional Limitations .
Billed by many progressives as the first official discussion of impeachment ( although use of that word was restricted , it came up dozens of time ) in a congressional committee , the hearing provoked no official steps toward impeachment proceedings or public censure .
Although he had no comment Monday on Bugliosi ’s testimony or the hearing itself — a broad - ranging six - hour discussion of current and historic executive branch infringements on legislative authority — Pasadena Democratic Congressman and Judiciary Committee member Adam Schiff used his time to denounce both the administration ’s secretive surveillance tactics and very public flouting of congressional subpoenas , ultimately making “ an open call to this Congress to form a Church Committee to conduct an investigation into any of the encroachments upon the Constitution . ”
The original Church Committee was formed following the Watergate scandal to investigate illegal intelligence - gathering activities .
But Bugliosi will not be satisfied with any committee , or even impeachment hearings .
The price he wants Bush to pay for the violent deaths of more than 4,000 Americans and 100,000 Iraqi civilians — life behind bars or a death sentence — can only be meted out by a jury .
While Bugliosi offers a mountain of evidence that Bush deliberately misled Congress and the public in his determination to wage a brutal and unnecessary war , at the crux of his argument are discrepancies between the classified and unclassified versions of the 2002 National Intelligence Estimate regarding Iraq .
The classified version of that CIA - authored report differs greatly from a subsequent unclassified version sent to Congress — the White Paper , as it came to be known — after facts were changed or heavily redacted by then - National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice and CIA Director George Tenet .
Issued one week before Congress authorized the invasion , the Oct. 4 White Paper declared that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction and was developing nuclear weapons , describing that nation as an imminent threat to ours .
The Oct. 1 classified version of the document , promoted by Bush as the main evidence for going to war before it was declassified in April 2004 , tells a completely different story , writes Bugliosi — one in which none of 16 different intelligence operations concluded that Iraq posed an imminent threat , and a fact seldom , if ever , fully reported by mainstream media outlets , he said .
“ Where did they get the guts to do this , the incredible audacity to take the all - important conclusion out ?
They had the guts because no one gives a damn and the weak liberal media will let them get by with murder , ” said Bugliosi , still exasperated by his own findings .
Criminal intent
More insidiously , elements from the classified document that were not ignored were either changed or completely made up by the time they reached the White Paper , according to
the book .
The phrase “ we have little specific information ” regarding Iraqi chemical weapons was changed to “ Saddam probably has ” ; conjecture was played off as fact when the phrase “ we judge ” was dropped from “ Iraq has continued its weapons of mass destruction programs ” ; and to one line about the use of deadly weapons the White Paper added the words “ including potentially against the US homeland . ”
Dissenting opinions about the Iraqi threat were discarded for the White Paper , including a State Department Intelligence Research Bureau finding that Iraq was not seeking to acquire nuclear weapons — changed for Congress and the public to read that “ all intelligence experts agree that Iraq is seeking nuclear weapons . ”
Bugliosi argues at the core of his book that Bush and his administration fabricated any notion of Iraq being an imminent threat , as they also did by falsely connecting Saddam Hussein to al Qaeda in repeated speeches .
This evidence convinces Bugliosi beyond a reasonable doubt that Bush was acting with criminal intent to start an unnecessary , deadly conflict .
“ What could possibly be worse and more criminal than the Bush administration keeping all these important conclusions from Congress and the American people ?
The terrible reality is that the Bush administration has gotten away with thousands of murders , ” Bugliosi told Congress .
He and other witnesses were asked to refrain , as if under some stodgy rule inherited from Britain ’s House of Lords , from making accusations specific to the president in addition to saying the word “ impeach . ”
“ All Americans should be absolutely outraged over what the Bush administration has done .
How dare they do what they ’ve done ?
How dare they ? ” concluded Bugliosi , bringing an overflow Capitol Building crowd to applaud .
Northern California peace activist Cindy Sheehan , who has publicly challenged Bush since her son died in Iraq and has been campaigning against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to further the impeachment cause , was ejected from the audience at the urging of congressional Republicans for saying “ Thank you , Vince , ” to Bugliosi after his testimony .
Also during the event , Ohio Democratic Congressman and former presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich — who has introduced articles of impeachment against Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney — and others testified that Bush could be censured or impeached for manipulating pre-war intelligence and for violating the Constitution for illegal domestic surveillance and torture tactics , as well as ordering executive branch officials not to cooperate with Congress .
Bush adviser Karl Rove has flouted a subpoena to testify before the Judiciary Committee , citing executive privilege .
Former White House Counsel Harriet Myers and Chief of Staff Josh Bolten have been charged with contempt of Congress for refusing to testify , but Attorney General Michael Mukasey — himself facing threats of a congressional contempt citation for withholding information from the CIA leak investigation involving former CIA agent Valerie Plame — has refused to enforce those orders .
“ Some of this [ constitutionally unsound ] conduct has taken place very much in the open , as when the administration ignores the plain language of a statute that when the Congress finds someone in contempt of Congress , that matter shall be brought before the grand jury — not may , not might , but shall , ” said Schiff , a former federal prosecutor .
‘ It ’s personal ’
That an intense moral outrage against the Bush administration surrounds the deliberate logic of Bugliosi ’s book is immediately clear :
The inside front and back covers contain photographs of Americans killed in Iraq ; and a glossy photo section inside juxtaposes images of the dead , wounded and grieving with photos of Bush — quoted throughout the book as “ feeling pretty good about life , ” having “ perfect days , ” and a “ great year ” — smiling and laughing .
“ With every other murder I ’ve prosecuted , including Charles Manson , it was not personal , ” said Bugliosi .
“ I ’ll tell you why it ’s personal with this guy George Bush .
It ’s not personal against Rice or Cheney — but , again , I ’d seek the death penalty against both of them ; they deserve to die .
It ’s personal because , to sum it up , as young American kids , 18 - , 19 - year - old kids who never had a chance to live out their dreams , are being blown to pieces by roadside bombs in Iraq , George Bush — the evidence is overwhelming !
— is having a lot of fun , enjoying life to the very utmost .
…
With all the death , horror and suffering he has caused , what type of a monstrous individual could be happy with his life ? ”
But why would anyone perpetrate such a crime ?
Bugliosi says
Bush ’s motive is unclear , but also unnecessary to establish in a murder trial .
“ Motive is not synonymous with [ criminal ] intent .
But whatever his motive was , it was not good , ” he said .
Some people say oil , politics , maybe even a Bush family drama .
A motive that has emerged from conservative Republicans was to establish democracy in Iraq so it would spread throughout the Middle East .
“ When a president takes the nation to war , he ’s supposed to get the informed consent of the American people because it ’s the blood of their children that ’s being shed . …
If you stipulate that really was his motive , you also stipulate the he lied to the American people , ” said Bugliosi .
At the hearing last week , several Republican congressmen branded the discussion as a ridiculous exercise , repeating that the Bush administration had committed no crimes .
Although Bugliosi spares Congress any guilt for authorizing the war — “ fraud negates consent , ” he explained — he describes Republican loyalists who defend Bush at every turn as also morally bereft .
“ Since Bush is a conservative Republican and so are they , anything he does — anything at all , including murder — is fine with them , just fine with them .
They do n’t care .
These people do n’t love America .
They say they do , but they love the Republican Party more than they love America , ” said Bugliosi , who supported Sen .
John McCain ’s run for president in 2000 .
“ [ Bush ] has committed an incalculable crime of incredible magnitude , and everyone ’s trying to protect him ! ”
See no evil
Even outside of the Washington Beltway , “ The Prosecution of George W. Bush for Murder ” — although No. 4 on the LA Times and No. 9 on The New York Times best - seller lists last week — has faced something of a mainstream media blackout .
Not only has the book received limited coverage in daily newspaper book review sections , but Bugliosi has also not been invited to make any major network or cable television appearances , and according to a recent New York Times report ABC Radio has refused to accept an advertisement for the book .
Unlike the Hanks ’ “ Reclaiming History ” project for HBO , an independent film producer working to turn the Bush book into a documentary was unable to find funding in the US ( turning instead to Canada ) and has so far been unable to find an American distributor .
Bugliosi said he ’s sent the book to the attorneys general of each state , but is n’t surprised that none have contacted him — yet .
“ If this were not something very real I would not have done it .
There ’s probably not a high probability — but there ’s a substantial possibility — that Bush is going to end up in an American courtroom , ” he said .
“ There ’s no statute of limitations on murder .
[ Gen. Augusto ]
Pinochet down in Chile — 33 years later they brought murder charges .
[ For Bush ] it could be some law student right now , ” he said .
At minimum , writes Bugliosi in the book , “ If thousands of American people will have nightmares for the rest of their lives over the horrible deaths suffered by their young son … the least I can do in return is put the thought in Bush ’s mind for the rest of his life that he may someday be held accountable in a criminal courtroom . ”
Bugliosi recently discussed “ The Prosecution of George W. Bush for Murder ” during a forum in West Los Angeles .
C-SPAN2 filmed the event and will broadcast it at 6 a.m. and noon ( Pacific Standard Time ) on Sunday .
La Lausitz , une région pauvre de l'est de l'Allemagne , réputée pour ses mines de charbon à ciel ouvert , a été le théâtre d'une première mondiale , mardi 9 septembre .
Le groupe suédois Vattenfall a inauguré , dans la petite ville de Spremberg , une centrale électrique à charbon expérimentale qui met en œuvre toute la chaîne des techniques de captage et de stockage du carbone ( CCS ) .
L'installation , qui a coûté près de 70 millions d'euros , permet de brûler le charbon dans une atmosphère d'oxygène pur , ce qui facilite le piégeage du CO 2 après combustion .
Ce gaz à effet de serre est ensuite liquéfié et transporté vers un ancien réservoir souterrain situé 350 kilomètres plus loin , à Altmark , dans le Land de Saxe Anhalt , où il est enfoui par un système de compression .
Ce procédé d'oxycombustion permet de réduire de 90 % les rejets de CO 2 dans l'atmosphère .
Si l'expérience s'avère concluante , l'entreprise construira en 2013 deux centrales d'une puissance de 500 MW ( mégawatts ) dans le Brandebourg et au Danemark et espère commercialiser l'électricité qui y sera produite en 2015 .
D'autres grands groupes allemands développent des projets similaires , à l'instar de RWE qui a récemment annoncé qu'il allait construire d'ici à 2014 à Hürth , près de Cologne , une centrale de 450 mégawatts qui utilise cette technique .
Le géant Eon veut également investir dans des sites pilotes jusqu 'en 2014 et espère pouvoir commercialiser une électricité propre à partir de 2020 .
" Cette technique est incontournable , sachant que nous ne pouvons pas renoncer au charbon et que des pays comme la Chine ne cessent de construire des centrales de charbon " , commente Claudia Kemfert , experte à l'Institut de recherches économiques de Berlin ( DIW ) .
Alors que l'Allemagne a décidé , en 2000 , de renoncer à l'énergie nucléaire d'ici à 2021 , le charbon reste l'un des piliers de sa politique énergétique et couvre à hauteur de 46,9 % sa production en électricité .
Le gouvernement soutient donc ces projets .
Le développement de ces techniques fait d'ailleurs partie des objectifs visés par le programme de lutte contre le réchauffement climatique dont le premier volet a été adopté par le Parlement allemand en juin .
DES ÉCOLOGISTES CRITIQUES
En revanche , plusieurs associations écologistes se montrent très sceptiques .
Elles craignent que la technique CCS serve d'alibi à la construction de nouvelles centrales à charbon .
" On ferait mieux d'investir dans les énergies renouvelables " , souligne Thorben Becker , spécialiste des questions d'énergie à Bund , la plus grande association allemande de défense de l'environnement .
Par ailleurs , les écologistes dénoncent la baisse de rendement induite par cette technique .
En effet , le piégeage du CO 2 contraint à consommer davantage de charbon pour produire la même quantité d'électricité que dans une centrale classique .
De plus , la construction d'une telle installation nécessite de coûteux investissements .
Enfin , les défenseurs de l'environnement doutent du potentiel offert par la technique de stockage du CO 2 .
Sur ce point , de nombreux experts se montrent optimistes .
" Nous pourrons bientôt maîtriser la technique de l'enfouissement du CO 2 " , assure Claudia Kemfert .
Le centre de recherche géologique de Potsdam ( GFZ ) a d'ailleurs lancé , en juin , un projet pilote d'enfouissement de CO 2 à Ketzin , dans le Brandebourg .

Jesse Ventura , when he's not talking about 9 - 11 , makes a lot of sense .
Describing the two party system to Larry King , he said : ' [ W ] hat you have today is like walking into the grocery store and you go to the soft drink department , and there is only Pepsi and Coke .
Those are the two you get to choose from .
There is no Mountain Dew , no Root Beer , no Orange .
They 're both colas ; one is slightly sweeter than the other , depending on which side of the aisle you are on . '
In an interview with Newsmax , he described politicians in the two party system as pro wrestlers .
' In pro wrestling , out in front of the people , we make it look like we all hate each other and want to beat the crap out of each other , and that 's how we get your money , [ and get you to ] come down and buy tickets .
They 're the same thing .
Out in front of the public and the cameras , they hate each other , are going to beat the crap out of each other , but behind the scenes they 're all going to dinner , cutting deals .
And [ they 're ] doing what we did , too ' laughing all the way to the bank .
And that to me is what you have today , in today 's political world , with these two parties . '
Jesse 's right .
Our political system is a farce .
This year , we have running for president a warmonger who 's a reluctant socialist versus a socialist who 's a reluctant warmonger .
We have two parties that claim they 're different , but when the Establishment , the Complex , our shadowy overlords , whatever you want to call them , really want something , they get it .
When the Establishment wanted the Bailout in the face of almost universal grassroots opposition , they got it .
When the Complex wanted immunity to the telecoms who knowingly spied on Americans , they got it .
When our shadowy overlords wanted stormtroopers to brutally stifle protesters during the party conventions , they got it .
But even if voters had a real choice , and even if the politicians followed the majority will on issues that matter , the system would still , most likely , be a farce .
As Augustine observed , without justice , a government is nothing but a band of thieves .
Augustine was writing about kingdoms , but his insight applies to democracy as well .
Without justice , the ability of the subjects of a government to vote on the laws and rulers that govern them does n't make a government any more legitimate than an unjust monarchy .
And the founders of this country did not believe democracies were likely to be just .
As Walter Williams points out , ' We often hear the claim that our nation is a democracy .
That was n't the vision of the founders .
They saw democracy as another form of tyranny . '
In Democracy : The God That Failed , Hans - Hermann Hoppe notes ' It is difficult to find many proponents of democracy in the history of political theory .
Almost all major thinkers had nothing but contempt for democracy .
Even the Founding Fathers of the U.S. , nowadays considered the model of democracy , were strictly opposed to it .
Without a single exception , they thought of democracy as nothing but mob-rule . '
In order to create a just government , the founders established a constitutionally limited republic , in which the popular vote was to be just one check among many .
Notably , the word democracy does not appear anywhere in the Constitution .
Yet today , the word democracy is sacred .
As Election Day approaches , Americans dutifully watch inane debates , respectfully watch commercials in which celebrities harangue them to ' rock the vote ' or other such nonsense , and compulsively ask each other who they 're going to vote for .
On Election Day , they go to the polls as if they were receiving Holy Communion and then go through the rest of the day wearing ' I Voted ' stickers as if these stickers were ashes on Ash Wednesday .
Pat Buchanan calls the blind reverence to and awe of the seemingly divine force of democracy ' democracy worship . '
He notes it was the prospect of spreading democracy to the Middle East that ultimately convinced The Decider to decide on war in Iraq .
So how did we get from the founder 's deep suspicion of majority rule to the deification of democracy ?
Once , humans lived in small bands and were free .
True , life was dangerous , but no one told you what to do .
As Philip Jackson explains , ' Men might hunt individually or in groups .
But when they cooperated , leadership was not based on official rank , but rather on one hunter proposing a group hunt and recruiting others to follow him .
None were compelled to follow , however , and different hunts might have different leaders based on the relative charisma of different individuals at different times .
Women needed even less coordination .
With them leadership would be more a matter of the wiser or more skilled giving advice as the need arose . '
Then came the great collusion , followed by the long oppression .
As humans increased in number and food became harder to come by , bands became tribes and tribes became chiefdoms .
Big Chief , hungry for power , convinced the high priest to delude the people to his consent .
Big Chief was divinely appointed , they were told , and maybe even divine himself .
Therefore , the people must do what he says .
Murray Rothbard ( 1926 to 1995 ) , economist , historian , and political theorist , was one of the greatest minds of the 20th century .
Perhaps Rothbard 's greatest achievement was his identification of the Court Intellectual .
In contrast to the masses , who ' do not create their own ideas , or indeed think through these ideas independently , ' intellectuals are society 's opinion shapers .
The Court Intellectual is the intellectual who , 'in return for a share of , a junior partnership in , the power and pelf offered by the rest of the ruling class , spins the apologias for state rule with which to convince a misguided public . '
Until recently , the propaganda put out by the court intellectuals was linked to traditional religion .
To quote Rothbard again , ' Particularly potent among the intellectual handmaidens of the State was the priestly caste , cementing the powerful and terrible alliance of warrior chief and medicine man , of Throne and Altar .
The State ' established ' the Church and conferred upon it power , prestige , and wealth extracted from its subjects .
In return , the Church anointed the State with divine sanction and inculcated this sanc'tion into the populace . '
In the West , the myth of the divine right of kings held sway until the Enlightenment .
According to Keith Preston , ' A principal achievement of the Enlightenment of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries was the demolition of the notion of the divine right of kings . '
The word enlightenment may conjure up images of a man sitting in the lotus position on a mountaintop , at one with the universe , but in regards to the time period , enlightenment refers not to mystical insight but to the realization that much of the received wisdom , including the myth of the divine right of kings , was a pack of lies .
With the courage to question the lies and disseminate their conclusions , the writers of the Enlightenment began a revolution in thought that culminated in the Declaration of Independence .
Unfortunately , at the same time they were knocking down one pillar of the Old Order , another writer , Jean - Jacques Rousseau , was planting the seeds of democracy worship .
In Rousseau 's mystical vision of a society governed by what he called the ' general will , ' each of us would put 'his person and all his power in common under the supreme direction of the general will , and , in our corporate capacity , we [ would ] receive each member as an indivisible part of the whole . '
The resulting sovereign , ' being formed wholly of the individuals who compose it , neither [ would have ] ' nor ' [ could ] have any interest contrary to theirs ; and consequently the sovereign power [ would ] need give no guarantee to its subjects .
In his imagined world , ' [t ] he Sovereign , merely by virtue of what it is , [ would ] ' always [ be ] what it should be . '
According to James Bovard , who calls Rousseau the ' modern state 's evil prophet , ' contends that in promoting his concept of the ' general will , ' Rousseau ' unleashed the genie of absolute power in the name of popular sovereignty , which had hitherto been unknown . '
Rousseau 's concept of the general will proved irresistible to future court intellectuals , as it perfectly conflated society and state , as useful trick indeed .
' With the [ subsequent ] rise of democracy , ' Rothbard wrote , 'it is common to hear sentiments expressed which violate virtually every tenet of reason and common sense : such as 'we are the government . '
The useful collective term ' we ' has enabled an ideological camouflage to be thrown over the reality of political life .
If 'we are the government , ' then anything a government does to an individual is not only just and tyrannical ; it is also ' voluntary ' on the part of the individual concerned .
If the government has incurred a huge public debt which must be paid by taxing one group for the benefit of another , this reality of burden is obscured by saying that ' we owe it to ourselves ' ; if the government conscripts a man , or throws him into jail for dissident opinion , then he is ' doing it to himself ' and therefore nothing untoward has occurred . '
Observing the power of ' the myth that says we are governing ourselves , ' Lew Rockwell notes that whereas ' [ k ] ings of old would have been overthrown in short order if they had tried to grab 40 percent of people 's earnings , or told them how big to make their toilet tanks , or determined how schools taught every subject , ' modern Americans ' turn a blind eye to petty tyrannies in our midst . '
As Bovard comments , it is as if ' [ b ] eing permitted to vote for politicians who enact unjust , oppressive new laws magically converts the stripes on prison shirts into emblems of freedom . '
Wise up , America .
There 's nothing special about 50 % plus one .
Truth and justice cannot be determined by a show of hands .
We are not the government .
Voting is not a sacrament .
And as it stands today , when we 're only given a choice between two Establishment approved candidates , voting is a joke .
Voltaire , the undisputed leader of the Enlightenment , used humor and wit as two of his primary weapons , and , as Robert Ingersoll remarked , ' In the presence of absurdity he laughed ' '
It was largely by making the divine right of kings a laughing stock that the Enlightenment writers destroyed it .
It is time for us to do the same thing to the divine right of the majority .
This year , vote laughing or stay home .

Admitting he was " perhaps an unlikely legal illustrator , " the Maryland Court of Appeals recently cited Jerry Seinfeld to illustrate the contractual and fiduciary duty of " good faith . "
The case , Clancy v. King , is not especially notable otherwise , except maybe because " Clancy " is the author Tom Clancy .
In 1992 , Clancy and his wife Wanda formed a limited partnership to handle various book projects , including the " Tom Clancy ’s Op - Center " books that you have likely seen and not purchased in airports .
( If you are a fan of that series , you might or might not like to know that Clancy not only did not write but also " did not read . . . in any meaningful part , any of the books in the series . " )
The partnership became much more limited a few years later when the couple got divorced .
Clancy decided he no longer wanted to contribute his name to the books he had nothing to do with , and Wanda argued that this breached his duty to the partnership .
She won .
But on appeal , the court reversed .
It found that Clancy had the right to withdraw his name , so long as he exercised his right in " good faith . "
And what does that mean ?
[ Seinfeld ] once epitomized the duty of good faith in contract .
. . .
Jerry ’s character purchased a jacket at a men ’s clothing shop .
The terms of the contract permitted Jerry to return the item for refund at his discretion .
When Jerry attempted to return the jacket after an unrelated personal quarrel with the salesman , the following discussion took place .
Jerry : Excuse me , I ’d like to return this jacket .
Clerk : Certainly .
May I ask why ?
Jerry : For spite .
Clerk : Spite ?
Jerry :
That ’s right .
I do n’t care for the salesman that sold it to me .
Clerk : I do n’t think you can return an item for spite .
Jerry :
What do you mean ?
Clerk :
Well , if there was some problem with the garment .
If it were unsatisfactory in some way , then we could do it for you , but I ’m afraid spite does n’t fit into any of our conditions for a refund .
* * * Bob :
What seems to be the problem ?
Jerry :
Well , I want to return this jacket and she asked me why and I said for spite and now she wo n’t take it back .
Bob :
That ’s true .
You ca n’t return an item based purely on spite .
Jerry :
Well , so fine then . . . then I do n’t want it and then that ’s why I ’m returning it .
Bob :
Well you already said spite , so . . . .
Jerry : But I changed my mind .
Bob :
No , you said spite .
Too late .
Seinfeld : The Wig Master ( NBC original television broadcast 4 April 1996 ) .
In attempting to exercise his contractual discretion out of " spite , " Jerry breached his duty to act in good faith towards the other party to the contract .
Jerry would have been authorized to return the jacket if , in his good faith opinion , it did not fit or was not an attractive jacket .
He may not return the jacket , however , for the sole purpose of denying to the other party the value of the contract .
The court also noted that Bob appropriately rejected Jerry ’s claim that he just did n’t want the jacket , finding this " post hoc rationalization " by Seinfeld " not credible . "

First off Brad , thanks for putting the information out in a straight forward way .
As the webmaster for republicantricks.com I agree with you 99 % of the time .
The one thing missing from your article , and the one thing that is bothering me is the Nevada Secretary of State is a Democrat .
Why would he do this ?
ACORN did nothing wrong , is he going to go after the canvassers that put in the false information ?
I have seen advertisements for ACORN in my state where they say " Make up to $ 25 per hour " Is ACORN paying per vote application ?
If so an individual canvasser could just go to a phone book and fill crap out .
I want to know more .
Let us know Brad , Thanks , Dale

Dale -
I do n't know that Ross Miller ( NV's new Dem SoS ) had anything to do with this raid , frankly .
Reports
I 've seen , so far , say " state and federal officials " , whoever that is .
That said , Miller has not been , um , particularly impressive on these issues .
For the moment , I 'll leave it at that .
Happy to offer more on those lines when I 'm able to learn more .
Either way , be sure to read ACORN 's statement posted at the bottom of the original article above .
More when I can get it , and after the Debate blows over ...

Yada yada yada , yeah it 's about time someone started jerking the Acorn hucksters around .
The charges against them are n't just propaganda , there is enough evidence of voter registration fraud by them in past elections to warrant shutting them down permanently .
IMHO of course .

Is this going to be the " GOP made me do it " defense ?

Ken ,
No , it does n't seem to me that ACORN is taking the " Republicans made me do it " defense --- as the Brad guy said , ACORN has to turn in all registrations by law , and has even been marking the suspect ones ( the same applications the nuts are whining about , it also seems ) .
No one who has paid any reasonable attention in the past 8 years would ever confuse the Republicans with having any connection with ( or respect for ) the law .
They 're above petty things like that .

Here we go again .
Flash back to October of 2004 , Nathan Sproul who turned out to be the 6th largest expense that the RNC had in the 2004 election cycle .
Team Bush Paid Millions to Nathan Sproul -- and Tried to Hide It ...
All the payments by the RNC to Sproul add up to a whopping $ 8,359,161 .
Where did all that money come from ?
Why did the RNC suppress their real expenditures ?
Mark Crispin Miller
In that cycle in late September Sproul got in trouble with voter registration in two states by destroying Democratic registration forms .
Immediately Rorwellian went to work and blamed ACORN with false allegations .
A year or so later ACORN was completely cleared .
That leaded to the firing of several of the U.S. Attorneys for not manufacturing good evidence to get ACORN .
As to Nathan Sproul , the Justice Department took the cases away from the states and then buried them .
Sproul boosts that in the 2004 election cycle that he worked 23 states .
“ How the 2004 Election was stolen on optical scanners : John Brakey and the " " by David Griscom , Ph.D.www.iefd.org/article/sleuthing_stolen_election.php
Sproul use to be the Executive Director of the Arizona Christian Right and up to the 2002 election cycle the Arizona Republican Party .

Not anymore !

It is proven beyond any reasonable doubt .
There are smoking guns all over the place but no one is putting this front page day after day and getting the legal and media resources to shut down these criminals .
The Diebold voting machines are all programmed for voting fraud .

I have worried about paying people to register voters in the past .
There is much room for the voter rolls to be corrupted when you pay someone by the registrant and not by the hour or use volunteers .
It is important to be able to train people with the ability to fire them if they do not fill out the forms etc correctly .
But unfortunately , the organizers ' eagerness to complete volume often gets lost in that , as well .
It is pointless to register people if they are n't going to vote anyway .
Most ' good ' organizers understand this , sometimes the training process loses sight of this .
But let 's face it , this was on the evening news and the fact that Michael Connell , who works for McCain refuses to be deposed has gone unnoticed .
This investigation has been stifled for nearly 4 years , and yet somehow the damn ' liberal '( ha .... what a joke ) media wo n't even talk about it .
The voters have more to worry about with this man still free & clear of criminal charges , while in the employ of the McCain campaign .
Connell 's involvement with the republican party should not be considered " client confidentiality " - especially since that is the whole issue .
more here if you do n't have up to date info :
http://velvetrevolution.us/
Thanks Brad , for explaining to people that ACORN is obligated to turn in all registrations , suspect or not .
Let 's hope that this issue gets more notice in other outlets .
You will be happy to know that FAUX ( FOX ) news did ' mention ' that the culprit is probably over eager workers who were trying to complete volume for the sake of profit - not ACORN faking up registrations .
Keep up the good work !

In a time of democratic crisis in our nation , you are calling the Association for Community Organizations for Reform Now ( ACORN ) communists ??!!
The last thing in the world ACORN does is support communism .
They function to support democracy in our nation .
In a democracy US citizens have a right to have their voice heard at the ballot box .
Registering voters is critical to the process of democracy .
Denying people the right to vote is closer to communism .
I would hate to throw out your senseless adhominems , but sadly - the Republicans have taken measures that are closer to communism .
If you think that supporting communistic ideals is why we are here - then maybe you need to ask yourself what your party is hiding when they refuse to allow Connell to be deposed .
Ask yourself why the corporations of America are being rescued by Bush when the ship was obviously going to sink over 5 years ago .... Seems a lot more like your red flag has been flying in the back rooms of the republican party .

People keep saying that having the right to vote is a most important and precious thing .
But , I can't seem to figure out why it is that there exists a need to rush out and register others , then bombard them with reminders only to spend time making sure they get to the polls .
Then I figured it out ; others votes and your own desire far out weigh the inspirations of others to vote .
Basically , the non-voters are lazy and without care while you are just plain selfish and inconsiderate of anyone of holds a separate opinion .
Do you realize that every single voter that you register under the ACORN principles and encouraged to vote under the same actually cancels out a vote of one who has the right to hold different views ; moreover , do you care ?
And please do n't insult my intelligence by claiming some altruistic endeavor to promote voter participation regardless of politics .
I know how this works and it saddens me to see my party engage in such tactics
In my opinion , the practice of registering other voters should be outlawed .
Registering is not that difficult ; I did it , you did it and I am sure others and their families can do it as well .
As for the homeless , well they have plenty of time on their hands to get themselves registered .
To be homeless in this great land of opportunity exemplifies the ability of some to make decisions to better themselves .
So why then , should we entrust their judgment that affects others ?
You all may take my position as crude and obtuse , but I assure you that I only see things in terms of fairness and human decency .

It 's pathetic that my party has become so corrupt and winning is more important than building a better country .
The GOP is no better and I 'm sure everyone here is well aware of the Bush travesty .
Again , make it required to show who the hell you are at the polls and a lot of fraud will be eliminated .
It worked in WA State , where I live .
ACORN signed up over 1800 false registrations ; only 6 were valid !
And that 's just one state .
I 'm tired of the bitching and finger pointing between parties .
I think they should both be eliminated ; they both suck .
Each day , we are having the life sucked out of us by these politicos and for what ?
Medical Marijuana , more " gay " rights , spending OUR money to buy off special interest groups or other party members ?

Do we really want this band of thieves to have MORE control over our lives ?
Sadly , supporters of either party have become " useful idiots " .
They keep us at each other ’s throats while they continue to steal more and more of our freedoms .
Divide and conquer .
And the end of the day , both parties are the same .
Obama and McCain BOTH voted for the bailout .

I can see what happened here .
When I lived in Washington , DC , the local County Paper ( run by a Republican ) hired people to go out and sell subscriptions .
They were paid based on piecework - how many subscriptions they sold .
So these folks went out and wrote down the names of everyone in my apartment building who was foolish enough to list their name on their mailbox , including me .
I started receiving this paper , thinking it was free or a promotion .
Then the bills started coming .
Then the phone calls - threatening ones , claiming they were going to damaging my credit rating if I did not " pay up " .
ACORN may have had good intentions , but if they used canvassers , the canvassers may have gone overboard .
Also , there is the possibility that Republicans dumped clearly fraudulent registrations forms on ACORN with the idea of then using this data later on to attack the organization .
The myth of Voter Fraud is just that .
The Republicnas have yet to show even ONE person caught in the act of illegally voting .
But yet the myth persists .
With Obama leading by nearly double digits in the polls , one wonders what their argument is going to be this time - that the pollsters are polling the dead ?

ARE THE POLLS TO BE BELIEVED ???
I , like many Americans believe that character , honesty , and integrity really do go to the foundation of who the next president should be .
Obama is ahead in the polls because Obama is dramatically outspending McCain with television advertising ... he has a biased media in the tank , who provides him with more and better exposure , and editorial endorsement ... Obama has 96 % of the black vote ... he enjoys the relentless support of a completely biased entertainment industry , plus the left wing educational community , plus massive illegal , or unethical fund raising , and voter registration drives , by groups like Acorn ... not to mention the fact that thanks to democratic propaganda , McCain has to carry Bush 's weight .
At this point in time , many Americans are also beginning to question the validity of the POLLS .
Are they skewed , like the biased media ?
Do they truly reflect reality ?
Are the sample groups mostly black voters ?
If the Democrats are so sure they 've already won , how come they keep trying so hard to make the rest of us believe it ?
Just like they did against Hillary !
There is a good chance that if we can keep voter fraud out of this election , that on November 4th , the actual voters , in the privacy of their booths , will elect McCain / Palin , by a comfortable margin .
If you vote for Obama , you are also voting for voter fraud and a crooked media .
On November 4th cast your vote for McCain / Palin !!!

G Holt , and others upthread ---

Based on your comments , it would appear not , or that perhaps you need remedial reading courses .
ACORN is required by law to turn in all forms , even the obviously fraudulent ones .
Or perhaps you would prefer that ACORN ( and other organizations doing similar registration drives ) be the ones to determine which forms get submitted and which ones get thrown in the trash ?
Hyper - partisans cling to their ideology against all logic and facts , and place party over country when they decry an organization that helps their fellow citizens participate in the election process , while at the same time giving jobs to the poor .
Unless , of course , those new voters are from the " right " side of the tracks ...
Tell you what , G Holt and others --- why do n't you find us some evidence of anyone actually casting a fraudulent vote through voter registration fraud , which is what this story is about , and enlighten us , in addition to entertaining us with your fact - free fever dreams ?
Seriously , you guys do not help McCain 's campaign when you can't manage to use facts or logic to support your assertions .

US$ 700 billion dollars is twice the combined debt of the world ’s poorest 49 countries .
By Tony Iltis
October 11 , 2008 -- “ Meltdown ” is a word that one hears a lot on the news these days .
Despite the US$ 700 billion government bailout of banks in the US , similar ( albeit smaller ) bailouts in Europe , and various forms of state intervention in the finance industry on both sides of the Atlantic , sharemarkets worldwide are in free fall .
Comparisons with the Great Depression of the 1930s are common .
Homelessness and unemployment are rising and are set to increase dramatically .
Meanwhile , more quietly but even more relentlessly , another meltdown is occurring : that of the polar icecaps .
According to the Western world ’s establishment politicians and corporate media , the way to avert catastrophic climate change lies in setting up elaborate emissions trading schemes and carbon markets : that is , relying on precisely the mechanisms that have created the economic meltdown !
Superficially , the crisis has created a dramatic reversal in the orthodoxy of Western economic policy .
After decades of preaching the virtues of deregulation of financial markets , privatisation of public assets and the superiority of the “ hidden hand of the market ” over government involvement in the economy , Western governments are now spending gargantuan amounts of public money intervening in the economy .
Following the US government ’s nationalisation of the mortgage institutions Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae and insurance giant AIG , and its unpopular $ 700 billion bailout of the banks , British PM Gordon Brown announced a £ 50 billion ( US$ 89 billion ) bailout for British banks , including partial nationalisations , with a further £ 450 billion being earmarked should the banks need more .
Likewise in Germany , France , Belgium , the Netherlands , Ireland and Luxembourg , massive state interventions and partial nationalisations are on the agenda .
In Iceland , where a globally oriented finance industry dwarfs domestic economic activity , the three largest banks have been taken over by a government desperately trying to stop the country becoming bankrupt .
Iceland ’s stock exchange has closed .

There has also been mutual recrimination between the governments of Iceland and Britain .
The British government has condemned Iceland for not guaranteeing the deposits of British individuals and institutions in Iceland ’s banks , including about £ 2 billion from British local councils .
Iceland , for its part , has charged that the British seizure of Icelandic bank assets ( using anti-terrorism laws ! ) has contributed to the crisis .
Iceland is currently negotiating a 4 billion euro bailout from Russia .
‘ Hidden hand ’ still reigns
However , the failure of this expensive government intervention to halt the global collapse of sharemarkets — and remove the spectre of a massive downturn in production , fuelling unemployment and poverty — reflects that the old orthodoxy has not , in fact , been overturned .
The thrust of the “ emergency ” economic interventions has been to pump money into the finance industry in the hope that this will encourage the banks to restart the flow of credit to productive industry .
The “ hidden hand of the market ” still reigns .
At the heart of the crisis is speculation on debt .
With US wages remaining static since 1973 , while the cost of living has risen considerably , consumer spending ( and therefore corporate profits ) have been maintained by a credit - fuelled economy .
Furthermore , deregulated financial markets created a huge industry based on repackaging and reselling debts , creating incomprehensible investment options ( “ collateralised debt obligations ” , “ credit default swaps ” ) .
In the US these “ products ” grew to a value of US $ 64 trillion — five times the annual output of the US economy .
There are nationalisations and there are nationalisations .
Under the various bailouts , the assets that governments are taking over are the so - called “ toxic assets ” — precisely those ecomomic “ products ” that have proved to be worthless .
A more rational response would be to simply put the banks under state ownership .
For their former owners , who have made countless billions , compensation should not even be considered — criminal charges would be more appropriate .
What $ 700 billion could achieve
It is worth considering what the $ 700 billion spent on bailing out the US banks could have been spent on .
Less than $ 200 billion would end poverty in the US .
The widespread hostility of the US working class to the bailout reflects that while money can be found to protect billionaires ’ profits from “ toxic assets ” , no assistance has been forthcoming for those who ’ve lost their homes through “ toxic ” variable interest rate mortgages .
Earlier this year , US President George Bush vetoed legislation to give medical coverage to 9 million poor children in the US , on the grounds that such expenditure , less than $ 6 billion , was “ useless ” !
Seven hundred billion dollars is twice the combined debt of the world ’s poorest 49 countries .
Underpinning world poverty is the fact for every dollar spent on Western aid to the Third World , $ 25 are paid back as debt servicing .
Currently , global inequality condemns 11 million children to death each year due to lack of healthcare , sanitation , food and water .
Ten billion dollars — a 70th of the bailout — would be sufficient to save these lives .
Six billion dollars would provide basic education for the whole world , while $ 9 billion would provide water and sanitation , $ 12 billion reproductive health for all women and $ 13 billion adequate nutrition and healthcare .
Along with increasing inequality within nations , the doctrine of neoliberalism ( reliance the “ hidden hand of the market ” ) has more than doubled the wealth gap between rich and poor countries .
Much trumpeted debt relief and aid programs ( such as the “ Millenium Development Goals ” ) make any assistance dependent on poor countries following International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) diktats to privatise and deregulate their economies for the benefit of Western corporations .
Privatising and commodifying basic services such as water and sanitation , and the removal of food and fuel subsidies , literally means misery and death for millions .
The IMF ’s offer of similar “ assistance ” to Western countries in response to the current financial crisis should be treated with trepidation by workers and poor people in these countries .
War spending
While the $ 700 billion bailout dwarfs Western social expenditure and international development aid , it is itself dwarfed by spending on the military .
Since the 2003 invasion of Iraq , the US has spent $ 3 trillion on the war alone .
The $ 1.339 trillion annual global military expenditure is , as much as the bailouts , assistance to the corporate elite .
Not only do corporations make direct profits through the arms trade , and increasingly privatised military infrastructure , military force ensures Western corporations ’ access to the world ’s resources and the labour of its people .
With excuses for the Iraq war ( weapons of mass destruction and involvement in the 9/11 attacks ) long discredited , it is difficult to disguise that the real reason for the invasion was to corner the fossil fuel market .
The centrality of fossil fuels to the Western - imposed global economic system raises the question of the other meltdown : global warming .
Both crises have the same source : the profit - driven capitalist economy .
Even when the economy was apparently booming , it was incongruous that finding solutions to the climate crisis was tasked to economists , such as Sir Nicholas Stern in Britain and Professor Ross Garnaut in Australia .
It should now be considered insane for the market to solve the problem of climate change when it has proved spectacularly incapable of solving the problems of the market !
It is necessary to redefine what is meant by “ the economy ” .
Mainstream economists have claimed that speculators trading incomprehensible financial products based on debt are creating wealth .
The financial meltdown has proved these claims fraudulent .
Wealth is actually created by people working to make goods and services .
The corporate rulers of the world take this wealth rather than create it .
With a large increase in unemployment looming due to the financial collapse it is worth remembering that the solutions needed to avert catastrophic climate change are labour intensive : for example , wholesale conversion of entire economies to renewable energy , sustainable agriculture and public transport instead of private car - based transport .
More than 150 years ago Karl Marx and Frederick Engels , explaining that the working class , as the creators of wealth , could , if they took control of society , create a world without poverty , inequality or oppression , said , “ We have a world to win ” .
Today it could be added that we also have a world to lose .

ISLAMABAD : A total of 428 Pakistanis comprising 260 women and 168 men were brutally killed across Pakistan in the name of honour between January 1 and August 31 .
The number of honour killings in Pakistan are estimated to be around 2,500 to 3,000 cases every year .
However , the report states that a good number of such cases still go unreported or are passed off as suicides and only 25 % of these are brought to justice .
According to the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan ( HRCP ) , 260 women and 168 men have already been killed in the first eight months of 2008 .
Honour killings are treated as murder under Pakistan ’s penal code ; however , the relevant law states that the family of the victim is allowed to compromise with the killer who is a close relative in most of the cases .
Provisions of the Pakistani law also allow the next of kin of the victim to forgive the murderer in exchange for money .
And most of the offenders continue to use this clause to escape punishment .
Asma Jahangir , the chairperson of HRCP , says the Pakistan government has not taken any concrete steps to put an end to honour killings and to hold perpetrators to account .
The Cardboard Shutter
Based on how popular the simple Bubble Wrap insulation for windows is , I thought I would add this cardboard shutter as suggested in the book " Movable Insulation " by Langdon ( a great book ) .
The idea is cut out several pieces of cardboard to fit the window , and stack them together .
The edges can be taped with duct tape to hold the whole stack together .
Some spots of glue here and there between the layers might also help .
The book suggests applying a layer of thick aluminum foil to both faces of the cardboard panel -- the improves the thermal performance substantially , and also makes the shutter more fire resistant .
Ideally you should mount the cardboard shutter such that any gaps around the edges are small , and spaced a little ways from the window to leave an air gap .
I 've picked up large pieces of cardboard from our local kitchen appliance store -- they were quite happy to part with them .
In my climate ( cold ) , the saving for this scheme on a 3 ft by 5 ft window would be :
Single Glazed :
Using the Insulation Upgrade Calculator ,
Current R value = 1 ( single glazed window )
New R value = 1 + ( 1 air films + 1 cardboard + 2 foil ) = R5
Propane fuel at $ 2.2 per gallon with an 80 % efficient furnace
The R4 for the cardboard shutter is roughly based on :
The air films on either side of the cardboard add R1 ( like any inside storm window ) + the cardboard itself -- say half an inch at R2 ( ? ) per inch adds R1 + the R value associated with alum foil on the inside and outside adds R2 .
The aluminum foil on the inside reflects IR heat from the room back into the room , and the aluminum foil coating on the outside acts as a low emissivity surface to reduce heat radiation to the outside .
Insulation Upgrade Calculator for Cardboard Shutter :
$ 66 in one year !!
And , 400 lbs of green house gas saving !!
The saving for a double glazed window is $ 27 with a 170 lb CO2 saving .
This should be about one week payback on the cost of the duct tape and aluminum foil !
So , even if you plan to do something fancier for " next winter " , you can do this right now , save some money and greenhouse gas , and then recycle the cardboard when you go to fancier window treatments .
If you give this a try , please email me a picture -- Gary .
Note : I got one comment from Dave in the UK to the effect that if even a small gap is left between the window and the insulating shutter , that he got a lot of condensation .
This probably has a lot to do with climate and whether the existing window is double pane or not .
High indoor humidity and single glazing will aggravate the condensation problem .
In our dry climate and with double glazed windows , we rarely if ever experience condensation on the windows .
At any rate , if you do get a lot of condensation , then you should do something about it , as the condensation can cause damage over time .
Further Note :
Dave came through with a calculator to tell how likely you are to have a condensation problem with a loose fitting shutter .
It depends on outside temperature , inside humidity , and the R values of the window and shutter .
Very helpful for determining if you are likely to have a condensation problem or not -- Thank You Dave !
The " Movable Insulation " book by William Langdon is a real classic -- it has hundreds of ideas for using movable insulation in ways that dramatically improve thermal performance -- highly recommended .
It was published in 1980 by Rodale .
Used copies can be found on Bookfinder.com for about $ 5 , it has also recently gone back into print via an internet publisher .

Here at Political Irony , I love it when comedians hit the nail on the head better than the pundits or other experts .
Here are two British comedians — back in 2007 — who exactly describe what was about to happen in the financial markets .
Plus it is extremely funny ( in a scary kind of way ) .
I was watching a video I posted earlier from TPM , and I noticed how strong , smart and energetic McCain was during one of the Republican debates .
It was a McCain I ’d not seen for a long while , but one I vaguely remembered .
I checked the date and saw it was from May of last year , 2007 .
Then I watched McCain making his gaffe yesterday in Pennsylvania .
They ’re two totally differently people .
The McCain of today is less sure of himself , stumbles with his words , loses his train of thought , gets confused .
He looks much older .
He evens sounds older .
The old McCain ( of 18 months ago ) had a lower voice .
The new McCain has a higher raspy voice .
It ’s kind of weird how much he ’s aged in just 18 months – and he ’s not even president yet .
So I put the videos side by side .
See for yourself .

I 'm apparently really into the shiftless layabouts .
If you are unemployed , unmotivated and possibly still live with your parents ... you could be next in my long line of failed relationships !
Just think of it ... an educated woman to show you how things work ( hey , I 'm even handy around the house - you wo n't have to raise a finger ! ) .
A woman with drive , ambition and goals to contrast your utter lack of motivation .
A girl with a thick skin who can roll with the punches and both dish out AND take jokes ...
I 'll be happy to be the one who does n't sugar - coat things so that you can blame ME for all of your hurt feelings and failures .
It 's probably even ALREADY my fault and you have n't even emailed me !
I am completely co-depedant , so you do n't have to worry about me booting you to the curb over petty things ( like finances , commitment or general civility ) .
In fact , you could probably take my cash , sleep with another girl and then come over and break some things in my house and I 'd just clean it up and continue along our path of destruction .
So if you 're looking for a lady to use and abuse , I 'm your girl !
I have a house , a car , a life , friends , pets and my shit together .
Please , I need some sort of zeitgeist in my life to screw all of this up !
It 's been way too long since I 've been reminded of how awesome it is to be undervalued .
I 'm over on minutes this month , otherwise I 'd put my phone number up for you to call right away ( either from your parents ' landline or collect , from jail ) .
So just email me and maybe we can work something out .
Pick you up ?
Well , yeah , if you need me to !
Williamsburg ?
No problem .
It 's only about an hour 's drive .
I do n't mind one bit , I 've got nothing but time !
Ranch hand for legislator wanted in fatal beating Ranch hand for Texas Rep .
Flores wanted in fatal beating
McALLEN — A ranch worker hired by a Texas lawmaker is a suspected illegal immigrant now wanted in the fatal beating of a young Hispanic man , authorities said Monday .
Hidalgo County Sheriff Lupe Trevino said Froylen Casares , 24 , is suspected of using a bat to beat another man to death on the ranch early Monday .
Casares , a Honduran , remained at large Monday afternoon .
" It was a very bloody , very bloody , very gruesome crime scene , " Trevino said in a story for Monday 's online edition of The Monitor in McAllen .
Authorities declined to name the dead man , who was killed in a shed next to horse stables on the ranch .
Casares was employed at a ranch owned by state Rep. Kino Flores , who said he hired the man without checking his immigration status .
" He was preppy .
He looked the part .
No indication .
He fit in extremely well , he had family members here , " Flores , D - Palmview , told the newspaper .
" It just looks bad in general .
I certainly do n't want to go around challenging people 's status . "
Flores said he did not know the victim .
Casares ' immigration status and whether Flores broke the law by hiring him would have to be investigated by Immigration and Customs Enforcement , Trevino said .
" I will make our documents , our case available to them , " the sheriff said .
An ICE spokeswoman declined to comment Monday night , saying the agency has not reviewed the case and has not been asked to assist .
" If they call us in to determine the immigration status we will , " spokeswoman Nina Pruneda told the newspaper .
I think it is still safe to say that most people have heard of Nick Leeson .
In early 1995 , Nick Leeson earned global notoriety when it was discovered that he had lost around $ 1.3 billion trading derivatives , bringing about the collapse of Barings Bank , one of the world 's largest at the time .
Nick was sentenced to six and a half years in jail .
On his release he became the darling of the chat shows and his story has since been glamorised in a film .
The result of all this was to catapult the world of derivatives into the public eye .
These financial instruments have since been viewed by the public as risky , dangerous bets akin to putting your house on the 4 o'clock at Newmarket .
There is an element of truth in this , but as I hope to demonstrate , this is only half the story .
So what is a derivative ?
Put simply , a derivative is a financial instrument whose value depends on the values of underlying variables .
The underlying can be almost anything from the price of gold to the amount of snow falling in certain ski resorts ( weather derivatives ! ) .
More commonly though , the underlying is the price of a traded asset , such as a share or a currency rate .
Forward ( futures ) contracts
The simplest type of derivative is a forward contract .
This is an agreement to buy or sell an asset at a certain time in the future for a certain price .
In entering into a forward transaction , one party agrees to buy a certain asset for a fixed price at a fixed date in the future , and the party on the other side of the transaction agrees to sell the asset on the same date for the same price .
The price that the underlying asset is bought / sold for is the delivery price .
This price is chosen so that the value of the contract to both sides is zero at outset .
What this means will be made clearer shortly - roughly it is that the price is fair , so neither party is ripping the other off .
The payoff from the forward is based on the actual price of the underlying asset on the delivery date .
For example , let 's assume that I enter into a forward transaction in which I agree to sell 100 pigs at £ 300 per pig in a year 's time .
( We 're also assuming I do n't have any pigs . )
If the price of a pig is £ 350 at the end of the year , I make a loss on the forward transaction because I must buy 100 pigs at £ 350 each in order to meet my obligation to deliver the pigs .
On delivery I only receive £ 300 per pig , a total loss of £ 5,000 ( 100 x ( £ 350 - £ 300 ) ) plus delivery costs .
On the other hand if the price of pigs has plummeted to £ 250 each , I profit to the tune of £ 5,000 .
In general , if K is the delivery price and S is the current price of the pig at time of delivery ( or any underlying asset for that matter ) the payoff will be
K - S
per pig ( or unit ) if I have agreed to sell pigs at a fixed price ( known as a short position in pigs ) , and similarly
S - K
per pig if I have agreed to buy the pigs at a fixed price ( known as a long position in pigs ) .
These payoffs are illustrated in Figure 1 below .
Figure 1 . Payoffs from forward contracts
How do we determine the delivery price ?
Let 's assume that cash can be deposited or borrowed at 5 % per annum .
If the current price of a pig is £ 300 and the forward price of a pig is £ 330 we can do the following :
Borrow £ 300 at 5 % interest for one year Buy a pig Enter into a short forward contract to sell a pig for £ 330 in one year 's time .
At the end of the year we sell the pig for £ 330 , and repay the borrowing of £ 300 plus £ 15 interest .
We have made a risk free profit of £ 15 .
In fact any delivery price above £ 315 will result in a profit using this strategy .
Likewise if the delivery price is below £ 315 we can do the following :
Sell a pig for £ 300 ( assuming we have one ! )
Deposit £ 300 at 5 % interest for one year Enter into a long forward contract to repurchase the pig in one year 's time for the delivery price .
At the end of the year we buy back the pig at the delivery price .
As long as the delivery price is under £ 315 a risk free profit emerges .
In theory investors in the pig market will try to take advantage of any forward price that is not equal to £ 315 .
These trading activities ( known as " arbitrage " ) will result in the forward price being exactly £ 315 .
This is known as an arbitrage free price as any other price results in an arbitrage opportunity .
What does all this tell us ?
First the forward transaction costs nothing for either party to enter into .
( The arguments above showed that either party could safely agree to the transaction without making a loss by suitable borrowing / lending , etc. )
Second the total return between the two parties will be the interest that can be earned on cash ( £ 15 in the example above ) ; however the payoff for one party is the opposite to that of the other , that is , for every winner there is a loser .
This illustrates the speculative nature of some of these instruments when traded in isolation and the reason that Nick Leeson came a cropper .
When forward contracts are traded on their own for speculative purposes , they can indeed be equivalent to betting on a racehorse .
( In fact speculative trading in options , which are discussed below , is far more dangerous than the kind of forward transaction we 've considered here . )
Although this illustrates the potentially speculative nature of forward transactions and the dangers of being able to enter into a large number of contracts at zero cost , there are a variety of ways in which these contracts can be used to reduce risk .
This is known as hedging .
Extending the pig example , say a pig farmer has a good year in which his pigs sire 100 piglets .
The current price is £ 300 and the farmer is concerned that this may fall or at least not grow in line with the one - year forward price of £ 315 .
He would be happy to receive £ 31,500 for his pigs in a year 's time .
The farmer sells 100 forward contracts on his pigs .
He will then sell his 100 pigs ( once they have grown up ) for the fixed amount of £ 31,500 in a year 's time .
This allows him to prevent a reduction in value due to the price of pigs falling as well as enabling him to fix his future cashflows to reduce the uncertainty of his business .
The farmer has hedged his exposure to pig prices - he has hedged his bets .
One of the most common uses of forward contracts is to hedge currency movements .
For example , a company may be aware that they will receive a $ 1 million payment in a month 's time .
If they do n't want to be exposed to movements in the sterling dollar exchange rate over the month they can sell 1 million dollars of a one - month forward contract on the sterling dollar exchange rate .
If the one - month exchange rate is 0.6 pounds per dollar then the company can agree to sell the payment forward for £ 0.6 million and remove their dollar exposure .
Options
A more interesting type of derivative is an option .
In this type of contract one of the parties has the option to buy or sell an underlying asset for a fixed price at a fixed time in the future .
There are two basic types of option .
A call option gives the holder the right , but not the obligation , to buy the underlying asset at a certain price ( the strike price ) on a certain date .
A put option gives the holder the right , but not the obligation , to sell the underlying asset at a certain price on a certain date .
The fact that the holder has the option to exercise rather than the obligation leads to the one - sidedness of the instrument , which is illustrated in the figures that follow .
Suppose I buy a call option on BP , giving me the option to buy 100 shares in 3 months time for £ 6.00 , and the current price is £ 6.00 .
If after 3 months the share price is below £ 6.00 there is obviously no point in exercising the option .
In order to exercise the option I would have to purchase the shares at £ 6.00 and only be able to sell them for less .
If the share price is above £ 6.00 , however , the option will be exercised .
For example , if the share price were £ 6.50 I would exercise the option , buy the 100 shares for £ 6.00 a share and sell them for £ 6.50 a share .
This would net a profit of £ 50 , minus the price I paid for the option .
Options cost money , the premium , and so it is useful to look at a profit profile rather than a simple payoff profile .
Figure 2 shows the profit profile for a purchased call option .
This illustrates the fact that the maximum loss when buying these instruments is the original premium paid .
The profit is :
max ( S - X , 0 ) - C
where S is the price of the underlying share at the time of exercise , X is the strike price and C the call option premium .
Note that when S is less than X I would not exercise the option ( I would n't buy the shares at the strike price ) so no further loss is incurred .
Figure 2 . Profit from bought call option : option price £ 0.50 , strike price £ 6.00
Similarly suppose I purchase a put option on BP giving me the option to sell 100 shares in 3 months time for £ 6.00 .
The cost may be £ 0.30 .
In this case the option will only be exercised if the share price falls , in which case I can buy the shares on the market for the reduced price and sell them through the put option at £ 6.00 .
Figure 3 shows the profit profile for the put option , which is defined as follows :
max ( X - S , 0 ) - P
where P is the price of the put option .
In this case , when S is greater than X the option would not be exercised and again the loss is limited to the original premium .
Figure 3 . Profit from bought put option : option price £ 0.30 , strike price £ 6.00
In both cases above the graphs represent the situation from the option purchaser 's point of view .
In each case the maximum loss is the option premium .
There are two sides to every option contract though ; on the other side is a party who has sold ( or written ) the option .
The writer of the option receives the premium up front but has potential liabilities later .
The profit profiles are the exact opposite of those above ( Figures 4 and 5 ) .
Sold Call Option : C - max ( S - X , 0 )
Sold Put Option : P - max ( X - S , 0 )
Figure 4 . Profit from sold call option : option price £ 0.50 , strike price £ 6.00
Figure 5 . Profit from sold put option : option price £ 0.30 , strike price £ 6.00
In these cases , there is only a small potential profit with extremely large , even unlimited , potential losses .
Buying and selling options in isolation is a risky business ( similar to forward transactions ) ; in particular , writing options can be very speculative due to the potentially unlimited nature of the loss .
So much for the risky stuff .
What about hedging with options ?
If I own 100 BP shares they are currently worth £ 600 .
I hope that they will go up in value but I also worry that they will fall drastically .
I can buy a put option with a strike price of £ 6.00 allowing me to sell 100 shares in three months time .
For the price of the put option ( £ 30 in my example ) I can ' insure ' against falls in the share price , but still offer the potential for profit from good performance .
Figure 6 illustrates the point .
The combination of shares and option will put a floor on my portfolio value of £ 570 .
This is a little like insurance in concept : I pay a small premium to someone who will cover any large losses should they occur .
The premium will represent the expected value of these losses plus a small profit .
Figure 6 . Hedging of Downside Risk
I may feel that £ 30 is a lot to pay to give me this level of protection and that actually I am prepared to take some risk in my investments .
I could for instance buy a put option with a strike price of £ 5.00 and accept a maximum loss of £ 100 ( plus the price of the put option ) .
This may reduce the cost of the put option to £ 0.05 per share or £ 5 .
This is a powerful yet simple hedging strategy used extensively by companies in the UK to insure against large losses on their balance sheets .
Exotic options
There is an almost unlimited variation in the types of derivatives available .
Many of these are innovations in the underlying asset or variable .
Credit derivatives depend on the credit worthiness of a company .
Weather derivatives have payoffs depending on the average temperature at particular locations .
Ski resorts may use them to protect against high temperatures affecting income because of lack of snow .
Insurance derivatives have payoffs dependent on the amount of insurance claims .
A general insurance company might use them as protection against catastrophic claims due to storms .
Electricity derivatives have payoffs dependent on the price of electricity .
These might be used by companies who use a lot of electricity in order to protect profits from extreme movements in electricity prices .
Often there are innovations in the measurement of the price of the underlying asset on exercise , such as the average over the last month or the lowest or highest level over the last month .
Alternatively the payoff profiles can be made extremely complicated - although these are usually based on combinations of the basic building blocks of forwards and options .
And finally ...
Derivatives can be risky when used in isolation to speculate on the performance of underlying assets in the future .
Equally , though , derivatives offer a flexible and efficient method of reducing risk when used in connection with the underlying assets .
Effectively , they can be used as insurance against losses .

Why we should legalize drugs by Benson B. Roe , MD Benson Roe is Professor Emeritus and former Chair of Cardiothoracic Surgery at the University of California at San Francisco .
And " poison " is also a misleading shibboleth .
The widespread propaganda that illegal drugs are " deadly poisons " is a hoax .
There is little or no medical evidence of long term ill effects from sustained , moderate consumption of uncontaminated marijuana , cocaine or heroin .
If these substances - most of them have been consumed in large quantities for centuries - were responsible for any chronic , progressive or disabling diseases , they certainly would have shown up in clinical practice and / or on the autopsy table .
But they simply have not !
More than 20 years ago when I was removing destroyed heart valves from infected intravenous drug abusers I assumed that these seriously ill patients represented just the tip of the iceberg of narcotic abuse .
In an effort to ascertain what proportion of serious or fatal drug - related disease this group represented , I sought information from the San Francisco Coroner .
To my surprise he reported that infections from contaminated intravenous injections were the only cause of drug - related deaths he saw except for occasional deaths from overdoses .
He confirmed the inference that clean , reasonable dosages of heroin , cocaine and marijuana are pathologically harmless .
He asserted he had never seen a heroin user over the age of 50 .
My obvious conclusion was that they had died from their .
habit but he was confident that they had simply tired of the drug and just quit .
When asked if the same were basically true of marijuana and cocaine , he responded affirmatively .
That caused me to wonder why these substances had been made illegal .
It is frequently stated that illicit drugs are " bad , dangerous , destructive " or " addictive , " and that society has an obligation to keep them from the public .
But nowhere can be found reliable , objective scientific evidence that they are any more harmful than other substances and activities that are legal .
In view of the enormous expense , the carnage and the obvious futility of the " drug war , " resulting in massive criminalization of society , it is high time to examine the supposed justification for keeping certain substances illegal .
Those who initiated those prohibitions and those who now so vigorously seek to enforce them have not made their objectives clear .
Are they to protect us from evil , from addiction , or from poison ?
The concept of evil is derived from subjective values and is difficult to define .
just why certain ( illegal ) substances are singularly more evil than legal substances like alcohol has not been explained .
This complex subject of " right " and " wrong " has never been successfully addressed by legislation and is best left to the pulpit .
Addiction is also a relative and ubiquitous phenomenon .
It certainly cannot be applied only to a short arbitrary list of addictive substances while ignoring .
a plethora of human cravings - from chocolate to coffee , from gum to gambling , from tea , to tobacco , from snuggling to sex .
Compulsive urges to fulfill a perceived need are ubiquitous .
Some people are more susceptible to addiction than others and some " needs " are more addictive than others .
Probably the most addictive substance in our civilization is tobacco - yet no one has suggested making it illegal .
As for prohibition , it has been clearly demonstrated that when an addictive desire becomes inaccessible it provokes irresponsible behavior to fulfill that desire .
Education and support at least have a chance of controlling addiction .
Deprivation only sharpens the craving and never works .
Even in prison addicts are able to get their `fix . '
And " poison " is also a misleading shibboleth .
The widespread propaganda that illegal drugs are " deadly poisons " is a hoax .
There is little or no medical evidence of long term ill effects from sustained , moderate consumption of uncontaminated marijuana , cocaine or heroin .
If these substances - most of them have been consumed in large quantities for centuries - were responsible for any chronic , progressive or disabling diseases , they certainly would have shown up in clinical practice and / or on the autopsy table .
But they simply have not !
Media focus on the " junkie " has generated a mistaken impression that all uses of illegal drugs are devastated by their habit .
Simple arithmetic demonstrates that the small population of visible addicts must constitute only a fraction of the $ 150 billion per year illegal drug market .
This industry is so huge that it necessarily encompasses a very large portion of the ordinary population who are typically employed , productive , responsible and not significantly impaired from leading conventional lives .
These drug users are not " addicts " just as the vast majority of alcohol users are not " alcoholics . "
Is it not a ridiculous paradox to have laws to protect us from relatively harmless substances and not from the devastating effects of other substances that happen to be legal ?
It is well known that tobacco causes nearly a million deaths annually ( in the US alone ) from cancer , cardiovascular disease and emphysema ; more than 350,000 die from alcohol - related cirrhosis and its complications and caffeine is the cause of cardiac and nervous system disturbances .
These facts suggest that the public is being fraudulently misled into fearing the wrong substances and into complacency about hazardous substances by allowing their sale and even subsidization .
Our environment contains a plethora of hazards , of which recreational substances are much less important than many others .
Recognizing the reality of consumer demand and the perspective of relative harm should make a strong case for alternatives to prohibition .
Should we not have teamed from the failure of the Volstead Act of the 1920s and the current ubiquitous availability of illegal drugs that prohibition is the height of futility ?
Is it not time to recognize that the " problem " is not the drugs but the enormous amounts of untaxed money diverted from the economy to criminals ?
The economic incentive for drug dealers to merchandise their product aggressively is a multi-billion dollar return which has a far more powerful effect to increase substance abuse than any enforcement program can possibly do to , constrain that usage .
The hopeless challenge of drug crime is compounded by the parallel expansion of theft , crime , which is the principal economic resource to finance the drug industry .
How can this be anything but a lose - lose situation for society ?
We should look at the fact that a relatively low budget public education campaign has resulted in a significant decline in US consumption of both alcohol and tobacco during a period when a costly and intensive campaign to curtail illegal drugs only resulted in their increased usage .
Is there a lesson to be heeded ?
Of course there is .
Scrap the nonsense of trying to obliterate drugs and acknowledge their presence in our society as we have with alcohol and tobacco .
Legalization would result in : purity assurance under Food and Drug Administration regulation ; labeled concentration of the product ( to avoid overdose ) ; obliteration of vigorous marketing ( " pushers " ) ; obliteration of drug crime and reduction of theft crime savings in expensive enforcement and significant tax revenues .
Effort and funds can then be directed to educating the public about the hazards of all drugs .
Can such a change of attitude happen ?
Probably not , because the huge illegal drug industry has mountains of money for a media blitz and for buying politicians to sing the songs of " evil " and " danger " which is certain to kill any legislative attempt at legalization .
Perhaps it will take some time before reality can prevail , but meanwhile we should at least do more to expose deception and to disseminate the truth .
do n’t succumb to Israeli pressure Spain : do n’t succumb to Israeli pressure
By Khalid Amayreh in Occupied Jerusalem
The Israeli government has been quietly pressing ( and pressuring ) Spain to reconsider issuing warrants for the arrest of high - ranking Israeli army officers accused of committing war crimes in the occupied Palestinian territories .
Earlier this year , a lawsuit was filed at the National court of Spain with the aim of issuing an arrest warrant against seven Israeli military officials .
The seven included former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon , former Defense Minister Benyamin Benalizer , former Shin Beth Chief Avi Dichter , former Chief of Staff Moshe Ya’alon , former Air Force Commander Dan Halutz , Operation Branch Commander Giora Eiland and Southern Command Chief Doron Almog .
The Palestinian Center for Human Rights ( PCHR ) , which filed the lawsuit , urged the Spanish Judicial authorities to issue an international arrest warrant against the seven in connection with their role in the bombing of an apartment building in Gaza on 22 July , 2002 , in which a Hamas chief was killed along with his family and 15 other civilians , including 11 children .
The National Court of Spain has accepted the case for further examination , the first step towards launching a formal prosecution .
If the case is successful , those charged would be arrested upon entering Spanish territory and stripped of the diplomatic immunity some of them currently enjoy .
According to Israeli media sources , Tzipi Livni , now acting Foreign Minister who is also slated to become Prime Minister , has asked Spain ’s Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos to use his influence to deactivate legal considerations that would enable the Spanish Justice system to “ hound ” visiting Israeli officials accused of committing war crimes .
Well , Spain is well - advised to refuse to succumb to Israeli pressure in this regard .
The reasons for that are many :
First , this is not a political issue ; it is first and foremost a legal and moral issue involving the premeditated murder of innocent people .
We are talking about hundreds , even thousands , of innocent men , women and children killed knowingly and deliberately by the Israeli army which acted on direct instructions and orders from the likes of Ya’alon , Halutz and Benalizer .
Comprehensive records containing full details of these crimes are readily available as they have been meticulously documented by human rights groups operating in Palestine .
The helpless , unwept victims owe it to the conscience of humanity to make the accused stand trial for their crimes .
If they are found not guilty , they will be set free ; but if they are found guilty , they should be made to pay for their crimes .
Hence , Spain must uphold the moral authority of its justice system and see to it that alleged Israeli war criminals setting foot on Spanish soil are treated no better and no worse than any other criminals .
Criminals are criminals regardless of their ethnic background or religious affiliation .
And it should n’t matter if the suspects are citizens of a powerful or a powerless state .
Second , there is a large mass of evidence that would indict these alleged war criminals .
Ariel Sharon is undoubtedly a certified war criminal .
He lived all his life as a war criminal .
He was a war criminal as a soldier , as Platoon commander , as a Defense Minister and as a Prime Minister .
Sharon had ordered the mass murder of hundreds of Egyptian Prisoners of War .
However , his role in the genocidal massacres of Sabra and Shatilla near Beirut in September , 1982 , accorded him the status of a war criminal par excellance .
But he does n’t have to stand trial now , if only because he , now in a vegetative stage for the third consecutive year , is being punished sufficiently by God .
As to Benalizer , this man too is a war criminal for ordering murderous operations that caused the death of numerous innocent people including children .
In 2001 , Benalizer boasted about killing so many Palestinians without drawing negative reactions from the world community .
“ The world is now preoccupied with the events in America ( 9/11 ) .
This means that we can behave as we see fit with the Palestinians , ” he said gleefully .
In addition , Benalizer okayed the bombing of an apartment building at Hay - al - Daraj in downtown Gaza more than six years ago .
Then an Israeli warplane dropped a 2000 ib. bomb on the house of Sheikh Salah Shehadeh , a commander of Hamas military wing .
The bombing killed fifteen civilians , along with Shehadeh , the majority of them young children .
Israeli officials involved in that monstrous crime also included Ya’alon , then chief of staff of the Israeli army , who knew that Shehadeh ’s wife and daughters were close to him during the bombing . ”
This is the same Ya’alon who several months later called Israel ’s Palestinian victims “ a cancer , ” saying that “ now I will be content with chemotherapy ” and implying that “ if the chemotherapy did n’t work , ” then He would have to adopt the Hitlerian therapy .
As to Halutz , the Israeli air - force commander in 2002 , he too boasted about the Hay - al - Daraj carnage .
A reporter asked him what he felt when he dropped the bomb , Halutz retorted that he felt a small movement under his seat when the bomb fell .
In a separate interview , he said he had no compunctions or guilty feelings knowing that innocent children were killed .
“ I sleep well at night , I have a clear conscience . ”
In their hearts , Israeli officials and Israelis in general realize that most of their actions in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and also in Lebanon can be classified as war crimes .
Some Israeli spokespersons try to prevaricate and create confusion by claiming that Israeli soldiers kill innocent Palestinians knowingly but not deliberately .
Well , what is the difference between killing knowingly and killing deliberately .
Even the Nazis did n’t have the Chutzpah to make such a claim .
Besides , when the number of innocent victims is so vast , as in Gaza , even intent becomes irrelevant .
It is for these reasons that the Spanish authorities must not allow the integrity of the Spanish justice system to be compromised by diplomatic pressure exerted by Israel ’s supremacist leaders who harbor the racist belief that what applies to the rest of humanity does n’t apply to Jews .
To be sure , no one is suggesting that Spain play the role of world judge or world policeman .
However , Spain is a sovereign state and has the right to bar suspected war criminals from entering its territory .
This is the least civilized countries can do to discourage and prevent the recurrence of more war crimes and crimes against humanity .
On May 7th city of Vallejo , California voted to declare Chapter 9 bankruptcy .
Tyrone , Georgia could be next .
The Citizen is reporting Tyrone finance director : " We ’re broke "
The Tyrone Town Council got a huge dose of reality Thursday night .
“ We ’re broke , ” said Finance Director Mary Sturm .
Sturm said the city ’s operating costs per month are $ 275,000 per month , but the town has only collected $ 53,000 in revenue this month .
The economic climate has taken its toll on the town , with only two building permits this month , she added .
The town currently has a Certificate of Deposit valued at $ 794,000 that earns just over 4 percent interest .
Sturm recommended cashing in the CD , and invest in another CD when tax money starts rolling in at the end of the year .
“ We only have 7,000 residents and we ’re providing services that towns such as Peachtree City with a population of 40,000 provide , ” she added .
The town reluctantly agreed to cash in the CD , but Councilman Tracey Young wants to make sure this does not happen again .

The Pakistani rupee has fallen to record lows against the dollar The International Monetary Fund says Pakistan has asked it to help deal with its looming balance of payments crisis .
Talks on plans to strengthen Pakistan 's economic stability would begin in the next few days , an IMF statement said .
It said Pakistan 's difficulties were " a result of high food and fuel prices and the global financial crisis " .
The scale of financing had yet to be determined .
Pakistani officials had said they would only ask the IMF for money if other options failed .
Pakistan is going through its worst economic crisis in a decade , with massive trade and budget deficits , plunging foreign currency reserves and capital flight .
The growing strength of Islamic militants , demonstrated by a devastating attack on the Marriott hotel in Islamabad last month , is deterring many investors .
Its traditional allies , China and Saudi Arabia , have so far refused its request for help .
The BBC's Barbara Plett in Islamabad says an IMF programme to stop Pakistan defaulting on its debt obligations would be politically unpopular because of the strict conditions attached .
Emergency mechanism " The Pakistani authorities have requested discussions with the IMF on an economic programme supported by financial assistance from the fund to meet the balance of payments difficulties the country is experiencing , " IMF managing director Dominique Strauss - Kahn said in a statement .
" The amount of fund financing under a stand - by arrangement has yet to be determined .
Financing could be made within framework of the fund 's emergency financing mechanism . "
There was no immediate response from Pakistani officials .
Although the Pakistani economy has recorded some quite robust growth in recent years , foreign exchange reserves have dropped by three quarters in the last year and it is believed there are sufficient funds for just a few weeks of imports .
On Tuesday , Shaukat Tarin , adviser to the Pakistani prime minister on economic affairs , said the country needed $ 10 bn - $ 15 bn of support from foreign lenders to avert a balance of payments crisis .
Officials believe that a " positive signal " from the IMF may encourage international financial institutions and others to release funds which are already in the pipeline .
But is unclear whether this money will be available over the next month to stop Pakistan defaulting .
The country also needs up to $ 3bn within a month to avoid defaulting on loans .
Stability fears
In addition to strains on the country 's foreign currency reserves there is a deficit in its trade with the rest of the world , approaching 9 % of national income this year .
A balance of payments crisis is a possibility , analysts say , which would result in importers struggling to pay for foreign goods , including oil imports from the Middle East .
Soaring inflation and chronic power outages are also affecting the country .
Observers say the economic crisis adds a new element of uncertainty to a country whose stability is of growing concern to the United States and its Western allies .

Understanding your customers and visitors using analytics
To get articles like this free in your inbox , subscribe to our newsletter ( the link opens in an overlay ) .
This is one of a series of articles .
In the first part of the series , we explain why these techniques are the most reliable way to grow hugely any business .
The first part also contains an infographic that summarizes the whole series .
( None of the links on our website are affiliate links .
We ’re vendor neutral , and we do n’t profit from recommending technology . )
Web analytics software is essential for conversion — but it only provides a small fraction of the picture .
Web analytics software gives you details about the visitors to your website — where they came from , and which links they clicked on once they arrived .
It ’s essential for conversion rate optimization ( CRO ) , but it tells only a small part of the story .
It ’s like the closed - circuit TV cameras in a supermarket .
They give an aerial view of where visitors entered the store , but they do n’t reveal why the visitors came .
They show the path that visitors took through the store , but they do n’t reveal what the visitors were thinking .
They show you exactly where and when the visitors left the store , but not why .
Or what to do about it .
For that , you ’ll need the qualitative tools , which begin with Technique 5 .
You ’ll find web analytics most useful in the early stages of a project , when you are seeking to identify on which pages to start work .
It will also inform the pages on which you should implement the tools described in the rest of this series of articles .
If a page gets no visitors , then changing it will have no effect .
Nor will changing a page that already has 100 % conversion rate .
Web analytics software will help you to identify the arteries of the website — the high - traffic flows that lead to successful conversions .
Along with other tools , it can also help you to spot the aspects of those flows that are currently underperforming .
Despite being free , Google Analytics is a sophisticated and powerful web analytics suite .
It is sufficient for most websites , and most of our clients use it or its enterprise equivalent , Google Analytics 360 .
Google Analytics alternatives include Adobe Analytics , Webtrends , Quantcast Measure , Woopra , Piwik and Flurry Analytics specializes in mobile apps .
Kissmetrics and Mixpanel provide additional functionality that can be useful to conversion marketers .
Cohort reports , for example , show how groups of visitors behave over a long period .
Amplitude helps marketers to understand how users behave within a website or app .
Technique 2 : Capturing easy - to - interpret click - maps ( to see exactly where visitors clicked — even if it was n’t on a link )
Whereas web analytics software tells you what links your visitors click on , click - mapping software shows you which parts of your pages your visitors click on .
There ’s a subtle difference : click - mapping software shows you clicks even if they were n’t on a link .
This information is displayed as a “ heat map , ” like this :
Crazy Egg ‘s confetti map shows exactly where visitors clicked — even if it was n’t on a link .
Click - mapping offers several advantages :
It will reveal things that are getting clicked but are not clickable .
You ’ll discover that visitors are clicking on parts of the page that are n’t links but perhaps should be .
For example , if you discover visitors are clicking on a product photo , you may choose to allow the picture to be magnified , or you may decide readers want to read more information about it .
Similarly , they may wrongly believe that a particular graphic is navigation .
It will also reveal , at a glance , which parts of the page are getting the most attention .
This can be particularly useful when you ’re showing the data to people who are n’t experienced in web analytics .
If several of the links on your page lead to the same URL — for example , if there are three links to a particular product page — click - mapping will show you which of the links your visitors clicked on .
This is technically possible with analytics , but requires some set - up .
Have you ever wondered how far visitors scroll down your pages ?
Many click - mapping tools can give you the answer , in the form of easy - to - interpret scroll - maps .
If some of your pages are long , scroll - maps can reveal which parts of the page get the most attention ( based on the average viewing time ) .
This can be great for identifying which parts of your page are most important to your visitors .
If one of your pages has a “ false bottom ” — a gap in the design that appears to visitors to be the bottom of the page — then a scroll - map will reveal that visitors are n’t scrolling .
( You then need to work out whether that ’s because they did n’t realize that the page could be scrolled , or because they were n’t interested enough to scroll . )
We recommend you study click - mapping reports of your most important pages ( in terms of revenue and traffic ) and of any pages you feel may have usability issues .
Of course , most heat maps show many things that are predictable , but that ’s not why you should use heat maps .
Ignore the predictable heat and look for the anomalies .
We often use Crazy Egg ( mobile - friendly ) , Hotjar ( mobile - friendly ) , ClickTale ( mobile - friendly ) and several A /B - testing tools that include similar functionality .
Other alternatives include Fullstory , Inspectlet , Decibel Insight ( mobile - friendly ) , Jaco , Lucky Orange , MouseStats , Ptengine , UsabilityTools , UserTrack , and Zeerat .
Hotjar ’s session recordings allow you to see how your visitors struggled their way through your website .
Web analytics software is concerned mostly with the movement of visitors between pages .
Session - recording tools can be a great complement , revealing what visitors did on each page , by capturing each visitor ’s keystrokes and mouse movement .
Session - recording tools can be useful in the following ways :
Session replay : Watch movies of your visitors ’ screens as they use your website .
You can view visitors ’ browsing sessions as videos , as if you were looking over their shoulders .
You can choose which video to watch based on attributes such as the visitor ’s country of origin , how much time they spend on the site , or the number of pages they visited .
You may choose to watch videos of visitors who appear to be struggling — for example , those who visit the same page several times .
Get a feel for how people use websites .
Session - recording tools are not a substitute for carrying out user - tests , which are described farther down this page .
However , watching a few videos will give you a better idea of how people interact with websites .
See errors .
The software can display a report of errors that users have encountered .
Analyze funnels .
Get to see where your visitors are dropping off .
ClickTale , in particular , makes it easy to study funnels for opportunities .
Scroll maps reveal how far down your page visitors scrolled .
ClickTale ( mobile - friendly ) pioneered session - recording software .
Alternatives include Hotjar ( mobile - friendly ) , Inspectlet , UsabilityTools , UserReplay , SessionCam , FullStory , Decibel Insight ( mobile - friendly ) , and Mouseflow .
( Each tool tends to have multiple functions , so our choice of tool often depends on the combination of features and functions that a particular client requires .
Also , some of our clients already have a tool installed when we begin the project . )
Some companies — such as those in financial services — are regulated as to how their data must be stored .
ClickTale offers an enterprise version for such cases .
IBM TeaLeaf is another popular alternative for enterprises .
Decibel Insight offers on - premises deployment , so you can store data in your own environment and have complete control .
Technique 4 : Using form - analytics software ( to identify which of your form fields are causing trouble )
If you have forms , you need form - analytics software .
( Image credit . )
Form - analytics software allows you to study how people are interacting with your forms .
The software is extremely important , because visitors who interact with forms are very likely to convert .
By finding out why they bail , you can unlock great profits .
The software can report on many issues , including the following :
The overall success of the form : how many visitors landed on it , and what percentage of them interacted with it , tried to submit it , and successfully submitted it .
of the form : how many visitors landed on it , and what percentage of them interacted with it , tried to submit it , and successfully submitted it .
The percentage of visitors who dropped out at each form field .
Knowing this information allows you to fix — or remove — the form fields that are causing visitors to lose their patience and abandon your website .

The amount of time that visitors spend on each field .

Such fields reduce a visitor ’s resolve to complete the form .

Options include ClickTale ( mobile - friendly ) , Hotjar ( mobile - friendly ) , Formisimo , Decibel Insight ( mobile - friendly ) , SessionCam and Inspectlet .
Technique 5 : Using live chat ( to let your visitors tell you what ’s wrong with your pages )
Live chat software helps for many reasons : to convert visitors , see their objections , and test your counter - objections .
( Image credit . )
Live chat can allow you to hear from visitors who would n’t phone you .
Such visitors might prefer live chat for some of the following reasons :
They are in a public place ( or at work ) and do n’t want to be heard .
They appreciate that , unlike phone calls , live chat does n’t cost money .
They do n’t want to be stuck at the end of a phone waiting for someone to answer .
They feel that a live chat session is less of a commitment than a phone call .
Live chat can reveal the following :
Which pages are giving people problems .
Which products people are asking questions about .
What visitors ’ main questions , concerns , and objections are .
Which of your answers , reassurances , and counter - objections persuade visitors to take further action .
Live chat can have two additional benefits :
If your customer service team is providing your live chat , you may choose to read through the transcripts of the chats regularly to find insights you can apply to your website .
If the customer service team uses canned responses , then study them .
They can be pure , field - tested copywriting gold — provided they have been refined over time to be the best responses .
Using live chat may increase your conversion rate , by personally helping the visitors to take action .
Live chat solutions we come across often
ZenDesk Chat , LiveChat , Drift , FreshDesk , Olark , LivePerson , HappyFox , SnapEngage , LiveAgent , Intercom ( for web apps ) , and Comm100 .
Some of them , like Intercom , allow you to track , help , and convert visitors across multiple browsing sessions .
Technique 6 : Using cobrowsing ( so your visitors can share their screens with you )
Cobrowsing software allows your visitors to share their screens with a customer support person .
Cobrowsing tends to be particularly useful when you struggle to work out what your visitors are seeing — for example , if the visitor is looking at a dynamically generated page , like a page of search results or an interface in a web app .
Solutions for cobrowsing include Pega , Oracle Service Cloud and Surfly .
Cobrowsing allows you to help your customers — as illustrated metaphorically in this creepy image from Surfly .

The McCain / Palin ticket recently learned the hard way that bad DMCA takedown requests can inhibit legitimate speech after having numerous YouTube campaign videos flagged by rightsholders for incorporating copyrighted music and video clips .
The campaign contends that most of these were obvious fair use , and it wants YouTube to stop processing DMCA takedown requests in cases where YouTube decides that fair use applies .
Because doing this requires highly - trained humans , the campaign recognizes that there 's a problem of scale .
Its answer ?
YouTube should only do this for US political campaign videos .
Not surprisingly , YouTube wants no part of this " solution . "
In a letter to the campaign yesterday , YouTube Chief Counsel Zahavah Levine made two key points .
The first was that having YouTube determine " fair use " claims is difficult and risky for the site .
As Levine notes , " Lawyers and judges constantly disagree about what does and does not constitute fair use .
No number of lawyers could possibly determine with a reasonable level of certainty whether all the videos for which we receive disputed takedown notices qualify as fair use . "
Some cases will be easy , but many wo n't , and YouTube could risk its " safe harbor " if it does not comply with takedown notices that are later found to be valid .
The company is certainly not going to put itself in this situation , especially when it involves huge amounts of extra work at lawyers ' prices .
While the McCain campaign suggests that this really wo n't take much time , and hey , even if it does , it 's " worth the small amount of additional legal work our proposal would require , " YouTube thinks that this all smells a lot like favoritism .
Why would a global brand go to this trouble for US presidential campaigns but not for those in other countries ?
Etc .
As Levine puts it , " We try to be careful not to favor one category of content on our site over others , and to treat all of our users fairly , regardless of whether they are an individual , a large corporation , or a candidate for public office . "
The other ( major ) issue here is that YouTube can't make accurate fair use decisions anyway , since it does n't know most of the key facts about the cases at issue .
For instance , YouTube does n't know if the DMCA takedown issuer truly does control the rights claimed , and it does n't know if the uploader had a contract to use the clips in question .
" When two parties disagree , " writes Levine , " we are simply not in a position to verify the veracity of either party 's claims . "
In the end , the real problem is bigger than takedown notices directed at political campaigns ; " the real problem here is individuals and entities that abuse the DMCA takedown process . "
And YouTube hopes to work with whatever candidate ends up in the White House to combat DMCA abuse ... in part by strengthening fair use .
There 's a proposal that sounds like change we can believe in .
WHAT REAL CUSTOMERS ARE SAYING
" I have been looking for a large safe for about 3 months .
I needed something large enough to store a backup hard drive for sensitive patient electronic records , the company laptops when out of town , controlled substance meds , weapons , cash , important documents and jewelry .
Needed protection from theft as well as fire , etc. Started with a Cannon " Executive Vault " [ aka " gun safe ' ] from Costco , and because it came damaged , ( quite accidentally ) I realized how much a WORTHLESS PIECE OF JUNK it was , and the absolutely FALSE SENSE OF SECURYTY it gave .
Started looking at Liberty , Fort Knox , and the sub $ 7500 AMSEC safes and found out that they may have been built a bit better , but were essentially glorified filing cabinets !!
Look up the UL RSC spec , watch some YouTube videos and understand these things wo n't keep out a 120 pound crack head with a splitting maul for more than 2 - 3 minutes !
So ... I quickly realized I needed at least a REAL SAFE with a REAL UL rating , like the TL - 30x6 .
Enter a Google search and my first call to 800-345-6552 .
The sales representative is VERY knowledgeable , talked me through my needs and offered a few different solutions from his inventory .
He did n't do the Liberty and Fort Knox dealer " hard sell " by a dropout of used car salesman school that I experienced locally . "

After 8 years of Bush Cheney , Iraq , busted Healthcare , an inneffectual response to Katrina ( not to mention global warming ) , the housing bubble burst and now , the coup de grace , an economic meltdown … the carefree Wassup boys of 2000 are back .
This might be one of the best , and last videos of the 2008 election season .
Wassssuuuuupppppp !
Change ?
True , true .
First , watch the original :
( Reuters ) - U.S. presidential debates are often as much about body language and aesthetics as they are about issues and substance .
White House hopefuls Barack Obama and John McCain went back and forth in Tuesday ’s debate , often pointing at each other in accusatory fashion while walking around the debate space , speaking directly to the assembled audience .
Both candidates chafed at the rules of the debate , which their campaigns had jointly agreed , and agreed partway through to loosen the format and allow further rebuttals .
McCain , a Republican senator from Arizona , and Obama , a Democratic senator from Illinois , hugged at the end of their debate .
Below are other examples of body language exhibited by both candidates on Tuesday :
MCCAIN
- The Arizona senator , who avoided looking at his opponent in their first debate , directly addressed Obama and referred to him as “ that one ” at one point when describing the Illinois senator ’s vote for an energy bill that McCain opposed .
- McCain sometimes came too close to audience members , a few of whom appeared uncomfortable by his distance .
He defused that later , patting the back of one questioner , who shook the senator ’s hand .
- McCain smiled broadly at many times during his exchange with Obama and lowered his voice to a partial whisper for emphasis on some issues .
He did not always know where to stand when Obama was speaking , settling at one point on a position of leaning with one hand against the high chair .
OBAMA
- The Illinois senator , who referred repeatedly to his opponent as “ John ” during the first debate , called him “ Senator McCain ” throughout most of Tuesday ’s exchange .
- Obama waited patiently during McCain ’s attacks , comfortably perched on the stool - like chair , often smiling in seeming wonderment about what he was hearing from his opponent .
- Obama at times appeared irritated and occasionally paused or sighed before giving his answer .
He was less inclined to make jokes than McCain , whose own attempts at humor sometimes worked and sometimes did n’t .
Tiffany King has made progress .
When the 5 - foot - tall 12 - year - old arrived at Camp Pocono Trails in June , she weighed 354 pounds .
By Sunday ’s weigh - in at the weight loss camp , she had lost 37 pounds .
She hopes to get down to 304 by the time camp ends next week .
Whether she does or not , Tiffany is already one of the lucky few .
Her family could not have afforded camp if Tiffany had not won a scholarship essay contest .
There are nine million overweight or obese children in the United States .
And although the prevalence of childhood obesity has tripled since 1980 , there are few comprehensive or affordable programs to treat them .
Summer weight loss camps are usually profit - making and can cost more than $ 1,000 a week .
Most insurance does not cover that cost .
For Dr. Walter J. Pories , a well - known gastric bypass surgeon , the dearth of government and insurance financing for such comprehensive weight - loss programs is “ the single most frustrating problem in dealing with childhood obesity . ”
Christina Benson , Tiffany ’s mother , knows all too well that insurance coverage is spotty .
She works for a health insurance program in Durham , N.C. “ I work in the health care industry and I think it is really a disgrace , a disadvantage to our members , that we cannot offer this kind of program under reimbursement , ” Ms. Benson , a widow since Tiffany ’s father died , said .

A jeering crowd taunted a suicidal teenager as he threatened to jump from the top of a city - centre car park .
In a shocking indictment of modern Britain , youths who gathered in the street below yelled at 17 - year - old Shaun Dykes to kill himself over the course of three hours .
One allegedly shouted : ' How far can you bounce ? '
Troubled : Shaun Dykes , 17 , plunged to his death from a car park as a crowd of onlookers urged him to jump
The A - level student eventually plunged 60ft to his death after police negotiators tried in vain to talk him down .
In a final sickening act , some of those responsible for the abuse outside the Westfield shopping centre in Derby rushed from behind the police cordon to take pictures of the teenager 's body on their mobile phones .
Yesterday police branded the mob's behaviour at the scene of Saturday 's tragedy a ' shocking reflection on society ' .
Horrifying end : Friends describe Shaun as funny and popular
Superintendent Andy Hough , of Derbyshire police , said he was ' disturbed ' by some of the comments aimed at the teenager , who is believed to have suffered from depression and also to have been upset at the breakdown of a relationship .
People were at the police cordon shouting for the man to jump , ' Superintendent Hough said .
' I find it a disturbing and shocking reflection on society when people feel inclined to do that .
' Negotiators were working with the man threatening to jump and it was their job to talk to him in the hope of changing his mind .
' We really need the public to work with us , not against us .
It was a very disappointing situation . '
Shaun , from Kilburn , near Derby , had climbed over a railing on the top floor of the car park , which is above the busy shopping mall .
Police cordoned off the pavement on the car park side , but pedestrians were still able to walk down the opposite pavement , and crowds formed .
A shopkeeper who witnessed the incident said groups of youths were responsible for shouting at Shaun as he was sitting on the edge of the roof .
' Quite a few people were hanging around watching what was happening and the police were telling them to move on , ' he said .
' Most just stopped for a few minutes and then left .
' But there were some people shouting things like " Jump " and " Get on with it ! "
They were teenagers with nothing better to do who seemed to think it was funny .
Death plunge :
The Westfield shopping centre multi-storey car park in Derby from which Shaun fell
' When he fell , lots of people were screaming and crying but there were several groups of youths who ran from behind the cordon and looked like they were taking pictures with their mobile phones .
' I found that sickening - why would anyone want to take pictures of something like that ?'
The Mayor of Derby , Councillor Barbara Jackson , called on the those responsible for goading Shaun to ' learn some respect ' , while the Bishop of Derby , the Rt Rev Dr Alastair Redfern , said he was ' horrified ' .
Mike Shewan , chief executive of Derbyshire Mental Health Services NHS
Trust , said : ' We can't condemn this sort of behaviour strongly enough .
' No one knows what was going on in his head , but encouraging him to jump is so wrong .
It is hindering the police and the people who care from doing their job . '
Yesterday Shaun 's parents , who are separated , were too distraught to talk about their only child .
His mother , Joy , lives with partner Kevin Lacey in Kilburn .
He said Shaun would be ' so sadly missed ' .
Flowers and tributes were left at the spot where he died .
Tribute : Friends and family have left flowers and cards at the tragic scene
Lindsey Reid , 17 , Shaun 's best friend , said : ' He was the joker and smiled all the time .
He was so funny and everyone knew him because he was so popular . '
On his MySpace web page , the teenager said he hoped to work in accounting , and that he wanted to die ' quietly ' when the time came .
The former John Flamsteed School pupil was studying at the Heanor Gate Science College , in Heanor , Derbyshire .
Heanor Gate head teacher Rob Howard said some students who had witnessed the tragedy were being offered counselling .
He added : ' At least one of our students also witnessed the shocking encouragement of Shaun to jump and was both horrified and angry .
' I sometimes wonder what value some people put on human life . '
Mr Howard said Shaun had ' personal issues ' out of school .
Derbyshire police referred Shaun 's death to the Independent Police Complaints Commission , which has decided not to investigate .
Officers will carry out their own inquiry and an inquest will be held later .
A force spokesman said : ' A small minority of onlookers - mainly other youths - were the ones shouting the abuse .
It is a very sad state of affairs . '
He had no knowledge of anybody taking pictures of Shaun after he fell and said the cordon was designed to restrict access to the street , whilst ' minimising disruption for shoppers ' .
Nobody was likely to be arrested as a result of the abuse directed at Shaun , he added .

A fire that broke out late Saturday inside a nightclub near the Hong Kong border caused a stampede of panicked partygoers trying to escape killing at least 43 people , and leaving more than 88 injured .
What caused the inferno is said to be fireworks which were a part of a show featured inside the nightclub .

A fire caused by fireworks set off inside a nightclub and a stampede of panicked partygoers trying to escape has killed at least 43 people in southern China , state media and government officials said Sunday .
The fire , which broke out late Saturday , also injured at least 88 people , an official with the Shenzhen Work Safety Bureau said .
Like many Chinese officials , the man refused to give his name .
Shenzhen is just over the border with Hong Kong in Guangdong province .
Anzeige
The official Xinhua News Agency said the fire broke out in a club called King of the Dancers while hundreds of people were watching a show .
An initial police investigation showed that the blaze was triggered by fireworks ignited during the show , Xinhua said .
Many partygoers were hurt in a stampede to escape down " a narrow aisle , “ a club staff member was quoted by the agency as saying .
Anzeige
" I saw people rushing out ... and all the lights were off , “ it quoted Yang Zhi as saying .
Xinhua said Yang suffered burns to his neck .
Video footage aired Sunday by Hong Kong ’s ATV news showed the smoke - filled nightclub after the fire .
Overturned tables , broken glass and shoes lost by partygoers littered the floor .
Guangdong Province Governor Huang Huahua blamed poor ventilation for the deaths .
Anzeige
" There was something wrong with the architectural design , “ Huang told Hong Kong media after inspecting the nightclub .
" If there was a better ventilation system , there would n’t be so many deaths in the fire , “ he said .
ATV said the nightclub had no windows and only one exit .
Hong Kong ’s government - run broadcaster RTHK reported that Shenzhen authorities had detained 12 people after the fire .
An injured Hong Kong man surnamed Cheng said the fire started after one performer on the stage set off fireworks .
" I saw one of the performers shoot fireworks to the ceiling .
I had no idea what the performance was , but the fire started , “ Cheng told ATV from his Shenzhen hospital bed .
" Many people fell to the floor .
They shouted for help and cried .
It was like in hell , “ said Cheng , whose first name was not given .
Anzeige
Fires and accidents in bars , theaters and other public places are common in China despite government pledges to improve safety .
Many are caused by negligence and lax safety procedures , such as a lack of fire extinguishers and emergency exits .
In China ’s worst recent nightclub disaster , a fire blamed on a welding accident tore through a disco in the central city of Luoyang in December 2000 , killing 309 people .

Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh has said the security forces have arrested a group of alleged Islamist militants linked to Israeli intelligence .
Mr Saleh did not say what evidence had been found to show the group 's links with Israel , a regional enemy of Yemen .
The arrests were connected with an attack on the US embassy in Sanaa last month which killed at least 18 people , official sources were quoted saying .
Israel 's foreign ministry has rejected the accusation as " totally ridiculous " .
" A terrorist cell was arrested and will be referred to the judicial authorities for its links with the Israeli intelligence services , " Mr Saleh told a gathering at al - Mukalla University in Hadramawt province .
" Details of the trial will be announced later .
You will hear about what goes on in the proceedings , " he added .
The 17 September attack was the second to target the US embassy since April .
Militants detonated car bombs before firing rockets at the heavily fortified building .
Mr Saleh did not identify the suspects , but official sources were quoted saying it was same cell - led by a militant called Abu al - Ghaith al - Yamani - whose arrest was announced a week after the attack .
An Israeli foreign ministry spokesman said the Yemeni president 's statement was without foundation .
" To believe that Israel would create Islamist cells in Yemen is really far - fetched .
This is yet another victory for the proponents of conspiracy theories , " Igal Palmor said in remarks reported by AFP .

As the economy collapses , credit lines become constricted , and tax revenues are choked off , we can expect local representatives of the parasite class ( commonly called “ government ” ) to become perversely creative in finding new ways to extract money from productive people .
For parasites looking to feast on the wealth of others , the liberty - devouring fraud called the War on Drugs offers a particularly rich menu of possibilities .
By way of the fraudulent , murderous enterprise called the War on Drugs , Police and Sheriff ’s departments in many jurisdictions are robbing people blind in the name of civil asset forfeiture , an officially sanctioned form of robbery in which cash or property is deemed “ guilty ” of involvement in narcotics trafficking .
It ’s not necessary to prove that a crime has been committed , or even to arrest or charge an individual with a criminal offense .
All that is required is for an officer to assert some “ nexus ” between the coveted money or property , and then a civil procedure begins in which the onus is placed on the victim to prove that both he and his property are innocent .
Law enforcement bodies across the nation are engorging themselves on the corrupt proceeds of such plunder .
Tom Allman , Sheriff of California ’s Mendocino County , recently advanced this depraved science by devising a way to seize both property and the money belonging to people who have explicit government permission to cultivate and use marijuana for medical purposes .
Allman , it must first be understood , insists that even though “ a marijuana plant that ’s legal looks just like a marijuana plant that ’s illegal , ” his Sheriff ’s Department carefully discriminates between the legal cultivation of medical marijuana , and that grown for illicit “ commercial ” use .
He also claims that “ I have friends who benefit from medical marijuana . ”
Allman also takes offense when his department is accused of exceeding its mandate by seizing medical marijuana .
“ The Sheriff ’s Office focuses its eradication efforts on commercial marijuana operations , ” Allman insisted in an essay - length letter published in the October 10 Ukiah Daily Journal .
“ We do not target legitimate medical marijuana patients or their caregivers . ”
In fact , Sheriff Allman continued , his department actually protected legitimate medical marijuana crops from violent criminals who would poach them and sell them illegally : “ Recently our office arrested eight Sacramento area young people who drove to Mendocino County for the sole purpose of stealing marijuana .
All eight were arrested within an hour of the crime .
Investigation into a series of violent marijuana robberies on the Coast has resulted in the arrest of more out - of - county criminals . ”
“ The citizens of Mendocino County can be proud of the work our detectives put into these cases , ” concluded Allman in the kind of self - congratulatory plug that ’s de rigueur in official communiques from the governing class .
To be fair , the September 19 marijuana robbery was a serious property crime , in which six large plants — each of which was valued at $ 3,000 — were stolen at gun point from 57 - year - old Laytonville resident Richard Weaver , who cultivated them for medical use .
This was an example of that rarest and most unexpected of things , a government agency actually acting in defense of an individual ’s person and property .
However , Allman ’s heroic deputies did n’t bestir themselves to solve an even more egregious armed robbery involving medical marijuana that took place in Philo the following Wednesday .
That crime involved the seizure of 17 marijuana plants and over $ 80,000 in cash .
As was the case with the Laytonville heist , the victims of the second crime had legally cultivated their plants for their personal medical needs .
Where Mr. Weaver was a sick man on the wrong side of 50 confronted by eight armed , college - age men , the victims in Philo were Lester and Mary Smith , both of whom are in their ninth decade and suffer from a variety of afflictions , from severe arthritis to heart disease .
Mary is confined to a wheelchair , and Lester , a World War II veteran , is immobilized by two bad hips and suffers from frequent chest pains that make it nearly impossible to breathe .
The pitiless thugs who attacked the Smiths on September 24 not only took away their indispensable pain medication — for which they had obtained the appropriate prescription , and the necessary growing permit — but stole their life savings as well .
It ’s difficult to conceive of a personality so utterly surrendered to criminal appetites that it would commit such an act .
Since Sheriff Allman is so eager to throw laurels at the feet of his intrepid detectives , one might expect him to deploy them in pursuit of the fiends who assaulted Lester and Mary Smith .
“ Let every brush be beaten ; let every stone be capsized ; let no clue elude your vigilant gaze , ” one imagines Sheriff Allman commanding his eager detectives , assuming that he favors the over - ripe diction typical of a hero from a 19th Century Penny Dreadful serial .
“ Darken not the door of this Sheriff ’s Office again until you hold , within the unyielding grasp of incarnate Justice , those responsible for reducing this venerable couple to their present undeserved state of penury ! ”
One would expect Sheriff Allman to issue a command of that sort to his detectives , albeit in less florid language .
One would be wrong .
You see , the perpetrators who robbed the Smiths at gunpoint were Allman ’s deputies , so having the detectives build a case about them would pose some interesting problems in workplace etiquette .
“ Four of these guys [ the deputies ] came in here , big as barnyard bulls , hollering real loud , accusing us of growing marijuana to sell , ” Lester Smith told Pro Libertate in a telephone interview .
“ They do everything they can to scare you and get you frustrated . ”
Smith lives near three grandchildren who rent properties from him .
One of them is his 31 - year - old granddaughter Yolanda , who was the victim of a lengthy , abusive harangue by one of the heroic deputies .
“ The trailer is nearby , and I could hear him yelling at her , ” Lester recounts .
“ He kept screaming at her , ` Your grandpa gives you pot to sell for money ! ’ and she kept telling him that I do n’t .
This went on for a long time , and he eventually made her cry and even throw up .
She told me that she was convinced that if she just told him what he wanted to hear , he ’d leave her alone , so she eventually said `yes . ’
But I never did anything of the kind ; we have a prescription , my daughter got the permit , and we grow marijuana here only to use as medicine . ”
The only “ legal ” justification for seizing anything from the Smiths would necessarily involve some kind of criminal charges .
Yet neither Smith nor his wife , nor any of their children or in - laws , has been charged with a crime .
So even by the terms of what Sheriff Allman calls the “ law , ” this incident is nothing more than felonious armed robbery , carried out under the color of supposed authority .
Not long ago , Mary Smith received a $ 52,000 inheritance .
And roughly a year ago Lester started to withdraw money from his bank accounts in anticipation of the economic catastrophe now in full flower .
When Congress passed the Plutocrat Bailout and Economic Dictatorship
Act two weeks ago , Lester cashed in his CDs .
When the Sheriff ’s deputies arrived to conduct their little robbery , the Smiths had $ 81,000 in the family safe , and then tore up another $ 51,000 in medicinal marijuana plants .
This is a total haul of $ 132,000 , which is pretty impressive for just a couple hours ’ worth of government “ work . ”
Lester and Mary have to wait until next March 3 to begin the long , painful , and expensive process of trying to recover the money Allman ’s department stole from them .
Both of them are approaching ninety years of age and in very poor health , which makes it exceptionally unlikely that they will ever get their money back .
This suggests the thugs who robbed them must have cased out their target very carefully .
It would n’t suprise me to learn that they got a heads - up from a spitzel at the local bank .
( When I suggested this possibility to Lester , he dismissed it right away . )
Interestingly , Allman and his homiez at the DA ’s office did n’t attach the Smith ’s minuscule checking account , which they could have done had they really believed that the elderly couple were “ drug peddlers . ”
But with their savings now being used to keep the Sheriff ’s Department supplied with donuts , Lester and Mary now have nothing but their Social Security checks and the $ 600 he gets from renting properties to his three grandchildren .
The Smiths are a couple who had saved nearly everything they earned that was n’t spent on necessities .
They are children of the Great Depression , who were making preparations to deal with the Greater Depression ( Lester indicated to me that he was planning on buying gold ) .
Stricken with years and left helpless by disease , they were an easy target for a predatory law “ enforcement ” agency .
This kind of thing is going to become very commonplace .
Sheriff Allman , you ’ll recall , admits that he can’t tell the difference between a “ legal ” marijuana plant and an “ illegal ” one .
Clear - headed people will have exactly the same problem in trying to find a moral distinction separating the gang of private sector thugs who robbed Richard Weaver , and the government - authorized gang that terrorized and robbed Lester and Mary Smith .
Sheriff Bubba ’s new toy : Georgia ’s Cobb County Police Department recently paid $ 45,000 — anybody wanna bet that the funds came from an asset forfeiture fund ? — to refurbish this $ 500,000 “ Peacekeeper ” light armor vehicle , which was donated — anybody wanna bet through the Pentagon ’s LESO program ? — to the department .
The gang that attacked Weaver behaved very much like a police unit :
They gathered intelligence about Mendocino County ’s legal marijuana gardens , coordinated their movements via radio , and carried firearms to compel their victims to submit .
As far as I can tell , the only substantive differences between these two robberies were , first , that the crooks who robbed Weaver had a much smaller take , and second , their heist was unsuccessful , because it was foiled by the intervention of a much larger , better equipped , and more ruthless gang .
Once again , we ’re driven to contemplate the wisdom of Albert Jay Nock from his magisterial book , Our Enemy , The State :
“ Everyone knows that the State claims and exercises [ a ] monopoly of crime … and that it makes this monopoly as strict as it can .
It forbids private murder , but itself organizes murder on a colossal scale .
It punishes private theft , but itself lays unscrupulous hands on anything it wants , whether the property of citizen or of alien … .
Of all the crimes that are committed for gain or revenge , there is not one that we have not seen it commit — murder , mayhem , arson , robbery , fraud , criminal collusion and connivance . ”
In ways too numerous to chronicle ( I ’m doing my best , and falling behind badly ) , the local police in our country are rapidly becoming the most serious criminal threat we face .
This is because common crooks , when repelled , will retreat and seek other victims , but criminals in State - issued costumes will summon sufficient force to visit exemplary violence upon those who resist .
This is not an argument against righteous resistance , but rather a sober tactical assessment of the enforcement arm of an Enemy that has dropped any pretense of acting on behalf of the public good .

An Indian man was arrested over the weekend for allegedly posting derogatory and vulgar content about Indian politician Sonia Gandhi on Google 's social networking site , Orkut .
22 - year - old Rahul Krishnakumar Vaid had posted his comments in an Orkut community called " I hate Sonia Gandhi " through an Orkut account associated with his Gmail account .
With Google 's help , local authorities were able to verify Vaid 's identity and make the arrest .
Vaid was charged under the Indian Penal Code as well as the Information Technology Act , according to expressindia .
Perhaps surprisingly , the creator of the " I hate Sonia Gandhi " group was left alone , as hating prominent politicians is not illegal in India .
Posting vulgar comments about that someone is , however , leading authorities to pursue Vaid .
Google admitted today that it had forked over Vaid 's information after it was requested by Indian law enforcement .
A spokesperson for Google told IDG News Service that , while the company is committed to protecting user privacy , it must obey local laws and legal processes .
Google 's part in the arrest has hit a nerve with those who hold Google on a pedestal for its commitment against evil - ness , but the search giant is far from the only company to give up the good on its users to law enforcement in other countries .
Yahoo is perhaps the most famous ( or is that infamous ? ) for having done so with a number of dissidents in China , resulting in their arrest .
Since then , the whole issue of complying with local authorities has become a large blip on Congress ' radar , which remains unimpressed with Yahoo 's defenses .
And , both Microsoft and Google regularly censor things in China , with Microsoft blocking certain terms from blogs hosted on MSN Spaces , and Google censoring search results .
Could Google et al. be forced to change their ways ?
Earlier this month , Rep. Chris Smith ( R - NJ ) announced his plans to push the Global Online Freedom Act ( HR 275 ) to the House floor for voting , which would bar US companies from disclosing personally - identifiable information about users except for " legitimate foreign law enforcement purposes . "
The problem is that " legitimate law enforcement " is vague and left up to the US Department of Justice 's discretion .
Would Vaid 's case be considered legitimate or not ?
What is the threshold for legitimacy ?
Also , the bill has a convenient exit plan for anyone who tries to apply its rules to the US , and the President would have the authority to waive the provisions of the Act as long as " the important national interest of the United States requires the exercise of such waiver authority . "
This much is sure : multinational digital giants like Google have to play ball with governments — repressive and otherwise — if they want to continue operating in those countries .
Making sure they do so without angering activists , shareholders , US authorities , and foreign authorities is another matter entirely .
Soilwork announces return of founding member
[ 4,414 views ]
Nearly three years after quitting , Soilwork guitarist Peter Wichers has officially rejoined the band .
The group has issued the following statement :
" The past two years have been great although sometimes a bit turbulent .
We made another killer album and did several amazing tours around the world ; and today it is with sheer joy and excitement that we announce the return of Peter Wichers as a guitarist in Soilwork .
He 's been missed both as a bandmate and as a songwriter .
" We know that we can come back even stronger , and it definitely gives us a feeling of inspiration and completion to have Peter , one of the founders of Soilwork , come back to the fold .
We feel that we can look into the future with greater confidence and musical creativity .
Having Peter back will complete the circle and the final line up of the band .
" This also marks Daniel Antonsson 's departure from Soilwork as Peter 's replacement since 2006 .
We are really grateful for Daniel 's excellent work and he will be missed .
However , to us it 's ideal for Peter to fulfill his former duties as a songwriter and guitarist .
Going separate ways with Daniel is not an easy decision for us to make , but it 's the right one .
We wish Daniel the best of luck in the future and many great things with his other band Dimension Zero !
Rock on Daniel !
" As we previously announced , Dirk 's bandmate in Scarve , Sylvain Coudret , has been doing session work for us throughout the Summer festivals and shredding on second guitar .
Therefore we 're taking this opportunity to confirm Sylvain as a permanent guitar player for Soilwork .
Since we 're big fans of Scarve , we know Sylvain will make a great addition to the songwriting process for the next Soilwork album . "
For his part , Wichers had the following to say :
" Let me first of all say that I 'm incredibly grateful for all the amazing feedback and support that I 've received since my departure from Soilwork almost three years ago .
" When I left Soilwork , I was at a place in my life where I felt burnt out on touring and I needed to get my life into a more stable situation .
I needed to do something other than Soilwork , perhaps explore more diverse styles of songwriting and musical journeys .
Therefore , over the past few years , I 've been very focused on production , songwriting and family , and have had the privilege to work with some amazing artists on some really cool and rewarding projects .
" During my time away from the band , my good friend Bjorn ‘ Speed ' and I had always kept in touch and maintained a great friendship .
We recently spoke about working on a possible musical collaboration , and that 's when we started toying with the idea of me perhaps returning to Soilwork .
" I needed some time to think about it , but after careful consideration , I 've decided that I still have tons of enthusiasm and creativity to contribute to Soilwork .
I have a lot of love for my brothers in the band , and I would of course be honored to once again share the stage with the greatest metal band in the world !
" So it is with great honor that I now announce my return and 110 % commitment to Soilwork .
I guarantee that we 'll bring forth one hell of a show and write the best album in the history of Soilwork 's career . "

That ’s not true . ”
“ That ’s just a fact , ” Mr. McCain responded .
“ Again , you can look it up . ”
So what does the record say when you look it up ?
Is one candidate right and the other wrong , or are both exaggerating ?
In the past , Mr. McCain has characterized Mr. Obama ’s position on taxes in ways that proved to be demonstrably inaccurate .
His remarks on Friday night , which he amplified on the campaign trail on Monday , seemed to be an effort to shift him away from that shaky ground .
However , they too contain assertions that are misleading or overstated .
Mr. McCain ’s campaign has made it clear that he intends to portray Mr. Obama as an advocate of tax increases in the home stretch of the presidential race .
Appearing Sunday on “ Meet the Press ” on NBC , Mr. McCain ’s senior strategist , Steve Schmidt , said Mr. Obama ’s voting record on taxes was “ different from what he says out on the campaign trail ” and was “ a recipe for disaster for the economy . ”
No barbed wire ... it might hurt the thieves , allotment holders told
A gardener who fenced off his allotment with barbed wire after being targeted by thieves has been ordered to take it down – in case intruders scratch themselves .
Bill Malcolm erected the 3ft fence after thieves struck three times in just four months , stealing tools worth around £ 300 from his shed and ransacking his vegetable patch .
But Bromsgrove district council has ordered the 61 - year - old to remove the waist - high fence on health and safety grounds .
Demoralised : Bill Malcolm and his fence
Mr Malcolm , who has grown potatoes , onions , beetroot and asparagus on two patches at the Round Hill allotments in Marlbrook , Worcestershire , for the past eight years , said : ' It 's an absolutely ridiculous situation .
' All I wanted was to protect my property but the wire had to go in case a thief scratched himself .
' The fence was just a single strand and ringing my property .
It was only 3ft high – it was n't as though I 'd dug a moat filled with piranha fish and erected 6 ft iron railings .
' The council said they were unhappy about the precautions I had made but my response was to tell them that only someone climbing over on to my allotment could possibly hurt themselves .
Security battle : Intruders have struck Bill 's allotments three times in four months
' They should n't be trespassing in the first place but the council apologised and said they did n't want to be sued by a wounded thief .
' I told them to let the thief sue me so at least that way I would know who was breaking into my allotment but everything I said fell on deaf ears .
It seems as though they are so wrapped up in red tape , they are unable to help me . '
Mr Malcolm said he had been robbed three times since June , along with around 16 of the 50 allotment keepers on the site .
' About £ 300 worth of tools were taken , including everything from a stainless steel border spade and pitchforks to screwdrivers and hammers , ' he added .
' The thieves cut through steel locks on the shed , or broke in through the windows .
I caught one lad of about 16 red -handed .
' He dropped the bag of tools and fled , but although the police took a description and finger prints , I heard nothing .
Another time yobs broke in and completely trashed my potato and vegetable patches .
' A lot of people , myself included , are growing our own veg to beat the credit crunch .
But what 's the point if they are going to be ripped up by mindless idiots ?
' I take care of this allotment but it 's very demoralising to have your belongings stolen and your hard work ruined . '
A spokesman for Bromsgrove council said : ' With regard to the barbed wire , when this is identified on site , we are obliged to request its removal or remove it on health and safety grounds . '
Sergeant Nick Husbands , of West Mercia Police , said : ' We can confirm that five thefts from Round Hill allotments have been reported in the past year .
' These have mainly been from sheds and our advice to allotment holders is not to leave anything of value there . '
Mr Malcolm 's plight comes just weeks after Bristol council angered allotment holders by urging them not to lock their sheds in case burglars damaged them breaking in .
In a 60 Minutes interview from 1996 , then US ambassador to the UN , Madeleine Albright infamously quipped of the deaths of half a million Iraqi children to maintain US policy : “… we think the price is worth it . ”
On 24 September , a prominent Canadian politician said that the collective punishment of the Palestinian people “… is the right thing to do . ”
The name candidate with Canada ’s Liberal Party delivered a shocking statement that is , in essence , advocating a genocide against 1.5 million Palestinians in Gaza .
Speaking at Toronto ’s Beth Emeth synagogue , hockey hall - of - fame goalie , former federal cabinet minister , and current member of the Canadian parliament for the Ontario riding of York Centre , Ken Dryden sounded like an arch - Zionist :
Stop all aid that flows into Gaza .
While that may seem a harsh measure that will hurt Palestinian civilians … it is the right thing to do at this time .
[ emphasis added ]
Journalist Paul Weinberg considered that Dryden was “ trying to out - Israel ” his competition from the staunchly pro-Zionist Conservative Party , Rochelle Wilner , a hard - liner and former B’nai Brith president .
Dryden ’s campaign manager , Ruth Thorkelson , contradicted her candidate .
She stated that the Liberal Party position was for a Canadian government boycott of aid but to indirectly support UN assistance .
Since Palestinians in Gaza were already starving , a call for cutting off all aid to Gaza is tantamount to a call for a mass starvation .
It is advocating collective punishment — a war crime , as stipulated by the Fourth Geneva Convention .
It is advocating genocide .
While with the International Committee of the Red Cross , Christa Rottensteiner argued that cutting all aid could be a war crime , crime against humanity , and / or genocide .
The requisites for genocide are there .
The denial of humanitarian assistance could fit into the categories of “ killing members of the group ” , “ causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group ” and “ deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part ” , provided that the prerequisites for genocide are fulfilled .
What was said for murder as a war crime is also applicable , mutatis mutandis , to genocide .
Wrote Rottensteiner , “ [ T ] he impact of the denial of humanitarian assistance can be just as strong as massacres ‘ committed with knives ’ . ”
So far no word has been forthcoming from Liberal Party leader Stéphane Dion on Dryden ’s racist remarks , which are receiving short thrift in the corporate media .
Dion is known to be a sympathizer of Zionism , so this is not surprising .
Dryden is considered to be an “ all - star ” of the Liberal team , a person who , according to “ prominent Liberal strategist ” Scott Reid , “ can speak to character . ”
Ron Saba , editor of Montreal Planet magazine , has been indefatigable in exposing the complicity of Canadian politicians in the crimes of Zionism .
Dion is near the top of his list .
Many of the supporters of Zionism turn out to be politicians from within Canada ’s corporate - political duopoly of the Conservatives and Liberals .
Prime minister Stephan Harper is an unabashed backer of Zionism .
A particular focus of Saba is the racist Jewish National Fund ( JNF ) which enjoys strong financial support in Canada — illegally .
Dion is taciturn on JNF crimes and the illegality of the JNF operating in Canada as a tax - exempt charity .
Dion even went so far as to welcome fellow liberal “ all - star ” Bob Rae , the Liberal candidate in Toronto Centre and a committee member of the JNF , an organization acknowledged as practicing racism towards Arabs by the attorney general of Israel .
Dryden ’s racist remarks are inexcusable from any human being and , certainly , from a MP .
The right thing for Dryden to do at this time is to resign , and Dion should be calling for that resignation immediately and publicly .
Dragon *Con 08 : ‘ Battlestar Galactica ’ Final Episodes May Be Delayed Til April 2009
The final episodes of Season Four of Battlestar Galactica may air as late as April 2009 , according to the show ’s star Aaron Douglas at a cast panel discussion Sunday at Dragon * Con 2008 .
Douglas , who plays Chief Tyrol , said that the SCI FI network has completely ignored arguably their biggest hit , adding â€ œand the SCI FI Network sucks , â€  which got a big applause from those in the audience .
â€ œTen episodes is not a season , â€ said Douglas , referring to the first half of the season , which aired from April to June 2008 .
In June 2008 , the remaining episodes , which will conclude the storyline for the series , had not yet been scheduled .
Michael Hogan , Richard Hatch , and James Callis seemed to echo their castmate ’s feelings .
In an earlier panel , Edward James Olmos riffed on the split saying , â€œ … of course they did n’t pay us for five seasons .
â€
Season Four was originally slated for 13 episodes , but was extended to 22 ( which included a 2 - hour movie ) .
The series finale is said to be a tear - jerker , according to science adviser / consultant , Kevin Grazier .
â€ œI do n’t know anyone who has n’t cried after reading the final episode script , â€ Grazier said .
" Desperate times call for drastic measures . "

But when a long train of abuses and usurpations , pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism , it is their right , it is their duty , to throw off such Government , and to provide new Guards for their future security .
Declaration of Independence
There are a thousand striking at the branches of evil , to one who is striking at the root .
Henry David Thoreau
How long is the " train of abuses and usurpations " that has been coupled together by the Bush regime with the consent , or active participation of Congress ?
In the Declaration of Independence , our fore - parents listed the train of abuses that King " George " III ( the king of Great Britain at the time ) perpetrated on the American colonies .
The differences between our " Mad King George , " and the one that reigned over these states , 232 years ago are slim .
If you " google " the Declaration , or pull one out of your pocket / purse and read it , you can see the abuses are practically identical .
I am not going to list the abuses , because you can read them .
The current one that is going to hit each and every American , though , whether unborn or one foot in the grave , is :
* For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent .
In a recent Rasmussen poll only 7 % of Americans approved of a bail out of Wall Street ... gee , I wonder which ones those were ?
The CEO's of Goldman - Sachs and their families ?
And former CEO of Goldman - Sachs : US Treasury Secretary : Henry ( Hammerin ' Hank ) Paulson ?
There is one major difference between Past Mad King George and Present Mad King George , though .
Our fore - parents had the courage and integrity to say " enough is enough , George " and they kicked an occupying force in the ass and booted them off our continent .
We Present Americans are so passive in the face of , and cowed into submission by , the current state of fascist affairs in our country .
Now the evil " powers that be " in an incestuous collusion are collaborating to steal 2300.00 per American to give to Wall Street to pay for worthless paper transactions that will make our paper dollar worth even less .
Mad King George and his obedient Court Jesters ( Congress ) are asking us to pony up our hard earned money from our hard - worked labor to keep the Wall Street Barbary Coast Pirates in the style to which they have become accustomed .
I would like to call " HORSESHIT " on that !
Before my son , Casey , was killed in Iraq , I was like these Americans .
I dutifully obeyed stupid laws and paid my taxes like a good , properly propagandized American .
As I wrote the checks , I never considered what my money was financing .
After Casey was killed , I became deeply ashamed that I had in some small part funded the very thing that killed him : greedy and rampant US imperialism .
I have not paid my taxes since .
I wo n't pay my taxes until our money is used for positive projects : health insurance , affordable housing , credits for green development , jobs programs to rebuild our compromised infrastructure , education , etc .
I can hold my head up and say that I feel that I have taken a principled stand against this US Corporate Empire .
This out of control system needs to be overthrown and even though we still retain a modicum of the 2nd Amendment , we do not have the firepower it would take to militarily overthrow our Mad King George and his Jesters .
More importantly , I fear armed revolutions for the very reason that they always install violent regimes , so I am proposing another solution : a tax revolt .
Over the past 7 + years , our taxes have gone to pay for : killing innocent people , torturing and detaining without due process other people ( innocent or guilty is no matter ) , increasing Police State America , bailing out other finance companies , paying for private mercenary soldiers in New Orleans , Iraq and Afghanistan and the very ephemeral notion of a " War on Terror . "
Most of us have continued to pay for these crimes against humanity .
Some have n't and some have done so with a nagging feeling in the back of the place that is called a " conscience . "
It is time to with hold your support from this criminally insane institution of Government / Wall Street .
DO NOT allow your money to be used to bail out the fat cats .

In the realm of digital art , so many wonderful and playful genres exist that stimulate the imagination , but so few do it with the intricate style of fractal art .
Fractal art is achieved through the mathematical calculations of fractal objects being visually displayed , with the use of self - similar transforms that are generated and manipulated with different assigned geometric properties to produce multiple variations of the shape in continually reducing patterns .
Sounds extremely technical and not that artistic , true , but these equations create some of the most mesmerizing and inspiring artwork to emerge from the digital art arena .

Brandon Friedman at VetVoice notes that for its " Pledge of Allegiance video " on Tuesday night , the Republican National Convention used stock footage of a staged military funeral , along with actors - fake soldiers and a staged military funeral instead of the real thing .
Brandon writes :
The issue here is n't that the RNC used actors in what might have been a haste .
Rather , the underlying problem is that Bush and McCain supporters do n't like to deal with the messy reality of warfare that genuine troops bring to the table .
That is , they feel compelled to stage a funeral with actors .
Because to show a real military funeral -- with the heaving chests of a broken family clutching a flag - draped coffin containing the pieces of their dead soldier -- might just make the funny hat - clad , stupid button - wearing audience blanch .
And that does n't make for good TV .
Plus , people just would n't go for it .
So they use sanitized actors .
But this is an insult to the military .
The use of actors shows an unwillingness to face up to what they 've done -- to the military and to the nation .
And it shows that the only way to keep up support for the war is to hide its reality from the American people .
If I said that something like this surprised me , though , I 'd be lying .
But then , this is also why troops overseas are donating to Obama at a six to one rate over McCain .
They 're tired of being treated like this .
I 'd add that its another example of the glorification of war - something that can only be done by sanitizing it - that McCain says he hates but that Republicans indulge in at every turn .
Even some on the Right have previously noted McCain 's love for warmongering .
Meanwhile , the wars that Bush involved America in continue to take their toll .
Army leaders said today that soldier suicides this year could surpass the record rate of last year and attributed the increase directly to a force strained by two wars .
As of the end of August , there were 62 confirmed suicides among active duty soldiers and Guard and Reserve troops called to active duty , officials said .
Another 31 deaths appear to be suicides but are still being investigated .
If all are confirmed , that means that the number for 2008 could eclipse the 115 of last year — and the rate per 100,000 could surpass that of the civilian population , Col. Eddie Stephens , deputy director of human resources policy , said at a Pentagon news conference .
With Richard Holbrooke warning that , because of Republican incompetence , Afghanistan is shaping to be a ' long war ' which will outlast even Vietnam 's 14 - year term , we can see clearly where a McCain - Palin administration would lead - and it is n't a glorious future unless the thousands of dead , crippled and grieving are to be played by actors too .
It bears repeating - in the first four days of the Republican convention , Afghanistan did n't rate a single mention .
That 's shameful .
Bunny of Bunny Hollow heard from
friends down south of an amazing true
story about some new animal friends .
Strangers Become
Best Friends !
On December 26 , 2004 tsunami flood waters in the East African country of Kenya swept a herd of hippopotamuses down the Sabaki River and into the Indian Ocean .
After a few days , most of them struggled to shore and returned inland .
Local fishermen spotted a baby hippo in the rough surf , separated from his mother and the herd .
After hours of effort , they finally caught the 600 - pound baby and named him Owen , after one of the rescusers .
Wildlife officials took Owen to the safety of Haller Park , a sanctuary for wild animals in the city of Mombassa .
But poor Owen was traumatized by this ordeal and needed a mother .
To their great surprise , little Owen trotted right up to a giant gray tortoise , named Mzee .
Now , tortoises are among the longest - living creatures on Earth , and Mzee , which means " old man " in Swahili , was more than 130 years old .
Mzee hissed , lifted himself up off the ground , and tried to run , but Owen persisted in his friendly and loving ways .
Sometime during that night , something changed .
By the next morning they were together , and they have been together ever since .
Hippos are very social animals who like to stay with their mothers for four years .
Owen follows old Mzee around like his mother , wallowing in mud ponds , swimming , and eating .
They even stay close and touching when they sleep .
Eventually Owen will be introduced to Cleo , an adult hippo , so he can be with his own kind .
But Mzee and Owen will always be close friends .
After all , they 're family !

Last week a reader decided to lambast me for , I think , having this posting section next to the comic .
It 's not like anyone has to read this part , though , when they 're done with the comic .
The focus of the site is definitely the comic .
Perhaps I 'll try to curtail my rambling ( or keep it up in the Forum ) rather than soap - boxing out here .
Anyone have any thoughts one way or another ?
If it really is just a case of the page displaying weird for people , for the record , this is what it 's supposed to look like :
So , to any of the few people out there who still use Internet Explorer ... let me know if the page does n't stack like that .
Yes there are two google ads on the page .
Sorry , but that 's how we pay for bandwidth , some of the contests , and if an article needs props .
You 're free to use the adblocker extension in Firef - ....oh .
I love all your heartfelt and crazy comments - the feedback is wonderful ( I check several times between comic postings ) , and I really dig the community we have here .
So if stuff bothers you , always go ahead and let me know .
I may not want or be able to change it , but lots of where the site has gone in the last year has been in response to comments from you rad little monkeys .
Your Comments :
( Or On Selling the Global Surveillance Society )
Homeland Security czar Michael Chertoff ’s recent remark in Ottawa that our fingerprints are not really our personal information , because we leave them on glasses and silverware , is bizarre .
Last I looked , fingerprinting was associated with totalitarian regimes and , in most Western nations , it was restricted to those arrested and certain government workers .
Fingerprinting was the tried and true means of identifying people who might need to be identified again .
Canadian privacy legislation specifically includes fingerprints in the definition of personal information , so Mr. Chertoff is wrong at law , including US law .
This is from the American Privacy Act :
( 4 ) the term " record " means ..... information about an individual that is maintained by an agency , including ..... his education , financial transactions , medical history , and criminal or employment history and that contains his name , or the identifying number , symbol ....... such as a finger or voice print or a photograph ; "
Mr. Chertoff is trying to do two things in selling the global surveillance society to other countries and to we , the data subjects .
Continue to scare the hell out of us daily about the threats posed by terrorism ( crime , illegal immigration , drugs , communism , etc. ) .
And continue to downplay the risks to those of us who have “ nothing to hide . ”
Mr. Chertoff was speaking of an all - Anglo project by the US , the UK , Canada and Australia to collect and share fingerprints , facial images and iris scans to improve border and immigration " controls . "
Throw in police and security " work . "
These people really want to know who you are and what you 're up to .
And not just when you fly or cross borders .
Always .
" Total Awareness " remains what it 's all about to these folks .
Bush ’s wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are widely recognized as disasters but our own governments ' wars against our privacy and other rights and freedoms continues with shockingly little resistance .
Even the Ontario Privacy Commissioner recently caved on a plan to install surveillance cameras on all Toronto subways , buses and streetcars .
Necessity ?
Unproven .
Cost - benefit ?
Unknown .
For almost seven years , our political leaders and the mainstream media have hammered away at us that the threat of terrorism is real , and it is .
But compared to other causes of death , it is so miniscule it ca n’t even be picked up by normal risk management models .
Three thousand deaths a year , world - wide .
There are countless more humane ways to spend the money being wasted on " security , " such as fighting poverty , famine and disease .
If even privacy commissioners can’t stop the surge to watch , identify , search and report us , wherever and whenever , who can ?
That would take new laws to reestablish the primacy and privacy of individuals over unwarranted government intrusions , especially if one is a “ targeted individual ” or on a watch list .
Right now , if you ’re on such lists , you ca n’t find out why and you ca n’t get off .
How ’s that for freedom !
Right now , our only protection from these absurd projects to amass and integrate data bases on us all is that they crash before take - off , due to over - ambitious or ever - changing goals .
However , the technology companies are getting the profits , and we are getting the tab .
We need to take a closer look at Big Bro ' because he is one scary dude .

CBS sitcom takes stealthy swipe at Fox News Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday October 14 , 2008
Print This Email This Sitcom producer Chuck Lorre has developed a cult following for the lengthy diatribes he includes at the end of his shows .
The " vanity cards , " which are too long to read during the two seconds they air following CBS sitcoms " Two and a Half Men " and " Big Bang Theory " serve as mini-journal entries for Lorre , who has taken pot -shots at other media outlets and even his own network executives .
A card that aired after " Big Bang Theory " Monday night takes a none - too - subtle dig at Fox News , comparing it to a state - run propaganda outlet charged with repeating lies until they become truth .
" We have once again arrived at a moment in history where the truth can be defined as ' that which you can make other people believe , ' " Lorre writes .
" The methodology for creating that belief is repetition .
Say something enough times and it becomes , for millions of people , the truth . "
To illustrate his point , Lorre peppers his treatise with the statement " I am endowed like a stallion , repeated eight times .
This is why control of the media equals control of the populace .
...
And also why a state run television news channel is so very dangerous .
...
Now there are those who would argue this has already happened and that a certain cable news channel is actually a covert extension of our government .
...
The fact that the channel is run by a high - ranking party official , an anchor person from the channel became a White House spokesman , and another top - ranking party official became an on - air news commentator is often used to make this argument .
...
Of course , this fact would be entirely inconsequential if the oft - repeated falsehoods they attempt to imbed into the Zeitgeist were simply amusing , or at worst , inane .
...
But , unfortunately , that is not the case .
Lorre encourages his viewers to use every possible avenue to " disseminate the actual truth . "
The Fox News dig was not Lorre 's first shot at a conservative - owned news outlet .
Before a profile of the producer ran in the Wall Street Journal earlier this year , Lorre authored a vanity card panning the paper , calling it " The Depressingly Inevitable Next Step Toward the End of a Free Press in America , Thanks a Lot Rupert , Journal . "
All 221 of Lorre 's vanity card , beginning with the pre-DVR card that followed " Dharma & Greg " are archived on the producer 's Web site .
Lorre 's anti-Fox card is reproduced below :
VIRGINIA BEACH  A feisty John McCain rallied the Republican faithful on Monday , unveiling an edgier stump speech for the final three weeks of the presidential campaign and vowing to fight aggressively through Nov. 4 .
Before a Virginia Beach crowd in a state usually in the GOP column , McCain shifted from attacking Democratic rival Barack Obama for ties to 1960s radical Bill Ayers and instead bristled that " the national media has written us off . "
" We 've got them just where we want them , " the GOP nominee said .
McCain distanced himself from the Bush administration and criticized Obama as lacking experience .
He warned about a Democratic president working with a Democratic Congress , led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid .
" Sen . Obama is measuring the drapes , " McCain said , " and planning with Speaker Pelosi and Sen .
Reid to raise taxes , increase spending … and concede defeat in Iraq . "
McCain , entering his Virginia speech to the theme from Rocky , used the word " fight " or a variation of it nearly 20 times in his speech .
He alluded to his years as a Vietnam prisoner of war , saying he knows what " hopelessness " and " fear " feel like .
He did not mention President Bush by name , but said , " We cannot spend the next four years as we have spent much of the last eight : waiting for our luck to change . "
The retooled speech comes as McCain trails Obama in several national polls .
An average of polls compiled by RealClearPolitics.com has Obama leading McCain by 7.4 points .
McCain told the crowd : " We 're 6 points down . "
Obama communications director Dan Pfeiffer said the election is not about the horse race reflected by polls , which are a snapshot in time .
" It 's about who will change the disastrous Bush - McCain economic policies of the last eight years , " he said .
McCain will discuss the economy Tuesday in the key battleground of Pennsylvania , where he trails Obama in some polls by double digits .
McCain allies , such as Sen. Lindsey Graham , R - S.C. , said McCain is exploring new tax cuts to encourage investment .
McCain 's new stump speech was delivered in Virginia and North Carolina , states where Obama is mounting major challenges .
North Carolina has not voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since 1976 , while Virginia has not done so since 1964 .
At the Virginia Beach rally , GOP running mate Sarah Palin said she understands Republican anger about Wall Street and " the arrogance of the Washington elite . "
She said : " Let John McCain turn that anger into action . "
Before I arrive in Dubai , I meet ' Clare ' on an expat website who insists I visit her at her home in the Meadows , a housing development in the city 's suburbs - ' to give you an idea of how so many people get misled into thinking they are in Milton Keynes ' .
Half an hour in a taxi later , past the skyscrapers , and the construction sites , and the six - lane highways , and minibuses of Indian and Pakistani workers being shuttled from one project to another , I 'm in a straight - out - of - a- David - Lynch - film picture - perfect suburban road lined with picture - perfect suburban villas .
And there 's Clare .
' That 's what I wanted you to see ! ' she says before I 'm even out of the car .
' Look at that . '
I 'm looking at a wheelie bin and not really understanding her point .
' People see the wheelie bin and they think it 's all familiar , and normal , and therefore nothing bad can happen .
Ha !'
The Meadows is a gated enclave with a uniformed security guard and lush green landscaping , and Clare is a British expatriate wife whose husband is a contractor .
To all intents , they 're living what looks very much like the good life : there 's a pool in the back garden , year - round sun , and in the living room Sky News is on .
' Oh yes , it looks good , does n't it ?
But we 've all made a pact with the devil to be here .
You get the tax - free salary , but in return you have to give up all your rights .
There 's no accountability , no transparency , no rule of law .
There 's no legislative body .
Very few employment rights .
It looks like a modern country , but it takes more than a few skyscrapers to create one of those .
Scratch the surface and it's a different story .
And if you 're a silly young girlie who gets into trouble , then forget it . '
There 's a particular silly young girlie Clare is referring to : Michelle Palmer , a 36 - year - old advertising executive who in July this year was arrested for allegedly having sex on a beach with Vince Acors , a 34 - year - old visiting company director from Kent .
It 's been a tabloid sensation .
Palmer 's ' Bridget Jones ' lifestyle endlessly examined ; at least a dozen conflicting versions of the story printed - they did have sex , they did n't have sex , Palmer may or may not have waved her shoe and called the policeman ' a fucking Muslim ' - the case comes to court this week and the prosecution is said to have concrete DNA evidence to prove they did n't have sex , but beyond that , almost nothing is certain other than the fact that , if convicted , they both face up to six years in jail .
And whatever the verdict , Palmer has already lost her job - with the publishers ITP which produces Time Out Dubai and whose chairman is Andrew Neil ; but then there 's no such thing as unfair dismissal in the United Arab Emirates - and been mauled in the press .
The Daily Mail is in strict accordance with sharia law on this point : it 's the woman 's shame .
In Dubai , it 's shocked the local population and split the expat community between those who feel sympathy and those who think she deserves nothing less than a stoning .
' What I can't believe , ' says Clare , 'is the amount of venom directed towards her .
The reaction here has been unbelievable .
I think people are under such pressure .
They know it 's not the dream .
And they need a scapegoat .
The fact is that if you can ascribe blame to someone else 's misfortune , then you are indemnifying yourself against it happening to you . '
There are a lot of Brits in Dubai .
A lot of people that it , or something similar , could have happened to .
People who do n't much want to contemplate how the judicial system works ( at best haphazardly , at worst unequally ) , or how long you can be detained without trial ( months at a time ) or what the British embassy will do to help you ( not a lot ) .
In the past year , 230 Britons have found themselves imprisoned for offences ranging from driving under the influence to bouncing a cheque .
It 's a minimum four - year term if any trace of drugs is found on you : the Radio One DJ Grooverider , caught with 2.16g of cannabis , spent 10 months inside before being pardoned two weeks ago , and Cat Le- Huy , a producer with Endemol , spent three weeks in jail without being charged , for possession of Melatonin - jetlag pills .
The Palmer - Acors case is about much more than any of this , though .
It 's exposed the very contradiction that has made modern Dubai what it is : a tolerant haven in an intolerant region .
And it 's the tension between the two Dubais : the socially conservative society whose penal code is based on sharia ; and the other Dubai , the increasingly visible Dubai , whose numbers are growing with every fresh planeload of people who land at the airport and wear crop tops to the mall and drink shooters in the bars .
It 's to Dubai 's enormous credit that these two halves have so far been accommodated side by side , but the strain has started to tell .
When I visited last week , it was Ramadan and the restrictions in Dubai are far harsher than in any other Arab country I 've visited .
Eating and drinking during daylight hours is illegal ; even for non-Muslims , having a sip of water can mean a jail sentence .
I got the timing of my trip all wrong .
I 'd wanted to check out the Friday ' brunch ' scene , all - day boozeathons which provided the setting for the Palmer - Acors romance , and I email the editor of an English language newspaper in a panic .
' Do n't worry , ' he emails back .
' You 'll see plenty . '
And it 's true : I can't drink coffee at the Starbucks next to my hotel , food is only served in a curtained - off enclave , and the clubs are closed - a DJ called Michael Robert describes the usual scene as ' like Ibiza but minus the drugs , the fights and the aggro ' .
But after 7.30 pm , all across the city , in any number of bars , it 's like downtown Croydon at closing time on a Friday night .
At Long 's Bar , it 's a crush of short skirts and spaghetti straps - alcohol is illegal if you 're a local , and practically a social obligation if you 're not .
And afterwards , a local journalist takes me on a tour of ' the dark side ' , taking in a hooker bar in a four - star chain hotel .
Prostitution is illegal , but absolutely blatant - every shape , size , nationality , ethnicity and possible aesthetic taste catered for .
But then , somehow Dubai manages to be all things to all people .
It 's capitalism 's ultimate expression : the land of opportunity , the most developed city in the Middle East , a free port .
It 's ruled absolutely by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum and is a constituent part of the UAE , a federation of seven emirates , including , down the road , immensely oil - rich Abu Dhabi , whose ruling family has just bought Manchester City .
Dubai , on the other hand , never had much oil ; it 's been forced to develop in other ways , to provide whatever is needed , and it 's done so more quickly and successfully than anyone could anticipate .
It knows what the rest of the world wants and has built it before anyone else has even realised .
Alexander McNabb , a PR executive and the writer of a blog called Fake Plastic Souks , arrived 15 years ago , when 'it was still a village , a strange and very foreign place ' .
It was the entrepôt of the Gulf and its R'n 'R facility , where oilmen came to relax - they knew the rules and relished the freedom .
It 's this that 's changed .
There are now 100,000 Brits living and working in Dubai .
And last year 1.1 m UK tourists visited - despite summer temperatures of 50 C plus , it 's now the second most popular long - haul destination after Florida .
And the ways in which the city is changing are in many ways a reflection of Britain itself .
Now , says McNabb , ' you drive your western car to your western office .
At the weekends you go to the western hotels and have your western buffets and western - style beach club , and it 's quite easy to ignore the fact that you 're abroad . '
He 's right .
It is easy .
It 's four days before I hear any actual Arabic .
Most remarkably of all the remarkable things about Dubai is that it 's occupied almost entirely by foreigners : native Emiratis make up barely 20 per cent of the population .
They 're a minority in their own country .
When I meet Sultan Al - Qassemi , a businessman and journalist , he points out that the Emiratis are handling this rather better than the British would .
' Can you imagine ?
It 's the equivalent of there being 55 m foreigners in Britain , and just 5 m of you .
It 's a unique case , and I think we deserve extra credit for the way we are handling it .
The country is completely open .
It is a utopia !
Anyone can come here !
We are one of the most tolerant countries in the world .
And all this has happened in a single generation .
Thirty years ago , it was desert . '
He sends me down the road , to the Sheikh Mohammed Centre for Cultural Understanding and I arrive in time for iftar - the breaking of the fast .
There 's a group of expats and we 're given dates and water , and then platters of home - cooked food are brought while young Emiratis tell us about their culture .
It 's fascinating : they 're so friendly , and articulate and welcoming .
' It 's so difficult to meet Emiratis , to talk to them .
In a year , I have n't properly met one , ' a British woman named Paula tells me .
Khulooda , a bright and sparky 21 - year - old in a fringed abaya , tells me she 's studying marketing and tourism .
She thinks people maybe need to do a little more research about the country before they arrive .
That maybe people should wear more appropriate clothing when they go to the mall .
That Palmer and Acors should have known better .
I think maybe she 's right .
And I hope , for her sake , that she goes into some other industry instead .
A decade ago , who had even heard of going on holiday in Dubai ?
But what Dubai has proved is that if you build it , they will come .
For if there 's one thing Dubai can do , it 's build : one third of the world 's cranes are here at any one time , most of them directly outside of my hotel window .
I try and count them but give up at 70 .
The highest is perched a kilometre up in the air , on the top of the Burj Dubai , already the tallest building in the world , and it 's not yet finished .
Next month , the biggest shopping mall in the world will open , the Dubai Mall , and shortly you 'll be able to fly into the world 's biggest airport - six runways and the size of Hong Kong island .
What 's more , if you stay in your hotel , you need never even know you 're in an autocratic Islamic state where it 's illegal to hold your wife 's hand in public , or be gay , or found with 0.003g of cannabis - less than a grain of sugar - on the sole of your shoe , as Keith Brown was , a youth worker from the West Midlands who was sentenced to four years in jail .
But the hotels are wonderful .
And even the Observer 's modest budget runs to a five - star number .
I'm on the 35th floor , with vertiginous views down , vertiginous views up .
It 's slightly queasy - making , more so after I talk to Chris Davidson , a Gulf political expert based at Durham University .
Two of the 9/11 hijackers were from the UAE , he tells me .
And every weekday , the malls are full of able - bodied young men simply hanging out .
' They 're the first generation who 've had this cradle - to - grave security , who receive a house from the government and money to get married , who 've not known hardship or what it is not to have air conditioning .
How are they reacting to what they see happening to their country ?
And if something did happen here , tourism would collapse overnight .
Real estate would collapse .
Dubai is so fragile .
It 's the result of a global boom and it's never properly been put to the test . '
Economically , nobody 's sure how it will weather the global crisis .
The region is awash with ever - increasing petrodollars , but Dubai 's construction projects are highly leveraged .
And culturally , tourism is Dubai 's great unmentionable can of worms , its fault line .
A blogger , who 'll only identify herself as Secret Dubai , tells me Dubai 's marketing machine has deliberately created ' the false sense of westernness , of a trashy holiday resort ' .
And , according to Davidson , it 's reached ' a critical mass .
Previously people were corralled into five - star enclaves ; what the Palmer - Acors case shows is that they 're starting to leak out . '
The week I visit , Atlantis opens - a mega resort owned by Sol Kerzner , the South African who gave the world Sun City .
It 's a vast pink edifice that looks like something Katie Price might design , built on an artificial island shaped like a palm tree .
It 's actually only one of three palms under construction , which together will add 520 km of beaches to Dubai 's coastline , and where the Beckhams are alleged to have ' bought ' a villa , along with Rio Ferdinand and Michael Owen .
It 's all PR , but then nowhere in the world wants the Beckhams to love it as much as Dubai .
It 's more of a WAG than almost any other place on earth : flashy , artificially enhanced , desperate to please , all things to all people .
I tour the resort and dutifully write down the stats : $ 1.5 bn to build , 1,539 rooms , a Nobu and a Locatelli restaurant , a $ 25,000 - a- night suite , 65,000 marine animals , a 1.4 km beach .
Do you think most tourists even know it 's Ramadan , I ask .
' That 's a good question , ' says the PR , a South African .
' I think they receive information at the airport . '
Actually , they do n't , I say .
We ponder this for a moment , and then she tells me about what a wonderful life she 's had since she moved there .
Back in the Meadows , Clare invites me to an expat ladies ' coffee morning .
It 's not an obvious place to go and meet a hotbed of radical malcontents .
The lawns are neat , the communal pool still inviting .
And yet ...
Nobody 's managing to save .
Rents are sky high : £ 45,000 a year for a modest villa , paid in advance .
And you can't move jobs : your visa is sponsored by your employer .
Jane says : ' If I knew now what I knew then , I just would n't have come . '
She 's spent months and months trying to get her daughter with mild ADHD into any sort of school .
Laura bought a house , in a ' lovely , quiet , very green development ' and the road in front of it has just been torn up to build a six - lane highway .
And Rebecca , who 's lived in Dubai for 13 years , tells story after story of the Dubai - dream - gone - wrong .
' People just do n't know what they 're getting themselves into , ' she says .
' There 's no social infrastructure , no safety net , nothing . '
You do n't even have to do anything wrong ; a bad case of bad luck is enough .
She puts me in touch with Richard , a twinkly fortysomething who came to Dubai as a salesman with a multinational company .
' And then , in one month , I had a car accident , lost my job , and my marriage fell apart . '
Richard fell behind on his car payments , his bank loans , his credit cards .
' Everybody lives beyond their means here .
It 's all front .
It 's like Dubai - a totally false appearance to what it actually is . '
He was charged by the police with defaulting on his loans and his passport was confiscated .
' So I could n't get another job and I could n't pay the debt , and I could n't leave the country ... and to cut a very long story short , I got 12 months . '
It 's quite a story .
He 's only been out two weeks , but he 's still managing just about to smile .
But not even the judges are Emiratis : they 're on short - stay visas like everyone else , and the only thing he had going in his favour , he says , is that he was n't Asian .
' Tons of them are in for practically nothing : jaywalking or owing £ 10 . '
All over Dubai you see construction workers outside in the searing heat .
They 're the ones building Dubai - they live in what are openly called ' labour camps ' , have very often paid hundreds of dollars to an agency for a visa and are trapped for years until they 've paid off the debt .
The 7,500 workers on the Burj Dubai are paid $ 7.50 a day ; unskilled ones $ 4 .
It 's how globalisation works , of course .
We get to buy our cheap Primark tops because in a factory far , far away somebody is n't paid very much to make them .
But in Dubai , you see it every time you step outside .
Nick McGeehan , founder of an organisation called Mafiwasta , tells me it 's more than that .
' The difference is that the salaries paid in sweatshops in foreign countries reflect the economic weakness of that country .
Furthermore , the people who work in them go home to their families at night . '
He was an oil contractor but was so appalled at the plight of these workers that he set up Mafiwasta and is attempting to make a legal case that the UAE government is complicit in these workers ' enslavement .
He forwards an email to me he 's recently received from an Indian recruitment agent .
She 's trying to help 133 men she sent to Dubai to fulfil a contract who have n't been paid , whose passports have been confiscated , who are not just living in inhumane , insanitary conditions but had been denied even basic necessities such as drinking water .
' It 's very unusual for an agent to come forward , and even more so to have one who actually cares about what happens to the workers , ' says McGeehan .
The only recourse , he tells her , is to get it in the newspapers ...
Both Secret Dubai and Chris Davidson have fallen foul of the UAE 's censorship laws .
The Secret Dubai blog , winner of a Webby award , is blocked - along with My Space , Flickr and Friends Reunited - and Davidson 's recently published book Dubai : The Vulnerability of Success was , like Harry Potter , banned , although the ban has now been lifted .
Mostly though , the authorities rely on editors to self - censor - an even more effective weapon .
' I defy a journalist who has been here a few months , who has got their child into a school , to rock the boat , ' says Davidson .
I interview a high - profile Emirati academic , and later he rings me up and says : ' You 're not going to write anything ... critical , are you ?
Our culture is different from yours , you see .
But I did n't say anything negative , did I ?'
He points me , as several others do , toward Abdulkhaleq Abdulla , a professor of political science at Emirates university , and possibly the most outspoken person in the country .
' He says really quite remarkable things , ' the other academic tells me .
' And he gets away with it .
It 's very surprising . '
Maybe he 's fearless .
Or maybe it is , as he says , that others need to be braver .
' We have to have more accountability of the government , more criticism of the policies .
More talk about our future and where we are going .
Dubai is an amazing place .
We are so much further ahead than the rest of the Middle East , but we can't be first on social indicators and last on political ones ...
It 's an embarrassment . '
Even more than that , he says , the place needs to take a long , hard look at itself .
Because in 2015 , he estimates , Emiratis will make up 10 per cent of the population .
And in 2025 , at the same rate of growth , zero per cent .
' At the moment when we have everything , we 're in danger of losing it all - our very identity . '
I do n't go out of my way to track Palmer and Acors down .
The case is being heard this week so it 's a particularly sensitive time for them .
And anyway , they 're not really the story .
They were drunk and foolish and they might pay an exceedingly high price for their actions , but more than anything else they 're simply fallout from an ideological schism that is not of their making .
I do n't look for them , but almost everyone I meet is acquainted with one or both of them .
Palmer has been in hiding for the past two months , reportedly suffering from anxiety and panic attacks .
And Acors ?
He 's there in Long 's Bar when I visit .
In fact , he 's not just in the same bar , he 's standing drinking with the same group of friends .
I 'm all set to question him , but his friends take me aside : ' He 's just an ordinary bloke .
He wo n't talk to you .
Just leave him alone . '
So I do .
It 's true , he 's just an ordinary bloke .
In an extraordinary place .
At precisely the wrong moment in time .
· This article was amended on Monday October 13 2008 .
In the article above , we mentioned the forthcoming opening in Dubai of the ' biggest shopping mall in the world ' and incorrectly named it the Mall of Arabia ; it is , in fact , the Dubai Mall .
This has been changed .
What Else Can Be Done ?

And two - thirds of respondents said the highest - profile action Mr. McCain has made in response to the crisis  announcing that he was suspending his campaign to return to Washington and help negotiators strike a deal  had made no difference in the outcome of the talks .
The CBS News poll suggested one sharp contrast in the view of voters of Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain that might have been fed by the different ways the two men responded to the crisis .
Forty - five percent said Mr. McCain acted too quickly when he made a decision , compared with 29 percent who said he did not act quickly enough .
For Mr. Obama , 23 percent said he acted too quickly , compared with 41 percent who said he did not act quickly enough .
The national poll findings by CBS News were echoed in polls released Tuesday by Time magazine and the Pew Research Center .
Perhaps more problematic for Mr. McCain were polls , also taken after the debate and in the midst of the financial crisis , suggesting problems for him in critical states , including Florida and Ohio , which President Bush won in 2004 and which Mr. McCain had been confident of holding , and Pennsylvania , a state that Democrats won last time and that Mr. McCain has put on the top of the list of states he has been trying to win .

Polls by Quinnipiac University , taken Saturday through Monday , showed Mr. Obama ahead in Florida , Ohio and Pennsylvania .
The Time / CNN battleground polls also showed Mr. Obama with a lead in Minnesota and Virginia , a state that has been on the top of the pickup lists for Mr. Obama .
The CBS News national survey suggested a toxic atmosphere for incumbents in general , but particularly for Republicans .
The approval rating for Congress is down to 15 percent , another historic low for the Times / CBS News poll .
The CBS News poll found economic anxiety among Americans as high as it has ever been in the history of the poll .
Nine in 10 Americans said the economy was in very bad or fairly bad shape , the highest measure on that score since The Times and CBS News began asking the question in September 1986 .
( The percentage who said that the economy was in very good shape was less than 1 percent . )
And the number of Americans who thought the economy was getting worse , 76 percent , set another record : the gloomiest Americans have been since the question was first asked in April 1974 .

Patients claim they have been left in pain following a decision to make it harder to get a commonly used drug .
Specialists said painkiller coproxamol was responsible for hundreds of fatal overdoses a year .
The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency removed the drug 's licence in January , although this did not mean a complete prescribing ban .
However , some patients say alternatives do not work , and their GPs are not prepared to offer an unlicensed drug .
The drug , a mixture of paracetamol and an opioid drug , has been available since the 1960s , but its licence was withdrawn because it was too easy to overdose on it .
Coproxamol has been linked to fatal overdoses
This still gave GPs the option to prescribe it " off- licence " , although this is considered a greater legal risk in the event of side - effects or complications .
However , for some patients - such as those with chronic back pain , arthritis , or sciatica - coproxamol was the most effective drug available .
Jenny Purle , who was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis at just 13 , can no longer get the drug , and is now in greater pain than before .
She said : " I 've got about a dozen and they 're like gold dust to me .
If I 'm at screaming point then I will take a couple .
" Coproxamol was n't a magic wand - but it was the closest thing I had . "
She now has to take a cocktail of drugs to control her pain .
" I am taking pills to counter - act the pills , to counter - act the pills .
How far do you take it ? "
The charity Arthritis Care said it received calls from patients with no effective alternative to coproxamol .
A spokesperson said : " We urge the MHRA to consider re-licencing coproxamol for these people or at the very least , progress must be made on ensuring people can access it on a named - patient basis .
" Otherwise many people will be looking at a bleak future of unrelenting pain . "
Fatal risk However , Professor Nick Bateman , from the University of Edinburgh , backed the decision to remove the licence .
" The truth is that in the UK for the past 10 years or more somewhere between 200 and 300 people have been dying every year from accidental ingestion , perhaps from overdose , many of them old or confused or vulnerable young people - often people who were n't actually prescribed the drug at all - and that 's the target of this change . "
Dr June Raine , from the MHRA , said that the move was already saving hundreds of lives a year , and denied that doctors were confused about its status .
She said : " We have always accepted that some patients will need co-proxamol , and that is why supplies are being assured .
" The doctor has to make a judgement that using the drug is in the patient 's best interests . "
GP Rosemary Leonard , who sat on the expert panel which eventually decided to remove coproxamol 's licence , is continuing to prescribe the drug to some of her patients , even though the cost to her primary care trust has risen from 20 p a box to £ 20 a box since the change .
She said that the lives saved had to be balanced against the likely increase in the number of patients who needed hospital treatment for stomach problems as a result of taking anti-inflammatory painkillers such as ibuprofen as an alternative .
Your comments : I have taken coproxamol in the past during severe arthritis flare - ups and it's the only thing which helped me .
Arthritic pain is draining and constant and I seriously question whether those who made the decision have ever experienced such pain .
When it is so constant you start to become very despondent about life and can slip into a depression , how is that beneficial ?
Claire , Buckinghamshire After I had my babies by caesarean ( 15 - 20 years ago ) , I took coproxamol for the post - operation pain .
Coproxamol was the only thing that worked - nothing else came close .
I feel sorry for those people who need coproxamol and cannot get hold of it .
Susan , Hertfordshire I take this drug as I suffer from osteoarthritis and will be in very severe pain without it .
Ibuprofen is no good to me as it burns my stomach causing severe problems .
I 've tried other painkillers to no avail so all that 's left for me is codeine or morphine which I am reluctant to take .
This is another ploy for the government to save money as there are so many people reliant on these drugs .
David , Edinburgh I have suffered with rheumatoid arthritis since the age of five and was first prescribed coproxamol in the mid seventies .
It is an excellent painkiller and enabled me to cope and continue to go to school .
I am now 46 , I still have rheumatoid arthritis , it never goes away and the only effective painkiller I have ever used is coproxamol .
It seems so unfair , when life is already a struggle to have one of my major resources removed .
I have managed my own drug regime since I was 12 years old , now me and thousands like me are told we can not be trusted .
Debbie , Cheshire I suffer from intermittent back pain and last had a bad episode about three months ago when the doctor agreed to prescribe me coproxamol .
Not only that , she prescribed me two boxes of 100 each .
When I had to go and see the emergency doctor a few days later as the pain got worse , she could not believe I had been prescribed so many .
Richard , Bathgate I do n't take coproxamol but I have been asked to prescribe it .
Our politicians think that they can design out every risk with a new law .
They forget that anyone seriously wanting to kill themselves will find a way .
The problem for me is that the change in the regulations has raised the cost of a packet of 100 coproxamol tablets from less than £ 2 to almost £ 30 .
Is that cost effective for our drugs budgets when there are certainly some people who do better with this drug than others available ?
Philip , Crowborough I have suffered with sciatica for years but am still relatively young with a young child .
I have a supply of coproxamol from years ago which I am using since my other effective pain killer was also banned , for the perfectly laudable reasons that it increased the risk of heart attack .
Whether through side effects , self - poisoning or accidental overdose , powerful drugs will result in regrettable fatalities but this leaves a great many of us - who can accept the risks in exchange for a better quality of life - debilitated and in constant , ever more severe pain as our effective pain relief is denied us .

Posted on Sep 25 , 2008 in Barack Obama , Campaign '08
Poll Position : WTF is Up With the Numbers Lately ?
A quick look at today ’s polls at Real Clear Politics reveal numbers going in every direction for both candidates .
While some polls have Senator Obama leading in the 4 - 6 point range , others have the race tied or McCain ahead by a couple points .
With that in mind , one can safely cast aside the stupid and plain idiotic theory posited by some Democrats that McCain put his campaign on hold as a stunt due to sagging poll numbers .
Generally speaking I find polls useful tools in gauging the overall picture of the race .
However , in the past few days it seems the numbers have gone crazy .
I have looked at about a ten national polls from the past few days to determine whether there appears to be some discrepancy with the methodology or samples sizes to explain the larger than usual point spreads .

MSNBC Brain Trust Discusses Bad Polling
The only pattern that I discerned was that McCain tends to do a little better with polls that have over / under age brackets closer to 50/50 .
In other words , in polls that sample voters 50 years or older in about equal numbers as those who are younger McCain generally does better .
In polls that sample 49 year - olds and under in around the 55 % sample range Obama does better .
So , if one can make a predication it would be that if voter turnout plays out as it has in past Presidential elections , that is age 50 and over constitute close to 60 % of the actual electorate , McCain will most likely win .
However , if Obama ’s efforts at increasing the youth vote pan - out he will win .
So how does that help us right now regarding the current polls with uneven samples and different methodologies ?
It does n’t .
Just rest assured that the race is close and barring a melt - down during the debates it will remain close to the very end .

What every father should know about taking the “ high road ”
by Amy Baker
As your family life turns into family strife and you make that change from a married man to a recently separated soon to be divorced man , you probably have a lot on your mind and on your plate .
Most likely , at the top of your list of concerns is maintaining a relationship with your children as your family undergoes a major shift .
Hopefully , you will never experience a particularly problematic aspect of post divorce life , known as parental alienation .
However , it is important that you know about problem so that you can quickly identify it , should you need to .
Parental alienation ( PA ) is a set of actions and attitudes exhibited by one parent ( the alienating parent ) with the purpose of undermining and interfering with a child ’s relationship with his or her other parent ( the targeted parent ) .
There are countless ways in which one parent can try to poison a child against the other parent and many parents exhibit some of these behaviors at some point because there is so much hurt and anger experienced during this transition time However , only a subset of parents use parental alienation strategies in a concerted intentional effort to destroy the child ’s relationship with the other parent .
These parents employ a full range of strategies on an ongoing basis .
Examples include the following :
Badmouthing the targeted parent by constantly highlighting for the child flaws or mistakes he or she has made and sometimes even making up stories and lies to put the targeted parent in the most unfavorable light .
Interfering with contact between the child and the targeted parent by refusing to produce the child for scheduled parenting time and cutting short parenting time with early pick - ups or late drop - offs .
Interfering with communication between the child and the targeted parent by throwing out letters and cards , hanging up on the targeted parent when s/he tries to contact the child , not letting the child come to the phone , and not passing on messages .
Interfering with symbolic communication between the child and the targeted parent by throwing out all photographs of that parent and not allowing the child to talk about that parent .
These are just some of the numerous strategies that alienating parents can use .
Unfortunately , some children exposed to parental alienation behaviors eventually succumb to the pressure placed on them through these emotional manipulations and ally themselves with the alienating parent against the targeted parent .
When this happens – in the absence of abuse or neglect on the part of the targeted parent — parental alienation syndrome ( PAS ) has occurred in the child .
PAS is considered a syndrome because children who experience it typically exhibit a set of related symptoms that extend beyond the simple rejection of one parent in favor of the other .
According to Dr. Richard Gardner , who coined the term PAS , the 8 symptoms include :
A campaign of denigration against the targeted parent in which the child comes to hate and / or fear that parent , when there is no reason for these feelings .
That is , the targeted parent has not abused or neglected the child .
When asked to explain this sudden rejection of the targeted parent , an alienated child will provide reasons that are weak , frivolous , and absurd .
The explanations for the rejection are often not of the magnitude that would typically lead a child to reject a parent , such as a parent not allowing a child to nap on the couch or serving spicy food to the child .
An alienated child exhibits a complete lack of ambivalence about the alienating parent .
The child demonstrates automatic , reflexive , idealized support of that parent .
When asked to name one thing that is imperfect about that parent , the child will draw a complete blank .
Even though an alienated child will give the appearance of being programmed or following a script , s/he will refuse to admit any outside influence on his / her behavior and actions .
This is what is known as the “ Independent Thinker ” phenomenon .
An alienated child will not appear to feel any guilt about the poor treatment of the targeted parent .
An alienated child will generally behave as if the targeted parent has no feelings and is completely unworthy of common human decency .
An alienated child may reject all gifts from the targeted parent or accept gifts but refuse to show appreciation by declaring that the targeted parent does not deserve it .
The sixth manifestation of PAS is that an alienated child will always side with the alienating parent against the targeted parent even when there is no rational basis for doing so .
There is no willingness or attempt to be impartial when faced with inter-parental conflicts .
The child concludes that the alienating parent is always right and the targeted parent is always wrong , even when there is considerable evidence to the contrary .
When speaking about both parents , the alienated child will use phrases and ideas adopted wholesale from the alienating parent , even when the child does not seem to grasp the meaning of the words and cannot define them .
This is referred to as the use of borrowed scenarios and is what gives parental alienation syndrome the appearance of brainwashing .
The final sign of parental alienation syndrome is that the hatred of the targeted parent spreads to his or her extended family .
Not only is the targeted parent denigrated , despised , and avoided but so too are this parent ’s entire family .
Formerly beloved grandparents , aunts , uncles and cousins are suddenly avoided and rejected .
The family is treated as if it has an infectious disease that is to be avoided at all costs .
Alienated children have been known to avoid important family functions such as birthdays , weddings , and even funerals of relatives with whom the child had once been quite close .
If you believe that your ex or soon - to - be - ex is using some or all of the parental alienation strategies , you need to act , before your child exhibits most or all of these PAS symptoms .
You may believe that the only recourse short of engaging in a parental alienation campaign of your own is to take the “ high road ” in which you never point out the mistakes of the other parent , you never say anything bad about that other parent , and you do n’t engage in any direct confrontation in front of the children because you do n’t want to inflame the situation .
Many parents who have taken this high road , conclude that the best course of action is no action .
However , experts in the field concur that there is more to the high road than doing nothing and that sometimes those who interpret the high road as doing nothing become either depressed because they feel helpless and hopeless as the situation deteriorates or they become overly reactive and angry as they suffer one frustration and indignity after another .
In order to avoid these common mistakes , it is suggested that you become fully educated and informed about parental alienation and parental alienation syndrome , you get as much support and counseling as you can , you become willing to look at yourself and make sure that you are not triggering your ex or creating your own problems with your children , and avail yourself of the best mental health and legal advice you can possibly obtain , ideally from professionals who are familiar with and trained in issues related to parental alienation .
In addition , you may find a paper by Baker and Fine ( 2008 ) helpful , in which they offer specific and concrete suggestions for responding to parental alienation tactics , while staying on the high road .

A simple memory trick has helped show UC Davis researchers how an area of the brain called the perirhinal cortex can contribute to forming memories .
The finding expands our understanding of how those brain areas that form memories are organized .
The brain puts together different items -- the what , who , where and when -- to form a complete memory .
It was previously thought that this association process occurred entirely in a brain structure called the hippocampus , but this appears not to be the case , said Charan Ranganath , a professor at the UC Davis Center for Neuroscience and the Department of Psychology who led the research .
" We want to know how the brain areas that encode memory are organized , " Ranganath said .
" If your memory is affected by aging or Alzheimer 's disease , is there a way to learn that can capitalize on the brain structures that may still be working well ? "
Ranganath , along with graduate student Andrew Logan Haskins , Andrew Yonelinas , a UC Davis psychology professor and associate director of the Center for Mind and Brain , and Joel Quamme , a former UC Davis graduate student now at Princeton University , used functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) to see which parts of the brain were active when volunteers memorized pairs of words such as " motor / bear " or " liver / tree . "
In this experiment , the volunteers either learned the pairs as separate words that could be fitted into a sentence , or as a new compound word , for example " motorbear , " defined as a motorized stuffed toy .
" It 's a sort of memory trick , " Ranganath said .
When volunteers memorized word pairs as a compound word , the perirhinal cortex lit up , and this activity predicted whether the volunteers would be able to successfully remember the pairs in the future .
The results suggest that the perirhinal cortex probably can form simple associations , such as between the parts of a complex object .
This information is probably passed up to the hippocampus , which may create more complex memories , such as the place and time a specific object was seen .
The research , which was funded by grants from the National Institutes of Health , is published Aug. 28 in the journal Neuron .
Marital problems have started contributing to stress in a very big way .
Day in and day out we hear people succumbing to marital problems with the growing numbers of suicides among married people especially males .
As per suicide statistics provided by National Crime Records Bureau , for the years 2005 and 2006 , close to 52 , 000 and 56 , 000 married men committed suicide respectively .
And the same years noted a splurge in the number of dowry harassment cases filed as reflected in the number of such cases filed – 58319 and 63128 .
Coupled with that , if a study conducted by Center for Social Research on the conviction rate of such cases is anything to go by , it shockingly reveals that there is only 2 % conviction in such cases .
This means 98 % of such cases are false , and thus a false claim of dowry harassment was made .
Not only that , based on that false statement , the husband and his entire family was arrested , put behind bars , made to cough out huge amounts to get a bail and had no choice but to fight a legal battle in an otherwise defunct and dead judicial outreach and was also subjected to malicious prosecution .
For the charge of dowry harassment being false , the concocted stories of alleged torture would also bear no ground .
Having thus said , section 498A IPC , being heavily misused has actually turned out into an assassin ’s weapon rather a protector ’s shield as rightly pointed out by the Honorable Supreme Court of India .
Instead of making families , it is breaking families , for any woman who has falsely implicated her husband and in – laws in a false criminal case has lost their trust and the marriage has been dead for all practical purposes .
A recent study in Mumbai claimed 40 % of marriages registered in Mumbai end in a divorce .
And most of such cases involve filing of a false dowry case in order to get a quick divorce with a hefty alimony .
Unscrupulous girls , supported by ill – minded parents , especially mother , pampered by a biased legal system who is highly de – sensitized to husbands ( read married men ) have found this as a very easy way to earn tax – free money .
And to add to that all of those so called marriages have been performed on some auspicious date / time in consultation with some purohit / pundit etc .
When marriages could last so strongly for ages down the memory lane , and those too were conducted on some auspicious date / time in consultation with some purohit / pundit etc. , what has changed so drastically in recent times that marriages have become a source of business opportunity for women and a source of ignominy and stress for men ?
Save Indian Family Foundation , the single largest NGO committed to the cause of spreading the message of Gender Equity and Family Harmony in addition to providing free legal , moral and psychological support to the victims of false dowry harassment and Domestic Violence cases , receives on an average of 200 calls a week over its various help lines spread all over India and abroad as well from battered and harassed men who are either victims of the misuse of these laws or are subjected to Domestic Violence at the hands of their wives .
Have we come of the time to consult a lawyer rather than a pundit or a purohit to decide a marital knot ?
Especially a male does need to do so before tying the knot .
For if the marriage does not work ( which is quite possible in today ’s dynamic socio – economic scenario ) , he will have to bear the brunt of the fallacy .
A false case lodged with the help of the corrupt police force , sleeping judiciary and mercenary lawyers robs the man of his health , wealth , life , career and happiness .
Even with a low conviction rate , the mental trauma that the man and his family including his mother and sisters and his father and other relatives undergo cannot be described in words and is by no means less than actual conviction .
But does life end there ?
Is the end of marriage , the end of life ?
Perhaps yes , but probably no .
Looking at the alarmingly high and surprisingly suppressed suicide statistics of married males as mentioned in the first paragraph , it is probably true that for married males , end of marriage is end of life .
But seeing the spirits of a few thousand volunteers at Save Indian Family Foundation , reality shifts .
Here people have not only gathered strength to fight against the system and stride against the tide , but have also developed high amount of positivity in their life and learned to remain happy despite a despicable and pathetic married life .
Marriage can definitely be the first step towards family foundation but cannot substitute life itself .
Life is too big and diverse and there are many things to be done in life than to waste it in crying over the split milk called a bad marriage .
Like the volunteers at Save Indian Family Foundation has taken cudgels against not only the biased laws and their faulty implementation but also against the mindset that a woman will not break away from a marriage without justifiable reason .
This is a bitter truth which the society needs to know , imbibe and live with it , till the time it refuses to change itself .

For a blockbuster movie that claims to be the first to show the warts - and - all horror of what has been described as Germany 's biggest post - war tragedy , the beginning of The Baader Meinhof Complex is disarmingly innocuous .
The film opens with shots of the idyllic playground of Germany 's rich and famous , the North Sea holiday island of Sylt .
It is the late 1960s and a newly married couple from a wealthy Hamburg background are shown cavorting about on the lawn of a luxury seaside home .
The bride is Ulrike Meinhof , the woman whose name was soon to become synonymous with post - war Germany 's radical , left - wing , Red Army Faction terrorist gang .
Yet , at that stage in her career , she looks like a society debutante on her way to a coming out party .
Within minutes , the images switch to a scene on the streets of capitalist West Berlin in the early summer of 1967 .
Lying in the road is the student Benno Ohnesorg , an innocent bystander who was shot dead by police during violent left - wing protests that coincided with the Shah of Persia 's visit to the city earlier that day .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
In the folklore of the German left , Ohnesorg 's shooting was the catalyst that inspired a generation of young West Germans to rise up against a parents ' generation which was seen to have failed to meet its moral obligation own up to the country 's Nazi past .
Ohnesorg was seen as the first victim of a resurgent fascist state .
Not only Joschka Fischer , Germany 's former Green foreign minister , then a radical left - wing firebrand , but even wealthy debutantes like Meinhof rallied to the cause .
But what followed was something that perhaps could only have happened in the Germany of the late 1960s .
In their efforts to achieve their aim , a radical offshoot of the country 's anti-American , anti-establishment left started to employ tactics that were just as fanatical and violent as those of their perceived Nazi enemies .
The Baader - Meinhof gang which took its name from Ulrike Meinhof and the radical left - wing activist Andreas Baader went on to become Germany 's feared Red Army Faction of RAF .
For nearly three decades , the terrorist organisation traumatised post - war West Germany as it waged war on what it claimed was a morally bankrupt state .
The gang started out in the late 1960s by lighting fires in department stores to protest against consumerism .
But , by the end of the 70s , it had carried out dozens of kidnappings , bombings and shootings in which 33 people were killed , many of them prominent bankers , businessmen , industrialists and other members of the German establishment
The RAF 's campaign reached its height in 1977 when the gang kidnapped the industrialist Hanns Martin Schleyer and hijacked a Lufthansa airliner and flew it to Mogadishu .
The incidents presented the West German government , led by Chancellor Helmut Schmidt , with its worst crisis since the Second World War .
A second RAF generation continued the organisation 's campaign right up until 1998 when the group officially disbanded .
Christian Klar , one of the RAF 's last unrepentant members , is still in prison .
There is a debate about whether he should be officially pardoned even though , like many other former RAF members , he has refused to show remorse or publicly apologise for his crimes .
The Baader Meinhof Complex which goes on general release in Germany today is an attempt to do justice to this dark chapter of recent history .
The film 's producer , Bernd Eichinger , won fame with his taboo - breaking portrayal of Hitler 's last days in his besieged Berlin bunker , the box office hit Downfall , released in 2004 .

His film about the Baader - Meinhof gang , is reputed to be the most expensive German movie ever made and is based on a book by Stefan Aust , until recently the editor of Germany 's Der Spiegel magazine .
The production has been selected as Germany 's Oscar entry and glowing proclamations that the film " destroys the myth of the RAF " and it " finally stops seeing them as they never were " have been plastered across the cover of Aust 's news magazine weeks ahead of today 's debut .
Watch the German trailer for the film
Germany 's Red Army Faction , may not have won its war on the West German state but , at its height , it managed to polarise West German society .
Its campaign pitched the established right , championed by Germany 's mass circulation Bild newspaper , against a 1968 generation of young , left - leaning idealists .
Many argue that the RAF has remained surrounded by a fog of misleading " terrorist chic " ever since .
Some left - wing intellectuals still argue that the Baader - Meinhof gang prevented a resurgence of Nazism .
Previous films about the gang have portrayed its members with a degree of sympathy .
The brutality of their kidnappings , aircraft hijackings and cold - blooded murders was played down , their perceived role as victims of a morally bankrupt society emphasised .
One recent television film by the director Christoph Roth portrayed Andreas Baader as an eminently " cool " fashion - conscious terrorist concerned about his jeans and the cars that he hijacked .
T - shirts emblazoned with a " Prada Meinhof " slogan or images of the gang 's Heckler & Koch machine guns were all the rage among German 20 - year - olds only a couple of years ago
The Baader Meinhof Complex breaks radically with that tradition .
In one scene , a fanatical RAF woman is shown wheeling a pram across a zebra crossing to stop the car of a prominent member of West German society .
She then pulls a machine gun out of the pram and pumps bullets into the vehicle .
The approach has received warm praise from official bodies such as Germany 's Federal Agency for Civic Education .
" Until now , films tended to make heroes out of the main character in the RAF , " said Thomas Krüger , its president .
" This is a bloodstain that soaks a strain of German history and it needs to be confronted honestly , " he added .
But the film has been fiercely attacked by critics for its obsession with violence .
The children of Baader Meinhof gang members and their victims have described it as tasteless hero worship and even some former terrorists have complained that the production is merely a callous attempt to reap maximum box office profits .
Mr Eichinger insists such explicit depictions of violence are essential .
" People are judged by their deeds and not by their motives , " he insisted , " That is why we have made a film about what they did , " he added .
Jörg Schleyer , the son of the industrialist who was kidnapped and murdered by the RAF , has welcomed Eichinger 's approach .
" You see how my father 's chauffeur and another passenger in the car were just slaughtered , " he said .
" It hurt me to watch it but it is the only way to make clear to young people how brutal and bloodthirsty the RAF was at the time . "
If you 're seriously considering a MacBook over a MacBook Pro , one of the major sniggles is the fact that it no longer has FireWire , an omission seemingly designed to stratify the more - alike - than - ever models .
So , it 's natural users would take to the Apple forums to talk it out ( or , let 's be real , bitch ) .
But Apple is n't having any of that apparently : MacFixIt is reporting that Apple is yanking threads from its forums that talk about the lack of FireWire on the new MacBooks .
Of course , there 's the possibility that these threads just contain complaints and not actual discussion questions , and that 's the reason they were deleted .

Says one of their readers :
Apparently , Apple does n't want anybody talking about the lack of FireWire ports on the new MacBooks , because they keep deleting every thread that people are posting about the lack of FireWire ports on the New MacBooks !
I was participating in 3 different threads on the Apple Discussion Boards regarding the lack of FireWire from the new MacBooks , and Apple has removed every single thread regarding this topic .
There are no threads left on the Apple Discussion Boards regarding this issue ! "

Yes , it 's possible that these threads were totally unproductive circle jerks , but there are legitimate technical issues to discuss here — workarounds for Target Disk Mode , what to do with FireWire cameras , etc. , so if they 're deleting every thread , it 's definitely overboard .
The official Apple word from an employee in at least one thread though , regarding how no FireWire gimps out some camcorders with iMovie ' 08 , is that " USB is the preferred interface for iMovie ' 08 . "
You know , even though a ton of cameras use FireWire .
Apple might not let users talk about the loss of FireWire , but their message seems to be loud and clear : Deal with it .

The Hacker 's Choice ( THC ) has released details of a procedure that allows you to " create a backup of your own passport chip (s ) " - or , if you were that way inclined , use a modified chip to build a fake ePassport that will not be detected by at least some passport readers .
THC offers a video of " Elvis 's " passport being approved by a reader at Amsterdam airport .
Note that the reader is a public verification terminal , not one at a border check , so there 's no illegal act being committed , nor does the video prove that a fake ePassport could get through a border .
But could that happen ?
THC provides a walk through of the process of producing a viable clone of an ePassport chip , and of producing one with altered data that will still be passed by machines of similar capabilities to the one at Amsterdam airport .
The procedure builds on - and cites - earlier work by Adam Laurie ( tools to read the chip 's content ) and Jeroen van Beek 's demo at BlackHat this year .
Updated ( i.e. , altered ) chip data is then signed using Peter Gutmann 's CryptLib .
What you would then have - if , that is , you would ever do such a thing - is a spoof ( say , Elvis ' ) or forged ePassport that would pass some readers , but not all of them .
But Entrust , which handles PKI security for ePassports , doubts that any of these readers will ever show up at a live border checkpoint .
" It 's exceedingly unlikely , " says PKI product manager Mark Joynes , arguing that the equipment used by van Beek for his demo is intended for test and development purposes , not for border deployment .
" Governments ' security experts are n't dummies and they are n't going to make those mistakes . "
Jeroen van Beek 's presentation gives a run down of how this particular class of equipment can be fooled , while the University of Amsterdam 's SNE / OS3 site explains what 's going on in more detail .
By manipulating ePassport data an attacker can circumvent optional security features such as Active Authentication , which is itself currently used only by a limited number of countries ( current UK and US passports do not use it ) .
The existence of countries not using this feature is crucial to the exploit demonstrated , because it means that readers need to cater for ePassports that do n't have Active Authentication as a defence against cloning .
Deleting the public key of the Active Authentication key pair causes the reader to assume that Active Authentication is n't enabled for the passport , and because that 's permissible under ICAO rules - but not advisable - it does n't flag it as a problem .
For the next part of the exploit , van Beek was able to copy his own data onto a passport chip , sign it , and have it passed by the reader .
Tim Moses , senior director at Entrust 's advanced security technology group , explains that what 's failing here is not the signature , but the certificate chain .
The signature itself , he points out , is a perfectly valid one backed by a self - signed certificate , and it's the check of whether or not that certificate has been issued by a bona fide authority that is absent .
Yes , that music you hear is the sound of angels dancing on a pinhead , but nevertheless what the man says is true .
The $ 64,000 question is therefore whether or not a proper certificate check will be present at border control .
The ' official ' channel for this is the ICAO Public Key Directory ( PKD ) , but as of May only nine countries - Australia , Canada , Germany , Japan , New Zealand , Republic of Korea , Singapore , the UK , and the US - were participating , although France is likely to have joined by now .
" PKD is getting greater use than it has in the past , " says Joynes , but he confirms that these numbers sound right , and points out that the PKD is n't the only route for distribution of countries ' public keys .
The number of bilateral agreements is growing , and countries are starting to establish Certificate Trust Lists , where numbers of them are , effectively , grouped in trusted relationships .
The bottom line , says Entrust , is that the ability to validate certificates should always be present at border crossings , and there machines will set off an alert if " Elvis " attempts to get by .
Would one expect a machine such as the Amsterdam airport one , which is intended to display the content of a passport chip but not ( as OS3 itself points out ) guaranteed to verify the chip , to check certificates ?
Possibly not .
This and other weaknesses could be dealt with , Jeroen van Beek argued at BlackHat , if key security features were mandatory rather than optional , as is currently the case .
" If one party does n't use a feature , " he said , " the security level of the entire system ( globally ! ) depends on compensating measures " .
He argues that automated border control ( which is currently planned for the UK ) should only be used for ePassports with all security features enabled and that all countries should be using a trusted PKI system .
" I would n't disagree with that , " says Joynes , adding that ICAO 's recommendations and documentation nevertheless provides you with sufficient tools to implement a secure system .
Systems are insecure , he says , " where they are not implementing all of the security measures correctly . "
Which is more or less what van Beek 's been saying . ®
" DOES ANYBODY IN their right mind think that the value of American business has dropped by $ 6 trillion ? " asked investment guru John Bogle in a recent interview at Marketwatch.com .
That was a rhetorical question , but this is not :
Does anybody in their right mind object to Bogle 's grammar ?
The answer is yes , " they " do - but opposition to singular - they seems to be losing steam .
For the first time ever , a reader has e-mailed not to complain about " everybody has their quirks , " but to wonder why we do n't all use the construction .
When you need a gender - and number - inclusive pronoun , writes John McCosh , " I think they makes sense . "
Usage writers , even if they do n't think singular they has achieved respectability , agree that its day is coming .
Barbara Wallraff explains why in a post at her new blog at TheAtlantic.com : " Write ' he ' about a nonspecific person and you 're a sexist .
Write ' she ' and you 're a flaming feminist .
Write 'he or she ' and you 're a pedant .
Write ' they ' and you 're an ignoramus . "
Bryan Garner , in Garner 's Modern American Usage , says that singular they is increasingly common , and he notes that some constructions require it : " Everybody was crouched behind furniture to surprise me , and they tried . "
" Disturbing though these developments may be to purists , they 're irreversible , " writes Garner .
Like it or not , usagists agree that they and their have been referring to indefinite antecedents like everybody , nobody , and anyone - grammatically singular but plural in sense - since Chaucer 's time .
That is not because the Wife of Bath and her 14th - century feminist friends objected to being subsumed under the pronoun he .
It 's because using he to include both sexes often sounded odd to ordinary people , including writers .
It still sounded odd some 500 years later , when H.W. Fowler , in Modern English Usage , said that men and women were equally reluctant to shape up grammatically .
Some people , he said , just resisted the idea that " the right shortening of the cumbersome he or she , his or her , &c. , is he or him . "
Those resisters had history on their side .
English had prospered , messy pronouns and all , for centuries before the 18th - century grammarians decided to clean it up and sort it out .
The earliest known document stating the rule against " singular they " is - I suppose we can call this ironic - a 1745 grammar book by a woman , one Anne Fisher .
" The Masculine Person answers to the general Name , which comprehends both Male and Female ; as , any Person who knows what he says , " Fisher decreed .
But though the rule has been enforced in much edited prose , it never managed to stamp out the older notional agreement .
Bergen Evans , in A Dictionary of Contemporary American Usage ( 1957 ) , contradicted Fowler , saying that they , them , and their " may be used in speaking of a single individual whose sex is unknown , " as in " everybody brought their own lunch . "
Singular they comes up in two situations , however , and most usage commentators treat them as one .
" Did everyone bring their pen " is indeed ancient usage .
But in a recent essay , etymologist Anatoly Liberman argues that when the antecedent is not an indefinite pronoun but a noun - " A student must bring their pen " - it does not deserve the same respect .
" This usage did not develop naturally ( it was forced on English ) , " he charged in his weekly etymology column at the Oxford University Press website .
Liberman thinks the anti-sexism forces are sneaking nouns like student , tenant , and hero into the generic category , pretending that they are as plausibly plural as anyone and nobody , and just as appropriately referred to with they and their .
And he strenuously objects .
But is it really sneaking ?
Even when the noun - pronoun disagreement is made plain , some usage writers embrace the form .
Bill Walsh , in " Lapsing Into a Comma , " offers the sentence " Every music lover has their own favorite album " for our consideration .
He calls it " grammatically incorrect ( for now ) but intuitively plausible and rather tempting . "
Garner says this kind of construction is " Either a common blunder , or a godsend that allows us to avoid sexism . "
And if political pressure has increased acceptance of the usage , why should that make it suspect ?
Every generation learns that some once - common usages are no longer socially acceptable , whether they 're racial slurs or religious taboos or the much - missed " ai n't I . "
But I 'm not convinced feminism alone accounts for the spread of the noun- pronoun mismatch .
As Fowler noted , reality exerts its own pressure on grammar ; many speakers , referring to a generic " student " or " tenant " or " hero , " might choose the pronoun they or their to avoid not the sexism of he or his but the inaccuracy of the male pronoun .
And of course , this is English we 're speaking , language of pure democracy .
Nobody can make you say " Everyone should bring their pencils " if you have a different preference .
To each his ( or her , or his and her , or their ) own .

Auto Industry Desperation : “ Small Cars Are Disposable and Bad for the Environment ”
The auto industry is beginning to look more and more like a crooked politician with lies and deceptive statistics .
Everyone knows the industry is hurting recently : gas prices are up , vehicle miles are down , people are buying less , and people are buying smaller .
All of this means that car companies are making a lot less money than they used to .
Environmental concern is definitely a big player here , but when you consider that hybrid sales are also down a considerable amount this year , it ’s obvious that the current ill state of the auto market is a result of a global economic downturn .
The industry is getting desperate
Why do I say this ?
My partner on the EcoModder forums sent me this link , telling me it would be worth writing about it .
To be honest , I did n’t even read it for a few days , but now I ’m glad that I did .
There ’s no denying that people are becoming more and more concerned with the environment , but instead of selling hybrids , the industry is trying to twist that environmental concern into sales of big cars and trucks :
“ Small cars do n’t last , ” DesRosiers says .
“ They fail to retain value , utility or desirability . ”
And while longevity may not be a sexy subject , it stands to reason that if some vehicles are useful longer than others , what consumers save in fuel efficiency will be lost in higher capital costs .
In other words , small car buyers may be robbing Peter to pay Paul and manufacturers are just following suit .
Before the phrase “ completely idiotic ” starts to get thrown around , please keep in mind the Dennis DesRosiers is a professional industry consultant / smut peddler .
It would be a stretch to call him stupid , but the things the he tries to have us believe , at best , push to limits of truth .
Firstly , take a look at my article on how fuel efficient cars are holding value better than less fuel efficient vehicles .
If you do n’t believe me , go to kbb.com and check anything out for yourself .
Some of the larger cars may be worth more after a few years , but only after losing more value , on average , than smaller , more fuel efficient cars .
DesRosiers goes on to assert that small cars are less durable :
But according to DesRosiers and other analysts , small cars are less durable .
First off , they are built lighter .
Secondly , they are cheaper , so they attract younger drivers who tend to maintain them poorly .
They have a lower resale value , which guarantees they wo n’t trade hands many times before they are scrapped , and they ’re more likely to be written off by insurance companies if they are involved in serious collisions .
In other words , “ the useful life of the vehicle ” is as short as their wheel base , according to Erich Merkle , an automotive consultant with Crowe Chizek in Grand Rapids , Mich .
To me , it makes sense that small cars are lighter .
They ’re smaller , therefore they consume less materials , and weigh less .
And get this , they ’re smaller , therefore they consume less materials , therefore they are more environmentally friendly !
DesRosiers expects to argue that big cars go to the junkyards less frequently , but he “ conveniently forgets ” that when they do , they also send more materials to the junkyards with them .
This article also seems to imply that cars end up in some sort of landfill , rather than stripped and melted down for scrap and reused in new vehicles .
If you look at this reliability index , you will see that contrary to the assertions of this article , cars like the Honda Civic and Toyota Yaris are both in the top 6 of all cars in terms of reliability .
The article in question specifically attacks these two small cars for being the type that would end up in junkyards due to their “ lack of durability , ” but that does n’t seem to mesh with what most consumers and analysts are saying about the same cars .
Secondly , DesRosiers seems to conflate young drivers destroying their cars with the cars not being durable .
Does he seem to think that young drivers who do n’t maintain their cars would n’t be sending SUVs to the junkyard in just the same way they do small cars ?
He expects us to be too stupid or uncritical to think about these deceptions , but I hope that most of us here on EcoModder can see through it .
Now , onto his assertion that small cars just are n’t worth as much :
Comparing the entry - level Chevrolet Aveo ( 1,148 kg ) , for example , to the mid-size Chevrolet Malibu ( 1,642 kg ) , Merkle adds , “ You will get rid of the Aveo faster .
It ’s much lighter , it does n’t have the strength .
After about three years , the Malibu will be worth something ; the Aveo , no . ”
I did a little research on KBB , and comparing 2008 models with 2005 models with 45,000 models , yes , the Malibu will be “ worth something . ”
He ’s telling the truth !
The 2005 Malibu LS 4D is still worth a whopping $ 11,815 , whereas the same model of Aveo is only worth $ 9,115 .
But wait , there ’s more .
The 2008 only costs consumers $ 12,188 for that model while Malibu owners are paying $ 19,522 .
That means the Malibu has lost 40 % of its value in just three years , but the Aveo has only lost 25 % of its value .
I guess the Malibu wins the race to the bottom , not the Aveo , contrary to DesRosiers ’ suggestion about their comparative values .
So , in conclusion .
When someone who ’s paid to tell you what kind of car to buy is doing just that , use a critical eye to look for deception , because you may just find some .
I hope you all take the same approach to what I write as well .
I may not be right , but I ’m also not in the market to sell my Civic , either !

NEW YORK � ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Stocks plunged Monday , with the Dow down as much as 800 points during the session , as the $ 700 billion bank bailout plan and European government attempts to prop up faltering banks failed to comfort panicky investors .
But the Dow Jones industrial average ( INDU ) and other major indexes cut losses in the final hour .
The Dow ended down just short of 370 points .
The index fell to 9,525.32 , the index hit its lowest level during a session since Oct. 24 , 2003 , when it touched 9,497.72 .
Other indexes also cut losses in the final hour .
The Standard & Poor 's 500 ( SPX ) index , after falling to its lowest point since Sept. 12 , 2003 , ended with a loss of 3.6 % .
The Nasdaq composite ( COMP ) ended down 4 % after falling to its lowest point since Aug. 28 , 2003 during the session .
Credit markets remained tight , with two key measures of bank jitters hitting all - time highs .
Treasurys rallied , lowering the corresponding yields as investors sought safety in government debt .
Gold rallied for the same reason .
Oil dipped .
The dollar jumped versus the euro and fell against the yen .
Investors across the board are realizing that the $ 700 billion U.S. bank bailout was not a cure - all , said Dan Genter , president and CEO at RNC Genter Capital Management .
The package involves the Treasury buying bad debt directly from banks in order to get them to start lending to each other again
" Everybody thought that the bailout was a panacea .
But it 's not , it 's a tourniquet that stops the bleeding so the patient does n't die right away , " Genter said .
The plan could end up doing what it 's meant to do , but there 's a lack of trust in Congress ' ability to do this , said Scott Armiger , portfolio manager at Christiana Bank & Trust Company .
" People just do n't have faith that the government can get us out of this , " he said .
The spate of European bank rescues underlined the global nature of the crisis .
Additionally , investors were disappointed that the Federal Reserve did n't stepped in to announce an emergency interest - rate cut , said Ben Halliburton , chief investment officer at Tradition Capital Management .
" It looks like panic capitulation , but there 's no telling how long it will last , " Halliburton said .
" The concern is that we will roll into a very severe recession or even a depression . "
A CNN / Opinion Research poll showed that nearly 60 % of Americans think a depression is likely .

A measure of investor fear surged , with the CBOE Volatility index ( VIX ) , or the VIX , at a 19 - year high .
The rise shows fear on a short - term basis is rising , but not enough to signal a stock market bottom is forming , said Todd Salamone , senior VP of research at Schaeffer 's Investment Research .
" Fear is getting higher , but it 's not at panic levels that have implied major market bottoms in the past , " he said .
After the close , Wells Fargo ( WFC , Fortune 500 ) and Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) both agreed to a legal standstill in their battle for Wachovia ( WB , Fortune 500 ) .

President Bush said Monday that the purposed of the package was to loosen up the nation 's credit markets to " get money moving again . "
However , Bush said " it 's going to take a while , " for the program to start working .
" We do n't want to rush into the situation and have the program not be effective , " he said .
On Monday , the Treasury Department issued interim guidelines for hiring money managers to run the programs and for preventing conflicts of interest .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson also announced the bailout chief .

While the package should help in the longer run , it wo n't loosen up credit markets in the short term , analysts said .
With cash still scarce , investors remained on edge .
" Purchases that require financing are extremely difficult to pull off currently and that 's going to have a severe impact on the economy , " said Tradition Capital 's Halliburton .
The Federal Reserve attempted to address this Monday by making an additional $ 300 billion available to banks in return for a broad range of damaged assets .
That raises the amount available to banks to $ 600 billion as of Monday and the Fed could expand that to $ 900 billion by the end of the year .

Credit markets : Measures of bank nervousness remained at elevated levels Monday .
The difference between the 3 - month Libor and the Overnight Index Swaps rallied to an all - time high of 2.94 % before pulling back .
The Libor - OIS spread measures how much cash is available for lending between banks and is used by banks to determine rates .
The bigger the spread , the less cash is available .
Libor , the rate banks charge each other to borrow overnight , rose to 2.37 % .
But 3 - month Libor , the rate banks charge each other to borrow for three months , dipped slightly to 4.29 % from a nine - month high of 4.33 % last January , according to Bloomberg .
The TED spread , which is the difference between 3 - month Libor and what the Treasury pays for a 3 - month loan , briefly hit an all - time high of 3.95 % , before pulling back a bit .
The wider the spread , the more reluctant banks are to lend to each other rather than from the federal government .
When markets are fairly calm , banks charge each other premiums that are not much higher than the U.S. government .
The yield on the 3 - month Treasury bill , seen as the safest place to put money in the short term , fell to 0.44 % from 0.49 % late Friday , with investors willing to take a slim return on their money rather than risk stocks .
Last month , the 3 - month bill skidded to a 68 - year low around 0 % .
Long - term government debt prices gained and the yields slipped .
The benchmark 10 - year Treasury note rose 1 - 8/32 , lowering the corresponding yield to 3.45 % from 3.60 % Friday .
Treasury prices and yields move in opposite directions .

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) --
Citing extraordinary demand , the U.S. has broadened its freeze on sales of gold bullion coins in another sign that retail investors who are priced out of the futures markets have been piling up their holdings of the metal as a hedge against market uncertainty .
" Due to the extreme fluctuating market conditions for 2008 , as well as current market conditions , gold and silver demand is unprecedented and the demand for platinum is unusually high , " the U.S. Mint said in a memorandum released to its authorized purchasers .
The Mint added that it 's halting the production and sales of several gold and platinum coins while putting a few other coins under allocation sales .
The move , announced late Monday , follows a halt on sales of two other coins in September and August .
In times of economic and market turmoil , investors turn to gold as the ultimate tangible asset .
Some gold dealers have reported unprecedented demand for coins and bars as the financial crisis around the world has intensified worries about a global slowdown .
Coins for retail investors
While the bulk of the 160,000 - ton above - ground gold stock ( about 5.1 billion ounces ) is used in jewelry and the electronics industry , about 16 % is held by investors for pure investment purposes , according to the World Gold Council .
The gold investment market , however , is dominated by big institutions , which trade with one another directly in large orders through the opaque over - the - counter markets .
Gold is also traded through futures contracts in New York , Tokyo and a few other places .
Futures trading , however , requires quite a bit of capital .
One futures contract on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange , for example , represents 100 ounces of gold , or about $ 88,000 in current prices .
Gold coins provide an easier channel for retail investors , who can buy coins through dealers online , much like buying a book at Amazon.com .
Since the South African Krugerrand became available in 1967 , bullion coins have become increasingly popular among retail investors .
" Because of what 's happened in the past and what I believe is happening now [ the financial crisis ] , it is imperative you own some gold , some real gold , gold you can bite down on , gold that clanks , " said Dan Ferris , writer for DailyWealth , an investment newsletter .
The U.S. fabricated 22 - karat American Eagle coins in 1986 .
The Mint introduced the American Buffalo gold coin , the first 24 - karat gold coin in the U.S. , in 2006 .
Twenty - four karat represents a gold purity of 0.9999 .
Mint halts coins
The U.S. Mint said on Sept. 25 that it was temporarily suspending sales of American Buffalo gold 1 - ounce bullion coins .
" Demand has exceeded supply " for the coin and inventories " have been depleted , " the Mint said in a memo sent in September .
Before the Mint suspended sales of the Buffalo coin , it had sold 164,000 of the coins this year , up 54 % from the same period a year ago , according to Michael White , a spokesman at the Mint .
The Mint had to temporarily suspend sales of the 1 - ounce American Eagle gold coins on Aug. 15 .
It then announced about a week later that sales of the Eagle coins would resume under an allocation program to designated dealers .
In late Monday 's memo , the Mint said the 1 - ounce Eagle and Buffalo coins will remain on allocation .
But once the remaining inventory of the Buffalo is depleted , no more coins will be produced this year .
The Mint also announced that the inventories of the 1/2 - ounce and 1/4- ounce Eagle have been depleted last week and no more coins will be produced this year .
The 1/10 - ounce Eagle , the smallest size among the Eagle coins , was also sold out .
More coins will be produced based on current blank supplies , but " once that remaining inventory is depleted , no more coins will be produced for 2008 , " the Mint said .
The Mint , the coin-producing division of the Treasury Department , also said the 1 - ounce silver Eagle will be put under allocation , and inventories of all sizes of the platinum Eagle coins were depleted .
" Tightness in the gold market is fairly normal in a time of financial stresses , " said DailyWealth 's Ferris .
" We 've seen high demand for gold coins because the news about banks is all bad . "
Amid the financial turmoil , gold prices have rallied .
The December futures contract gained 5.5 % in September on the Comex .
In spot trading , the London gold - fixing price , used as a benchmark for prices of gold for immediate delivery , rose 6 % last month .
The London fixing stood at $ 876.75 an ounce Tuesday afternoon .
See Metals Stocks .
Coin prices track the London gold - fixing prices , with a certain percentage of premiums , as production and distribution costs have to be added .
ETFs or coins ?
But holding physical gold is n't the only choice retail investors have when they want to expand their portfolio to gold .
The buying patterns of retail investors have shifted recently because more choices have been available , such as gold exchange - traded funds and gold certificates .
" Coins and bars are seen as somewhat higher priced , less safe in terms of storage and transport and less liquid than the custodial alternatives , " said Jon Nadler , senior analyst at Kitco Bullion Dealers .
Indeed , investors are increasing their gold ETF holdings .
Gold held by the SPDR Gold Trust GLD , +0.84 % , the largest gold ETF , surged 16 % in September to 755.26 tons .
That would rank the fund as the eighth - largest worldwide in gold holdings .
The fund is holding more gold than countries such as China , Russia , and the U.K .
Ferris , however , said he did n't recommend buying ETFs when times are really bad .
" Sooner or later , it 'll become clear the ETF is not gold .
It 's a stock , " Ferris said .
" When panicking investors need to liquidate securities portfolios , they 'll sell the gold ETF with a mouse click .
Once your gold is in your hands , you 're less likely to sell into that panic . "
Thats what so many want .
Right ?
I ’m certainly not going to lie and say it is not a whole lot better having lots of money .
I had a whole lot of fun and loved my life when I was eating mustard and ketchup sandwiches and sleeping on the floor of a 3 bedroom apartment that housed me and 5 buddies .
I have a whole lot more fun now .
It does n’t suck to be rich .
The question everyone wants answered , is how to get there .
There are ways to get there .
But there is not a template that works every time for everyone .
It works sometimes .
Getting there requires being ready when opportunity presents itself .
IMHO , change and uncertainty create opportunity .
Times like we are facing now , with complete financial uncertainty are perfect times to start on the road to getting ahead financially .
First , here is WHAT NOT TO DO :
There are no shortcuts .
NONE .
With all of this craziness in the stock and financial markets , there will be scams popping up left and right .
The less money you have , the more likely someone will come at you with some scheme .
The schemes will guarantee returns , use multi level marketing , or be something crazy that is now “ backed by the US Government ” .
Please ignore them .
Always remember this .
If a deal is a great deal , they are n’t going to share it with you .
I dont broadcast my great deals .
I keep them all to myself .
The 2nd thing to remember is that if the person selling the deal was so smart , they would be rich beyond rich rather than trolling the streets looking to turn you into a sucker .
There are no shortcuts .
So what should you do to get rich ?
Save your money .
Save as much money as you possibly can .
Every penny you can .
Instead of coffee , drink water .
Instead of going to McDonalds , eat Mac and Cheese .
Cut up your credit cards .
If you use a credit card , you dont want to be rich .
The first step to getting rich , requires discipline .
If you really want to be rich , you need to find the discipline , can you ?
If you can , you will quickly find that the greatest rate of return you will earn is on your own personal spending .
Being a smart shopper is the first step to getting rich .
Yeah you have to give things up and that does n’t work for everyone , particularly if you have a family .
That is reality .
But whatever you can save , save it .
As much as you possibly can .
Then put it in 6 month CDs in the bank .
The first step to getting rich is having cash available .
You arent saving for retirement .
You are saving for the moment you need cash .
Buy and hold is a suckers game for you .
This market is a perfect example .
Right at the very moment when cash creates unbelievable opportunity , those who followed the buy and hold strategy have no cash .
they cant or wont sell into markets this low , that kills the entire point of buy and hold .
Those who have put their money in CDs sleep well at night and definitely have more money today than they did yesterday .
And because they are smart , disciplined shoppers , their personal rate of inflation is within their means .
Cash is king for those wanting to get rich
The 2nd rule for getting rich is getting smart .
Investing your time in yourself and becoming knowledgeable about the business of something you really love to do
It does n’t matter what it is .
Whatever your hobbies , interests , passions are .
Find the one you love the best and GET A JOB in the business that supports it .
It could be as a clerk , a salesperson , whatever you can find .
You have to start learning the business somewhere .
Instead of paying to go to school somewhere , you are getting paid to learn .
It may not be the perfect job , but there is no perfect path to getting rich .
Before or after work and on weekends , every single day , read everything there is to read about the business .
Go to trade shows , read the trade magazines , spend a lot of time talking to the people you do business with about their business and the people they buy from .
This is not a short term project .
We are n’t talking days .
We are n’t talking months .
We are talking years .
Lots of years and maybe decades .
I did n’t say this was a get rich quick scheme .
This is a get rich path
Now you wait for times of uncertainty and change in your business .
The time will come .
It may come quickly , it may take years and years .
But it will come .
The nature of our country ’s business infrastructure is that it is destined to be boom and bust .
Booms are when the smart people sell .
Busts are when rich people started on their path to wealth .
You will know when that time is here for you because you will know your business inside and out .
You will be ready because you will have been saving up for this moment in time
With all the change and uncertainty in the financial markets , there are people right now making more money than they ever dreamed of .
They are the ones who have been living the real estate market and the financing behind it and understanding what actually what was going on .
They re the one who understood the complexities of the credit markets .
When everyone was following the crowd , they kept on saving their money and avoiding the temptation of groupthink .
Boom and busts happen to every industry .
The question is whether you have the discipline to be ready when it happens for you ?
If you do , you will find out what it feels like to get lucky .
For more on how to get lucky , here is some additional reading for you
“ A man should hear a little music , read a little poetry , and see a fine picture every day of his life , in order that worldly cares may not obliterate the sense of the beautiful implanted in the human soul . ”

Beaver lodges , like this one in Wyoming , can help preserve local watersheds and habitat for wildlife .
The busy beaver 's iconic dams do more than hold back streams ; they also provide critical habitat to some migratory songbirds , a new study finds .
The study , detailed in the October issue of the journal Western North American Naturalist , found that through dam building , beavers create ponds and stimulate growth of diverse streamside vegetation critical for birds , including many migratory songbirds that are currently in decline .
The more dams beavers build , the more abundant and diverse local songbirds become , the study showed .
" We found that increasing density of beaver dams was associated with a diverse and abundant bird community and the wetland and streamside habitat these species depend on , " said lead study author Hilary Cooke , a graduate student at the University of Alberta in Edmonton , Canada .
A 2007 study in the journal Biological Conservation found that beaver dams are also critical to maintaining the habitats of frogs and toads .
The study , conducted in Wyoming , found that the effect was particularly important in the semi-arid interior of western North America .
“ This habitat is critical to birds in semi- arid regions yet has been severely degraded or lost through much of the West , " Cooke said .
" Our results suggest that management of beavers may be an important tool for restoring habitat and reversing bird declines . ”
Beaver populations once numbered in the millions in the American West but dramatically collapsed due to the fur trade in the 1800s .
Currently , beaver are often considered a pest species when they take down trees and flood property .
Beavers , and their dams , are missing from most watersheds in the West , but the study researchers say this and other studies have shown how critical these wood - chomping creatures are to maintaining stream ecosystems .
" Beaver are an essential ecosystem engineer , " said co-author Steve Zack of the Wildlife Conservation Society ( WCS ) , which sponsored the study .
" Beavers help repair degraded stream habitats and their dams and associated ponds recharge local water tables and create wetlands . "
Maintaining local water resources is another issue currently facing Western communities and ecosystems .
" With our changing climate likely to mean increasing droughts in the West , managing ways to allow watersheds to act more like sponges will be a challenge , " Zack said .
" Beaver are a powerful tool to be considered for that , and the associated benefits to other wildlife add to their value . ”
In 2007 , the WCS reported that they had found the first active beaver lodge seen in New York City in at least two centuries .
The lodge was discovered in the Bronx River on the grounds of the Bronx Zoo .

What 's Wrong with Western Music ?
Part III .
" Passacaglia in Cm "
By : Bernard Chazelle
A few remarks first :
Do n't waste your time " disagreeing " with me because , so far , I 've only been stating established , known facts .
Well , maybe not known to everyone and , hopefully , a few of you will find in these postings food for thought .
But please try to dial the hostility down and the civility up .
I find some of the aggressivity in the comments frankly baffling .
This blog is all about pointing out weird aspects of things we love : art , politics , humor , etc .
Those of you who still think I am trying to prove the superiority of music A over music B are missing my point entirely , and -- if I may add -- that of this blog , in general .
But many of the comments are from genuine lovers of music ( you know who you are ) who , like me , are perpetually puzzled by the mystery behind it .
Yours are the voices I want to hear above all .
Please share your thoughts and experiences , especially what and why music moves you .
Again , sounds odd to say it , but yes these are just hastily written blog posts ( like all my blog posts ) .
I discuss only a tiny corner of the musical world , the acoustic implications of harmony and the social choices they imply , and I greatly oversimplify .
Music has so many other facets .
One topic that fascinates even more than Western harmony is African rhythm , which is extremely intricate ( much more so than in Jazz ) .
It 's a world onto itself .
Anyway , let 's get cracking .
( If you spot technical mistakes , please let me know so I can correct them .
I have no time to proofread this and I apologize in advance for the sloppiness . )
Thanks .
-----------------------------------------------------
So it 's the small fractions ( 2:1 , 3:2 , 4:3 ... ) that make music the physical art form that it is .
Any true music lover knows exactly what it means to be overpowered with ecstasy while listening to [ FILL IN YOUR FAVORITE MUSICAL PIECE ] .
For me , that would be Bach 's Passacaille in Cm. ( French spelling . )
Amazing what Bach could do with 3:2 !
It 's in a minor key .
I still remember when I learned music theory and I discovered with amazement that minor and major " modes , " which sounded so emotionally different to me , were in fact the exact same notes played in the exact same sequence , just starting from a different place !
If you read Romeo and Juliet from the middle to the end , and then from the beginning to the middle , do you get a happy play ?
( Well , maybe you do ! )
When it 's all said and done , I can not think of any music that has had more power on me .... ( 6:06 - 6:30 is scary ) .
It 's personal .
My grandfather was an organist .
The sound of the organ in a big cathedral is one of my earliest childhood memories , and so the effect of that piece on me has a context .
Before he passed away , my grandfather confided to my mom that if he gets to sit between God and Bach , the afterlife should n't be so bad .
Opera lovers will tell you similar stories of ecstasy .
As will rock , blues , folk , Jazz buffs .
I do n't know enough about the visual arts to know if there 's an equivalent .
Can a painting cause people to stop breathing ?
I am curious to hear your experience .
I played guitar in local rock & blues bands for many years .
I can't count the number of times we'd look at each other while playing and think the same thought " How can living be so pleasurable ? "
Music buffs know exactly what I am talking about .
If you have n't experienced the overwhelming physical power of music , you just do n't know what you 're missing .
This post is long , so you might want to let Bach make it more tolerable .
Some oppose on principle the concept of playing music and doing work at the same time .
( Not that reading this is work . )
They 're idiots .
Life is finite and I have thousands of Jazz CDs to listen to before I die .
( And I am very lucky to have a job that allows me " music at work . " )
What Bach can do with small fractions is staggering .
But he was the ultimate music genius ( sad to think it peaked just as it got really started ) and to draw from his example the lesson that pretty intervals properly placed makes great music would be a serious mistake .
Humans are complex beasts .
Sometimes pleasure is enhanced when it follows pain .
In the end , make no mistake , music is about pleasure .
But pleasure is a tricky thing .
Too much of 3:2 and 4:3 will numb you .
Muzak is " pretty . "
So what ?
And so perhaps preceding a 3:2 with a dissonance will sometimes enhance it .
For example , take the tritone C- F# .
It 's a fascinating interval : its ratio is sqrt ( 2 ) : 1 , which means that , if you take the tritone of a tritone , you get an octave .
The math is simple :
( sqrt ( 2 ) :1 ) *( sqrt ( 2 ) :1 ) = 2:1 .
Millions of years of evolution have made your ear into a giant logarithm table ( no one knows why for sure ) , so when air goes sqrt ( 2 ) of the way through its natural period , your ear thinks it goes log( sqrt ( 2 ) ) / log ( 2 ) = one - half of the way .
So the tritone is very natural .
Trouble is , as a small fraction , it sucks .
First of all , sqrt ( 2 ) is irrational , which means ?
Well , which means precisely that it cannot be expressed as a fraction .
A close approximation might be 45:32 .
But , hey , that 's awfully close to the subdominant 4:3 !
Remember my chocolate sundae metaphor .
The fraction 45:32 sounds horrible because it 's so close to 4:3 yet so far !
But then why is the tritone used all the time , not just in jazz and rock , but also in 19 -c and 20 - c classical music ?
Being half an octave means that your brain treats it as not just a horrible dissonance but a very special one !
So if you 're going to use dissonance to prepare the grounds for higher pleasures , then a tritone might be the ideal candidate .
Renaissance musicians hated it and called it a " Satanic interval , " which of course implied their recognition of its special status .
( Not every random asshole gets to be Satan ! )
Bach used it to create tension that only a motion to the root chord could resolve .
In the 19th century it was used to modulate ( more on that below ) .
The idea was this : I am tired of meat so I 'm going to yank that steak from your plate and replace it by a piece of fish .
But I do n't want you to scream WTF when I do that , so I 'll distract you by yelling :
Oh my God , did you see the flying pig over your head ?
And when you look up , pronto , I switch your dish .
Then you 'll eat your fish all happy without even realizing the change .
The tritone is the flying pig .
Wagner was a fanatic flying pig farmer , an obsessive modulator : he could easily change your dish every two measures for 10 minutes .
( Trust me , with too much of that , you would invade Poland , too ! )
Think of dissonance as the word " fuck " in comedy .
It can be used to transgress , to liberate , to ridicule , to humanize , to bring down to earth , to change topics .
In " Curb Your Enthusiasm , " Elaine has a cameo appearance where she says fuck all the time .
People ask her :
Why are you saying fuck all the time ?
She replies : " Because I 'm on HBO . "
By that she means to expose the hypocrisy of network TV .
( As though American kids do n't hear ' fuck ' at school all the time that they have to be " protected " on TV . )
In " Last Tango in Paris , " this is how Marlon Brando asks for forgiveness for the love he failed to give his now - deceased wife .
He addresses her in her open coffin :
" You cheap goddamn fucking God - forsaken whore , I hope you rot in hell , you lying cunt ! "
These are the necessary dissonances , if you will , of a scene that captures despair as poignantly and powerfully as film ever has .
" You , lying cunt " is an eloquent affirmation of love .
You have to see it to believe it , but this scene will leave you in tears .
The dissonance works .
But it works because it 's great art .
In any other context , it stinks .
Art can make the stinky sublime .
And , in music , bad sounds help you make it happen .
Life is a bitch , and sooner or later , believe you me , you 'll need your tritones to get by , you 'll need your Satanic intervals to make it through the day .
But here 's the thing : you also need a purpose .
A stand - up comic who thinks of " fuck " as a " comedic enhancer " does not get it : " 2+2 is 4 " is not funny , but " 2+2 is fucking 4 " is not funny either .
Dissonances should be in your music and , hopefully in your life , only where and when you need them .
The artist has to feel the necessity of them , else it 's manipulation .
Good , but now , if deep inside you really wished you had 3:2 but your technology or your culture imposed , say , 31:20 , then it would be wrong .
How can denying an artist her creative need be called right ?
Keep this in mind .
I 'll get back to it .
Change of scenery : Scales .
You need them .
Between 1:1 and 2:1 you need to specify special points ( ie , notes ) that you favor .
You need them for many reasons .
One of them is technological : many instruments can not be built otherwise .
But there 's a more fundamental reason : writing down music on paper .
Before the age of recording , people could learn music by oral transmission ( but that does not work well for complex instruments ) or by reading it .
But to read it , you have to write it first .
And to write it , you need an alphabet .
Western music chose an alphabet of 12 letters ( the 7 white keys on your piano between two Cs plus the 5 black keys ) .
English has 26 ; Western music has 12 .
Why 12 ?
It 's a cool number .
The best way to see how cool is to draw a regular polygon ( like the Pentagon in DC but with 12 sides ) .
Then draw the diagonals .
If you blink hard enough , you will see all sorts of beautiful interlacing patterns .
If you have the time , do it .
Take a circle and draw 12 equally - spaced dots on it .
Number them 0,1 , ...,11 ( with 0 at the North Pole and 6 at the South Pole ) .
Now connect 0 to 7 .
There is exactly one other diagonal of the same length starting from 7 .
It goes to 2 .
Draw it .
Then repeat .
Lo and behold , this will take you back to 0 after 12 diagonals , and you wo n't even have to lift your pen !
Exactly two diagonals connect 0 : they are 0 - 7 and 0 - 5 .
Guess what ?
These correspond to 3:2 and 4:3 !
( Do n't try to read the numbers 3:2 and 4:3 from the polygon : you can't ! )
If you draw all the diagonals , you end up with a grand total of 66 lines .
Every piece of Western music can be interpreted by looking at the symmetries among these lines !
Neat , huh !
This picture bends the diagonals for effect .
People weaving Persian , Chinese , or Indian rugs will not be impressed .
Islamic artists will shrug their shoulders .
The symmetries of the 12 - sided polygon are , shall we say , babyish !
To give you an idea , physicists sometimes use generalized polygons ( called Lie groups ) with one trillion " diagonals " !
Not just 66 ...
There 's one serious human limitation on music , though : one must be able to hear it , to play it , to memorize it .
So big numbers are out .
Certainly , 12 is on the low side .
And that will come back to haunt Western musicians .
( Much of Indian music uses 22 tones : 12 is to 22 what a bicycle is to a Mercedes , because the number of possibilities grows exponentially in the size of the scale . )
Anyway , we have our 12 notes , we have our diagonals , symmetries , and all that .
We 're ready to go .
Except for one thing : what should these 12 notes sound like ?
You need 12 notes between 1:1 and 2:1 ?
That 's easy :
1. Throw in 1:1 ( our root )
2. Throw in 3:2 ( the dominant , our favorite )
3 . Throw in 4:3 ( the subdominant , our second favorite )
4 . Now what ?
Going 3:2 from anywhere sounds good , so let 's take our dominant and move up by 3:2 , which lands us at ( 3:2 ) * ( 3:2 ) , which is 9:4 .
But we want a number between 1:1 and 2:1 , so we raise the denominator 4 of ( 9:4 ) by an octave to get 9:8 .
That gives us 4 notes :
( 1:1 ) ( 3:2 ) ( 4:3 ) ( 9:8 )
Keep on doing this ( multiplying by 3:2 and bringing the numbers back to the range between 1 and 2 ) until you get 12 notes and that 'll get you a scale .
Done .
Only one problem : the closest fraction to 5:4 ( the major third ) you get in this scale is 81:64 , which is the difference between 1.25 and 1.27 .
Close but no dice .
Can we just say we do n't care about thirds ?
No , we can 't !
You need 5:4 or something very close to it because all chords in Western music are formed by stacking thirds , so if you get those guys badly wrong you 're out of luck .
Especially that by stacking them together the error gets compounded .
Let 's fix it this way :
Keep ( 1:1 ) ( 3:2 ) ( 4:3 ) ( 9:8 ) as before but now add in the major thirds ( 5:4 ) above and below each of these 4 pitches , for a total of 12 .
This gives you :
( 1:1 ) ( 16/15 ) ( 9/8 ) ( 6/5 ) ( 5/4 ) ( 4/3 ) ( 45/32 ) ( 3/2 ) ( 8/5 ) ( 5/3 ) ( 9/5 ) ( 15/8 )
Wunderbar !
This is a great scale .
You can still hear funny dissonances if you 're not careful ( but , remember , you want them to say " fuck " and to fly pigs ! )
For a measly 12 notes , you got yourself a good deal .
OK , if you 're dying to hear all those intervals you can't get in Western music , well , tough .
Go get yourself a 22 - sided polygon and learn to play Indian ragas .
The trouble is that to be really good at Indian music takes enormous skill AND a lifetime of learning .
So if you want young children to sing in a choir or music to dance to in the town square , 12 is better than 22 .
Medieval European music was based on this principle .
But then it all changed in the 17th century !
( Yes , nitpickers , I know , nothing ever happens all of a sudden ! )
Why ?
How ?
First , why ?
Even though a mere 12 - pitch scale is already asked to do way more than it can ( ie , accommodate all these good intervals ) , the Western man asked for more and more .
When the Western man sees a mule loaded with 1,000 pounds of bricks on its back , what does the Western man say ?
The Western man says : " Let 's add another 1,000 pounds of bricks and see what happens ! "
Why is the Western man ( with an Italian / French / German accent -- for once the " Anglo - Saxons " are off the hook ! ) is being so demanding ?
Because of their sisters .
You see , the way we defined the scale will get us good dominants , subdominants , and thirds , but only when we start from certain lucky notes .
So the Western man looked at the 12 - scale and said :
My sister does n't like you !
When I sing my song , I begin in C ( ie , 1:1 ) and go up to a dominant and that sounds great .
But C is too low for my sister , so she starts at the third note , which is labeled ( 9:8 ) .
We call it D .
And then she goes up to the dominant , which is ( 9:8 ) * ( 3:2 ) = 27:16
But 27:16 is not in your damn scale .
The closest you have to offer is ( 5:3 ) , which is so way off it makes my sister 's ears bleed .
Fix yourself !
The answer could have been :
" Hey , buster , that scale is already overtaxed .
It ca n't be changed .
Ask your sister to get her own piano tuned to D and she 'll be OK . "
But for the Western man , you see , no mule is ever overloaded and devotion to one 's sister knows no bound .
Here is what the Western man will do .
He 'll find a number , call it R , and form this scale :
( 1:1 ) ( R:1 ) ( R*R:1 ) ( R*R* R:1 ) ( R*R* R:1 ) ( R*R*R* R:1 ) .....
( R*R*R*R*R*R*R*R*R*R*R*R*R*R*R*R:1 )
If R were an integer you would get the harmonics , which would be , like , really stupid .
You want all these ratios to be between 1 and 2 .
So , make R very tiny : so small that when you multiply it 12 times with itself you get 2 .
That means P is the twelth root of 2 .
So the last note in the list above is actually
( R*R*R*R*R*R*R*R*R*R*R*R*R*R*R*R:1 ) = ( 2:1 )
The neat thing is that the ratio corresponding to any interval is the same .
For example , take a third like ( R:1 ) ( R*R* R:1 ) .
[ It 's of length 3 because in our new scale , there is exactly one note in between . ]
See , you go from one note to the next by multiplying the numerator by R*R .
But , now , consider the interval of length 3 from ( R* R * R:1 ) to ( R*R*R* R* R:1 ) .
Ah , you go from one note to the next by multiplying the numerator by R*R. Voila !
All intervals of a given length like , say , all fourths , will sound exactly the same .
Remember that your ear is a logarithm table .
This means that it will perceive exactly the same increment as you sing an interval of a given length .
This new scale is essentially a 12 - step ladder where each step takes you up by exactly the same amount ( or so your ear thinks ) .
We 'll call it equal - tempered ( do n't ask why ) .
So , the Western man and his sister will sing exactly the same music ( only transposed higher ) .
You can play from any note and as long as you go up and down as you should it does not matter a bit where you start .
There 's only one trouble .
Yes , the music will sound the same wherever you start , but unfortunately it wo n't be the one you had in mind !
All intervals have now ratios that are powers of R .
But these powers can never be what we want , ie , things like 3:2 , 4:3 , 5:4 .
Never !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
But do we get close ?
No !
The scale is wrong in at least 3 ways :
1 . It is an assault on the ear .
You do n't have to be Mozart to hear that it 's all wrong .
Every chord Maurizio Pollini plays on his piano at Carnegie Hall is off .
It 's off by at least 10 % of a semitone , which most people can hear if they try .
Worse , we 're so used to hearing wrong music we do n't let it bother us too much .
But a classical Indian musician will be horrified by the sound of a piano .
You 've heard a sibling or a cousin butcher a tune so badly you wanted to get a lifetime membership to the NRA .
Be honest , you have no qualms calling that singing " wrong . "
Well , then Ravi Shankar should have no qualms calling an equal - tempered piano " wrong . "
2 . The piano teaches singers to sing out of tune .
To sing out of tune is hard .
It takes practice .
In fact opera singers will naturally revert back to form and sing in tune , with perfect thirds , dominants , etc , as soon as the piano shuts up !
Barbershop quartets sing in tune naturally .
In fact , humans who can carry a tune are pretty much incapable of singing out of tune as pianos do even if they try .
The only way they can do it is when they 're accompanied by a fucking piano !
( Do appreciate the judicious use of a dissonance in the last sentence . )
Piano accompaniment is , of course , how all singers practice !
This is wrong because it 's not wanted .
It has no purpose , except convenience .
This is wrong because not even the piano 's biggest fan would keep that system if it could be fixed .
But it can't .
Unless , that is , you throw away equal temperament .
3 . Mathematically you 're trying to do something that , in better worlds , gets people shot .
I wo n't go into the math , but only mention a relevant anecdote .
One of the world 's greatest number theorists once told me ,
" Bernard , do you realize that all of the world 's mysteries can be traced back to the fact that addition and multiplication do n't go together . "
This is ( in all seriousness ) one of the most profound truths I 've ever heard .
" Equal temperament , " which is what this new scale is called , pretends that addition and multiplication are compatible , when it is the very essence of everything that 's beautiful in life that they are not .
Bach is often accused of having forced equal temperament down our throats .
That is a lie !
He wrote pieces for well - temperament , which is not the same .
In equal temperament , all consecutive keys are equidistant .
But piano tuners , especially before electronics , used their ears and their ears were still accurate so that they tweaked the tuning to " fix " the thirds and fifths , etc .
In fact , Bach wrote his famous " Well - Tempered Clavier " as a set of pieces in all 12 keys , major and minor .
Why did Bach bother with all these different keys ?
Because when you do n't do equal temperament different keys will sound different .
That too is lost in post - Bach music ( OK , not quite true , because pianos get tuned in certain ways sometimes for certain pieces , like Beethoven 's amazing Waldstein sonata being a good example ) .
In equal temperament you get the famous joke :
" You say potato , I say potato ; you say tomato , I say tomato . "
Hmm , I do n't get it !
Now our 12 - pitch mule has 2,000 pounds of brick on its back .
Its sounds are all audibly wrong .
The wrongness is undesired .
So it 's not like the dissonances we love to throw in .
It 's plain wrong all across the board .
Is the cost huge ?
Yes , absolutely .
Many musicians ( including Western ones ) have tried to break away from it .
But do we get a reward for our sins ?
Yes , a huge bundle of prizes .
Transposition is one benefit .
But the more important is modulation : changing tonal center within the same melody .
When you start singing the note C , chances are you 'll soon be hitting E , and F , and G .
But playing F# would sound weird .
( I have n't talked about the diatonic scale so I 'll do it quickly : the white keys on the piano .
Remember our first attempt to build a scale , get the root , the subdominant , the dominant , and then keep multiplying by ( 3:2 ) .
If you stop once you have 7 notes , that 's your diatonic scale right there : C, D , E , F , G , A , B . Well not in that order .
The cycle of fifths goes : F , C , G , D , A , E , B , etc .
So your 7 - note scale is built out of the 12 tones by cycling through the dominants .
There are other ways of justifying its construction but this one will do .
The famous pentatonic is built out of the first 5 notes from the cycle of 5ths ( with its " minor " variant ) .
I do n't want to digress , but the way the pentatonic is understood in rock and blues is completely different : it 's downright absurd to think a rock minor pentatonic as being extracted from a Western scale .
It 's no longer a matter of debate among musical ethnographers that the origin of that scale , as used in blues / rock / Jazz is non-Western .
We simply define the minor pentatonic as its closest match in the Western scale , but it is a poor approximation .
Equal temperament allows you to do the same thing starting from anywhere , say , F# .
This adds great flexibility to music writing .
It allows you to break from the hierarchy imposed by tonality ( which favors certain notes over others . )
Our long diagonals in the polygon allow us to modulate to any key we like .
So we gain great " syntactic " power at the price of poorer sounds .
We bloggers know that well : the more we bullshit the more we can say .
Equal temperament was tremendously liberating for musicians .
By sticking to 12 pitches , the language was still very simple , making innovations easier .
Modulation allowed for the sort of versatility that is difficult to get in other musics .
Some have argued that if you want equal temperament , then 20 pitches should be the minimum acceptable ; or 30 .
They say that 12 makes the music so wrong as to be offensive .
I would n't go that far .
For one thing , we Westerners are too conditioned to it by now to get so upset .
But some non-Western musicians are horrified to see their compatriots abandon their much richer native musical vocabularies for the Western " approximation . "
Bollywood has a lot of Westernized Indian music which many natives regard as destructive .
I think we can all agree that , in an ideal world , all musical traditions should enrich each other but not suffocate each other .
Equal - temperament costs a lot ( wrong sounds : again , I use the word wrong because it violates the rules of acoustics in a way not even fans of equal - temperament like ) .
The wrongness is accepted only because it opens new doors , transposition and especially modulation .
No other music cheats that much .
But all do to some extent .
Even Indian music has wrong intervals that it tries to hide with drones and harmonics , etc . But Westerners do it so much more ....
Well , like this : Take pi=3.14159 ....
No one uses the exact value of pi numerically .
It 's impossible .
But the great state of Indiana tried to pass a bill in the late 19 c decreeing that pi would be officially 3.2 .
( Funny they did n't choose 3.1 . )
Many musicians , including American ones ( but not Hoosiers ) , think of the equal - tempered rule of Western music as the pi=3.2 of music .
Some will say :
But imagine , as a thought experiment , that , without a literary equivalent of this ridiculous approximation , writing King Lear had proven impossible , would n't it had been all worthwhile then .
Well , yes !
The choices made by Western music were without a doubt worthwhile .
To say that Western music would have been better off if it had opted to be less wrong and , say , stick to " just intonation " ( the scale I discussed before equal temperament ) is silly because such a statement is entirely unfalsifiable .
The interesting question is why Westerners made a drastic choice that no other big music traditions seem to have made .
( I could be wrong about that , but certainly not among the " major " ones ) .
It was drastic because , when it was made , for many people , music was still a medium to communicate with God .
It takes guts to offer God imperfect dominants just so that little Sis can sing Mary Had a Little Lamb !
Why did it happen ?
Was it :
1. Technology ?
2. Expediency ?
3. Curiosity about modulation : much of Western harmony is really the art of modulating and substituting .
4. Dance music ?
Do n't forget that Bach borrowed melodies from everyone , including local villagers singing folk tunes .
In some ways , music was much more democratic then .
I do n't see modern classical musicians borrowing much from hip hop .
( OK , Radiohead borrowed 1 measly sample from Lansky . )
But Schubert spent his evenings in local bars to hear people sing folk songs .
Also , remember that classical music often incorporated dance elements .
5. Church music ?
Bach was both a court musician and later a church composer .
He 'd compose music from one sunday Mass to the next .
Local parishioners knew his music .
Again , there was a smooth continuity between high art and vernacular music in the 17 - 19th c. that seems to have been lost .
Which villagers today listen to Philip Glass ?
6 . A desire for abstraction ?
Equal temperament decouples harmony from acoustics .
Since you do n't care how things will really sound in the end , you 're allowed much more freedom to explore .
Composition acquires an abstract flavor whereby mathematical patterns matter more than aural perception .
At the same time , political theory became more abstract ; empires grew .
The enlightenment made it easier to be seduced by the sure rationality of the new rules .
( Just to clarify , Western harmony is perfectly fine mathematically as an abstract model .
It only breaks down when you connect its impeccable logic to the logic of acoustics .
It violates the math of acoustics , not the math of harmony . )
So was it part of a general philosophical trend toward abstraction and universality ?
Who knows ?
Take it away .
I am done .

In East Asia ginseng is believed to have multiple health benefits
Three people have died in south - western China after receiving an injection of Siberian ginseng extract .
The deaths , announced on China 's health ministry web site , occurred in Yunnan province after six hospital patients received the injections .
It said sales and use of the ginseng extract had been suspended .
The ministry is also trying to dampen fears about melamine poisoning of milk , which has killed four babies and made thousands ill in a months - long scandal .
It said that 10,666 babies remained in hospital receiving treatment for renal problems caused by the melamine contamination of baby milk formula .
Some parents are taking legal action against the manufacturer at the centre of the scandal , the Sanlu Group , and the state quality supervision body .
Ginseng treatment
The ginseng injection was manufactured by Wandashan Pharmaceutical , based in the north - eastern Chinese province of Heilongjiang .
Siberian ginseng is often used in China to treat heart disease and thrombosis .
The six patients suffered " serious ill effects " including chills , vomiting and sudden drops in blood pressure after receiving the injections at the Number Four People 's Hospital in Honghe prefecture on Sunday .
Some went into a coma .
Three of the six died on Monday , official media reported two days later .
The State Food and Drug Administration ( SFDA ) says it has isolated two problematic batches of the extract , made from a herb called " ciwujia " , and has urged immediate nationwide reporting of any adverse effects .
The Associated Press reports that a man who answered the telephone at Wandashan 's marketing department in Heilongjiang , in China 's north - east , said the company had stopped selling the herbal injection and had sent the two batches to the SFDA for testing .
The man was reported as saying the company had used ciwujia in its products for more than 30 years without any problem .
Poor regulation
He added that the injectable form of the herb was relatively new , saying : " I have n't heard of any bad reaction [ to ] this injection before . "
China 's pharmaceutical industry is highly lucrative but poorly regulated .
Last year , the country 's former top drug regulator was executed for taking millions of dollars in bribes to approve substandard medicines , including an antibiotic that killed at least 10 people .

What are these ?
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
Families have been feeling increasing financial pain at grocery - store cash registers , exacerbating their difficulties in the souring U.S. economy .
Here 's how much it hurts :
A basket of 16 basic food items cost $ 48.68 over the past three months , up 10.5 % from a year ago , the American Farm Bureau Federation said Thursday .
The latest survey from the nation 's largest farm organization underscores the pressures reverberating throughout the food chain , from the American farm to the executive suites of the largest U.S. packaged - food manufacturers .
Besides the elevated costs for basic food ingredients , rising energy prices have boosted processing , hauling , and refrigerating expenses for food makers including Kraft Foods Inc. KFT and Campbell Soup Co. CPB , +0.08 %
Potatoes , cheddar cheese and apples posted the largest price gains from the second quarter of this year .
A five - pound bag of potatoes cost $ 3.38 , up 83 cents .
Cheddar was $ 4.91 a pound , up 31 cents .
Apples fetched $ 1.80 a pound , up 26 cents .
Among other items that rose are the following : pork chops , up 22 cents to $ 3.62 a pound ; ground chuck , rising 10 cents to $ 2.95 a pound ; and whole milk , costing 4 cents more at $ 3.92 a gallon .
On the downside , large eggs fell for the second consecutive quarter to $ 1.71 a dozen , down 11 cents , while a 20 - ounce loaf of white bread also dropped 11 cents to $ 1.79 .
Bacon fell 6 cents a pound to $ 1.43 .
The American Farm Bureau conducts its informal survey on a quarterly basis .
The latest reading of how stretched the American grocery budget has become was done by 72 volunteer shoppers in 32 states during the month of August .
Americans spend about 10 % of their disposable income on food each year -- the lowest of any country worldwide , according to the U.S. government .
Grocery - chain operators Supervalu Inc. SVU , Safeway Inc. SWY and Whole Foods Markets Inc. WFMI all have been grappling with more frugal shoppers as job losses and the housing downturn have pinched consumers .
And it 's not just individuals ; four SF companies have have launched attacks on local families , too :
- Blackford Construction gave $ 200
- Visionary Electronics gave $ 99
- Large Format Computing gave $ 1500
- Malta and Co , located in the Richmond , gave $ 100 ( and Elena Malta gave another $ 100 )
Malta and Co already seems to be suffering a bit of Yelp - retribution for its anti-marriage stance .
Of course , these people and companies might object to their donations being made the subject of scrutiny -- and we can certainly understand that .
It must be simply awful to have strangers involving themselves in your private life .
To have people you do n't even know talking about your values and personal decisions -- why , that must feel simply .
Is this conversation sort of like how the Yes On 8 campaign threatened to publish the names of donors to marriage equality ?
Well , yes .
Yes , it is .
Thanks for the idea !
Disclosure : SFist_Matt is working on a stop - prop - 8 project .

A full day of excavating the storage room in search
of the various Christmas boxes has
definitely created a mess .
Finally all have been found .

Documentary reveals hidden side of British mosque where extremist women urge Muslims to kill non-believers
Women preachers in one of Britain 's most influential mosques are calling on Muslims to kill homosexuals and adulterers , a television documentary will reveal tonight .
During a hardline rant at the London Central Mosque , one preacher said Muslims who switch to another religion should also be slaughtered .
The extremist sermons , filmed secretly by the Channel 4 Dispatches programme , encourage a circle of listeners to follow a hardline Islamic code , urging Muslims not to talk to people from other religions .
A still from the Channel 4 Dispatches programme which reveals extremist sermons being given by hardline Muslims
They describe Britain as the ' land of evil ' and say the behaviour of other races is ' vile ' .
The mosque , known as Regent 's Park Mosque , is one of the most respected centres for moderate Islam in western Europe and has a major interfaith department which welcomes visits from other religious groups and thousands of British school children each year .
However , the documentary exposes a hidden side to the mosque , where hardline Muslim women preach to study groups .
The DVDs preach that disbelievers are 'evil , wicked , mischievous people ... they do the most evil , filthy things ' .
In one of the recordings , a speaker says of the Jews : ' Their time will come , like every other evil person 's time will come . '
Undercover : Regent 's Park Mosque was at the centre of an investigation
Dr Ahmed Al Dubayan , the director general of the mosque , said the women were not authorised and did not reflect the views of the mosque .
He said the mosque ' is committed to interfaith and cross-cultural understanding .
It does not support or condone extreme views , racial hatred , violence or intolerance . '
The Muslim Council of Britain , of which the mosque is an affiliate , said : ' Some of the statements are deeply offensive , but it would be very wrong , and quite unfair , to smear the whole centre . '
The documentary is a follow - up to Undercover Mosque , which investigated mosques in Britain more than a year ago .
This found DVDs preaching intolerance on sale in a bookshop at the Regent 's Park Mosque .
The new programme says they are still there .
Dr Al Dubayan pointed out the bookshop was run by an independent company and said : ' We made it clear that it was not acceptable to stock materials containing extremist views . '
We have all read stories about people who have experimented living without spending any money whatsoever .
By growing their own food , washing in the river , using a solar panel to provide electricity , and bartering for certain goods and services , these adventures have met with limited success .
However , for us mere mortals the simple fact is that we need money .
Money to buy food , to purchase clothes , to pay our bills , as well as indulging in our other infinite wants and desires .
While it can be a struggle to make ends meet , it is possible to make life easier through better money management .
Financial management is about planning income and expenditure and making informed decisions that enable you to survive financially .
With austerity still with us , it ’s even more important to look after your finances , if only to make sure there are no nasty surprises when you receive your next bank statement .

Whether pundits dub it melanoma - gate , relapse - gate , or perhaps prognostic model - gate , there ’s an unprecedented amount of interest in the odds that John McCain will drop dead in the next four to eight years due to a skin cancer relapse .
The latest armchair doctoring comes in the pages of The Lancet , from a physician who has donated $ 4600 to the Obama campaign and another $ 28,500 to the Democratic National Committee .
John Alam , a Cambridge , Massachusetts , physician with 17 - years in clinical research who now works as a biotechnology consultant , estimates that Senator John McCain has a 6 % risk of dying of a melanoma recurrence each year – or about 22 % over four years .
“ There is a one - in - four to one - in - five chance that he would not survive a first term , ” he told New Scientist .
This is higher than the estimate of McCain ’s physician at the Mayo Clinic , who previously told reporters that he had a less than 10 % chance of deadly relapse .
On the other end of the scale , a group of physicians – and Obama supporters – has called on McCain to release more health records , claiming that his risk of relapse could be higher than 60 % .

Alam ’s estimate is based on studies of the survival rates of others with melanoma , where the patients were grouped by the size and location of their tumour , their gender and age .
His estimate – which is no more than an educated guess , of course – falls between the previous estimates of 10 and 60 % for one important reason .
New procedure
Many of the prognostic models that others have cited are based on patient studies that did not perform a sentinel lymph node ( SLN ) biopsy , a relatively new procedure that attempts to determine whether a tumour has spread to lymph nodes that serve as a cellular superhighway for aggressive tumours .
If the biopsy turns up no melanoma after surgery , patients are at a far lower risk of relapse and mortality than patients who are SLN - positive , according to two recent clinical studies .
However , some dermatologists worry that failing to detect melanoma in the biopsy can lead to false negatives and an underestimate of relapse risk .
However , the procedure has become routine in patients with more advanced melanomas , such as McCain ’s , Alam says .
McCain , according to records posted on his campaign website , was SLN - negative when doctors performed the biopsy in August 2000 , Alam writes in a short letter to The Lancet .
Alam says he performed the analysis independent of the Obama campaign .
“ Because the analysis is an objective , evidence - based analysis , I believe my having contributed has no bearing on the results of the analysis , ” he adds .
For comparison , a quick web search reveals the odds of dying in the US of other causes , natural and unnatural :

A bow is an ancient weapon that shoots arrows powered by the elasticity of the bow .
Energy is stored in the limbs of the bow and transformed into rapid motion when the string is released , with the string transferring this motion to the arrow .
The bow is used for hunting , sport ( target shooting ) , and in historical times was a weapon of war .
The technique of using a bow is called archery .
Someone who makes bows is known as a bowyer , and a fletcher makes arrows .
Together with the atlatl and the sling , the bow was one of the first ranged weapons or hunting tools which used mechanical principles , instead of relying solely on strength and skill of its user .

Seven years after 9/11 and there are starting to be signs that America is finally emerging from 9/11 hysteria .
Maybe it ’s the time gone by , maybe it ’s the incredibly expensive ( and failed ) war on terror , maybe 9/11 is finally being put in perspective by a vastly bigger problem , the economic meltdown .
9/11 was a hell of a thing , like everyone I was mortified when I turned on the TV that day .
However , within days , if not hours , I was more mortified by America ’s reaction to it .
By the next day I was pretty sure that the response to 9/11 was going to be vastly more expensive and counter - productive than the failed war on drugs .
And sadly , if anything , I underestimated just how expensive and counter - productive the so called “ war on terror ” was going to be .
At least I was n’t the only one who felt the same way , but public voices speaking rationally were few and far between those days .
Susan Sontag was one of the few not jumping on the Islamofascist hysteria bandwagon , she said it better than I could have :
“ The disconnect between last Tuesday ’s monstrous dose of reality and the self - righteous drivel and outright deceptions being peddled by public figures and TV commentators is startling , depressing .
The voices licensed to follow the event seem to have joined together in a campaign to infantilize the public .
Where is the acknowledgement that this was not a ‘ cowardly ’ attack on ‘ civilization ’ or ‘ liberty ’ or ‘ humanity ’ or ‘ the free world ’ but an attack on the world ’s self - proclaimed superpower , undertaken as a consequence of specific American alliances and actions ? ”
I was pretty much afraid to speak my mind in the months following 9/11 .
That was far more scary to me than the fantasy threat posed by Osama Bin Laden , I knew the chances of another attack like 9/11 was basically zero , and that even if it happened , my chances of being caught by it was still basically zero .
On the other hand , I knew that if I said something “ unpatriotic ” in front of the wrong person I could be beaten or worse .
And what a big effing thrill that was .
In any event , the point I am trying to make is that because of a sensationalist media and an ideologically driven administration , a terrible crime was parlayed into a world changing event .
I mean , let ’s look at this .
A few dozen guys conspired to hijack four planes and fly them into buildings .
A few dozen guys .
This was n’t Pearl Harbor .
This was n’t the Alamo .
This was n’t a “ war of civilizations . ”
This was a small terrorist group that got lucky .
No more and no less .
How should America have responded to 9/11 ?
We should have hardened cockpit doors , taken up the Taliban ’s offers to turn Bin Laden over for trial , had a memorial for the victims … and gone on with our lives .
It would n’t have hurt either to examine why Al Qaeda came into being and started attacking the USA , and why the people who were supposed to be defending America were asleep at the switch .
Instead we were panicked into borrowing and spending trillions of dollars in an open ended war against “ evil . ”
Seven years later some sane voices are starting to be heard .
The former head of Britain ’s intelligence agency for example has called the response to 9/11 a huge overreaction .
Even the US State Department has gotten into the act and ried to get people to tone down the rhetoric .
I mean , what has the War on Terror accomplished ?
Pakistan , Afghanistan , and Iraq are all more unstable and generating more terrorism than before 9/11 .
Al Qaeda has spread to a dozen or more countries it was n’t in before 9/11 .
Jihadists in Spain and England were inspired to commit acts of terror .
And the world ’s opinion of America and its foreign policy is at the lowest ebb ever .
All this for only twenty thousand dead and maimed GIs and a multi trillion dollar debt ?
Not to mention a vastly expanded US government and a serious erosion of our civil rights ?
To defend ourselves against pirates , bandits , and outlaw groups ?
This was beyond stupid , and I can only hope the fog continues to lift from people ’s eyes .
Am I saying the USA should have ignored Al Qaeda .
Of course not .
However , a military response was not the way to go .
( And I ’m pretty sure invading and occupying two countries counts as military force , not to mention missile and air strikes in at least two other countries . )
This is borne out by the first comprehensive study of how terrorist groups end .
RAND recently studied 648 terrorist groups that were active between 1968 and 2006 .
What as the most common way for them to end ?
43 % of them were ended via political means , IE negotiation .
40 % of them were destroyed by police and intelligence action , usually by locals .
10 % of terrorism groups achieved victory .
And lastly , 7 % of terrorist groups were destroyed by military force .
So much for “ you ca n’t negotiate with terrorists , ” apparently in the real world it ’s seven times more effective than military force as a response to terrorism .
As I ’ve said before , terrorist groups have always been with us , and they always will .
A sensible restrained flexible foreign policy and adequate police / intelligence work is the best way to both prevent and deal with terrorism .
And , most important of all , do n’t panic .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The Federal Reserve announced Monday that it will increase by hundreds of billions of dollars the money it makes available to the nation 's banks .
The central bank said that its so - called term auction facility , which accepts financial instruments such as mortgage - backed securities as collateral , will be doubled immediately to $ 300 billion .
The total amount available to banks will rise to $ 600 billion under the moves announced Monday .
In addition , the Fed signaled it could increase the amount available through those loans to $ 900 billion by the end of the year , increasing the amount the Fed will loan through the program by $ 750 billion above its previous limit .
The moves come in the wake of the passage on Friday of a $ 700 billion bailout bill that will allow Treasury to buy damaged assets directly from banks and Wall Street firms .
Experts said the moves by the Fed were an acknowledgement that many of the nation 's leading financial institutions may not be able to wait until Treasury sets up its program .
It may take weeks or perhaps even months before the Treasury can pump billions into the system itself by buying the damaged assets held on their balance sheets .
" The crisis in credit markets has become very acute , not just here but in Europe as well , " said Lyle Gramley , a former Fed governor who is now an economist with the Stanford Group .
" In a situation like this , you have to provide all the liquidity that is needed so that illiquid institutions do n't become insolvent institutions . "
The rapid expansion of the Fed program is essentially like an emergency bridge loan for institutions caught in a credit squeeze , said Kevin Giddis , head of fixed - income sales trading and research for investment firm Morgan Keegan .
The Fed had little choice but to try to pump as much cash as possible into the system , no matter the risks associated with taking damaged assets as collateral , Giddis said .
" Liquidity is needed immediately , and we 're talking hours , " he said .
" I think the Fed will continue to take whatever steps it can until we unlock the problem . "
Giddis and Gramley both agree that the Fed appears to be focused on these kinds of non-traditional measures to pump cash into the market rather than simply cutting interest rates , which is how the central bank has historically spurred a slowing economy .
But neither would rule out the possibility that the Fed will do an emergency rate cut before its Oct. 28 and 29 meeting if problems in credit markets continue to worsen .
The term auction facility was announced in December as a move to pump cash into the already battered credit markets .
The Fed allows banks to bid in an auction for the rate they 're willing to pay to borrow the funds , and it accepts a much wider range of collateral for the loans than in other forms of lending by the central bank .
The Fed started loaning $ 20 billion in its first auction in December , but it quickly reached a $ 150 billion limit by late May and has stayed at or near that level since then .
The auctions are split between different length loans .
The Fed 's statement Monday said it is doubling both its 28 - day and 84 - day auctions to $ 150 billion each immediately .
The Fed conducted a previously scheduled 84 - day auction Monday morning for $ 150 billion of funds .
That was originally set to be a $ 75 billion auction before Monday 's announcement .
Paying interest to govern rate
The Fed also announced it would pay banks interest on their reserve holdings .
That change had been set to start in 2011 , but its effective date was moved up as part of the bailout legislation enacted on Friday .
Paying interest will allow the central bank to have control over the fed funds rate , its key overnight lending rate target .
The Fed announces its fed funds rate target after every meeting of its policymakers .
But in fact the rate is movable :
The central bank must buy and sell treasuries to maintain it close to the target .
It potentially could be hard for the Fed to keep the funds rate close to its target as the central bank takes on so many troubled financial assets as collateral - rather than holding treasuries .
By agreeing to pay interest equal to the fed funds , there is little chance that the fed funds rate will fall below the target because banks will have no incentive to loan money for less .
An official familiar with the Fed move said Monday that the central bank could n't have substantially increased the money available through the auction until it received the congressional authority to pay interest .
He said that while it may appear that the Fed move negates the need for the Treasury - led bailout , in fact it provides only short - term benefit to the institutions .
" This treats the symptoms of the problems , " said the official , who spoke on condition that his name not be used .
" Treasury is the one trying to cut out the cancer . "
The crisis in financial markets was spreading around the globe , sending overseas stocks sharply lower Monday while U.S. stock futures also fell .
Over the weekend , European governments moved to shore up some leading financial institutions there , including a $ 69 billion bailout for Hypo Real Estate AG , and the purchase of the Belgian and Luxembourg operations of Fortis NV by French banking giant BNP Paribas , in a deal announced by the Belgian government .
And speculation grew that governments in Europe may soon announce their own bailout package .

Gen .
Thomas Hartmann said Wednesday the military is eager to move forward with trials of alleged terrorists as it prepared for the court appearance of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four alleged co-conspirators accused of plotting the Sept. 11 attacks that killed nearly 3,000 Americans .
Mohammed and the others will be among the first to be tried under the military commission system set up in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
Mohammed is scheduled to be arraigned Thursday .
Dozens of reporters from the United States and abroad landed Wednesday at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo .
" We are moving forward , not with potential but with reality , " said Hartmann , the Pentagon 's legal adviser to the commission .
Evidence obtained through harsh interrogation methods is allowed under the commission system established by President Bush and approved by Congress .
Hartmann would not say whether evidence obtained through waterboarding which simulates the sensation of drowning would be allowed at trial .
CIA Director Michael Hayden disclosed in February that three detainees , including Mohammed , were subjected to waterboarding .
" The judge will make that determination , " Hartmann said .
" The U.S. does not have a policy on that . "
He also said that the Pentagon erred when it decided not to allow relatives of those who died during the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks to attend Thursday 's hearing .
He said the problem was a logistical one and that victim 's families would be allowed to attend some other commission hearings .
He also said they are working to establish viewing locations somewhere in the United States to allow relatives to view the proceedings .
" That was a mistake , " Hartmann said .
" We 'll make sure that does n't happen again . "

When alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed walks into his first court appearance Thursday in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , it will launch the most high - profile test of a military court system that has been created , destroyed and rebuilt through nearly seven years of wrangling among the White House , Congress and the Supreme Court .
Mohammed 's long - awaited arraignment could begin to answer fundamental questions about the United States ' handling of justice in the wake of the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks :
Will the military commission system , which President Bush created to prosecute accused terrorists , ever hold one of them accountable for the tragedy ?
Or will the federal government 's efforts to secure guilty verdicts crumble amid mounting concerns about the evidence , fairness to the defendants and treatment of the accused while in custody ?
And if guilty verdicts ultimately are rendered for Mohammed , four alleged co-conspirators and about 75 other Gitmo detainees facing prosecution , will those verdicts be widely viewed as valid ?
The answers could help determine whether the alternative justice system launched two months after the 9/11 attacks will prosecute alleged terrorists for years or even decades to come .
Nearly seven years after the attacks — and after several revisions spurred by the Supreme Court and made by Congress — the system has not taken anyone to trial .
Instead , it has been mired in criticism over whether it should allow the use of evidence obtained through harsh interrogation techniques — including waterboarding , which creates the sensation of drowning — for permitting evidence that can be withheld from defendants , and for holding closed court hearings without defendants or their lawyers .
The Senate Judiciary Committee will meet Wednesday to scrutinize how the United States prosecutes alleged terrorists and to debate whether the system needs to be changed again .
Critics and even several prominent onetime supporters of the system now say it is so deficient legally — and so flawed in the eyes of human rights groups and foreign governments such as the United Kingdom — that it should be abolished .
If that happens , the United States will have to decide whether to hold the prisoners indefinitely without granting them trials or find another way to prosecute them .
Military and legal specialists who study the commissions suggest four alternatives to the system at Guantanamo : using U.S. federal courts to hold trials , using the military courts - martial system , creating a new national security court or simply holding detainees until the undefined , open - ended " war on terror " ends .
The analysts say each alternative highlights a perceived flaw in the military commission system that must be fixed for it to be credible .
" It 's dishonest to go through the charade and pretend we 're doing something legitimate , " says John Hutson , the dean of the Franklin Pierce Law Center in New Hampshire and a former Navy judge advocate who initially was an " ardent " supporter of the commissions .
He believes the detainees deserve full trials in which they can see all the evidence against them .
Military officials insist the commissions are the best way to balance the need for fair trials with the obligation to protect Americans from people they say are eager to kill U.S. soldiers and civilians .
Even though terrorists do n't abide by traditional rules of war , military officials say they get the same rights as traditional prisoners of war .
" These courts , as constituted by Congress , meet and exceed all international standards , " says retired Army major general John Altenburg , who oversaw the commissions from the Pentagon from 2004 to 2006 .
" We 're too hung up on television programs and criminal justice as we know it in our own country .
These people are n't entitled to that level of due process . "
Even as Mohammed 's case moves forward , the commission system could be derailed .
The Supreme Court , which has ruled against the Bush administration 's detention policies three times since 2004 , likely will rule soon on the latest challenge , which tests whether detainees have the right to protest their detention in U.S. courts .
The court 's decision could further delay hearings and force more changes .
All three presidential candidates have vowed to close the Guantanamo prison , although none has provided details on a justice system or holding site that they believe should replace it .
What 's left is a cloud of uncertainty looming over the commissions and the prison that Amnesty International has dubbed the " gulag of our times . "
" If we had gotten some of these cases to trial , people would have seen what a fabulous system of justice the military system is , " says Andrew McCarthy , who led the Justice Department 's prosecution in the cases involving the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and consulted for the Pentagon on the military commissions .
" Now you 've got a perception problem , which I do n't know that you can cure at this point . "
Questions about rules of evidence
One alternative to the military commissions system is the federal courts , which would let detainees see the evidence against them .
American courts generally require that defendants have access to all the evidence or witnesses who will be used at trial .
Yet the Military Commissions
Act passed by Congress in 2006 lets prosecutors introduce evidence against a detainee without sharing it if a judge believes doing so would compromise national security .
Proponents of the regular U.S. courts say federal judges have shown they can handle sensitive issues .
Federal prosecutors have convicted Zacarias Moussaoui for his role inplanning and training for the Sept. 11 attacks ; Omar Abdel - Rahman , the blind Egyptian cleric convicted of assisting in a plot to bomb New York City landmarks ; and others .
Moussaoui pleaded guilty in 2005 to terrorism conspiracy charges .
A jury convicted Abdel - Rahman in 1995 of seditious conspiracy and other charges .
Both are serving life sentences .
" The judges were able to come up with some provisions to deal with national security concerns , " says Stacy Sullivan , an adviser on counterterrorism for Human Rights Watch who has observed hearings in Guantanamo .
But Richard Samp , chief council for the Washington Legal Foundation , a conservative think tank , believes the evidence that federal judges allowed to become public during the trials hurt the war on terrorism .
He says the cases tried in federal court — especially Moussaoui's — provided al - Qaeda with information about U.S. intelligence - gathering techniques .
Some defense attorneys believe the commission system is weighted far too heavily in favor of the prosecution and cloaks mistreatment and neglect of detainees .
Air Force Maj .
David Frakt has asked that a psychologist examine Mohammed Jawad , a detainee he is defending who is charged with throwing a grenade at U.S. troops in Afghanistan in 2002 .
It was n't until last week , Frakt says , that he was informed Jawad tried to commit suicide by hanging himself in his cell more than four years ago .
He says the failure to disclose that speaks volumes about detainees ' ability to get a fair trial .
Altenburg , who oversaw the commissions , says there has been no coordinated effort to withhold information .
He says delays result from trying to prosecute alleged war criminals during a war , forcing intelligence officials to hand over evidence that is being used in the battlefield .
Seeking international trust
Some analysts ask why the military did n't use its courts - martial system .
Hutson , the Franklin Pierce Law Center dean , says the proven , well - respected process could protect national security while ensuring fair trials .
Like the federal courts , this option would require that defendants and their lawyers see all the evidence against them .
Yet members of the military would remain as judge and jury , which would do little to alleviate the chorus of opposition against Guantanamo , says McCarthy , the former federal prosecutor .
McCarthy says there should be a clean break from the military - judge system to help the United States regain international trust .
" The appearance of integrity is important in this war , " he says .
" Unless we have a system that has and exudes integrity , we 're hurting our security . "
He favors a third option for handling detainees : a new court that largely follows the military commission model but inserts a federal judge atop the proceedings .
A national security court could combine the neutrality of federal judges with the security safeguards in the military commissions .
Altenburg calls such a terrorism court a " reasonable alternative " but says there 's no point in setting up an entirely new system now .
" They 're going to have the same hitches that the military suffered " when establishing the commissions , he says .
For some , no prospect of a trial A fourth option is to treat the detainees as the United States has treated past prisoners of war : hold them until the government 's " war on terror " is over — whenever that may be .
Timothy Lynch , director of the Cato Institute 's Project on Criminal Justice , supports military commissions .
But if enough pressure builds to abandon them , he thinks America should detain the most dangerous detainees until the war ends — a political determination , he says , to be made by a future president in consultation with Congress .
About 120 of the 270 detainees in Guantanamo are being held without the prospect of a trial , according to the Pentagon .
" In our past wars , we 've held many prisoners in POW - style camps .
We can do the same thing in this war , " Lynch says .
Human rights activists believe such indefinite detention is inhumane , because it is unclear how or when the war on terror will end .
" Is it the war in Afghanistan ?
Is it the war in Iraq ?
It 's an indefinite war .
A war with no time frames , " says Jamil Dakwar , director of the Human Rights Program for the American Civil Liberties Union .
" All of this is going to create a humanitarian crisis and will only increase the problems the government is facing in the future . "
The alternatives are beginning to receive more scrutiny on Capitol Hill and among military specialists .
Yet no quick consensus is emerging .
The fate of the Guantanamo detainees likely will be decided by the next president .
" There is a desire on the part of some defense counsel to delay proceedings until the next administration , in hopes that fairer procedures will be put into place , " says Frakt , the defense attorney .
" At the same time , every day that we delay is another day that our clients spend in misery in Guantanamo . "

Even before Red Hat bought the virtualization company Qumranet , with its Linux KVM ( Kernel Virtual Machine ) platform , Red Hat had made it clear that it was moving into virtualization in a big way .
At its annual Red Hat Summit in June , the Linux powerhouse announced that it would be deploying its Embedded Linux Hypervisor , oVirt , which is based on KVM in its server line .
This lightweight , embeddable hypervisor currently enables users to run run Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Windows VMs on Linux .
Now that Red Hat owns Qumranet , Scott Crenshaw , Red Hat 's VP of the Platform Business Unit , explains that Red Hat made the move for three reasons .
First , to " accelerate time to market for a broad virtualization solution ; " then to keep KVM open source , and further the investment in it . "
And , finally to " extend our virtualization product line into the VDI ( Virtual Desktop Infrastructure ) market . "
Crenshaw then explains in more detail that " KVM will form the basis of Red Hat 's embedded hypervisor product , which is slated for release early next year .
We have strong interest from customers and OEMs to bring the advantages of this Linux bare metal hypervisor to the market . "
" If and when , " continues Crenshaw , " KVM gets deployed into Red Hat Enterprise Linux is still being determined .
We designed into RHEL virtualization the industry 's first open - source , open - standards interface allowing new hypervisors and management tools to be deployed with plug - and - play ease .
So managing any transition will be seamless for customers . "
Crenshaw also made it clear that Red Hat is thinking about taking virtualization into the desktop market .
Recently , Red Hat declined to enter the traditional Linux desktop market .
Now , with its newly acquired " SolidICE VDI solution .
We will build on the excellent momentum Qumranet has generated .
This is a game - changing product for the VDI market , and we expect customers to accelerate their already rapid deployment now that a company of Red Hat 's stature is backing it . "
SolidICE is a virtual desktop that uses SPICE ( Simple Protocol for Independent Computing Environments ) to run Windows or Linux desktops from a virtual machine on a server .
Thus , it has more in common with Citrix 's XenDesktop and before that its MetaFrame product line than it does conventional desktops .
That 's what Red Hat intends , but do these moves make sense ?
According to Jay Lyman , an open - source analyst for The 451 Group , they certainly do .
Lyman says , " This acquisition makes perfect technical sense since Red Hat was already moving to incorporate KVM more into its distribution .
Of course , it will continue to support Xen which has been a big part of its virtualization technology and strategy thus far , but I think internally the company will , wisely , move aggressively to the KVM technology that is being driven by Linux kernel developers . "
Lyman adds , " Red Hat felt it had to make this acquisition to be a bigger player in virtualization , to continue extending and building from its OS and before somebody else did .
By acquiring Qumranet , Red Hat adds the people and products it needs to do that integration and polish work on KVM , but it will take some time to integrate into RHEL . "
Dan Kusnetzky , principal analyst for the Kusnetzky Group looks at Red Hat 's history .
" Virtualization has appeared to be a secondary concern for Red Hat for quite some time .
Although the company included both Xen and KVM in their product since both are standard parts of the Linux kernel at this point , the focus of their efforts seemed on other levels of the software stack .
As virtualized environments become increasingly important , the company needed to do something to 1 ) improve Red Hat 's position in the market , 2 ) acquire useful , workable technology and 3 ) acquire talent in their area of virtual machine software and 4 ) move into an area that offered a rich source of other talent . "
" The acquisition of Qumranet appears to have touched on all of those points , " Kuznetzky concludes .
" Red Hat 's move was covered broadly and demonstrated their interest in virtualization .
Qumranet 's SolidICE and management technology offers Red Hat a toe hold in the desktop virtualization market and offers room to reach into the server virtualization arena .
Qumranet 's staff includes many of the key developers of KVM , developers who also have deep levels of expertise in other virtualization technology as well .
Red
Hat now has access to a wealth of [ virtualization ] expertise . "
So , from the experts ' viewpoint it certainly appears that Red Hat is making the right moves to become a player in the virtualization market .
Now , the question is : " Will the market agree ? "

On their website they are saying that each flower is handpicked , dried and then embedded into crystal clear resin .
What a great idea to preserve something so fragile and short lasting .
I think these are truly beautiful and something I would wear any day !
Verdict : Great way to preserve your favourite flowers and make them a long - lasting piece of jewellery !
I have sat across from Chris Matthews enough times now , participating in that psychotropic ritual known as Hardball , that I thought I ’d heard it all — but then the other night he uncorked a doozy that actually rendered me speechless .
( No , that is not a misprint . )
“ Let ’s start with John McCain , ” he said to me on the air shortly after the first presidential debate between McCain and Barack Obama .
“ Do you think he was too troll - like tonight ?
You know , too much of a troll ? ” I laughed .
“ Seriously , ” Chris went on .
“ Do people really want to put up with four years of that ?
Of [ him ] sitting there , angrily , grumpily , like a codger ? ”
As both a media figure and a human being , Matthews is sui generis — and yet what made his comments so remarkable was how unremarkable they were .
In the past several weeks , the shift of press - corps sentiment against McCain has been stark and undeniable , even among heavies such as Matthews long accused by the left of being residents of the Arizonan ’s amen corner .
Jonathan Alter , Joe Klein , Richard Cohen , David Ignatius , Jacob Weisberg : all former McCain admirers now turned brutal critics .
Equally if not more damaging , the shift has been just as pronounced , if less operatic , among straight - news reporters .
Suddenly , McCain is no longer being portrayed as a straight - talking , truth - telling maverick but as a liar , a fraud , and an opportunist with acute anger - management issues .
In McCain - land , this turn of events has provoked a fit of press - bashing that recalls the complaints lodged , albeit less loudly and indiscriminately , by Hillary Clinton ’s people .
The New York Times , says McCain chief strategist Steve Schmidt , is a “ pro-Obama advocacy organization . ”
When Politico ’s Ben Smith questions some of Schmidt ’s ( factually dubious , it turns out ) assertions , a McCain press aide declares that Smith is obviously “ in the tank . ”
The liberal media is ignoring Tony Rezko , Bill Ayers , and the alleged misdeeds of Joe Biden ’s son .
Many of these whinges are purely tactical , others rooted in a genuine sense of grievance .
But what all of them ignore is the degree to which the McCain campaign has been complicit in squandering one of the most precious assets its candidate brought to the race : a media dynamic that had previously worked overwhelmingly to his advantage .
Indeed , at this moment , McCain and his aides are perilously close to losing control of his public image , if it has n’t been lost already — a development that , as much as the financial crisis , may ultimately be seen as having driven the final nail into his coffin .
It ’s important to remember that just a few months ago , at the conclusion of the Democratic primaries , McCain and Obama stood on roughly level footing with the press .
“ They were both media darlings , ” says Marion Just , a Wellesley professor and consultant to the Project for Excellence in Journalism who studies campaign coverage .
“ The salient question was which of them would benefit more in the general election . ”
McCain ’s darlinghood was largely a vestige of his 2000 race in the Republican primaries , when his challenge to George W. Bush and the GOP Establishment , his reformist stances , and , not least , his freewheeling open - access press policy on the Straight Talk Express earned him countless fans among inky - fingered wretches .
He emerged from that campaign , despite having lost , as the most popular politician in the nation , and his defiance of Bush on matters such as torture , taxes , and campaign finance only enhanced his stature in the media as a different kind of politician .
“ His meta - narrative , ” says Just , “ is that he was authentic , a man of integrity , a man of high moral character . ”
Or , as McCain ’s chief strategist , John Weaver , puts it , “ John was the Good Housekeeping seal of approval in American politics . ”
But in the middle of the summer , the McCain campaign took a series of steps that appeared on their face to be at odds with the candidate ’s gold - plated brand .
In the interest of greater message discipline , his advisers eliminated his running back - of - the - bus ( or front - of - the - plane ) bullshit sessions with reporters .
And they turned sharply negative in their approach to Obama , hammering him with a series of ads — seen by some as trivial and trivializing , by others as racially coded , and eventually by most as unexpectedly effective — focused on his status as a celebrity unqualified to be commander - in - chief .
Much of this departure from the modus operandi of “ the old McCain ” was chalked up to Schmidt , who had run the Bush war room under Karl Rove in 2004 and who believed that running hard negative against Obama was McCain ’s only chance to win .
But many longtime McCain watchers say that the candidate ’s own gathering sense of frustration made him ripe for such a change .
“ It offended him that Obama walked away from his promise to do town - hall debates — and that the press did n’t seem to care , ” says Dan Schnur , McCain ’s 2000 communications director .
“ And then he did a series of nontraditional campaign events , like his poverty tour , and was alternately ignored or mocked by the media .
And my guess is that gave Steve much greater leverage in saying , ‘ Let ’s try a different approach . ’ ”
Whatever the reasoning , the strategists behind McCain ’s 2000 run , Weaver and Mike Murphy , immediately voiced their disquiet over the potential long - term damage to the image they ’d so carefully crafted .
“ There is no brand in politics you can just put on the shelf , run a campaign totally contrary to it , and then take it down later and still expect people to believe it , ” Weaver told me at the time .
“ I just hope it ’s still there for them when they need it . ”
To be fair , it ’s easy to see why Schmidt and his allies might have expected the McCain brand — or , if you prefer Just ’s phrase , his meta - narrative — to be everlasting .
Over the past eight years it had proved durable , most of all with the press , which consistently saw McCain ’s deviations from what were supposed to be his core beliefs as aberrations .
The speech at Falwell ’s university ?
The reversals on the Bush tax cuts and torture ?
The support for the teaching of “ intelligent design ” ?
All had been dismissed by the press corps as necessary hedges , as a matter of McCain doing what he had to do to win the GOP nomination .
But then came September — and everything changed .
The selection of Palin .
The lipstick - pig imbroglio .
The ad accusing Obama of supporting the teaching of sex education to kindergartners , along with a slew of other spots rife with distortions and fabrications .
Perhaps it was the sheer number of such incidents , perhaps the depth of their mendacity .
But the meme began to take hold in the press that the “ old McCain ” was dead .
Or perhaps that he had never existed in the first place .
“ There was a mismatch between the way he was behaving and the narrative the press had bought into , ” observes Just .
“ It made reporters wonder , ‘ Have we been had ? ’
And when that question starts being asked , it ’s a very bad place for a candidate to be . ”
Fueling that questioning behind the scenes , it should be said , were countless professional Republicans — some who ’d always regarded McCain as a fraud , others who believed in him all too much .
Taken together , they gave the press a permission slip to question McCain ’s authenticity and integrity .
And as that skepticism began to take hold , it effectively doomed McCain ’s maneuvers during the financial crisis ( the suspension of his campaign , the threat to pull out of the debate ) to be greeted with disdain and suspicion by the media .
“ By the time the financial crisis hit , we were past the tipping point , ” says a national reporter who covers McCain .
“ Lipstick on a pig and sex ed were the last straw for some of McCain ’s old hands and media allies .
And because of this cynicism , he did n’t get the benefit of the doubt for his ‘ suspension , ’ and it was treated as the stunt it was . ”
For McCain , seeing the press — “ my base , ” as he once famously put it — turn against him has apparently been more than painful .
According to people close to the campaign , it accounts for much of the seething , simmering anger that he ’s displayed of late on the hustings .
And rather than attempting to mute that anger , Schmidt and his associates , with their attacks on the press , are only validating and even stoking it — with borderline disastrous results .
The central memes that have always posed the greatest risk to McCain ’s candidacy are that he ’s dangerously erratic ( the dark side of maverick ) and that his notorious temper is forever threatening to explode .
And , as evinced by the recent spate of stories about his sarcastic , cantankerous performance last week before the Des Moines Register editorial board ( THE ANGRY WARRIOR ? read the headline in a Washington Post blog ) , those two memes are now coursing wildly through the media ’s collective bloodstream .
It ’s possible , of course , that Sarah Palin ’s debate performance — competent enough to relegate questions about her readiness and intellectual capacity to the back burner — may help McCain to find his way back to a happier place .
But it will do little to alter the fundamentals of the race , which now tilt strongly in Obama ’s favor .
The financial crisis has not only put the economy front and center , but it has also raised the stakes of the election , thus making the kinds of attacks that kept McCain afloat in the late summer seem tactical and unpersuasive .
Moreover , with the media filter where it is now , any wild - assed gambits that McCain undertakes are likely to be dismissed out of hand and vocally called out , thus diminishing their effectiveness .
The irony here is that , for so many months , the campaign being waged by Schmidt & Co. was viewed by the press as devious , sure , but deviously brilliant , delivering to McCain innumerable victories in the battle for the daily — and even hourly — news cycle .
But presidential campaigns are perverse , quicksilvery things , and it appears that the very tactics that for a while gave McCain the faint hope of victory are now the main obstacle to any hope of a late - stage revival .
Weaver and Murphy , it turns out , were right to worry .
The new McCain may have won some news cycles , but he is losing the contest of the meta - narrative — and with it , perhaps , the election .

Fourteen years ago South Africa buried Apartheid and , for the first time ever , all South Africans were able to vote in democratic national elections .
It was a pivotal moment in South African history .
It ’s a pity , however , that the South African Independent Electoral Commission ( IEC ) , which runs democratic elections in the country , finds it unnecessary to allow South Africans to access its website .
Visiting the IEC website with anything other than Windows and Internet Explorer rewards users with the following message :
“ Our server detected that you are using a Browser or Operating System ( e.g. Netscape , Mozilla Firefox , etc ) which is
currently incompatible with our site .
This web site is designed for Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 4 and above on Microsoft Windows .
The IEC is currently in the process of enhancing the web site so that it will also cater for other browsers .
We apologize for the inconvenience caused . ”
The fact that the IEC website does n’t work on anything but IE and Windows – I tried Opera and IE on Linux using Wine – is an anomaly .
The South African government has an approved open source strategy and has published Minimum Interoperability Standards for Information Systems in government which commits government and its agents to open standards .
It ’s a poor show from an organisation entrusted with facilitating democracy in the country .
The good news is that there are people of influence within government that are aware of this .
Department of Science and Technology CIO , Aslam Raffee , was the person who first pointed out the IEC website to me .
Lets hope that the IEC can fix this problem before the next national elections when it will become important for All South Africans to be able to access the website .

Pundits say the success of the surge has had unexpected political effects
At the outset of this presidential race it looked as though foreign policy would be one of the dominant issues in the campaign .
Adapting the United States to a fast - changing world , extricating its armed forces from Iraq , and restoring the country 's standing in the wake of " the global war on terror " would be sufficient foreign policy challenges for any new president .
Add to this the linked crises in Afghanistan and Pakistan ; Iran 's nuclear programme , and the quest for Middle East peace and you have more than enough to keep any administration occupied .
Foreign policy was also expected to play a significant tactical role in this campaign .
It is after all one of the big selling points for Republican contender Senator John McCain .
' Surge ' effect
In all of the presidential debates , he has sought to contrast his experience in foreign affairs with the relative inexperience of the Democratic hopeful Barack Obama .
Senator Obama , in contrast , has sought to present his opponent 's policies as simply a continuation of the Bush Administration in all but name .
But out on the campaign trail , foreign policy appears to have all but disappeared as an issue in this race .
Even Iraq - still one of the thorniest of problems - has fallen from the headlines .
Out in Colorado , veteran pollster and pundit Floyd Ciruli explained to me what was happening .
Whichever president wins , a troop build - up in Afghanistan is likely His polling shows how foreign policy - even Iraq - has fallen way down the list of voters ' priorities .
Of course it is the economic crisis that is largely responsible for this .
But he told me that paradoxically the very success of the surge - the increase in US troop numbers in Iraq - has had an unexpected political effect .
" The more successful the surge , " he says , " the less Iraq has been covered in the press . "
" So the more successful the strategy that John McCain advocated - which was to change the ground rules and add more troops to Iraq - the more Iraq receded from the agenda , leaving Senator McCain without the credit he was really yearning for and expected . "
Of course to say that foreign policy has gone away at a time of global financial meltdown is to impose a totally false division between the worlds of economics and foreign policy .
In today 's globalised world they are intimately bound up with each other .
No silver lining
For a view on the significance of this crisis for America 's role as a global leader , I turned to Richard Haass , President of the Council on Foreign Relations in New York , and a former senior official in the Bush Administration .
The new President is going to wake up in the White House and very quickly realise just how constrained he is
Richard Haass President of the Council on Foreign Relations in New York " Not every cloud has a silver lining , " he said , " and essentially there will be nothing particularly positive that flows from this financial crisis . "
" Most importantly , " he stressed , " it weakens the economic foundation stone , which is at the basis of all the US does in the world .
In the future there will be far fewer resources available , be it for the military , for aid , and for anything else . "
It is going to be harder , he said , for the next US president to get Americans to support open trade policies , for example a new world trade agreement .
" I think the prospects for that go down " , he says .
But above all he stressed that the crisis effects " the ability of the United States to preach to the rest of the world about how to operate a modern global capitalist economy .
Our credibility in that area has gone down considerably . "
Richard Haass though , as one of the more pragmatic conservative foreign policy analysts is no doom - merchant .
Catastrophe or opportunity " The crisis has damaged or weakened the position of the United States in the world , " he said .
" But I would n't assume that this is permanent .
" We are most likely entering a period of disorder , where essentially we have gone from an American - dominated uni-polar world to a world in which power is distributed to many actors ; some of whom are prepared to play a helpful role , and unfortunately some of whom are not . "
Gary
Hart believes the global economy problems help Mr Obama While in the West , I touched base with one of the Democratic Party 's most prominent foreign policy thinkers - former senator and one - time presidential hopeful Gary Hart .
While not underestimating the impact of the problems of the global economy , he nonetheless saw in all of this an opportunity for the man that he backs for the Presidency , Senator Obama .
" I can see a situation " , he told me in his office at the University of Colorado , " where catastrophe can be turned into opportunity , where a President Barrack Obama simply says our situation is different now , we are going to play a different role in the world and our role is convenor and creative leader . "
A new international regulatory system for banking might be needed , he argued and this , he said , " might be a good place for the new president to start . "
Gary Hart thinks that a President Obama could transform American foreign policy .
This assessment stems from his fundamental analysis of the problems facing the contemporary world .
" All of the current global problems , " he told me , " be it proliferation of weapons of mass destruction ; failing states ; climate change ; mass South - North migrations ; the threat of pandemics and so on , share two common features .
One is that no single nation , by itself can solve them and second , they can not be solved by military means at all . "
Then he harked back to a theme of many Democrats , suggesting , as he put it , " that an Obama Administration might recreate the Truman - era of 1945 to 1948 and create a new set of international institutions in collaboration with our allies to address these new realities . "
This idea of a new American foreign policy based upon co-operation and collaboration rather than unilateralism is what many people abroad seem to be hoping for from a President Obama .
If opinion polls are to be believed , the overwhelming view in the world beyond America 's shores is that Mr Obama is the right man for the job .
Outside America many of the caricatures of Mr McCain as simply " a George W Bush Mark III " seem to be widely accepted .
But behind the slogans , some experts wonder just how different an Obama or a McCain administration might be from each other ; at least in foreign policy terms .
Diplomatic tools " I think no matter who wins " , Richard Haass said , " you are going to see a reduction in the American presence in Iraq - they may disagree on the pace and how fast we get to some point - but the era in which Iraq has dominated American foreign policy is over . "
Polls show the Iraq war has become less of a priority for voters
He went on : " We are going to see a build - up in Afghanistan , no matter who is the winner , there is a consensus that the situation there is deteriorating rapidly and the United States needs to re-orient its policy .
" And I would think we are going to see a new diplomatic approach towards Iran as it speeds along in its efforts to give itself the option to develop nuclear materials and conceivably nuclear weapons . "
Nonetheless Richard Haass accepted that there were some significant differences between the candidates especially in the emphasis they place on diplomacy .
" I think Senator Obama is more comfortable in embracing diplomacy as a central tool or instrument of American foreign policy " he told me .
" Senator McCain approaches diplomacy a little bit more with pre-conditions ; as something of a reward and he also seems to see it as something of a sanction , to be removed when he does n't like a country . "
But whoever wins the coming election , Richard Haass believes that diplomacy will win out over other options .
" The new President is going to wake up in the White House , " he notes , " and very quickly realise just how constrained he is . "
" He is going to have very few military forces that he can do anything with because the bulk of our Army and Marines are so tied down in Iraq and Afghanistan .
" Economically he is obviously going to find himself extraordinarily constrained - the US will still be importing two - thirds of the oil it uses and even if the price comes down somewhat , it will still be relatively high by historical standards .
" So the one box of tools the new president is likely to have at his disposal , will be diplomatic tools . "

Do you read labels at the supermarket ?
If you do , you may soon notice changes in the ingredients of some of the foods you buy .
Food makers are quietly substituting cheaper ingredients in processed foods to offset the high price of commodities .
The Wall Street Journal took note of this trend last weekend , reporting that Food Makers Scrimp on Ingredients In An Effort to Fatten Their Profits [ 1 ] .
However , that may be overstating their intentions .
With high fuel prices driving up the cost of basic ingredients such as sugar and wheat , food companies are are forced to make a choice : raise prices or cut corners .
Because competition in the industry is so strong , raising prices is the last thing food companies want to do .
Instead , they look to the quality and quantity of the ingredients they use [ 2 ] .
For example :
Kraft Miracle
Whip now contains more water
Nestle snack products now contain less milk
Sara Lee has switched to cheaper wheat for some breads
Mars Inc. is reducing the size of its Funsize candy packs
Hamburger Helper products have reduced the number of spice and ingredient pouches
Some of Hershey ’s chocolates are now being made with vegetable oil instead of cocoa butter
While some companies are adding fillers or cheaper ingredients , others are simply trimming manufacturing costs to save money .
Food makers that are changing ingredients insist that they are n’t sacrificing quality or nutritional value .
That may be hard to swallow , given that they ’re reducing ingredient quality and quantity .
Although it ’s not hard to imagine smaller quantities ( and thus lower calories ) making a positive impact on health , the WSJ article cited at least one change that does n’t result in a healthier product : making chocolate with vegetable oil instead of cocoa butter .
Indeed , by replacing cocoa butter with vegetable oil , Hershey ’s is lowering the overall health benefit of chocolate .
Why ?
Because a number of epidemiologic studies have shown that cocoa , rich in flavonoids , has a number of cardiovascular health benefits [ 4 - 5 ] .
The question is , will consumers be sensitive to the nutritional affects of these kinds of changes ?
Not really , according to Harry Balzer of the NPD group , a market research and industry tracking firm [ 3 ] :
Consumers read labels .
About half of all Americans say they routinely read labels on food products .
So , I ’d say yes , but the question really is ‘ are they going to alter their behavior because of the reading the label ’ .
Our experience has been no .
Health in this country is really a secondary issue , a secondary concern .
The primary concerns are taste , cost and ease .
What can health - concious consumers do ?
Keep in mind that these changes are occurring in processed foods .
Food processing tends to lower the nutritional value of food , and processed foods often have a higher ratio of calories to other essential nutrients than unprocessed foods .
Simply by reading this article you ’re aware that cheaper ingredients are being used in processed foods — review your labels carefully .
Your best bet ?
Stick with fresh fruits and vegetables .
A diet rich in fresh fruits and vegetables is important for maintaining good health .
When fresh produce is n’t available , frozen and canned fruits and vegetables are a good option .
Canned vegetables do n’t taste as good as fresh and typically are n’t as nutritious , but it ’s better than not eating vegetables at all .
Fruits and vegetables contain essential vitamins , minerals and fiber , and increased consumption lowers your risk of developing several cancers .

A couple of days ago we all saw Jim Martin of Georgia climb to within two points of Saxby " Jackass " Chambliss in recent polls .
Now another unthinkable moment just occurred : Rick Noriega is within 7 points of John Cornyn in , yes , Texas !
The Texas seat currently stands at 50 - 43 in favor of Cornyn .
Now , okay , 7 points is still gives a scary looking lead for Cornyn , especially when combined with Cornyn's 50 % polling number .
But , Bruce Lunsford was 7 points ( or more ) behind Mitch McConnell in the usually Red State of Kentucky when I added him to my Senate Swing State list .
Now , Lunsford is only 2 points behind .
So , today , I 'm adding Jim Martin ( sorry , a little late ) along with Rick Noriega to my list of Senatorial Swing States !
That means that the list goes from eight swing states to ten !
We 're not just looking at a Democratic President .
We 're also looking at major gains for the Dems in the House and the Senate .
This could be the first filibuster - proof Democratic majority in decades .
This could very well be a Blue Revolution !

Parents are not allowed to inflict physical marking or mental harm A cross-party group of MPs has failed to force through a ban on smacking children in England and Wales .
Led by Labour 's Kevin Barron , the campaigners opposed the current situation allowing parents to use the practice as a " reasonable punishment " .
Some 28 MPs signed an amendment to the Children and Young Persons Bill , but this was not discussed .
The government said it had tightened up protection for children but opposed making smacking a crime .
The current law allowing so - called ' reasonable punishment ' of children is unjust , unsafe and unclear
Kevin Barron
Chairman , Commons health select committee Under a tightly drawn timetable , MPs had just four hours to debate the legislation , and that was taken up with discussion on long - term residential placements and fostering issues .
Mr Barron , chairman of the Commons health select committee , said : " It was always a long shot because the bill was not about the punishment of children ; it was about the protection of children . "
He added : " The issue wo n't go away .
This is something many of us feel concerned about . "
The amendment , signed by 28 MPs , called for children to have the same protection against assault as adults .
Law tightened Campaigners said 111 Labour backbenchers had signed a private letter demanding a free vote on smacking , with some warning they were prepared to defy the whips if ministers did not back down .
But the government and opposition front benches said they wanted to focus on the main functions of the bill , which do not include dealing with corporal punishment .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown 's spokesman said the government was clear on the need to safeguard the interests of children but did not support an all - out ban on smacking .
Children 's Minister Beverley Hughes said , while it did not condone or encourage smacking , the government did not want to criminalise it .
She said : " If we put a ban on smacking into legislation it would mean in practice that a mother who gives her child a mild smack on the hand when they refuse to put back sweets picked up at the supermarket checkout could end up facing criminal charges . "
She added that a survey suggested fewer parents were smacking children and the law had already been tightened to give children greater protection from assault .
The last attempt to impose a full ban on smacking was defeated in 2004 , although 49 Labour MPs rebelled .
A compromise was agreed , tightening the law by outlawing punishment which left physical marks or caused mental harm .
Last December , Northern Ireland 's children 's commissioner failed in a High Court attempt to force the government to outlaw the physical punishment of young people .

What are these ?
Tuesday , for the first time in Gallup tracking , Obama surpassed the 50 percent threshold and now leads McCain 52 percent to 41 percent .
Dem strategists see landslide
Three weeks of historic economic upheaval have done more than just tilt a handful of once reliably Republican states in Barack Obama ’s direction .
Democratic strategists are now optimistic that the ongoing crisis could lead to a landslide Obama victory .
Four large states John McCain once seemed well - positioned to win — Virginia , North Carolina , Ohio and Florida — have in recent weeks shifted toward Obama .
If Obama were to win those four states — a scenario that would represent a remarkable turn of events — he would likely surpass 350 electoral votes .

Under almost any feasible scenario , McCain cannot win the presidency if he loses any of those four states .
And if Obama actually captured all four states , it would almost certainly signal a strong electoral tide that would likely sweep the Southwestern swing states — Colorado , New Mexico , Nevada — not to mention battlegrounds from New Hampshire to Iowa to Missouri .
One month ago , Democratic strategist Paul Maslin , who closely tracks the electoral map , thought that perhaps Democrats would win by a couple of percentage points .
At best , he thought Obama might earn a slight majority as Democrats earned in 1976 , the last time the party ’s presidential nominee cracked the 50 percent barrier .
“ Now it ’s a whole different world , ” Maslin said .
“ The economy is way beyond 1992 .
In 1980 , it was the Iran hostage crisis and the economy .
I ’ve never seen an issue take this kind of prominence . ”
Gallup finds that 69 percent of Americans believe the economy is the most important issue facing the nation .
The second most cited issue , the war in Iraq , is named by only 11 percent of voters .
Bill Clinton ’s former pollster Doug Schoen calls this the “ economic tsunami . ”
And it ’s this tsunami that has altered the electoral map in a way that Obama himself could not .
“ The Obama campaign did a lot of important foundation work to expand the Democratic map .
And I give them credit for that , ” Maslin said .
“ But the real expansion of the map is coming from an outside event , namely the economy , and not the tactics of the Obama campaign .
“ Obama has not changed the map , ” Schoen said .
The map has changed because , in light of the economic turmoil , “ McCain has become an almost unacceptable alternative ” to President Bush .
According to Gallup , only one in four Americans have a positive view of the president , the lowest rating of Bush ’s presidency .
That is only one point above Richard Nixon ’s floor , 24 percent — which he registered when disgrace forced the first presidential resignation — and just three points higher than the lowest public approval ever , which was notched by Harry Truman in 1952 during the Korean War .
Only 9 percent of Americans are “ satisfied ” with the direction of the United States , the lowest level since the question was first asked by the Gallup , in the late 1970s .
Nearly six in 10 Americans believe that the United States could be on the verge of entering an economic spiral similar to the Great Depression , according to a CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll conducted over the weekend .
“ These events are conspiring against McCain , ” said Tony Fabrizio , the pollster for 1996 Republican nominee Bob Dole .
“ The only thing that we can hope is that these circumstances change in terms of being off the front page .
“ We are playing defense in places we should n’t , ” he continued , speaking of the electoral map .
“ It will take something ground - shaking , earth - shaking , ” to reorient the map to where it was even one month ago .
It was only a month ago that McCain seemed poised to overcome the public ’s poor view of the Republican Party , having literally lifted the GOP ’s prospects with his own and largely escaped the political dead weight of President Bush .
That changed on Sept. 15 , when the stock market tumbled 505 points and McCain observed that “ the fundamentals of our economy are strong ” before pivoting to use the language of an “ economic crisis . ”
“ McCain could have changed the direction of the river .
He could have opposed the bailout .
Made clear it was a massive bailout loaded with pork .
And he was not a party to the Bush - Obama plan , ” Schoen said .
“ Barring a terrorist attack , ” said Maslin , “ in the face of what ’s happened to the United States economy , the world economy , in the last two weeks , how does this trend reverse itself ? ”
Multiple surveys in the past two weeks , like the CNN / ORC poll , have shown Obama with his highest level of support in the general election .
Until Sept. 15 , Obama had reached 50 percent support in the Gallup tracking poll only once , at the peak of his Democratic convention bounce .
Since Sept. 15 , Obama has hit the 50 percent mark or higher eight times , including in the past five days .
On Tuesday , Obama surpassed the 50 percent threshold and now leads McCain 52 percent to 41 percent , the largest margin of the campaign .
That same tracking shows that in the past 12 days , Obama ’s support has stabilized between 48 percent and 52 percent , while McCain ’s has stabilized between 41 percent and 44 percent , outside the bounds of the fleeting fluctuations that gave Obama his last 9 point lead following his international trip in late July .
Many veteran GOP and Democratic pollsters who have been skeptical of Obama ’s effort to win red states like North Carolina now believe the economic turmoil has put them well within reach .
“ Here , events have made the economy dramatically the issue .
More people are concerned about the economy now than even in 1992 , ” said Mark Penn , who has served as both Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s and Bill Clinton ’s pollster .
“ What we are seeing is more and more voters who are saying they are voting on the economy because I do n’t have any confidence from McCain and George Bush that they can handle the economy . ”
Obama is seen by double - digit margins in multiple polls as the more capable economic steward .
Briefly , following the GOP convention , McCain had drawn about even on the question .
“ There is the complete utter loss of faith in GOP politics , ” argued Jim Jordan , a Democratic strategist .
“ This is chickens coming home to roost in a way that was almost unimaginable a year ago . ”

Pew ’s national poll still has her at +11 , but that ’s down from + 22 just two weeks ago ( which is where Biden ’s at now ) .
As to whether she ’s qualified to be president , the split after the first week of September was 52/39 .
Now : 37/51 .
A good debate could work wonders .
She does have it in her , as our now expectations - raising media eagerly reminds us this morning .
REYKJAVIK , Oct 15 ( Reuters ) - Iceland has food stocks for about 3 to 5 weeks , but needs quickly to restore a proper foreign exchange market so importers can get back to normal business and avoid shortages , importers said on Wednesday .
Since crisis broke out on the north Atlantic island of 300,000 people , involving the government taking over the top three banks , suppliers to Iceland have cut credit to importers .
Some have also demanded pre-payment for goods .
Though the central bank has said it has foreign reserves for eight to nine months of food , importers said a cash injection from abroad was the only solution to avoid shortages .
They said Iceland imported about a half of its food products , but produced its own dairy products and meat .
“ The government has to get some currency in to back up the crown and build up credibility again , ” said Oli Johnson of the OJNK food importer , one of Iceland ’s biggest .
“ As soon as we can show we can pay without restrictions , things will open up again , ” Johson said .
“ Hopefully they plan to solve it in the next few days . ”
He said Iceland on average had stocks of about 3 to 4 weeks .
The problem for importers was uncertainty about whether they would get foreign exchange , which they now have to apply for under a rationing system begun by the central bank .
“ The second problem is that we do not know what the exchange rate will be , ” he said .
The central bank held a first auction to set the exchange rate on Wednesday and it was set at 150 crowns to the euro , versus 131 to the euro before currency trading halted last week .
Peter Thorginsson , chief operating officer of largest food importer , Olgerdin , said current food stocks would last about 4 to 5 weeks , with some supplies still coming in , he said .
He did not anticipate major shortages , but said the situation could get acute if supplies to food producers , such as bakers , were affected .
“ They can not produce if they are missing one or two ingredients , ” he said .
On Tuesday , Iceland drew on Nordic help to get hold of 400 million euros ( $ 546 million ) and separately began talks with Russia over a possible multi-billion - euro loan .
A team from the IMF is in Reykjavik , but Prime Minister Geir Haarde said on Tuesday that it was still an open question whether Iceland would borrow money from the Fund .

GRAND ISLAND , Neb . 
Like many workers at the meatpacking plant here , Raul A. Garcia , a Mexican - American , has watched with some discomfort as hundreds of Somali immigrants have moved to town in the past couple of years , many of them to fill jobs once held by Latino workers taken away in immigration raids .
Mr. Garcia has been particularly troubled by the Somalis ’ demand that they be allowed special breaks for prayers that are obligatory for devout Muslims .
The breaks , he said , would inconvenience everyone else .
“ The Latino is very humble , ” said Mr. Garcia , 73 , who has worked at the plant , owned by JBS U.S.A. Inc. , since 1994 .
“ But they are arrogant , ” he said of the Somali workers .
“ They act like the United States owes them . ”
Mr. Garcia was among more than 1,000 Latino and other workers who protested a decision last month by the plant ’s management to cut their work day  and their pay  by 15 minutes to give scores of Somali workers time for evening prayers .

This is an excerpt from the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy :
James ’s fundamental idea is that mind and matter are both aspects of , or structures formed from , a more fundamental stuff — pure experience — that ( despite being called “ experience ” ) is neither mental nor physical .
Pure experience , James explains , is “ the immediate flux of life which furnishes the material to our later reflection with its conceptual categories … a that which is not yet any definite what , tho ’ ready to be all sorts of whats … ” ( ERE , 46 ) .
That “ whats ” pure experience may be are minds and bodies , people and material objects , but this depends not on a fundamental ontological difference among these “ pure experiences , ” but on the relations into which they enter .
Certain sequences of pure experiences constitute physical objects , and others constitute persons ; but one pure experience ( say the perception of a chair ) may be part both of the sequence constituting the chair and of the sequence constituting a person .
Indeed , one pure experience might be part of two distinct minds , as James explains in a chapter entitled “ How Two Minds Can Know One Thing . ”
Looks like James was influenced strongly by Buddhist contemporaries .
He was a major fan , and I wonder if this ‘ pure experience ’ can really be reduced to the philosophical category of “ idealism , ” as my professor had mentioned .
Or , was he trying to convey as best he could , a state before our conceptualizing – before the idea of the “ physical ” and the “ mental ” even arise .
Not that these two concepts do not equate with real things , but that there may be something deeper , primordial and before the formation our brains crystallize .
This “ before the concept ” hinting sounds like what he was trying to convey with , “ a that which is not yet any definite what . ”
So is this “ pure experience ” the tool of radical empiricism , so much so that it is before our concepts , before our scientific instruments , before even the mental and the physical concepts– is it so radical that it is at the root of just ‘ being ’ ?
It sounds to me like he was trying to say that bare attention is as direct as we can get .
This work happened very early on ( James died in 1910 ) , and perhaps early thinkers musings on our very nature , consciousness and the usefulness of a form of meditation ( “ Between this and that ” , as Krishnamurti might say ) , did not go so far because scientific studies were going in another direction .
Although psychology was never abandoned , science narrowed its scope to the physically observable .
Even though the characteristics of “ pure experience , ” and exploring our awareness directly was feasible , observable , and arguably insightful , the changing attitudes at the time saw this area of studies as valueless .
This remains a considerable problem , even today .
Although , we are beginning to be more open about meditations and their insights , it is still strictly from a “ top down ” approach , meaning : observing the universe from the outside - in , as if we can be totally “ objective ” and peer down through microscopes into the universe , dissecting its bits and categorizing it .
While not to belittle this method , the very other side of the spectrum : “ bottom up ” has been abandoned .
I think I ’d like to explore this relationship : between “ bottom up ” and “ top down , ” and how feasible both sides of the spectrum really are .
Can there be a middle ground ?
Is there one ?
Contemporaries will often bash the “ bottom up ” as pure nonsense , and see no value in it whatsoever unless it is grounded in “ empirical ” research .
Unless it can be observed top - down , through the lense of modern science , it is not worth much beyond aesthetics and personal interests .
I feel that this alone is a profound misunderstanding , and it has alot to do with what we value , and how our attitudes often mold our ability to perceive insights about the universe and ourselves .
Finally , a bit of inspiration !
I ’ll continue this soon !

Firefighters have extinguished a blaze in the tunnel under the English Channel , but undersea train traffic remains suspended for a second day .
Jacques Gounon , chief executive of Eurotunnel , said the undamaged southern passage of the Channel Tunnel , could reopen as soon as Friday evening .
Anzeige
The tunnel was closed off after a fire broke out Thursday afternoon on a truck aboard a 30 - car shuttle train traveling from England to France .
Fourteen people were injured in the fire , including six who suffered from smoke inhalation .
It was among the most serious incidents in the history of the 50 - kilometer ( 30 - mile ) tunnel , which opened to passengers in 1994 .
The cause of the fire remained unclear .
Bussereau said it „ likely resembles something accidental , “ without elaborating .
Jacques Gounon , chief executive of Eurotunnel , which operates the tunnel , said he had no reason to believe the fire could have been „ criminal . “
Anzeige
The Channel Tunnel is composed of three tunnels , each 40 meters ( 130 feet ) beneath the sea bed .
One tunnel carries shuttles , Eurostar passenger trains and freight traffic from France to England , while another runs in the opposite direction .
The pair are connected to a central service tunnel , used for maintenance and emergency access .
The central tunnel is kept under a higher pressure than the train tunnels it flanks to keep out smoke in case of fire .
Gounon said on RTL radio that traffic could resume in the southern tunnel later Friday at half its usual capacity .
He said the damaged part of the northern tunnel would remain closed „ for several weeks . “
Anzeige
Eurotunnel , which has been plagued by financial troubles and crushing debt , assured investors in a statement Friday that any financial impact of the accident „ will be limited . “
Eurotunnel shares dropped 4 percent Thursday after the fire broke out and another 3.2 percent in early Paris trading Friday to Euro 9 ( $ 12.54 ) .
The train was carrying 32 people – mostly truck drivers accompanying their vehicles – in mid-afternoon when the fire erupted about 11 kilometers ( seven miles ) from the French side , officials said .
All were evacuated safely .
Anzeige
The fire broke out on a single truck on the train , with the truck drivers occupying a railcar ahead .
Six people were taken to a hospital after inhaling large quantities of smoke , officials said .
Another eight were treated for light injuries .
Some injured their hands by trying to break the train 's windows to get out , Interior Minister Michele Alliot - Marie said Thursday .
Two of the injured „ said they heard an explosion followed by flames , “ she told reporters after arriving in the area .
Eurotunnel and local officials could not confirm Friday whether there had been an explosion , or media reports that three trucks were ablaze .
Firefighters got the blaze under control within two hours , but were n't able to immediately put it out because temperatures that remained as high as 1,000 C ( 1,832 F ) inside complicated their effort , Alliot - Marie said .
Eurostar trains carry some 26,000 people a day on average , according to latest traffic figures .

WI ’ve spent most of the last week getting into , around , and out of the issues related to interoperability of Oracle and PHP .
Before you start laughing , cursing , and blaming , Oracle was n’t my choice of the database for this specific project .
It ’s just the company already had it installed and working for the background , and there needed to be some integration with the front , which is of course MySQL and PHP based .
First thing I do , obviously , is visit PHP . net to check for the prefix of the functions that I need for Oracle .
Through out my experience with PHP , that ’s about the only thing I need to know to start working with the new database .
Oh , and the PHP module installed to provide those functions .
Oracle interface for PHP is called is called OCI8 .
All you need to do now is install the oci8 module .
Here comes the first trouble .
oci8 is not provided as a pre-compiled package for Fedora Linux .
There is an alternative yum repository – Remi , which has oci8 RPMs , but first of all , the oci8 module is compiled against somewhat outdated Oracle headers ( version 10.2.0.4 instead of the latest 11.1.0.1 ) , and it also needs to replace your native PHP and MySQL packages .
I tried that , and it sort of worked , but I was n’t happy .
So I got my Fedora packages back and decided that I need to compile oci8 myself .
In order to compile oci8 , one needs to download Oracle InstantClient ( basic package ) and some header files ( devel package ) .
These can be downloaded from the Oracle web site , for free , minus the time for the registration .
The little trick here is that during oci8 compilation process , the includes are searched from locations which do not include the one from Oracle RPM .
I did a simple symlink of the includes folder to where Oracle headers were , and compilation went on just fine .
( Hint : otherwise you ’ll get a whole lot of Zend related messages and a fatal error ) .
Gladly , I only had to do this path correction on the Fedora 9 machine .
My production server with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 compiled oci8 without any problems all by itself .
Update : more detailed instructions on the actual installation can be found here and here .
Now that oci8 installed and configured , I spent some time figuring the correct way to specify the DSN .
Oracle uses some weirdly name file ( tnsnames.ora ) in some weird location , but luckily there is a way to go around it .
More so , I recommend that you remove tnsnames .ora file altogether , since it can add to your troubles .
For example , if you mix spaces and tabs as whitespaces in that file , you are screwed .
So , just get rid of it .
The way you specify DSN is directly in the PHP script , and you use the syntax like so : “ //hostname.or.ip:port/dbname “ .
Intuitive , I know .
Once you ’ll get connected to the server , you have a whole bag of surprises waiting for you .
That is if you are too used to working with MySQL .
First is the syntax .
Oracle is using PL / SQL , so you wipe the dust of from that really old Pascal textbook that you have somewhere .
“ begin : result := some.procedure.call( : param1 , : param2 ) ; end ; ” – that sort of thing .
Secondly , you ’ll be happy to know that prepared queries are supported .
So your workflow will slightly change .
Perl programmers will feel more at home here . oci_bind_by_name( ) and oci_execute ( ) are your friends here .
Oh , and while you are at , get familiar with the types of the parameters , because they are important .
And do n’t forget that you ’ll have to bind each and every variable in the query , or get a fatal error .
And since you are learning something here , get ready for the oracle errors .
The most frequent one you ’ll get would be something like “ Failed to retreive the error message for ORA - 12345 ” , where 12345 would be a number of the error .
So you ’ll google for ORA - 12345 and ORA - 54321 and ORA - XYZZZ a lot .
But than you ’ll have a wrapper library and you ’ll be OK .
Update : as was noted in the comments , PL / SQL is just an option , not a requirement .
Also , most of the headaches of the above paragraph could be avoided by using one of the PHP frameworks .
I personally have n’t yet tried the framework yet , since I ’d like to see things working directly first .
Especially since we are not in the test mode only .
The bigger surprise is still waiting for you though .
You are very likely to discover that OCI8 implementation for PHP is very slow .
And I do mean extremely very slow .
I could n’t believe that it could be slow , so I went into the source code and OMG !
It is really slow .
The slow part is around fetch_all ( ) against fetch_row ( ) .
Basically , it ’s always row by row and never all , even if you tell it how many rows you need fetched .
In my case , I have the server a bit far away , and there is a possibility to get many rows back .
So even for a simple query with 140 rows in results I was getting 20 seconds execution time .
Oracle was serving results fast , the network was OK , machines on both sides were powerful and all , but it was still taking 20 seconds or more .
I am still trying to find the solution to this issue , but so far it seems that the current way I do it will be the way to do it .
And the way I do it now is the following .
Never ever run direct SQL queries .
Everything goes through a stored procedure .
The results are returned all in a single row .
And that single row has the BLOB ( CLOB actually ) with all results in one single XML .
Fetching works good enough to get it , and then parsing is done with one of the billion XML parsers for PHP .
In my case MiniXML worked pretty good until bigger results started coming in .
That ’s when I learned an important lesson .
MiniXML parses XML with a regular expression .
PHP has a couple of settings in the configuration file that limits the size of the memory and recursion during regex parsing – pcre.backtrack_limit and pcre.recursion_limit .
If you really want to kill your server , set these to - 1 ( instead of default 100000 ) and try a regex against a 1 MB XML file .
Enjoy , cause it wo n’t be long before everything goes down .
I did n’t feel like changing from MiniXML so we just implemented some limits in the queries and stored procedures on the Oracle side , and add a few checks in PHP fail rather than crash the system .
So , to some it up , here is my experience with Oracle and PHP from the last week :
I had to register on Oracle web site to download packages
I had to re-learn my long forgotten compilation skills
I had to go read some C
I had to step on the “ re-inventing the wheel ” path more than once
I am parsing XML when working with the database
I had a head ache more than twice
I did n’t have much fun
After all , it works .
Sort of .
One last point in this saga is about Googling .
Ask me any question , and I do mean any question , about MySQL .
Heck , even PostgreSQL .
And the answer is just there , on the first page of Google results .
In any human or programming language .
For any operating system .
You ’ll be sorted out and working in less then a minute .
Then , try asking even the simplest of the simplest questions about Oracle and PHP .
Sometimes you ’ll find something .
Some other times , you wo n’t .
The overall feeling I have is that not a lot of people are using Oracle with PHP , and those of them who do are in their majority not very happy .
Now I ’ve joined the army .
Sometimes , I have to admit , when predictions are made , I can be just wrong .
Asked , early in the summer as to the wisdom of buying winter supplies of heating oil in the North East , I suggested that there would be a likely continued rise in price , and that with distributors having problems , that an early securing of supplies would pay off .
Well it is not happening .
Recent stories have shown that the price of heating oil in Maine has fallen from $ 4.71 in July to $ 3.08 last week .
The national average heating oil price as shown by the EIA is steadily falling .
AccuWeather.com Chief Long -Range Forecaster Joe Bastardi today released his 2008 –09 Winter Season Forecast addressing issues of average temperature and precipitation impacting the nation .
His forecast calls for one of the coldest winters in several years across much of the East .
The underlying facts about world production potential have not changed , but the demand side of the equation has , at least temporarily , and with this change , the price has dropped .
Winter still comes around ( I look up at a tomato ripening on the window ledge as temperatures outside drop to freezing ) and this winter has been predicted as being a bad one .
The core of cold was centered across the Great Plains last year but is expected to be farther east this year .
Bastardi says the winter of 2008 - 2009 will be viewed as the hardest in several years .
“ It may be a shock to some when compared with the above - average temperatures of last year in the East .
It will put some ‘ brrrrrr ’ in the saddle of folks who have not had to deal with such things for a while , " he cautions .
The toughness of the winter will not be seen just by those who use the oil .
Distributors , and the suppliers that provide it up the chain are now starting to see the fall - out from the credit freeze .
" A lot are starting to bounce checks , " said a trader at a wholesale heating oil supplier , who requested anonymity to protect the supplier 's standing in the physical fuel market .
" Credit lines are definitely strained . "
In the Northeast U.S. , heating oil 's biggest market , hundreds of dealers , ranging from single - truck operations to publicly traded corporations , bring the fuel to customers .
The fractured system , which stretches back decades and includes many multigenerational family owners , connects into a global market through the heating oil futures contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange , which in turn acts as a global benchmark for other products , including diesel and jet fuel .
But the story goes on to note that inventories are 25 % lower than they were last year , and though the price drop has helped the financial stability of some distributors , the price is still higher than it was this time last year , and it wo n’t take much of a disruption to take it back up .
I have written in the past about the supply of natural gas into the North East , and the recent drop in price from $ 13.58 to $ 6.50 per million Btu , would initially suggest that there is nothing to worry about this year for that fuel either .
However stocks are down a little over this time last year , when they were at record levels .
If the cold weather is arriving a little earlier this may also reverse the decline in price , and depending on the winter ’s severity may also remind folk that the cheaper supplies from the Rockies are n’t quite to Ohio yet , though the Rockies Express pipeline ( REX ) reached Missouri in May .
Comments on an extension through Ohio ( which it was scheduled to reach in June , 2009 ) close this week .
This is later than had been intended , and with this delay in getting permits , the project completion has been set back about five months .
( Interestingly there is some concern that this will hurt supplies to places such as Nevada . )
We have reached a time when production from the Marcellus shale in PA is now gearing up , so this supply may have an overall influence on price .
However , given the relative cost of the wells , it will be interesting to see how the entire dynamic of price plays out with the two new competing sources of natural gas becoming available at around the same time .
This may be especially interesting with the changes in the financial market .
At the other side of the country up in Alaska , one might have thought that supplies would have been more assured , given that the recent redistribution of oil revenue to the residents has been upped by some $ 1,200 per person .
However , getting oil out to the more remote communities of the state continues to be a difficulty , and at an additional cost , so that prices away from the towns may well be at double that in the city .
This is leading to concern from the Alaskan Federation of Natives , who considers that it is reaching emergency levels .
One of the impacts that this might have , is on the longer - term availability of natural gas from Alaska into the lower 48 .
The recent decision that TransCanada will run the pipeline the 1,715 miles from Prudhoe Bay to the Alberta Hub in Canada may face the same sort of objections from Native tribes that has caused problems for the McKenzie River project further East .
If the economic downturn reduces demand , with the concurrent increased availability of natural gas in the short term , then the economics of pipeline construction may not be as immediately pressing as they might have appeared even a year ago .
Unfortunately putting off the construction planning and the other preliminary work that presages construction may mean that by the time that Arctic gas finally gets down to the lower 48 , it will be considerably later than can do most good for the country .
Perhaps in recognition that it is no longer prudent to rely so heavily on external sources , Maine is now seeing construction of wood pellet plants , although there is currently a greater demand than supply .
Part of the reason for the shortage is credited , in part , to the ability to buy larger volumes at a time , without the storage problem that arises with other forms of fuel .
The pellets are selling for around $ 300 a ton , with one plant producing 60 – 70 tons a day during the summer .
With demand increasing there are plans in place for expansion of the industry .
Which reminds me that it is time for the annual chimney sweeping , so if you will excuse me . . . . . . nothing like a face - full of soot to keep one humble .
What IS a disaster for America ’s Wall Street ( actually 50th and Park ) and London ’s City ( actually Canary Wharf ) and deep trouble for the economy of jobs , factories and stores has a ( very small ) silver lining for Charles D. Ellis and his publisher : “ The Partnership : The Making of Goldman Sachs ” will probably sell as many copies as they can print .
Everyone interested in finance and economics will spend several months trawling for information to understand our current mess .
Many know ( or will soon know ) that , of all the investment banks , commercial banks , shadow banks , hedge funds , investment vehicles , etc. , in our economy , only two seem capable of withstanding current financial upheavals : James Dimond ’s JPMorgan Chase and Lloyd Blankfein ’s Goldman Sachs .
As of this writing , the rest of Wall Street ’s large institutions appear likely to vanish completely , become nationalized or be gravely weakened if they manage to survive intact .
The financial markets are reacting to the news of Treasury Secretary ( and former Goldman Sachs head ) Henry M. Paulson ’s $ 700 - billion relief plan without the slightest sign of the crisis easing .
JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs may not survive either , but they have much better odds of emerging stronger and of profiting from today ’s stock market chaos -- it would take a near - Great Depression to drag them under .
For the last two generations , Goldman Sachs has been the rising firm to watch on Wall Street .
For at least the last generation , the consensus judgment of those who work in the financial system has been that Goldman Sachs is the “ best ” large - scale Wall Street firm .
As Ellis writes , the firm “ recruited more intriguing people ” and “ people who cared more about [ the long - term welfare of ] their firm ” than in other firms .
Its leaders “ took a longer - horizon view ” and “ were more alert to [ operational ] details . ”
They “ worked harder ” and “ were more modest ” -- that ’s what Ellis says , but I do n’t believe it .
The saying is that B - grade people hire C - grade people to work for them , and A - grade people hire A - grade people to work for them .
The Goldman Sachs mathematics , however , has been that A + - grade people hire A +++- grade people -- the best in the world -- to work for them .
That is many things , but it is not “ modesty . ”

Since the end of World War II , Goldman Sachs has grown from being a 250 - employee firm that sold mostly commercial paper at low margins to a firm of tens of thousands able to enter and make a credible play to dominate any market it wishes .
The firm ’s analytical abilities to make guesses about where asset prices should be ( and will be ) are at least as good as , and usually better than , those of anybody else .
Testifying before Congress early in the 20th century , then - dominant financier J.P. Morgan said that the most important asset in finance was character -- that one ’s analytical judgments and long - term desires for the business are so strong that what one says does in fact happen .
Goldman Sachs is seen by the consensus to have that character .
According to Ellis , the firm ’s nadir occurred during the Roaring ‘ 20s , when it was known as the Goldman Sachs Trading Co. , a firm that was the most overleveraged and catastrophic , bubble - based investment vehicle of that era .
And yet , by a long , slow process , various Goldman Sachs heads created an institutional culture in which it has dominated in so many ways .
The firm is trusted by outsiders , makes use of the information it gathers to make itself more profitable without making clients feel cheated , and places great value on intelligence and analysis as it takes large but calculated risks .
In the last generation , Goldman Sachs has grown to its current position as a financial juggernaut playing in every single sector of modern finance .
And that is what most of Ellis ’ book is about -- the creation of , in current head Blankfein ’s words , “ an interesting blend of . . . confidence and commitment to excellence . . . [ coupled with ] insecurity that drives people to keep working and producing long after they need to .
We cringe at the prospect of not being liked by a client .
. . .
Alumni take a lot of pride in having worked here . ”
With the current market crisis , however , readers may be more interested in how , in the early 2000s , 16 Goldman Sachs traders invested the firm ’s own capital in residential mortgage - backed collateralized - debt obligations while also being responsible for making a market for clients who were speculating in the same securities .
At the end of 2006 , Goldman Sachs Chief Financial Officer David Viniar ordered the traders to reduce their exposure to mortgage - security risk .
As Ellis tells the story , the traders complained that they did not know how to do that :
They did n’t know what would be a fair or good price at which to sell .
And Blankfein intervened , ordering them “ to sell 10 percent of every position : ‘ That ’s the market price .
Mark to that .’
Since the market was so large , it took months to completely hedge the firm ’s exposure .
By February 2007 , the firm would have a large short position focused on the riskiest part of the ABX [ index ] . . . [ which ] would rapidly drop from about 90 to nearly 60 . ”

By the summer of 2007 , Goldman Sachs was making additional large bets against the ABX index and was out of the business of making new collateralized debt obligations -- all this was happening while Citigroup head Charles Prince was saying that you had to keep dancing as long as the music was playing .
If you stopped and prices kept going up , Prince said , your profits would lag far behind those of your competitors and the stock market would punish you .
Prince echoed an apocalyptic judgment by John Maynard Keynes on a previous generation of bankers : that government intervention and economic management were required because high financiers were people who thought it better to fail conventionally -- in the company of their fellows -- than to succeed unconventionally by breaking from long - held strategies and positions .
The end result of what is happening on Wall Street is unclear .
Organizations that bet significantly that mortgage - backed securities and their derivative collateralized - debt obligations had a future may not have much of a future of their own .
Other firms that implicitly bet that these shaky organizations would not be forced to dump assets onto the market at fire - sale prices may not have much of a future either .
And Goldman Sachs has reincorporated itself as a bank holding company to get inside the Federal Reserve system ’s protection and is hunting for commercial bank assets to buy .
Like all financial institutions , Goldman Sachs is fundamentally a bank and is equally vulnerable to a bank run .
In today ’s world , the financial institutions with large commercial - bank businesses -- Bank of America , JPMorgan Chase -- appear to have an easier time maintaining confidence than those without .
In retrospect , Goldman Sachs ’ failure to acquire large - scale commercial bank assets once Glass - Steagall was repealed in the late 1990s was a mistake .
But that appears not to have been a fatal mistake .
Its competitors have made bigger mistakes , and Warren Buffett just invested $ 5 billion of Berkshire Hathaway ’s money in Goldman Sachs .
He would n’t do that unless he expected to make a lot of money .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Letters containing white powder that were sent to more than 50 financial institutions warned that " it 's payback time , " the FBI said Thursday .
Officials said most of the powder - laced letters were sent to branches of JPMorgan Chase .
" Steal tens of thousands of people 's money and not expect repercussions .
It 's payback time .
What you just breathed in will kill you within 10 days .
Thank [ word redacted ] and the FDIC for your demise , " said one letter released by the FBI on Thursday .
Most of the letters contained a powder that the FBI said is harmless .
But sending the letters is " a serious crime , " even if they are a hoax , FBI spokesman Richard Kolko said in a statement .
More than 50 letters were received this week at financial institutions in 11 states and the District of Columbia , the FBI said .
The letters were all sent from Amarillo , Texas , to branches of Chase Bank ; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. , which insures bank deposits ; and the U.S. Office of Thrift Supervision , a regulatory agency .
Not all the letters contained exactly the same wording , the FBI said .
The U.S. Postal Inspection Service is offering a reward of up to $ 100,000 " for any information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible . "
The FBI , U.S. postal inspectors and state and local authorities are investigating , resulting in " a drain on resources " for those agencies , Kolko said .
" Law enforcement will continue to work to identify and arrest those responsible , " Kolko said .
As of Thursday , financial institutions in New York , New Jersey , the District of Columbia , Ohio , Illinois , Colorado , Oklahoma , Georgia , Texas , Virginia , California and Arizona have received the letters , the FBI reported .
Kolko said that field tests on the powder included in the letters have found no sign of a hazardous material but that additional tests were being conducted .
Most of the letters have been sent to branches of JPMorgan Chase , one law enforcement official said on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing .

Since I am from Sweden while most of my readers are n't , and since the bail - out of Swedish banks by the Swedish government in many American media reports have been said to be essentially the same as the bail - out propsed by Hank Paulson , and since this bail - out in these same media allegedly was a big success , I have recently received questions about it .
The truth is that first of all that the Swedish solution was much better than the plan proposed by Paulson or for that matter the Democrats .
And secondly , while the plan was better than the ones proposed in Washington , it was n't as big of a success as it is often asserted .
The background to the Swedish banking crisis was a ill - timed " deregulation " in 1985 , where Swedish commercial banks were permitted to lend as much as they wanted in a time where the tax system and the high rate of inflation meant that after - tax real interest rates were significantly below zero .
That of course meant a massive credit and monetary expansion during the latter half of the 1980s .
As Sweden at the time also had a fixed exchange rate , this meant that the real exchange rate rose sharply and soon became highly overvalued .
As the overvaluation and the recession in important trading partners such as the U.S. and the U.K. caused net exports to decline , the Swedish economy began to weaken considerably in 1990 .
Meanwhile , Swedish politicians instituted a tax reform which closed several loopholes and broadened the tax base , while at the same time significantly reducing marginal tax rates .
That reform was a very sound one in a long term perspective , but as the reduced tax rates also meant that the ability to deduct interest expenses fell sharply , this caused real interest rates to sky rocket .
The weaker economy meanwhile caused inflation to fall while nominal interest rates had to be raised to defend the fixed exchange rates , contributing even more to a real interest rate shock .
The end result of this was a deep economic downturn , which caused hugh losses for the banks in Sweden .
Fearful that many banks would collapse and that this would cause a general run on the banking system , the Swedish government decided to declare that they would guarantee all depositors that they would get any money they deposited in a bank back .
However , they made it very clear that they would not bail out those who owned shares in Swedish banks .
Share holders in any bank which went bankrupt or turned to help from the government would see all of their equity wiped out and all operations overtaken by the government .
These harsh terms made the banks extremely reluctant to seek aid , so most banks did everything they could to avoid it .
In the end , apart from a smaller regional savings bank , only Gota bank was taken over .
Moreover Nordbanken ( now known as Nordea ) , which was largely state - owned to begin with was fully nationalized .
The other large banks , S - E - Banken ( now known as simply SEB ) and Handelsbanken , as well as the main savings bank called Sparbanken ( what is now known as Swedbank ) was not bailed out .
S - E - Banken was close to collapsing , but the main owner , the Wallenberg family , chose to recapitalize the bank themselves rather than turning it over to the government .
The Swedish solution thus limited the bail - out to depositors while destroying the equity of any bank whose depositors had to be bailed out .
By contrast , the Republican bail - out plan would fully bail out share holders as well , and the Democratic bail - out plan would partially bail them out .
Was this limited bail - out a success then ?
Well , it probably limited the severe downturn in the economy somewhat , but at the initial cost for taxpayers of 4 % of GDP ( which in today 's America would be equivalent to more than $ 550 billion ) .
Admittedly , some of those costs were n't really costs in a proper accounting sense , since the government was able to recoup some of the spending it made by later profits these state owned banks made .
However , it is certainly not the case that nearly all of the spending has been recouped , as some of the calculations that have been made that seemingly conclude this overlook that much of Nordbanken was already state owned and also assume a too low opportunity cost for the money .
On the minus side must also be added that the limited bail - out created a moral hazard that has contributed to current problems in the Swedish economy .
The economic recovery that followed could hardly be attributed to the bank bail - out as it first of all was exaggerated by the terms of trade factor , and secondly can be attributed to long term effects the free market economic reforms implemented in the late 1980s and early 1990s ( including the aforementioned marginal tax rate cuts ) as well as the end of the overvalued exchange rate and the extremely high real interest rates used in a vain attempt to defend that overvalued exchange rate .
A new study found that trained sexologists could infer a woman 's history of vaginal orgasm by observing the way she walks .
The study is published in the September 2008 issue of The Journal of Sexual Medicine .
Led by Stuart Brody of the University of the West of Scotland in collaboration with colleagues in Belgium , the study involved 16 female Belgian university students .
Subjects completed a questionnaire on their sexual behavior and were then videotaped from a distance while walking in a public place .
The videotapes were rated by two professors of sexology and two research assistants trained in the functional - sexological approach to sexology , who were not aware of the women 's orgasmic history .
The results showed that the appropriately trained sexologists were able to correctly infer vaginal orgasm through watching the way the women walked over 80 percent of the time .
Further analysis revealed that the sum of stride length and vertebral rotation was greater for the vaginally orgasmic women .
" This could reflect the free , unblocked energetic flow from the legs through the pelvis to the spine , " the authors note .
There are several plausible explanations for the results shown by this study .
One possibility is that a woman 's anatomical features may predispose her to greater or lesser tendency to experience vaginal orgasm .
According to Brody , " Blocked pelvic muscles , which might be associated with psychosexual impairments , could both impair vaginal orgasmic response and gait . "
In addition , vaginally orgasmic women may feel more confident about their sexuality , which might be reflected in their gait .
" Such confidence might also be related to the relationship (s ) that a woman has had , given the finding that specifically penile - vaginal orgasm is associated with indices of better relationship quality , " the authors state .
Research has linked vaginal orgasm to better mental health .
The study provides some support for assumptions of a link between muscle blocks and sexual function , according to the authors .
They conclude that it may lend credibility to the idea of incorporating training in movement , breathing and muscle patterns into the treatment of sexual dysfunction .
" Women with orgasmic dysfunction should be treated in a multi- disciplinary manner " says Irwin Goldstein , Editor - in - Chief of The Journal of Sexual Medicine .
" Although small , this study highlights the potential for multiple therapies such as expressive arts therapy incorporating movement and physical therapy focusing on the pelvic floor . "

Over the last two months , the price of oil has declined nearly 28 % , falling from a record high of $ 147.22 to Friday ’s closing price of $ 106.23 .
Â
Likewise , the price of gasoline has declined more than 11 % , falling from a record high of $ 4.12 to today ’s average price of $ 3.65 .
These price declines have come as a relief for many Americans , as they have helped ease the pain at the pump and pushed down inflation in general .
However , as welcome as these price declines have been , some drivers believe they ’re coming about due to reasons beyond supply and demand or economic weakness .
According to a recent poll on Daily Fuel Economy
Tip , nearly half of us feel that the prices of oil and gasoline are being manipulated leading up to the November Presidental election .
The poll asked :
Do you believe gas and oil prices are being manipulated for the upcoming Presidental election ?
Here ’s how the responses broke down :
49 % believe prices ARE being manipulated
being manipulated 44 % believe prices ARE NOT being manipulated
being manipulated 7 % are UNSURE if prices are being manipulated
This is up slightly from the 2006 elections , when 42 % of Americans said they believed oil and gas prices were being manipulated leading up to the elections .
Â
I guess with the price of oil being double and the price of gas up 75 % since the 2006 election , it would make sense that slightly more Americans believe there is some sort of manipulation going on .
Lower oil and gasoline prices would probably help the Republicans – i.e. John McCain – since much of the Democratic platform – i.e. Barack Obama – is built on improving the economy and pushing alternative energy .
Â
Lower prices would help to keep the economy from getting much worse , and would push back the need for altnerative energy , at least from an economic standpoint .
With this in mind , the notion of price manipulation comes in because , over the years , the Republican party has been accused of being very pro Big Oil and , in turn , Big Oil has been very pro Republican party .
Based on contributions made to each party , it ’s obvious Big Oil prefers that Republicans be in elected positions .
Â
According to figures compiled by OpenSecrets.org – the website of the Center of Responsive Politics , a group that tracks campaign donations and funding – since 1990 , for every dollar contributed by Big Oil , roughly 75 cents has gone to the Republican party .
Donations to Republicans – $ 166,126,945
Donations to Democrats – $ 54,376,295
Despite these figures , I find it very hard to believe that Big Oil is manipulating the oil and gasoline markets .
Â
It ’s one thing to contribute ( a lot ) more money to one party , but would it really be worth manipulating an entire market for the sake of said party ?
Think about it .
Â
Regardless of who ’s in office , we ’re not going to stop using oil or gasoline any time soon , and prices and profits are still going to remain high .
Â
That ’s all Big Oil really wants .
Plus , in today ’s day and age of investigative reporting and 24 hour news networks , if a conspiracy like this did exist , someone would find out about it .
So , at the end of the day , it seems far more likely that the recent price declines have more to do with the natural ebb and flow of the usual price cycles and far less to do with some sort of price manipulation conspiracy .
At a time when the environment seems to be going to hell in a handbasket , alongside the economy and employment rates , a new investment by the US government could lend a helping hand .
Being assessed by the Center for American Progress , the $ 100 billion investment could see the creation of some 2 million “ green ” jobs .
This stimulus package , for lack of a better term , would greatly affect industries such as steel and construction .
“ From the point of view of the steelworkers union , the view is quite simple , that an energy - efficient green economy creates jobs , and it can create jobs in America , ” says Leo Gerard , international president of United Steelworkers .
One need only look at the recent reopening of two struggling steel mills that are now making steel plate for use in wind turbines .
Further jobs are opening up in the need to retrofit old and energy - inefficient buildings .
Add this to jobs opening up for people to operate and maintain wind turbines , and an environmental push is also an employment boon .
Environmental and labor groups are citing a report commissioned by a think tank called the Center for American Progress , led by former Clinton administration official John Podesta .
Podesta laid out the plans for the $ 100 billion .
$ 50 billion would go towards tax credits to help private businesses and homeowners pay to make their buildings more energy efficient .
$ 46 billion would go towards retrofitting buildings , expanding mass transit and freight rail , making “ smart ” electrical grids and investing in renewable energies .
The remaining $ 4 billion would exist as federal loan guarantees .
In that distribution , thousands of jobs are evident , especially in retrofitting buildings and the expansion of transit and the electrical grids .
On top of that , the allocations make for huge energy savings .
Shoring up ones house to be energy efficient , from the type of glass used and heating and cooling systems in use , is going to save you money , and decrease power consumption .
Making a smarter electrical grid will help bring us closer to the day when we can rely on wind and solar power generation .
And anything to help the mass transit systems is a good idea by me .
But the real story is in the jobs that this investment could make .
But right now I have a whole “ do n’t put the horse before the cart ” thought process running through my head so , like hoping the LHC does n’t doom us all , * fingers crossed *

What makes the news from China is usually the bad news : the arrests , the raided churches , the blocked Internet sites , the overzealous security goons .
That ’s the way journalism works  we cover planes that crash , not those that land .
Yet the underlying trend in recent years is the opposite .
For all the continuing repression , Chinese live far freer lives now than when I lived in Beijing in the 1980s and ’90s .
Ordinary citizens can now easily travel abroad , choose their own housing and jobs , and move to whatever Chinese city they want to .
Then there is the Internet .
It ’s true that the government censors critical Web sites and closes down troublesome blogs .
Yet there are n’t nearly enough censors to manage the job , and many Chinese are quite adept at technological ladders over the Great Firewall of China .
Objectionable posts are deleted by censors , but then are quickly reposted on 50 different platforms .
This is a cat - and - mouse game in which the spotlight is usually on the mice when they get caught : China has more Internet commentators in prison than any other country .
But the larger truth is that the mice are winning this game , not the cats .
How is Capitalism Killing the Kids ?
An illustration of how this capitalist culture has affected our kids …
***
On the surface all seems natural enough , until , in this preschool nursery , a little 4 year old boy , zooming from toy to toy , sees a little girl picking up a toy truck .
He yanks it from her hand and bashes her over the head .
Heedless of the girl ’s shrieks and his teacher ’s warnings , the boy rushes to another corner of the room , to another toy , and when someone manages to pick him up to discipline him , his body stiffens .
He kicks and screams ***
A child who is consistently callous and emotionally distant , seemingly immune to the rules and feelings of others , is what psychologists call “ unattached . ”
Who ’s to blame for kids without a conscience ?
Violent kids in preschool classrooms , with no remorse .
No loving bonds in the first two years of life because parents must work at two or more jobs to keep the apartment , or the home mortgage , contribute to dysfunctional families that result in more children without a “ conscience “ as time goes by .
In addition , criminologists and child development specialists believe that the combined effects of poverty and the resultant crime produce children who are emotionally distant , manipulative and selfish to the extreme .
“ Such children are likely to commit violent crimes , “ says Michael Rustigan , a teacher and writer currently at the University of San Francisco State , himself a criminologist of note , Rustigan attributes some of the problem to where the kids are forced to live .
Inner cities offer no hope for the young , thus the drug scene , and the crimes that support that temporary drug escape .
“ In terms of crimes committed , our society is five times more violent than Europe , and ten times more violent than Japan , ” said Rustigan , and that observation was back in 1990 !
We can only speculate on how much more exacerbated is this societal cauldron of violence today .
But the sources of child disattachment are not limited to ghetto children .
Children can be detached from parents on any and all economic levels .
Mom and Pop breadwinners , who work 12 hours a day to keep up the “ success ” image and who “ warehouse ” their children to day care centers , can create a precarious situation for a young child .
Day care centers hire workers who come and go , and leave child attachments in limbo , and the child becomes dispossessed of relationships that had potential bonding benefits .
The “ economics ” of low wages also causes day care centers to have a high turnover of “ concerned ” workers .
All of the problems discussed here have their origins in the economic lives of the VICTIMS , who ultimately , become ALL OF US , for we must be in daily contact with those who are scarred by their backgrounds , and who walk among us , and are prone to act out whatever tendencies have been developed and enforced by their upbringing .
The economic system produces the poverty that creates the inner city ghettos , as well as the fierce , so - called middle class drive to get the big bucks that make for “ security ” in a very hostile and insecure system .
The children that result from such a system can only reflect the insecurities and values of their parents , who , themselves are victims of the system .
“ What drives America today is money , power , paranoia . ”
These words were spoken not by a critic of the system of capitalism , rather by Dr. T. Berry Braselton , one whose concerns are for the growth and development of kids .
Dr.T.Berry Brazelton is rightfully disturbed about the way kids in our society are forced to grow , He ’s no new kid on the block .
He was a clinical professor emeritus of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School , and founder of and chief of Child Development Unit at the Children ’s Hospital in Boston .
( More on Dr. T. can be accessed at … http://www.brazelton-institute.com/berrybio.html )
T. Berry is no radical . .
He recognizes the problem and the circumstances , but curiously overlooks the cause , or else Dr. T. would not be begging for the U.S. government to come to the support of kids who lack positive family life experiences .
Were T. Berry an objective social scientist , he would be calling for changes in the present economic institutions which provoke all the conditions which affect our kids in so many negative ways .

Not sure whether this helps the atheist cause , but it might ignite some fun debate .
From the BBC :
The atheist posters are the idea of the British Humanist Association
( BHA ) and have been supported by prominent atheist Professor Richard
Dawkins .
The BHA planned only to raise £ 5,500 , which was to be matched
by Professor Dawkins , but it has now raised more than £ 36,000 of its
own accord .
It aims to have two sets of 30 buses carrying the signs for four weeks .
The complete slogan reads : " There 's probably no God .
Now stop worrying and enjoy your life . "
Just some small thoughts about cyclic lists in Haskell .
Every Haskell beginner knows that you can use infinite lists , as long as you do n’t fully evalute them .
So , this is perfectly valid
endless = [ 0 .. ] --
All natural numbers !
main = print ( endless !!
10 )
It will not crash , but print " 10 " as the list has not been fully used .
What happens if we take a piece of the list further down , let ’s say at position 1000000000 :
endles = [ 0 ..] main = print ( endless !! ( 10^9 ) )
If you try this at home , better run " ulimit - S - v 1000000 " before , because then you ’ll get " test : out of memory ( requested 1048576 bytes ) " instead of a sluggishly swapping machine .
What happened ?
The long list will be evaluated , and fills the memory .
Does this mean that we can not use arbitrary long lists ?
Let ’s try a special case : A list that is infinitely long , but repeating the same values all over again :
list =
" Oh , happy day !
Oh , happy day . "
cycle ' list = list ++ cycle ' list
main = do let rlist = cycle ' list
print ( rlist !!
( 10^9 ) , rlist !!
0 )
We repeat the ( finite ) list endlessly , and then try to pick the 1000000000th element .
We also pick the first element again , to make sure the compiler does not cheat by forgetting the first 999999999 elements ( It ’s actually pretty nice that the compiler will forget these elements , but not what I want to demonstrate here ) .
Running that code , sure enough , fills up the memory .
But maybe I was coding badly .
At least I have re-implemented a function that already exists , which is bad practice .
Let ’s try with Haskell ’s own cycle :
list =
" Oh , happy day !
Oh , happy day . "
main = do let rlist = cycle list
print ( rlist !!
( 10^9 ) , rlist !!
0 )
Now it takes a while , but surprisingly , the memory gauge does not skyrocket , and in the end I ’m told that the 1000000000th character in my infinite character string is ' d ' .
This leads me to the conclusion that the Haskell library uses black magic .
Or does it ?
Here is the definition of cycle :
cycle xs = xs ' where xs ' = xs ++ xs '
What is the difference to our cycle ' ?
Here , the result is given a name ( xs ' ) , which is used again inside the function .
So while our cycle ' appends the list over and over again , filling up the RAM , their cycle ties a loop and makes the end of the list refer to it ’s beginning .
And my list lookup will no longer evaluate the list up to infinity , but just run around in , well , cycles until it has counted down from 1000000000 .
I could even ask for the last element of this list , and it will not use any more RAM than a small , finite list , while endlessly searching for the end of the list .
Despite Haskell being a very high level language , I sometimes wonder how my data will look like on the physical memory .
And as you can see , it can make a difference .
Some more thoughts on this were written down by Duncan Coutts .
Consumption is the key .
With small fluctuations , U.S. oil usage has climbed steadily for the past 50 years .
From 5.6 Mb/d in 1949 ( 6 % supplied by imports ) to 13.8 Mb/d in 1970 ( 23 % from imports ) and 20 Mb/d in 2004 ( 60 % from imports ) , America 's unrelenting thirst for petroleum has driven the consumer end of the market for a hundred years .
And by late 2005 , consumption had climbed to 20.5 Mb/d , fueled by net imports of 13.2 Mb/d - more than 64 % of the total .
How much is 20 million barrels a day ?
A 42 - gallon oil barrel is maybe four feet high .
If you laid 20 million of them end to end , they would stretch more than 15,000 miles - every day !
In terms of gallons of all oil products , if a 1 - gallon can is a foot wide , lined up those cans would extend about 163,000 miles - enough to circle the earth at the equator 6 ½ times - every day .
Not all the oil used goes to make gasoline , of course - there 's fuel oil , jet fuel , the chemicals to make all the plastic in the world , as well as lubricants , greases , lipstick and petroleum jelly .
But U.S. consumption of gasoline is astonishing - we burn it up at a rate averaging more than 320 million gallons per day , or about 3700 gallons per second , 24 hours a day , 7 days a week .
That 's enough one - foot - square gallon cans to cover a football field every nine seconds .
So which countries supply our imported oil ?
Few people can name the top four countries , which together supply about 60 % of our crude oil imports .
In August 2005 , Canada and Mexico were in a virtual tie for first , each providing about 16 % of total imported petroleum .
Saudi Arabia , which most people would include on the top four list , was No. 3 with about 14 % .
Venezuela ( 13 % ) rounds out the top four sources of American oil .
Up - and - coming Nigeria is Number 5 , with 11 % of our imports .
The rest of the top 10 , in order , are Angola with 6 % and Iraq , Algeria , United Kingdom , and Ecuador , at about 3 % of our imports each .
The amount of oil we import from each country fluctuates somewhat from month to month and year to year .
For most of the past 5 years , Canada was the clear leader , at about 17 - 18 % , and Saudi Arabia was number 2 , with 14 - 15 % .
During the 1960s , Venezuela was far and away our greatest supplier .
What can be done about our import dependency ?
Drill more wells ?
In 1972 we had 508,000 pumping wells .
Many of those wells have dried up or become uneconomical to operate , but despite that , in 2004 about 510,000 wells were pumping oil .
We 're drilling about as many new wells as we can , both technologically and economically .
The problem is the average volume per well - down from almost 19 barrels per well per day in 1972 to about 10.5 barrels per well per day in 2004 .
The same number of wells pumps only about half the oil of 30 years ago .
You can't make a 10 - barrel - a - day well pump 1,000 barrels , no matter what you do .
There are some enhancement techniques that squeeze the last drops out of an oil field , but those are short - term fixes that do not provide great volumes of crude .
In contrast to America 's 10 - barrel - per - day average for each well , the few wells in Saudi Arabia average about 6,500 barrels per day per well .
What about ANWR - the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge ?
The controversy rages .
As of today , there is no known oil in ANWR - it can't be known until the rocks are drilled .
The U.S. Geological Survey , using sophisticated estimation techniques that factor in the geology and other " knowns , " gives a best guess for the amount of oil that MAY be in ANWR at 10.4 billion barrels of technically recoverable oil .
That sounds like a lot , but it 's less than Prudhoe Bay contained .
At about 13 billion barrels , Prudhoe was the largest oil field in North America , but most of its oil has been produced .
In contrast , the world 's largest oil field , Ghawar in Saudi Arabia , contained about 85 billion barrels , with much remaining .
That guesstimate of 10.4 billion barrels in ANWR works out to 520 days ' supply at our current rate of consumption .
But in reality , even if it 's there , it wo n't be produced in a whoosh .
Any oil will take years to come on - stream , and will be produced over a period of perhaps 20 years .
A reasonable production rate over that time would be one million barrels per day - just 5 % of today 's 20 Mb/d consumption .
Given that our rate of consumption is increasing by 4 % to 5 % each year , all the possible oil in ANWR would do nothing but help keep pace with demand growth .
Helpful , but no panacea .
The deep - water Gulf of Mexico offers some possibilities for major oil finds .
Such exploration and production is expensive , and once established runs the risk of shut - downs because of hurricane damage , as we know well after the season of 2005 .
Offshore California has potential , but stringent environmental regulations have reduced exploration there to virtually zero .
Can Montana help ?
Montana IS helping .
Because many of their fields are small , old and largely tapped out , traditional oil - patch states are losing oil production at increasing rates .
Texas ' production fell by almost 7 % between 2004 and 2005 while Louisiana lost not quite 2 % ; California declined by 2 % , and New Mexico lost almost 5 % of its production rate .
At the same time , Montana , ranking # 10 on the list of oil producing states , increased its production by more than 14 % , to 88,000 barrels per day in June 2005 .
That volume is paltry compared to leaders like Louisiana , averaging 1,463,000 barrels per day in 2005 , but the Montana rate of increase is dramatic .
Compared to 2002 , Montana 's oil production has grown by a whopping 87 % .
The growth in Montana production is also enjoyed by North Dakota , which shares the oil - rich Williston Basin with eastern Montana .
A package of rock called the Bakken Formation , laid down around 360 million years ago , is the key to the new production .
Averaging just 8 to 12 feet thick , the pay zone is exploited by a relatively new technique called horizontal drilling , which punches the drill along the length of a rock layer rather than straight through it .
This exposes much more of the oil - bearing rock to the drill hole , allowing more oil to be extracted .
Best estimates by many economists see no end in sight for this increase , and some optimistic folks suggest that Montana could be producing as much as 200,000 barrels per day within 5 years , jumping it to the Number 5 ranking among the states , after Louisiana , Texas , Alaska , and California .
It could happen , but without major changes in consumption habits , oil price shocks are likely to be the rule rather than the exception .

Let me say right up front that Marc Emery sometimes pays me money to write articles for his magazine , Cannabis Culture , so I am not a completely disinterested observer .
That said , " Prince of Pot " director Nick Wilson has done a superb job of explaining who Emery is , where he came from , and what he is all about -- and in tying Emery 's trajectory to the larger issues of marijuana prohibition , the drug war in general , and Canadian acquiescence to US - style prohibitionist drug policies .
Marc Emery ( courtesy Cannabis Culture magazine )
I assume that anyone reading these words already knows who Marc Emery is : Canada 's most vocal advocate of marijuana legalization , founder of the BC Marijuana Party , publisher of Cannabis Culture magazine , operator of POT - TV , and former proprietor of the Marc Emery Seed Company .
Emery made lots of money with his seed company , and plowed much of it back into the marijuana legalization movement , not only in Canada , but also bankrolling activists in the US Marijuana Party south of the border and putting some loonies ( Canadian nickname for their one - dollar coin ) into various Global Marijuana Marches .
For Emery , the seed company was merely a means to an end , a method of raising money to subvert marijuana prohibition , or , as he nicely put it , to overgrow the government .
But all that came to a crashing halt three years ago , when Emery and two of his employees , Michelle Rainey and Greg Williams , were indicted by a federal grand jury in Seattle on marijuana trafficking charges for his seed sales .
Now , the Vancouver 3 , as they have come to be known , face up to life in prison in the US if and when they are extradited .
The documentary , which is available from Journeyman Productions , opens with some vintage Emery , addressing the crowd at a pro-legalization , anti-extradition rally in Vancouver , the headquarters of his operation .
" The DEA says I am responsible for 1.1 million pounds of pot , " he said to cheers from the crowd .
" I would be happy to believe that .
That 's the problem -- the DEA and I agree on the facts . "
" Prince of Pot " follows Emery 's career from his beginnings as an Ontario bookstore owner who loathed stoners , but came to embrace their cause as he fought the Canadian government 's censorship of " drug- related " magazines like High Times .
Early on , Emery displayed the same qualities that propelled his meteoric rise to the heights of the pot legalization movement : a libertarian sensibility , " an ego that takes up 40 % of his body weight , " as one observer put it , an aggressive , abrasive personality , a penchant for the publicity stunt , and a mouth that never stops working .
The documentary also shows that Emery 's exhibitionism is n't limited to the sphere of the political .
Early on , viewers are treated to a shot of Emery 's backside as he gets out of bed , and another scene shows him naked on a Vancouver nude beach being anointed with cannabis oil by his young wife Jodie in an experiment to see whether it could have an impact on " any cancerous or pre-cancerous cells . "
( No word on how that turned out . )
But if Marc Emery 's ass is on the screen , it 's also on the line , and this is where " Prince of Pot " really shines .
The documentary makers interviewed the unrepentant US attorney in Seattle who indicted him and a Seattle DEA agent who justified the bust , and confronted DEA head Karen Tandy at a 2006 international DEA conference in Montreal .
" Prince of Pot " hones in with precision accuracy on Tandy 's post - bust press release where she bragged about how Emery 's arrest was " a blow to the legalization movement . "
That press release may be Emery 's best long - shot chance at avoiding extradition because it provides evidence that his prosecution was politically motivated .
All of the feds , of course , deny that was the case , but , in tracing Emery 's career , his succession of trivial arrests by Canadian authorities , and growing US frustration with Canada 's seeming indifference to his activities , the documentarians make a strong case that Marc Emery was busted not because he sold seeds , but because he was a burr under the saddle of Washington .
The documentary also features a strong cast of Canadian supporters , including former Vancouver Mayor Larry Campbell ( " The drug czar is an idiot " ) , Vancouver East MP Libby Davies , Toronto attorney Alan Young , Ottawa attorney and criminal justice professor Eugene Oscapella ( " Why should we emulate the failed drug policies of the United States ? " ) .
Vancouver activist David Malmo - Levine , shown smoking a foot - long joint at one point , makes a compelling observation , too : " They want to send him to prison for life , " he exclaims , recounting the DEA 's argument about the harm Emery has caused by promoting marijuana production .
" What harm ?
Show me the bodies , " he demands .
" There has to be at least one body if they want to send him away for life .
There has to be at least one person who suffered more than bronchitis . "
Washington state marijuana defense attorney Douglas Hiatt 's brief appearance is also powerful and worth noting .
Visibly angry at the injustice of the marijuana laws , Hiatt lashes out at prosecutors and the DEA .
" If the DEA wants to talk about destroying families , " he growls , " they can talk to me about the families they 've destroyed for trying to use medical marijuana .
The only thing I see ruining people 's lives is the government 's policies , " Hiatt spits out .
His righteous wrath is refreshing .
At one point in the documentary , film - maker Wilson says that for him , " It 's not about seeds , it 's about sovereignty . "
From the Canadian perspective , he 's right , of course , but it 's really about marijuana prohibition , and Wilson does a wonderful job of sketching its history and ugly current reality .
At the end , the documentary speculates about a possible deal for Emery to serve a shorter prison term in the US .
That did n't happen .
Neither did a proposed deal that would have seen charges dropped against Rainey and Williams and Emery serving a few years in a Canadian prison .
Now , it 's back to fighting extradition , and given that the decision to extradite is ultimately a political one made by the Justice Minister and given that the Canadian federal government is in bed with the US on drug policy , extradition remains the most likely outcome .
In a touching scene , Emery and his wife argue over whether he will serve his cause by martyring himself , something he seems determined to do .
I have personally counseled him otherwise .
I suggested that he become the marijuana movement 's Osama bin Laden .
No , not that he blow up DEA headquarters , but that he escape to a hidden cave complex somewhere in the Canadian Rockies and bedevil his enemies with communiques from his hidden sanctuary .
I , for one , would rather see Marc Emery figuratively flipping the bird to the US government than disappearing , like so many others have , into the American gulag .
Check out this documentary .
It 's a good one .
It 'll give you goose bumps at some points , make you want to cry at some , and make you want to cheer at others .
As we 've ramped up the riding here , we 've also ramped up our bike maintenance needs .
Many riders end up taking their bikes to a local shop , and that 's a great solution if you 've got a shop you trust .
But I 'm just a little too anxious about handing off tasks to others that have such a large impact on my performance or safety–plus , it 's fun to tinker with your own bike .
The only trick is that compared to bikes in the past , today 's rely on many more specialized tools for proper assembly and repair .
From the various standards for bottom bracket bearings to different size spoke nipples for wheel truing , you quickly find that having all of the tools you need is not only expensive , but also a simple challenge of collecting the right ones .
Pedro's has a solution – the Master Tool Kit .
Basically everything you need to work on a bike , it features 64 tools in a cool , custom - made case that let 's you toss them all in your car when you need to work on the road .
Most of the tools are a joy to work with , including a great set of ratcheting combination wrenches , although we wish the finish on the tools was a little more durable , as we had some tools loose their sleek black appearance in just a couple of uses .
But if you 're starting from scratch as a bike mechanic , and do n't have a lot invested in tools , there 's no better way to go from zero to hero .
It will cost you – the retail on the kit is 800 bucks – but when you can instantly put your hand on a star nut setter when you really need one , you wo n't mind .

Other translations of this chapter : Chapter 11 1
And the apostles and brethren that were in Judaea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God. 2
And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem , they that were of the circumcision contended with him , 3 Saying , Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised , and didst eat with them .
4 But Peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning , and expounded it by order unto them , saying , 5 I was in the city of Joppa praying : and in a trance I saw a vision , A certain vessel descend , as it had been a great sheet , let down from heaven by four corners ; and it came even to me : 6 Upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes , I considered , and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth , and wild beasts , and creeping things , and fowls of the air .
7
And I heard a voice saying unto me , Arise , Peter ; slay and eat .
8
But I said , Not so , Lord : for nothing common or unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth .
9
But the voice answered me again from heaven , What God hath cleansed , that call not thou common .
10 And this was done three times : and all were drawn up again into heaven .
11 And , behold , immediately there were three men already come unto the house where I was , sent from Caesarea unto me .
12 And the Spirit bade me go with them , nothing doubting .
Moreover these six brethren accompanied me , and we entered into the man 's house : 13 And he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house , which stood and said unto him , Send men to Joppa , and call for Simon , whose surname is Peter ; 14 Who shall tell thee words , whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved .
15 And as I began to speak , the Holy Ghost fell on them , as on us at the beginning .
16 Then remembered I the word of the Lord , how that he said , John indeed baptized with water ; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost .
17 Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as he did unto us , who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ ; what was I , that I could withstand God ?
18 When they heard these things , they held their peace , and glorified God , saying , Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life .
19 Now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice , and Cyprus , and Antioch , preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only .
20
And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene , which , when they were come to Antioch , spake unto the Grecians , preaching the Lord Jesus .
21
And the hand of the Lord was with them : and a great number believed , and turned unto the Lord . 22
Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem : and they sent forth Barnabas , that he should go as far as Antioch .
23 Who , when he came , and had seen the grace of God , was glad , and exhorted them all , that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord.
24 For he was a good man , and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith : and much people was added unto the Lord.
25 Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus , for to seek Saul : 26 And when he had found him , he brought him unto Antioch .
And it came to pass , that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church , and taught much people .
And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch .
27 And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch .
Note Have archaeologists confirmed the existence of Claudius ?
Answer 28
And there stood up one of them named Agabus , and signified by the Spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world : which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar .
29
Then the disciples , every man according to his ability , determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Judaea : 30 Which also they did , and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul .

Today 's stunning news that controversial attorney and anti-gaming zealot Jack Thompson will be disbarred for life from practicing law by the Supreme Court of Florida seems to have done little to faze the attorney himself .
In response to our request for comment Thompson sent Kotaku a copy of an emergency motion he filed with the federal court .
In the motion Thompson outlines what he hints at as a perversion of justice , one that wo n't allow him , for instance , to meet with a potential client who he says is an inmate in a state prison .
Thompson also sent over a press release saying that the disbarment is in retaliation for , among other things , Thompson 's Tyndale House book Out of Harm 's Way which he says blew the whistle on what he describes as the Florida Supreme Court 's attack on his activism against the American entertainment industry .
The timing of this disbarment transparently reveals its motivation :
This past Friday Thompson filed a federal civil rights action against The Bar , the Supreme Court , and all seven of its Justices .
This rush to disbarment is in retribution for the filing of that federal suit .
With enemies this foolish , Thompson needs only the loyal friends he has .

The emails from Thompson wrap up with : " ... this should be fun , starting now " Full press release and motion are on the jump for your perusal .
Immediate News Release – Sept. 25 , 2008 Miami Attorney Jack Thompson Disbarred by Florida Supreme Court Miami attorney Jack Thompson , nationally and internationally known by virtue of his effective and successful opposition over the last 20 years to the broadcast , marketing , and sale of adult - rated entertainment to children , has just been informed by the Florida Supreme Court that he has been disbarred from the practice of law today .
This disbarment is in retaliation , among other things , for Thompson 's Tyndale House book Out of Harm 's Way , published in 2005 , which blew the whistle on the Florida Supreme Court 's earlier efforts in the 1990's to literally pathologize his faith - based and successful activism against the American entertainment industry .
The Florida Bar 's insurance carrier was forced to pay Thompson money damages for that earlier assault upon his First Amendment rights , which is the only known payment of damages by any state bar to any lawyer for improper disciplinary efforts .
It appears that the State of Florida will be paying Thompson more damages this time around for its illegal , now repeated , use of " discipline " to punish a Christian lawyer for his activism in the public square .
The timing of this disbarment transparently reveals its motivation :
This past Friday Thompson filed a federal civil rights action against The Bar , the Supreme Court , and all seven of its Justices .
This rush to disbarment is in retribution for the filing of that federal suit .
With enemies this foolish , Thompson needs only the loyal friends he has .
Thompson looks forward to successfully litigating his federal claims , now before US District Court Judge Marcia Cooke in the Southern District of Florida .
Thompson always wanted to own a Bar .
Now , armed with multiple US Supreme Court rulings that no state bar can do what it has done to Thompson , he is set to own that Bar .
IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT IN AND FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA CASE NO .

Defendants .
PLAINTIFF'S EMERGENCY MOTION TO STAY FLORIDA SUPREME COURT'S PERMANENT DISBARMENT ORDER OF SEPTEMBER 25 , 2008 COMES NOW PLAINTIFF , on his own behalf , and moves this federal court , pursuant to the applicable Federal Rules of Civil Procedure , for the following emergency relief on the following grounds , stating : 1 . All seventy - seven defendants have been served with the complaint herein ; thus , they are all fully on notice as to the nature of this suit , the relief sought , and the basis therefor .
2 . Today , at approximately 11 am , on September 25 , 2008 , the Florida Supreme Court , has entered an order , a copy of which is attached hereto , permanently disbarring plaintiff Thompson , the respondent therein , effective in thirty days .
Thus , the clock is now running on those thirty days .
This is an emergency .
3 . Under this order , Thompson is unable , for example , to meet , as he is scheduled to do next Friday , with Richard Gorman , who is an inmate in a state prison for the purpose of being retained by him as his lawyer .
Mr. Gorman is sitting in his prison cell solely because of the unethical conduct of Assistant State Attorney Matthew Alex Smith and the obstruction of justice by the Board of Governors of The Florida Bar .
The attached Report of No Probable Cause is a smoking gun document that proves that the entire Board of Governors of The Florida Bar is involved in a cover - up in order to keep this innocent man in jail , all for the purpose of protecting the corrupt Leon County State Attorney 's Office .
It is the single most remarkable document Thompson has ever seen in his 31 - year legal career .
It indicts the entire Bar 's disciplinary process which in that instance is being perverted to keep an innocent man in jail .
It is little wonder that these same Governors would then do to Thompson what they have demonstrably done over the past four years .
4 . Thompson was to meet with Mr. Gorman for the purpose of securing his release from jail , and now Thompson cannot be retained by Mr. Gorman for that or for any other purpose .
Thus , one of the consequences of this disbarment order is not only Thompson 's inconvenience , to say the least , but more importantly the thwarting of the retention of Thompson by an innocent man in jail who is the victim of the obstruction of justice of The Florida Bar and its Governors .
5 . Plaintiff herein thus seeks an immediate stay , on an emergency basis , of the Florida Supreme Court 's disbarment order because he can show a substantial likelihood of success on the merits , irreparable harm unless the injunction issues , including public damage to his career and to the rights of others , such as those of Mr. Gorman , that this harm far outweighs any conceivable harm to defendants if the injunction issues , and that the injunction will not disserve but actually serve the public interest .
6 . Further , there are demonstrable factual errors in the disbarment order itself , which provide the basis for the disbarment , which can be easily and quickly proven .
Additionally , it is fascinating that Justice Cannady , who has undoubtedly reviewed absolutely nothing about this disciplinary case , has put his name to this disbarment order on the day that he was served with the federal civil rights action .
What a coincidence .
WHEREFORE , plaintiff respectfully seeks an order , on an emergency basis , staying the Florida Supreme Court 's disbarment order until such time as an evidentiary hearing , either before Judge Cooke or Magistrate Bandstra , can be secured as to the granting of apreliminary injunction sought in the complaint .
I HEREBY CERTIFY that this pleading has been provided to all defendants and / or their counsel by various means , including fax and e-mail , this September 25 , 2008 .

FASCISM Came To America - Do You Agree ?
Video : ten steps to fascism
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXFMCa...
Ten Steps to fascism
1. Invoke a terrifying internal and external enemy
After we were hit on September 11 2001 , we were in a state of national shock .
Less than six weeks later , on October 26 2001 , the USA Patriot Act was passed by a Congress that had little chance to debate it ; many said that they scarcely had time to read it .
We were told we were now on a " war footing " ; we were in a " global war " against a " global caliphate " intending to " wipe out civilisation " .
2. Create a gulag
Once you have got everyone scared , the next step is to create a prison system outside the rule of law ( as Bush put it , he wanted the American detention centre at Guantánamo Bay to be situated in legal " outer space " ) - where torture takes place .
3. Develop a thug caste
The years following 9/11 have proved a bonanza for America 's security contractors , with the Bush administration outsourcing areas of work that traditionally fell to the US military .
In the process , contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars have been issued for security work by mercenaries at home and abroad
4 . Set up an internal surveillance system
In closed societies , this surveillance is cast as being about " national security " ; the true function is to keep citizens docile and inhibit their activism and dissent .
5. Harass citizens ' groups
The fifth thing you do is related to step four - you infiltrate and harass citizens ' groups .
It can be trivial : a church in Pasadena , whose minister preached that Jesus was in favour of peace , found itself being investigated by the Internal Revenue Service , while churches that got Republicans out to vote , which is equally illegal under US tax law , have been left alone .
6 . Engage in arbitrary detention and release
Professor Walter F Murphy is emeritus of Princeton University ; he is one of the foremost constitutional scholars in the nation and author of the classic Constitutional Democracy .
Murphy is also a decorated former marine , and he is not even especially politically liberal .
But on March 1 this year , he was denied a boarding pass at Newark , " because I was on the Terrorist Watch list " .
7 . Target key individuals
a CIA contract worker who said in a closed blog that " waterboarding is torture " was stripped of the security clearance she needed in order to do her job
8. Control the press
Josh Wolf ( no relation ) , a blogger in San Francisco , has been put in jail for a year for refusing to turn over video of an anti-war demonstration ; Homeland Security brought a criminal complaint against reporter Greg Palast , claiming he threatened " critical infrastructure " when he and a TV producer were filming victims of Hurricane Katrina in Louisiana .
Palast had written a bestseller critical of the Bush administration .
9 . Dissent equals treason
" spy " and " traitor "
10 .
Suspend the rule of law

For believers in liberty and sound economics , it has been a series of devastating weeks .
The crisis of fiat money , long foretold by the Austrian school , finally came .
But there turns out to be no great satisfaction in saying " I told you so . "
If it would do any good , it would be worth it .
But Treasury officials and central bankers are proceeding as if they had nothing to do with actually causing the bubble and the bursting of the bubble — acting , in fact , as if the old tale about the need to support prices to fix the recession were true .
It is the perfect storm : the big banks loot us through government , while the academic economists approve it as applied science .
Moreover , there seems to be no test of whether or not what they are doing is a good thing .
When the market responds negatively to a new infusion of cash , they say that it is n't enough .
When the market responds positively , they take credit for fixing the problem .
The state maintains the charade that it is the one infallible institution .
To top it off , the unreconstructed Keynesian Paul Krugman has won the Swedish central bank 's Nobel Prize in economics .
It was n't for his reflationist views but for his trade theory ; nonetheless , his overall oeuvre will receive new attention , and his views on the crisis are identical to the kind of fallacy - ridden central planning that caused the downturn of 1929 to turn into the Great Depression .
Put his ideas in charge , and we are doomed .
Instead , of course , they should turn to those who both predicted this crisis and who offer a coherent explanation for it .
The most important priority right now is dramatic monetary reform .
In an ideal world , officials would follow the Mises / Rothbard strategy of defining the dollar as a weight of gold and permit all - around convertibility at all levels .
The immediate criticism is that this step would curb the power of central bankers and government to create money out of thin air to fix the crisis .
But the criticism alone makes the point .
It would indeed restrict their power , and that is precisely why it needs to be done .
True liquidity is based on savings and capital ; it can not be created by decree .
Decrees end up creating money out of thin air , which ends up overriding market preferences and generating inflation .
Everything officials do to fix the crisis ends up prolonging it .
Here 's the core problem of the gold - standard idea .
It is indeed the best path .
But the people charged with implementing it will invariably be the very people , advancement of whose interests has caused the current problem and have the least incentive to change the system .
We 've seen in the last several weeks how these people are willing to blow up the world rather than face liquidation .
So the question becomes , how can we take steps toward sound money and banking without depending on the good will of the officials in charge ?
The answer is provided in some of the writings of Jörg Guido Hülsmann and , before him , Hans Sennholz .
Guido is a student of Rothbard 's while Hans was a student of Mises's .
Both agree on an alternative path forward that embraces radical decontrol of money and banking in the hope of a currency competition that will at least allow gold currency as an option .
Guido's book on the topic will be appearing soon , and Hans Sennholz 's relevant work here is Money and Freedom , which is newly available from Mises.org .
( This is also the approach that Ron Paul , a longtime advocate of the gold standard , took during his campaign . )
Currently the government has in place severe restrictions on what currency you can use as legal tender .
The courts do not enforce other kinds of monetary contracts .
Anyone who comes up with alternative currency is going to face possible prosecution .
For this reason , the dollar is mandatory .
We will be stuck with it even as the feds are destroying it .
There is no way out .
All these restrictions need to be repealed as a step toward monetary reform .
People should be free to use any money they can get each other to accept .
More than that , people should be free to introduce new moneys based on gold or silver or any other commodity , and develop payment systems based on this , whether that means paper signifiers or digital goods .
The market is capable of policing this system the same way it does retail trade .
Money originated in market competition long before the age of the nation - state .
It is a product of the market , not of state edict or some mythical " social compact . "
Nor is there a reason to put a stop to the competitive process once it has decided upon a single money .
Money can and does fail , especially once it is nationalized and given over to a central bank to manage .
Permitting freedom in money production and use amounts to permitting market forces to continue to select the most - serviceable alternative .
In many ways , this proposal finds support in the work of F.A. Hayek , who also advocated competitive currencies .
But this one goes further in allowing a full free market in minting money by private firms .
There is historical precedent for this in George Selgin 's Good Money .
In England , early in the Industrial Revolution , the state also maintained a monopoly on money production but it failed to make enough small - denomination coins to meet the demand .
Private button makers swung into action to make coins that were circulated widely .
Their quality was controlled by market means , and they became far more desirable and widely circulated than government money .
What 's interesting here is how the market appeared to violate what is called Gresham 's Law , which asserts that " bad money " drives good money underground .
But that is only true if the " bad money " is artificially overvalued .
In settings in which the official currency is failing and alternatives are available , the process can work in the reverse , with good money replacing bad as the primary means of exchange .
Not only is the soundness of the world economy at stake ; there is a matter of human rights : the rights to invent , trade , make contracts , and associate .
The major strategic advantage of this program is that it is not asking the state to do anything positive with its monetary powers .
A demand for monetary freedom — a repeal of legal - tender laws and the opening up of the banking system to private enterprise — is nothing more than the extension of freedom generally .
I ’ve had a few run-ins with boxed wine in my day , mostly in college , and they ’re experiences I ’d care not to revisit .
But when I visited a local wine shop that focuses on budget - friendly wines , and saw French Rabbit ’s eco-friendly claims , I had to check it out .
My thoughts , after the jump …
French Rabbit wines come packaged in a Tetra - Prisma container –they ’re 100 % recyclable ( if you can recycle Tetra - Paks in your area , which is supposed to become easier ) , and weight considerably less than a glass bottle .
By French Rabbit ’s estimates , the Tetra - Prisma uses 90 % less packaging than traditional packaging .
Shipping costs are also reduced due to a lighter overall product , reducing fuel use and emission production .
I found the design to be very thoughtful .
If you do n’t drink the entire box , you open the flaps at the top of the box to squeeze out any air until you drink the rest .
And the very , very best part about the packaging ?
They ’re 1L containers .
That means you ’re getting about two glasses more than a traditional bottle .
But how does it taste ?
I make no claims to being an oenophile , but I drink wine frequently , usually $ 20 or less bottles .
I tried French Rabbit ’s Cabernet Sauvignon , but they also have a Pinot Noir , Chardonnay , Merlot , and two Family Reserves , one red , one white .
The Cabernet had a strong aroma and tasted of berries , and was easy drinking .
I ’d gladly buy it again , particularly since the price ( around $ 10 ) is so great .
And because of its light packaging , French Rabbit wines are perfect for camping or backpacking , particularly since the packaging folds flat when you inevitably drain the bottle .
I ’d say make the move to French Rabbit as a reliable bargain wine , particularly if you have access to Tetra - Pak recycling .

In response to last week ’s highly anticipated Vice Presidential ( VP ) debate , many pundits , news outlets and other “ media elite ” have come out declaring VP candidate Sarah Palin ’s performance “ exceptional , ” “ winning ” and all around “ outstanding . ”
Having watched the debate myself last Thursday , I ca n’t help but wonder :
Were we watching the same broadcast ?
Governor Palin openly refused to answer direct questions , obviously recited prepared statements ( whether they were relevant to the topic of discussion or not ) and has a tendency to ramble incoherently .
Is this someone I ’d hire in a job interview ?
No .
She may “ shoot from the hip , ” but I ’d much rather work with someone ( even more so be represented by someone ) who can think critically , listen to questions , answer them thoughtfully using concrete examples and facts ( much in the way I feel Senator Biden did during the debate ) .
While I personally disagree with some of Governor Palin ’s political views , and find the controversy that surrounds her career in Alaska questionable , I cannot discount the fact that she has been very successful in Alaska political office .
Going from city council member to Governor in 10 years is quite a feat , with 80 % approval rating to boot .
But if she is so successful as governor and as sharp as her proponents claim her to be , why is none of this coming across during her Vice Presidential campaign ?
The answer may lie in an obscure social theory known as The Peter Principle .
The Peter Principle , as defined by Wikipedia , states that
… in a hierarchy , members are promoted so long as they work competently .
Sooner or later they are promoted to a position at which they are no longer competent ( their “ level of incompetence ” ) , and there they remain .
Peter ’s Corollary states that “ in time , every post tends to be occupied by an employee who is incompetent to carry out his duties ” and adds that “ work is accomplished by those employees who have not yet reached their level of incompetence . ”
What Dr. Laurence J. Peter , author of the Peter Principle , claims is that most people will eventually move up the corporate ladder until they hit a performance ceiling and are unable to competently perform the duties of the job they now hold .
( This is not to be confused with the Dilbert Principle which states that incompetent people , regardless of how poor their performance is , will keep getting promoted far , far beyond their ability level ) .
A killer salesman can be great at closing deals and bringing in sales , but once promoted , will flail at managing a cohort of his peers , finding that his no -nonsense approach which worked so well on customers is n’t working on his employees .
A middle manager who takes great pains to connect and mentor her employees may find herself feeling disconnected and out - of - depth in a tough - decision , high - stakes arena of upper management .
Watching Governor Palin stumble through interviews and seeing how fiercely guarded she is by her handlers makes me think this woman has reached her “ level of incompetence . ”
This is not to say that she is incompetent as a wife / mother / woman / governor , just not ready for the job of Vice President .
Blogger Penelope Trunk , asks
“ Who is so arrogant to think that they could do better with just five weeks ’ preparation ? ”
I think the question should not be , “ who thinks they could cram better than Palin ? ” but “ who is Palin to think she can cram for the job of Vice President ? ”
Can one ‘ cram ’ for the second highest political office in the country ?
Does this mean a nurse can study like crazy for a month and become a doctor ?
Of course not .
Can a student read the entire textbook in a week and take over as teacher ?
Well … maybe ( no offense to quality teachers ) .
But do we really want one of our highest political leaders to be practicing a “ fake - it - till - I - make - it ” approach ?
As the national election draws closer , I urge everyone to take a step back and really consider if you want style over substance ( this goes for either ticket ) for the next four years .

Breaking : Senate Passes Rescue Bill
By a vote of 74 - 25 , the Senate just approved the revised version of the $ 700 billion Wall Street rescue bill rejected Monday by the House .
The bill now heads to the House for a vote , likely on Friday .
Some of the revisions included in the Senate bill were designed to win the support of House Republicans who voted against the first bill .

Nuclear power is not , as the industry and some politicians claim , a carbon - free source of electricity .
It is truly carbon free when you split uranium in a nuclear fission reaction , but acquiring that uranium - 235 and disposing of its wastes are not zero - carbon enterprises .
For that matter , nor is constructing the nuclear power plant itself .
And now Nature News has reported on a study about how much carbon nuclear power plants emit over their entire life cycle , and the life cycle of its uranium fuel .
The study claims nuclear power emits between 1.4 g carbon dioxide equivalent per kilowatt - hour ( gCO 2 e/kWh ) and 288 gCO 2 e/kWh , with an approximate mean of 66 gCO 2 e/kWh .
This compares quite favorably in even the worst case ( 288 gCO 2 e/kWh ) to scrubbed coal ’s 960 gCO 2 e/kWh or natural gas ’ 443 gCO 2 e/kWh , but not as good as photovoltaic or onshore wind , at 32 gCO 2 e/kWh and 10 gCO 2 e/kWh respectively .
But even at 66 gCO 2 e/kWh , nuclear appears to be a truly low carbon electricity source , although not a carbon - free source .
Representatives from both anti-nuclear environmental groups and a pro-nuclear industry group dislike some of the basic conclusions of the study .
The environmental groups dislike that nuclear has significant proliferation issues , faces questions about the sustainability of the uranium supply , and is publicly supported via government tax subsidies against standard free market determinations of value .
And the nuclear industry group points out that environmentalists are pushing for tax subsidies for their favored renewable technologies and that renewable electricity cannot provide baseload ( always on electricity that ’s tunable moment - by - moment ) electricity supply .
However , the study pointed out that money spent on renewable electricity generation or energy efficiency will prevent the emission of great deal more carbon than even nuclear will .
Perhaps the best approach is what PCAP ’s Bill Becker suggested in his interview during the DNC , but that both the environmental groups and the nuclear industry seem to be unwilling to accept at this time :
[ W]e do n’t oppose coal , we do n’t oppose nuclear .
We oppose carbon emissions , we oppose proliferation .
What we need to do as a nation is set a performance standard for the technologies we ’re going to promote and subsidize publicly .
We need to meet this standard for net energy gain , net carbon reduction , national security impact , water consumption .

Global heating may cause ocean dead zones
There are dead zones – areas where normal ocean life has died due to a lack of dissolved oxygen in the water – scattered throughout the world ’s oceans , and the number and size of the dead zones are increasing .
Most dead zones have the same cause as the well documented and understood Gulf of Mexico dead zone at the mouth of the Mississippi River , namely runoff of phosphorus and nitrogen compounds into rivers that causes an algal boom in the ocean .
When the algal bloom dies , the decomposition of all that organic matter uses the oxygen dissolved in the water , making an area where normal life cannot survive but where sulfur - eating anerobic bacteria can thrive and create toxic sulfur compounds that kills any organisms that cannot flee and that poisons the area for weeks or months .
But the algal bloom - dead zone cycle is n’t inherently driven by agricultural runoff or human wastes being dumped into rivers – anywhere that theres a sudden increase in the amount of nutrients available to algae at the ocean ’s surface can produce a dead zone .
And it now appears that global heating , as it changes the location and strength of ocean currents and nutrient - rich upwellings , may create dead zones as well , such as the recent dead zone off the coast of Oregon .
According to the Scientific American article , Andrew Bakun of the University of Miami believes he knows why some of the dead zones are appearing so close to shore in places where they never used to appear : global heating is increasing the temperature difference between the ocean and the land .
The increased temperature difference drives coastal winds , and it ’s these winds that are largely responsible for creating upwellings as the wind blows surface water back out to sea and uncovers nutrient - rich deep water .
More nutrients means more organic matter to decompose and lower oxygen levels .
Unfortunately , there ’s not a lot of data on upwelling - driven dead zones – they ’re too new – and so scientists do n’t really know for sure , but the hypothesis fits the existing facts so far .
This means that scientists do n’t have enough data right now to predict when changes in upwellings might kill off a commercially important fishery as a result of global heating .
Apparently overfishing and ocean acidification were n’t bad enough problems .

Livestock may help increase soil carbon
It ’s not every day that you come across someone suggesting that livestock , usually put in the column titled “ this is bad for the climate ” , could well be the key to adding carbon to our soils world wide and , in the process , pulling the carbon that ’s already in the atmosphere out and improving soil yields and water management in the process .
Yet that ’s exactly what Soil Carbon of Bond University , Queensland , Australia is suggesting .
And after reviewing their case study ( English version ) , I have to say that their proposal at least makes some logical sense .
The gist of the situation is this – insufficient management of livestock has led to the wholesale destruction of large areas of otherwise productive land .
When livestock are managed properly – driven from one part of the range to another to prevent overgrazing , populations controlled , and so on – the livestock can actually enhance the quality of the land they ’re ranched on .
The reason is that livestock leave fertilizer around , punch seeds into hard packed land , and thus give new plants a better chance to grow with more nutrients and better access to water .
And so long as the livestock are kept moving through the recovery areas , the land will eventually grow more lush and , at the same time , sequester more atmospheric carbon .
In essence , livestock are used as a recovery tool for damaged agricultural lands and , because the amount of plant life increases , more carbon is stored in the land and water soaks into the land instead of running off in flash floods .
The photos are pretty amazing and compelling , and the case study document is well worth the 15 minutes it ’ll take to read .

New international study on green job creation
Last Saturday , Green Jobs
Now held their National Day of Action where over 700 events held in every state showed local communities that there were jobs to be had in the “ green ” sector .
In the last week , a new report produced by the International Labor Organization , the U.N. Environment Program , and the International Organization of Employers and reported by Voice of America found that 2.3 million green jobs had already been created in renewable energy and that another 8.5 million green jobs would be created by 2030 in just solar and wind power .
In addition , the report found that renewable energy was currently generating more new jobs worldwide than fossil fuels .
If you read the summary of the actual report , you find that the news is actually much better than the VOA article suggests .
The growth in renewable energy from 2006 ( ~ 2.3 million jobs ) to 2030 is 18 million more jobs world wide , while the full report says that millions to tens of millions of jobs would be created in green buildings , a net gain of about 600,00 new jobs in green transportation ( after subtracting the lost jobs in dirty transportation ) , but an unknown number of new jobs in organic and natural agriculture , sustainable forestry , and green industry .
And while the green sector is expected to grow from about $ 1.4 trillion today to $ 2.3 trillion by 2020 , the growth will not occur equally everywhere , for all job categories , and in equally green ways – some areas will grow more than others , some may in fact shrink , and some jobs are simply less green than others .
The key to all of this tremendous job growth is education and training .
New employees need to be taught how to work in a green fashion within existing industries , existing employees need to be similarly trained , and those people who lose their jobs due to a green transition need to be retrained how to do a new , green job ( or shown how to do their old job for green contractors ) .

Combined photovoltaic and solar thermal technology
Green , Inc. , one of the many NYTimes blogs , reported on a brilliant new development in solar energy – combined photovoltaic and solar thermal panels .
Photovoltaic panels produce electricity from sunlight , but they are n’t very efficient partly because of how much energy is converted to unrecoverable heat .
Solar thermal panels use sunlight to create heat specifically to function as a hot water heater or to directly heat the home ’s air in lieu of a furnace .
The new system by Berkeley - base PVT Solar uses the fact that so much of the sunlight is converted into heat even in photovoltaic systems to simultaneously generate electricity and provide heating to the house ’s water or air .
In addition , because electronics in general run more efficiently when cool instead of hot , the solar thermal aspects of the new system also cools the photovoltaic panels themselves , making them more efficient .
The Green , Inc. post quotes Gordon Handelsman , president of PVT Solar as saying “ We make around 100 percent more energy than a regular PV system . ”
Given that this “ combined - cycle ” solar energy system is more than 50 % energy efficient , it ’s hardly a surprise that Vinod Khosla , the company ’s primary investor , say “ [ n ] ow the economics make sense . ”
One way to tell that an idea was brilliant – it looks glaringly obvious and self - evident after the fact .
I hope that it works , and that PVT Solar makes millions , if not billions , licensing the technology far and wide .

There is no need to use public money to bankroll next - generation broadband in the UK , says a report .
The six - month long review of the UK 's readiness for high - speed net access said the case for government intervention was " weak " .
The review said there were " promising signs " that the market was already delivering high - speed broadband .
But , it said , the government must oversee initiatives that will smooth the route to high - speed access .
Speed boost " There is little evidence that in the short term the UK is going to suffer from the lack of an extensive next generation access network , " said review author Francesco Caio as he unveiled his conclusions .
Rather than hand over public money to telecoms firms that will be laying fibre - optic cables to homes and businesses , Mr Caio said the government should ensure the regulatory regime encourages firms to take the financial risks themselves .
Next - generation broadband would boost the speed of connections to 100 Megabits per second ( Mbps ) and beyond .
In the UK the average speed of high - speed fixed line net access is 3 - 4 Mbps - but this fluctuates widely depending on where people live .
Telecoms firms will boost speeds by replacing ageing copper cables with fibre that use light to carry data .
But this city is betting that it will be cheaper to get into the fast lane now , rather than wait and see the costs of the labour to dig up all those roads - and canals - rise later .
Rory Cellan- Jones
dot.life blog Japan tops world broadband study
The cost of putting in a basic next - generation broadband is likely to top £ 5 bn according to analysis by the Broadband Stakeholder 's Group .
Laying cables to every home and business could push costs to £ 28 bn .
Mr Caio said BT 's plan to spend £ 1.5 bn on laying fibre and Virgin 's plans to improve its network were " promising signs " that the UK was on track to update its broadband infrastructure .
However , a report from net firm Cisco suggests that the UK's net infrastructure is already falling short of what users want to do with it .
Cisco drew up a net quality index which looked at whether the infrastructure was reliable enough to become the bedrock for existing or future web - based services and applications .
" Notably the UK , Spain and Italy did n't cut that threshold , even for today 's applications , " said Fernando Gil de Bernabe , a spokesman for Cisco .
The government 's role in next - generation broadband should be to support local groups keen to signal their interest in getting high - speed access .
It should also relax rules that stop high - speed access being offered via overhead and work with building firms to ensure all new build homes have next - generation access .
Antony Walker , head of the Broadband Stakeholder Group , said although the report ruled out substantial subsidies it did charge the government and regulator Ofcom with significant duties to make sure next - gen broadband took off .
" The government needs to come off the fence about next - generation broadband and be very clear that it thinks it is of real , fundamental importance to the UK economy for the next 5 - 10 years , " said Mr Walker .
The government needed to adopt a leadership role to create the right environment for next - gen broadband to take off , he added .
It was very unlikely that any single telecoms firm would be wiring up the whole of the UK for fibre .
Instead , he said , different firms would upgrade different parts of the UK .
" Making sure that patchwork fits together seamlessly - that 's where government and Ofcom have a role to play , " he said .
Also , he said , the government and Ofcom should get behind the local initiatives that will try to take high - speed broadband to rural areas .
Backing such schemes would help stimulate demand in areas where some firms may have been reluctant to upgrade cables , he said .
" Demand stimulation initiatives are going to be very important and in many areas will make a significant difference , " he said .
The review was kicked off on 22 February 2008 by Business and Competitiveness Minister Shriti Vadera .
It aimed to find out what the government should do to ensure next generation broadband technology does get rolled out in the UK in a timely fashion .
The review was tasked with discovering what , if any , barriers existed that would stop firms taking on the financial risk of investing in the technology .
The government said it would respond to the review and its recommendations in " due course " .

Film we ’ve got this brand new photo ofin his final film , ‘s “ . ”
The magic mirror in which the actors travel through seems to be sitting behind Ledger in the photo .
Ledger passed away during filming , so trio of actors : andall stepped in to fill his role for the remainder of the film .
“ Ledger ’s character falls through a magic mirror four times throughout the film ” making these transformations into other actors actually feasible .

By : Jeff Clark Date : Mon , 15 Sep 2008
In the current US election there has been much discussion about Obama 's advantage in campaign financing .
In short , he is collecting much more money from donations than his rival , McCain .
The Federal Election Commision has a wealth of data about the contributions made to all the campaigns .
They provide details on each individual donor including name , address , employer , occupation , date of donation , and the amount donated .
I have taken the contribution data for Obama and McCain and done some analysis focused on the occupations of the contributors .
This first graph shows which occupations contributed the most to the Obama and McCain campaigns .
The top blue bar gives the total contributed to Obama from people of the corresponding occupation and the red shows the total contributed to McCain .
The darker blue sections show the amount that contributions for Obama exceeded those of McCain for that profession .
Similarly , the darker red sections show the amount that contributions to McCain exceeded those for Obama .
For example , the bars for ' attorney ' show that they contributed ~ 23 million dollars to Obama and about 7 million to McCain .
The darker rightmost portion of the blue bar makes it more visually obvious that contributions to Obama exceeded those to McCain by attorneys by a great margin .
The occupations are sorted in the order of total contributions to both of the presidential candidates .
Some observations :
People listing their occupation as ' retired ' contributed more money than any other
44 of the top 50 occupations contributed more to Obama than McCain
Obama has a huge relative advantage in many occupations including ' unemployed ' , ' professor ' , ' student ' , ' lawyer ' , ' teacher ' , ' writer ' , ' artist ' , ' architect ' , ' software engineer ' , and ' registered nurse '
McCain did not have a huge relative advantage in any of the top 50 occupations
There were more contributions from ' student ' than ' teacher ' although ' professor ' was higher than both
As noted in the second observation above there were very few occupations in the top 50 that contributed more to McCain .
So what occupations did favour him ?
The graph below shows which occupations contributed more to McCain than Obama and by how much .
The scale seems too large for this data but I wanted to keep it consistent with the one on the next graph showing the same information for Obama .
Some observations on McCain 's support :
None of these show a large absolute advantage for McCain compared the occupations listed on the comparable Obama graph shown below
Lots of business executive occupations - ' executive ' , ' chairman ' , ' chairman and ceo ' , ' president ' , and ' business executive '
Lots of oil related occupations - ' oil and gas ' , ' oil and gas producer ' , ' petroleum engineer ' , ' oil and gas exploration ' , 'oil and gas investments '
' lobbyist ' at # 10 , ' government affairs ' at # 24 , ' campaign staff ' at # 25
' beer distributor ' , ' beer wholesaler ' in the list .
McCain 's wife has a lot of wealth that came from the beer industry .
Support from ' farmer ' , ' rancher '
' homemaker ' seems slightly anamolous but the relative edge for McCain was slight
The comparable graph for Obama is below at the same scale .
Some observations from this graph :
Strong support from the legal industry - ' attorney ' , ' lawyer ' , ' law professor '
Strong support from academic professions - ' professor ' , ' teacher ' , ' student ' , ' educator '
Strong support from health - related professions - ' physician ' , ' psychologist ' , ' registered nurse '
Strong support from the creative class - ' writer ' , ' artist ' , ' architect ' , ' designer ' , ' actor ' , ' photographer ' , ' musician ' , ' actress '
Support from some executive classes - ' chief executive officer ' , ' executive director ' , ' managing director '
A greater contribution advantage from ' unemployed ' than any other occupation except for ' attorney '
In conclusion , this data shows that Obama has a large contribution advantage across virtually all classes of occupations with the exceptions of some high - level business executives , the oil and gas industry , the beer industry , farmers , ranchers , and homemakers .
_______________________________________________________________________________
Some notes on methodology :
The data available at the time of this analysis includes contributions up to July 31st , 2008 .
I have combined a few obvious occupation spelling variations together .
For example , ' home maker ' has been combined with ' homemaker ' , and ' cpa ' and ' certified public accountant ' combined with ' accountant ' .
Several high - level executive occupations have been combined into ' executive ' - namely ' coo ' , ' chief operating officer ' , ' cio ' , ' cfo ' , ' exec ' , and ' cto ' .
There are many other variations that could plausibly be combined - ' doctor ' with ' physician ' or ' attorney ' with ' lawyer ' for example .
If anyone wants to verify my analysis and is interested in the complete list of combinations I used just send me an email .

A bacteria cell 's ' crisis command centre ' has been observed for the first time swinging into action to protect the cell from external stress and danger , according to new research published in Science .
The research team behind the new study says that finding out exactly how bacteria respond and adapt to stresses and dangers is important because it will further their understanding of the basic survival mechanisms of some of the most resilient , hardy organisms on Earth .
The crisis command centre in certain bacteria cells is a large molecule , dubbed a ' stressosome ' by the scientists behind today 's research .
These cells have around 20 stressosomes floating around inside them , and although scientists knew they played an important role in the cell 's response to stressful situations , the complexities of this process had not been fully understood until now .
If a bacteria cell finds itself in a dangerous situation - for example , if the temperature or saltiness of the bacteria 's environment reach dangerous levels which threaten the survival of the bacteria - a warning signal from the cell 's surface is transmitted into the cell .
Using cutting edge electron microscopy imaging techniques the authors of the new research observed that the stressosomes receive this warning signal , and in response several proteins called RSBT break away from the large stressosome .
This breakaway triggers a cascade of signals within the cell which results in over 150 proteins being produced - proteins which enable the cell to adapt , react and survive in its new environment .
Professor Marin van Heel from Imperial College London 's Department of Life Sciences , one of the corresponding authors of the study , explains : " The cascade of events inside bacteria cells that occurs as a result of stressosomes receiving warning signals leads to particular genes inside the cell being transcribed more .
This means that some genes already active inside the cell are ' turned up ' so that levels of particular proteins in the cell increase .
These changes to the protein make - up of the cell enable it to survive in a hostile or challenging environment . "
Dr Jon Marles - Wright from Newcastle University says : " Our work shows that cells respond to signals much like a dimmer on a light switch .
Now we 'll be building on this to work out how nature controls that dimmer switch .
We would n't have been able to carry out this work without access to the Diamond synchrotron Light Source which has enabled us to examine the structures of individual stressosome proteins at atomic resolution . "
Dr Tim Grant , one of Imperial 's post doctoral researchers , adds that the key to bacteria cells ' success at surviving in rapidly changing environments is their speedy response :
" The cell 's stressosomes are very good at their job as crisis command centres because they provide a very fast effective response to danger .
The chain reaction they kickstart produces results really quickly which enables bacteria to adapt to changes in their surroundings almost instantaneously . "
The team is now planning to collect very high resolution data of the stressosome complex on the world 's newest high - resolution cryo electron microscope , the FEI " KRIOS " that has just been installed in the Max Planck Institute in Martinsried , Germany .
Improving the resolution of the stressosome structure by a factor of two will lead to a resolution range normally only attainable by X - ray crystallography and will allow the researchers to directly see the amino - acid components of this fascinating complex .
This study has been carried out as a collaboration with the research groups of Professor Rick Lewis at Newcastle University and Professor Marin van Heel from Imperial College London .

Indoor Marijuana Grow ( DEA photo )
Marijuana ( also spelled marihuana , and colloquially known as " chronic " , " ganja " , " joint " , " kush " , " pot " , " reefer " , and " weed " ) is the name given to the flowering buds of the Cannabis genus of plant , divided into the species Sativa , Indica and Ruderalis , prepared for human consumption .
The main psychoactive ingredient in marijuana is THC , or delta - 9 - tetrahydrocannabinol , an organic chemical compound which imitates natural cannabinoids produced in the human body .
Because THC is considered harmful , marijuana is generally illegal to possess , cultivate and sell in most countries , although it is legal in some liberal states .
[ 1]
In some extremely liberal jurisdictions , you can even buy it in a vending machine . [ 2 ]
Marijuana is a highly addictive drug that causes short - term memory loss , malaise , psychosis in predisposed individuals , violence and violent fits , as well as impairment of physical and mental functioning .
Studies confirm and even defenders of marijuana admit that it causes violent paranoia . [ 3 ]
Marijuana use may contribute to a rise in brain tumors .
While some pretend that cannabis has " medicinal " benefits ( see Medical marijuana ) , many scientists debunk that fiction and observe that there are numerous federally approved medicines for the diseases that " medicinal " marijuana has been used to treat .
Marijuana consumption impairs one 's ability to drive , thereby creating enormous hazards on the road .
The media downplays or even conceals the role of marijuana in murders that result from extreme paranoia .
There were many media reports about the brutal random murder of the 22 - year - old rookie police officer Natalie Corona in Davis , California in January 2019 , by Kevin Douglas Limbaugh , a white man aged 48 .
The toxicology report on Limbaugh showed that he had THC in his blood , which demonstrates his marijuana use . [ 4 ]
Yet media reports about the murderer 's marijuana use are very hard to find .
As of early 2019 , only two countries have legalized recreational use of marijuana , as in 2013 socialist Uruguay legalized the drug , and Canada , under Trudeau 's Liberal Party , legalized marijuana in October 2018 .
In the United States , nine states have " legalized " the recreational use of marijuana : Alaska , California , Colorado , Oregon , Massachusetts , Maine , Nevada , Vermont and Washington , along with Washington D.C. , but not all allow sales of marijuana .
All but three conservative states have either decriminalized marijuana or allowed limited medical usage for specific medical conditions .
However , due to the Supremacy Clause , federal law , under which marijuana is illegal , overrules those states which have legalized or decriminalized , so their " legalization " is only de facto effective to the degree to which the federal government refrains from enforcing federal law .
Legal History
United States
Marijuana was first restricted in the United States on the federal level in 1937 , with Franklin Delano Roosevelt 's signing of the 1937 Marihuana Tax Act . [ 5 ]
On May 19 , 1969 , the Supreme Court declared the Marihuana Tax Act unconstitutional due to illegal self - incrimination , a violation of the Fifth Amendment , in the case of Leary v. United States . [ 6 ]
As a result , President Richard Nixon signed into law the Controlled Substances Act on October 27 , 1970 , renewing the ban on marijuana . [ 7 ]
From 1973 to 1978 , several US states " decriminalized " marijuana , meaning that they would not enforce state laws against minor marijuana use and possession .
This began with Oregon , and was joined with Alaska , California , Minnesota , Mississippi , North Carolina , and Nebraska . [ 8 ]
In 1996 in California , a voter referendum legalized the use of marijuana for medical usages , allowing it to be used for any condition for which a patient presented a doctor 's recommendation . [ 9 ]
Arizona also passed a medical cannabis ballot measure , but it was rendered ineffective on a technicality . [ 10 ]
Other states followed , and in 2014 Utah became the first state to legalize only some derivatives of marijuana , not the full drug itself . [ 11 ]
In 2012 , Washington and Colorado " legalized " recreational marijuana by voter initiative ; [ 12 ] by early 2018 the number of recreational legal states reached nine with the addition of Vermont . [ 13 ]
Marijuana is a Schedule I Controlled Substance in the United States of America , meaning that it is illegal under federal law of the United States , and considered to have no redeemable medical value .
According to the FBI , in 2012 , there were 658,000 arrests for marijuana possession compared with 256,000 for cocaine , heroin and their derivatives . [ 14 ]
Many liberals have advocated for decriminalization , including National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws , Marijuana Policy Project , and Law Enforcement Against Prohibition . [ 15 ] [ 16 ]
On July 26 , 2014 , the New York Times published an editorial calling for removing federal controls over marijuana for people 21 and older , leaving the question to individual states . [ 14 ]
Many American conservatives , especially social conservatives , oppose legalization of marijuana in any form due to its perceived harmful medical and psychological effects and its likelihood of harm to third parties due to drug - related crime and reckless driving .
A few libertarian - leaning conservatives , most notably Ron Paul , William F. Buckley , and Larry Elder , have advocated the decriminalization of this drug .
Some liberals support legalization , but most instead advocate for drug treatment and rehabilitation .
Libertarians are usually the biggest supporters of marijuana legalization .
Gary Johnson , a former Republican and 2012 Libertarian Party Presidential candidate for president , is the highest ranking US politician to advocate for marijuana legalization .
He was a two - term Governor of New Mexico .
Legalization on a Federal level is virtually impossible , since the United States was a major leader in the international treaty known as the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs [ 17 ] of 1970 .
Said treaty is defined by the Constitution as carrying equal weight to an Amendment to the Constitution ; therefore , the only way marijuana could ever be legal on a Federal level is if we withdrew from a treaty of our own creation as a prerequisite to legalization .
Overseas
The Netherlands decriminalized the use of marijuana in 1976 .
As a result , marijuana use among the 18 - 25 age group doubled , however , despite its availability , marijuana use in the Netherlands is lower than the European average .
The Netherlands also saw an influx of " drug tourists " and other undesirables , as well as an increase in crime .
In 2013 , the government of the Netherlands enacted a new toleration rule regarding the use of marijuana in order to combat drug tourism , essentially restricting access of marijuana to citizens [ 18 ] .
Crime has since leveled out , leaving the Netherlands with one of the lowest crime rates in Europe until recently [ 19 ] .
In several countries , particularly in Western Europe , cannabis use has been decriminalized .
However , in many other countries , particularly those in the Middle East and Asia , possession of even small amounts of cannabis can be punishable by death .
In 2013 , Uruguay initiated nationwide legalization of recreational marijuana , becoming the first developed nation to do so in the modern era . [ 20 ]
Canada legalized recreational cannabis in October 2018 , allowing " pot shops " that sold marijuana under the ruse of " medicinal " purposes to drop the pretense and begin selling marijuana openly for recreational purposes .
Adverse effects
Areas of the brain negatively effected by THC
Marijuana contains many of the same carcinogens as tobacco , and some research suggests that when smoked , it shares the same risk of lung cancer [ 21 ]
If smoked , marijuana also leads to a temporary increase in heart rate and blood pressure resulting is a slight increase in the risk for heart related problems including heart attack . [ 22 ]
Chronic smokers often suffer from mild withdrawal symptoms , however marijuana is not believed to be physically addictive . [ 23 ]
Marijuana can impair judgment , motor skills , and balance . [ 24 ]
Prenatal exposure to marijuana has also been linked to impaired learning and developmental disability in children . [ 25 ]
If marijuana is consumed heavily and on a daily basis by children around the age of 12 for a period of years , even liberal scientists have been forced to conclude that humans have a 1/4th random chance of developing psychosis , based on a random genetic trait . [ 26 ]
However , all of these adverse effects , which have been the motivation for making recreational use of marijuana illegal , are typically ignored by the liberal advocates of recreational marijuana use , who use deceitful and dismissive arguments ( including the creation , publication and use of fraudulent " studies " which claim to " debunk " the science proving the negative effects of marijuana , without offering any legitimate proof behind their " debunking " claims ) against keeping marijuana use illegal to justify its use and are motivated both by politics and simply by doing what they want at the expense of public health and safety . [ 27 ] [ 28 ]
Crime
The liberal media typically downplay or completely ignore the role of marijuana in mass killings , horrific accidents , and other types of harm to innocent people victimized by users of the drug .
For example , authorities conceal from the public how much marijuana was in the system of " College Weed Dealer " Dzhokhar Tsarnaev when he went on his killing rampage . [ 29 ] [ 30 ]
Rolling
Stone magazine , which has often featured musicians who abuse drugs , put Dzhokhar Tsarnaev on its July 13 , 2013 cover .
The magazine 's article described him as " a dedicated pot smoker " and local dealer who " always had big Tupperware containers of weed in his fridge . " [ 31 ]
The current trend of marijuana becoming legal on the state level has lead to increased supply in the United States , which in turn has lead to Mexican drug cartels choosing to switch to heroin and methamphetamine , both far deadlier drugs , due to marijuana commanding a lesser profit margin . [ 32 ] [ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ]
Medical benefits
Advocates of marijuana claim that the active ingredient in marijuana , THC , has been shown to produce some short - term psychological and medicinal " benefits " , which are probably more than offset by the medical harm .
For example , Harvard University conducted a study on the effect of Δ - 9 - Tetrahydrocannabinol on certain lung cancers , claiming that THC might help reduce a lung cancer tumor size by as much as half . [ 36 ]
In addition to a significant reduction in tumor size , there was a reduction in lesions on the lungs by 60 % , and a reduction in protein markers associated with the progression of cancer . [ 37 ]
Marijuana is used to relieve symptoms experienced by patients afflicted with ALS . [ 38 ]
Marijuana is an antispasmodic and anticonvulsant is used in the treatment of seizures . [ 39 ]
Marijuana is also used in the treatment of migraines , arthritis , [ 40 ] depression , [ 41 ] and glaucoma .
However the effect of marijuana on intraocular pressure ( IOC ) is not as effective as those offered by other drugs on the market . [ 42 ]
In states where marijuana is legal ( either completely or via medication ) , parents of young children have been known to seek out strains that are high in Cannabidiol ( CBD ) and low in THC ; Cannabidiol is known to counteract the " high " of THC , and is believed to be the cause of the anti-seizure effects when consumed .
There have not been many in - depth and widely distributed studies into the possible medicinal effects of marijuana .
However , with political pressure from liberal advocates of marijuana , more accredited institutions are conducting research on the drug .
Despite state legality , physicians are reluctant to prescribe " medicinal " marijuana fearing it may jeopardize their DEA license to prescribe controlled substances .
[ 43 ] " Medicinal " marijuana is used by physicians as a last - resort in states where it is legal or semi-legal ( under state law ) , but also misused by people who simply want to get high .
" Medicinal " marijuana , however well - intentioned and beneficial , will also lead to abuses in that system .
Marinol
Marinol ( a brand formulation of dronabinol ) [ 44 ] is a schedule III controlled substance , approved for relief of nausea and vomiting in persons undergoing cancer chemotherapy and to improve appetite in persons with AIDS .
It is dispensed in gelatin capsules containing synthetic Δ - 9 - Tetrahydrocannabinol dissolved in sesame oil .
Liberals advocating " medicinal " marijuana do their best to ignore this drug .
A 1998 survey of physicians , addiction specialists and police demonstrated no evidence or concern about the abuse , dependence or diversion of Marinol . [ 45 ]
About this time , the DEA moved the drug from schedule II to the less restrictive schedule III . [ 46 ]
Cannabidiol ( CBD )
CBD is chemically extracted from the cannabis plant .
It is legal in most states , and its oil has been proven to be effective in certain cases of epilepsy and insomnia .
So far , any other effects have been demonstrated to be snake - oil .
While CBD itself is safe , oils claiming to contain CBD are currently unregulated by the FDA . [ 47 ]
Atheism , marijuana usage and amotivational syndrome
Atheism and amotivational syndrome ( Marijuana usage is associated with amotivational syndrome )
Tax Revenue
Marijuana advocates , ignoring the adverse health , cultural , and societal effects of legalized marijuana , point to increased tax revenue in states where it is legal and heavily taxed . [ 48 ]
Colorado alone has made over $ 1 billion in tax revenue over the course of its five years of legalization , roughly the same amount that the seven states where marijuana is both legal and taxed made in 2018 . [ 49 ] [ 50 ]
Interesting Facts
Carl Sagan used recreational marijuana to help " open his mind " . [ 51 ]
Cannabis was first cultivated in China around 4000 B.C. [ 41 ]
U.S. Declaration of Independence was not written on hemp paper , despite popular belief by liberals . [ 52 ]
George Washington grew marijuana . [ 53 ]
An average human will pass out after consuming 1/14 of the LD - 50 of weed , which is why no overdoses have ever been reported .
Driving while high , however , is extremely dangerous . [ 54 ]
Barack Obama has admitted to use of marijuana .
Former President Bill Clinton has also admitted to smoking marijuana , but claims that he " did not inhale " .
Former President George W. Bush privately admitted to smoking marijuana , but stated he would n't state it publicly " ' Cause I do n't want some little kid doing what I tried . "
Marijuana was originally a slang name , and as such , it is the only drug to be legally defined by its slang name
Industrial marijuana was briefly made legal in World War II in order to keep up with the demand of rope , canvas and other materials traditionally made from hemp [ 55 ]
Marijuana is called " weed " because it grows like one - heterogeneous marijuana grows in every part of the world except for the Arctic poles .
In the United States , one can report the accidental growth of marijuana on ones ' property to law enforcement without fear of criminal penalty
Like many plants , marijuana was selectively bred over the course of millennia in order to increase its potency .
Primitive marijuana plants , if smoked , would induce a headache rather than the desired " high "
