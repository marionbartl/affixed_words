IN THE ENEMY COMBATANT ’S HOUSE , in the room where he eats and prays and sleeps , a single window casts its light on a single adornment : an enormous Soviet - era map of the world .
It is the first thing I notice after I arrive unannounced one cold fall morning and am ushered into the warmth of the room .
We sit on the floor below an elongated Africa , a tiny America , and a colossal , pink - shaded U.S.S.R .
A brother with a prosthetic leg appears and lays out a brightly patterned sheet still covered with past meals ’ bread crumbs .
Non ham non , nonreza ham non , the Tajik proverb goes : “ Bread is bread , crumbs are also bread . ”
The enemy combatant serves the tea .
He pours it before it ’s properly steeped , dumps the watery cups back into the pot , and repeats .
If he ’s unhappy to see an American after Guantanamo , he does n’t show it .
He smiles , and two wrinkles appear on his left cheek .
I ask him his full name .
Muhibullo Abdulkarim Umarov , he tells me .
He says he is 24 years old .
He asks , “ You want to know the story of my capture , yes ? ”
The village of Alisurkhon , where Umarov was born and eventually returned , is a collection of mud-walled homes and apple orchards beneath the 14,000 - foot peaks of Tajikistan ’s Pamir Mountains .
Physically , it ’s closer to Afghanistan than to the Tajik capital , Dushanbe , 12 hours and 150 miles of dusty , nauseatingly potholed road to the west .
Along with post - communist detritus that litters the roadside — smokestacks , rusting tractors , half - finished cities of concrete and rebar — are occasional burned - out tanks , leftovers from the 1992 - 97 civil war that killed at least 150,000 Tajiks after the breakup of the U.S.S.R .
The crumbling infrastructure disappears as you climb higher into the Pamirs ; the frequency of gutted tanks increases .
This valley along the Obihingou River was once home to the Islamist opposition , and nearly a decade after the peace accords , the ex-Soviets who control Dushanbe still believe they have enemies lurking here .
It is a suspicious place to be from .
The valley has a wild - boar problem .
The hogs are everywhere lately , trampling crops , tearing through fields of potatoes and wheat .
Local hunters , increasingly orthodox since the fall of the Soviet Union and no longer interested in eating pork , have stopped controlling their numbers — and Russian hunters have stopped coming here altogether .
Aid groups , wary of the valley ’s growing conservatism , have largely steered clear .
When a friend and I visited on a mountaineering trip in the summer of 2003 , villagers said we were the first Westerners they ’d seen in 12 years .
I ’m back in the Obihingou Valley a year and a half later when one of these villagers , a bearded farmer with a toothy grin and two missing fingers , tells me about Umarov .
We ’re having fried potatoes and soup in the farmer ’s guest room , a converted shed with whitewashed walls and plastic bags for windows .
“ There ’s a man in the valley who has been to America , ” he mentions casually .
I find this unlikely .
“ Really .
He was in a prison .
They made a mistake . ”
He begins to chuckle — that America could make such a mistake amuses him .
I ask where the prison was .
“ Koba…kaba ? ”
It takes me a moment to realize he ’s trying to say “ Cuba , ” and a few days to cancel trekking plans and find an ancient Uaz jeep to transport me down to Alisurkhon .
WE SIT CROSS - LEGGED in Umarov ’s room , circled around the teapot , me staring at the wall and running a tape recorder , Umarov staring out the door .
The brother with the prosthesis — Ahliddin — keeps shuffling in and out , and my friend Kubad ( he asked that his name be changed for the purposes of this story ) , a Tajik mountain guide playing the role of translator , sits with us as well .
Umarov looks mostly at Kubad when he answers questions , keeping his hands in his lap , speaking so softly that it sometimes seems he ’s whispering .
“ As you know , 1994 was a year of continual war in Tajikistan , ” he begins , “ and the planes came to bombard our village .
I was 14 .
Ahliddin was 10 . ”
The boys were in the field outside their grandparents ’ home when one of the bombs fell , and day turned to night , so thick was the dust in the air .
“ My brother ’s right leg was amputated from the knee down , ” Umarov says .
In this same house , under the same Soviet map , he and his father readied a stretcher that would carry Ahliddin through the Pamirs to Afghanistan , where they would spend the winter in a camp along with thousands of other Tajik refugees .
His youngest brother , Rahmiddin , then six , also came .
Umarov does not know which pass they took .
He only remembers the snow .
By springtime , Ahliddin had a new leg from the Red Cross , but the boys needed a new home .
“ The Taliban were not in Afghanistan at that time , ” Umarov says , “ but the country was not peaceful either . ”
Their father took them south to Pakistan , then returned to his wife and daughter in Alisurkhon .
“ We attended religious schools in Peshawar , ” Umarov says .
“ Our studies were paid for by wealthy Pakistanis and the government . ”
I ask what these schools taught about America , and he smiles knowingly .
“ Maybe there were schools with the primary goal of preparing fighters , ” he says , turning to face me , “ but where I was , we never thought of these things .
We were very young . ”
He gestures to the wall .
“ I heard about America when I saw it on this map .
But I did n’t know anything about it . ”
He stayed for six years , moving through three schools .
He learned Urdu , Pashto , and Arabic .
He was a good student , and a good soccer player .
In May 2001 , soon after his graduation , the Tajik Embassy gave him a passport and documents for a trip home to newly stable Tajikistan .
He returned proudly to Alisurkhon — the eldest son , diploma in hand — and helped his parents with the harvest , collecting apples and potatoes and walnuts .
“ But then America started bombing Afghanistan , ” he says , “ and the whole world went crazy . ”
THAT FALL , Umarov was dispatched by his parents back to Pakistan , to raise enough money to bring his brothers home .
With direct flights nonexistent , and the land route via Afghanistan treacherous , he flew via Iran .
Once in Pakistan he worked selling clothing , food , and pencils — whatever was in demand — in the Peshawar bazaar , and on May 13 , 2002 , he decided to visit Karachi in search of a steadier job .
A Tajik friend , Abdughaffor , had a place for him to stay .
Abdughaffor lived in a room in the University of Karachi library , where he worked .
Also staying there was another Tajik , Mazharuddin , whose name means “ place for the miraculous appearance of the faith . ”
All four walls in the library were filled with books , and on the floor were thin carpets .
The three Tajiks slept on the carpets .
They hung up their T - shirts .
It was early in the morning of May 19 when Pakistani secret service agents came .
The agents woke them up , took the T - shirts down , and used them to tie the men ’s hands and cover their eyes .
When his blindfold was removed , Umarov was in a jail cell , his friends at his side .
“ I was not afraid , ” he says .
“ I knew I ’d done nothing wrong . ”
The Pakistanis took them one at a time for interrogations , quizzing them in rapid - fire Pashto about their names , birthplaces , and histories — and about a bombing that had just occurred .
“ Somewhere in Karachi , ” Umarov says , “ there was an attack .
A bomb exploded . ”
It had been Pakistan ’s first suicide bombing : Eleven days earlier , a red Toyota Corolla had pulled alongside a minibus outside the Karachi Sheraton , its tires screeching .
An explosion ripped the bus apart , shattered nearby windows , and left a smoking crater in the ground .
Three passersby and 11 passengers — French engineers working for the Pakistani navy — were killed .
At least 22 others were injured .
Pakistani authorities immediately suspected outsiders ; newspapers ran ads asking the public to report any suspicious foreign nationals .
( The investigation would , in fact , lead to a homegrown mastermind , Sohail Akhtar , alias Mustafa , who was eventually arrested in April 2004 . )
AFTER 10 DAYS OF INTERROGATIONS , Umarov was handcuffed , taken from his friends , and driven across the city .
He thought he would be freed ; the Pakistanis had said as much .
But the drive ended at a building that looked like a luggage factory — a secret jail where leather briefcases were stacked high against the walls .
Two Americans were running the jail , both blond , one with long hair , one short .
One was a “ strong man , ” big and muscular ; the other had an average build .
Neither wore a military uniform .
“ The reason I knew they were Americans , ” Umarov says , “ is that they told me so . ”
Later , he would hear that America paid bounties for suspected terrorists , and he would wonder if he , too , had been purchased .
No longer was he questioned about the Karachi bombing .
The Americans interrogated him about Al Qaeda .
“ They asked me what I knew about the terrorists , ” he says .
“ Did I know where they were ? ”
They asked if his passport was fake , and if he ’d seen or met Osama bin Laden .
“ Of course , I ’d heard about him on the radio and TV , ” Umarov says .
“ But how would I , a student , know much about him if people who came from a powerful country like America did not know anything about him ? ”
He pauses and looks at Kubad and me , inviting us to question his logic .
“ I was not afraid , ” he repeats .
“ I am not a thief — not someone who should be afraid of them or anything .
I told them what I knew . ”
If he lied , the men said , they would send him to Cuba .
Umarov remembers turning to the translator .
“ What is Cuba ? ” he asked .
When the questions were over , they locked him in a concrete room for 10 days .
The room was three feet long and one and a half feet wide and insufferably hot .
He wore iron handcuffs .
It was impossible to stand up or move about .
“ All my thoughts were about how my life was going to end , ” he says .
He worried about his brother Ahliddin , about an unpaid debt to his neighbors , and about the times in his life when he had made people angry or upset .
“ When I wanted to go to the toilet , ” he says , “ I would knock on the door and three guards — one with the gun and two with the stick — took me there . ”
Three times a day , he was given a bowl of rice , one chapati , and one glass of tea .
“ I was angry at these men for putting me in that room without any reason , ” he says .
“ But if you read the history of Islam , you will know there are stories similar to mine — when people are taken or sentenced to death without any reason .
It taught us to keep our emotions together . ”
What confused him was that there seemed to be no purpose to his treatment ; it was not a tactic to get him to talk .
The blond Americans did not interrogate him again .
He was returned , bleary - eyed and unwashed , to the Pakistani jail , where his friends were still being held .
“ From my appearance , ” he says , “ they knew I had not been in a good place . ”
AT 2 A.M. THE NEXT DAY , the Pakistanis handcuffed Umarov , Abdughaffor , and Mazharuddin and put black bags over their heads .
There was a bus , where American soldiers took their photographs , and then an airplane , where they were tied together on the floor .
They wore metal belts around their waists and chains over their shoulders .
They could not move , Umarov tells us .
They did not know where they were going .
When the plane landed , two soldiers lifted them and counted , in English , “ One , two , three , ” and threw them into a truck .
“ As a sack of potatoes , ” Umarov says .
He landed on the metal truck bed .
His friends landed on top of him .
“ When we cried out , ” he says , “ we were kicked . ”
UMAROV BREAKS FROM the storytelling and stands up , and Kubad and I follow him outside into the blinding daylight .
Walnuts are spread out on a canvas tarp , drying in the sun .
He plucks a handful of tiny red apples from a tree , presents them to us , and disappears through a door .
When he returns , he ’s carrying a stack of papers : documents , in English and in Russian , from the Red Cross and the U.S. Department of Defense .
“ This individual has been determined to pose no threat to the United States Armed Forces or its interests in Afghanistan , ” one reads .
“ There are no charges from the United States pending [ sic ] this individual at this time . ”
It goes on : “ The United States government intends that this person be fully rejoined with his family . ”
These papers are now the only form of identification Umarov has , he says — a red flag that causes shakedowns at Tajik checkpoints and occasional arrests .
The U.S. , which offered no compensation upon his release , never returned his passport either .
Attempts to get a new one have been blocked by a local official — part of the “ KGB , ” as Tajiks still call it — who also blocked Ahliddin ’s passport application and demands periodic bribes from the now vulnerable family .
AN AIRPLANE HANGAR , vast and bright with artificial lights , was Umarov ’s third prison : Bagram , Afghanistan .
“ Our cages were in a two - story building inside the bigger building , ” he tells us .
“ They had high fences and were surrounded by sharp wires . ”
All the windows were covered .
“ The whole place , ” he says , “ was blocked from daylight and man ’s sight . ”
Each cell held as many as 15 men ; each man was issued blue prison dungarees , a wooden platform to serve as a bed , and two blankets .
Umarov used one of the blankets as a mattress , the other to cover himself — though it was n’t enough .
The nights were cold , and the guards would not let him put his head under the covers .
Inmates wore shackles on their wrists as well as their ankles , even when sleeping , and each was assigned a number .
Umarov ’s was 75 .
“ Seventy - five , ” he whispers in halting English .
“ Seventy - five , come here . ”
Powerful lights flooded the cages 24 hours a day , and the guards made loud noises to keep the prisoners awake .
They hit their billy clubs against the metal fences .
They pounded on barrels .
They threw cans and empty water bottles .
“ We lost count of days , let alone dawn and dusk , ” he says .
“ We never saw daylight .
We were never outside . ”
Groups of four guards worked eight - hour shifts ; black tape covered the names on their uniforms .
One American looked just like Rambo : no uniform , a scarf on his head , a cut on his hand .
“ I know him , ” Umarov says , smiling .
“ He was the guy who made the film about Afghanistan . ”
If the prisoners talked to each other , the soldiers forced them to stand and hold their shackles above their heads until the pain made them not want to talk again .
If they talked again , Umarov says , the soldiers would take them upstairs and beat them .
He was never beaten .
But once he dared to talk to Abdughaffor and Mazharuddin , and the soldiers forced him to stand for hours , holding his shackles up while his arms shook .
He did not talk again .
Umarov knew the other men in his cage as faces .
He grew bored of looking at them .
They were Arabs and Afghans and Pakistanis and men who spoke French and English .
These , he assumed , must be the terrorists — the ones to be blamed for the world going crazy , the ones who should be punished .
Sometimes , when a cellmate was taken upstairs , screams would ring out across the prison .
“ This did not happen every day , ” he says , “ but it happened . ”
I ask for details , and he ’s reluctant to say more .
“ I did not see anything with my own eyes , ” he says , “ and my friends and I did not experience this torture . ”
He pauses .
There were stories he later heard in Cuba , he says — stories that he believed — about “ beatings with the wooden stick ” and electrocutions .
“ American soldiers used electrical cables to shock them in their eyes , hands , and feet .
Three men told me this .
And some , mostly Arabs , were forced to remove their clothes in front of women .
There were other things , too . ”
He will not go on .
I wonder if I should put any faith in rumors passed from detainee to detainee to me , then realize I ’m missing the point .
Umarov ’s story is best understood as what happens when an everyman is imprisoned without trial , moving through a system built for the worst of the worst .
It ’s not a story about the cruelest cases of torture — those that America may someday expose and bemoan and ban — but about something that may be scarier : what has become normal in the war on terror .
IN TWO MONTHS AT BAGRAM , Umarov says , he had only one interrogation — with an American woman who questioned him in Farsi and seemed confused as to why he was there .
“ We were alone in the room , ” he says .
“ She checked my documents and listened to my answers , then told me I was n’t guilty . ”
Life became a haze .
He would stand and sit and try to sleep in his cage , and every fifth day a soldier loosened his handcuffs and let him walk around the prison grounds .
Every seventh day , he was brought to the showers , which often had female guards and shut off after two minutes , even if he was still covered in soap .
One day early in August , while Umarov and his friends were eating lunch , the soldiers came to take them to Cuba .
They walked into their cell and started shouting , “ Stand up , stand up ! ” and everybody did , leaving plastic containers of pasta and meat half - eaten .
“ They handcuffed our hands with metal , ” he says , “ and covered our eyes with something like sunglasses , only it was impossible to see through them .
They covered our ears with something like headphones , only it was impossible to hear anything . ”
His mouth and nose were covered with tape , then with what seemed like a surgical mask .
They placed a dark hood over his head , and it became difficult to breathe .
They tied his legs and feet with a chain and attached this chain to another chain around his waist .
Finally they marched him onto an airplane and chained him to the floor .
“ After that , ” he says , “ I do not remember anything . ”
“ I was sleepwalking when we came to Guantanamo , ” he tells us .
“ I did not understand where I was . ”
He was unloaded from the airplane , but he does not recall how .
“ When my consciousness appeared , ” he says , “ I found myself in the sandy desert .
And I thought I would be executed there , in the desert . ”
His wrists , legs , and face were bleeding from the shackles and mask .
Soldiers loosened the cuffs and straps , changed the tape on his mouth , and removed the thing that blocked his ears .
They took him to the showers and gave him a clean uniform — this time in orange — and a new number .
Then Prisoner 729 went for an immediate medical checkup and interrogation .
At first , he was interrogated every week .
“ There were new investigators every time , ” he says .
“ There was a new room every time .
But the questions were always the same ” — an endless repetition of the conversation about Pakistan and Tajikistan and his life in both .
Occasionally , he became so angry that he would n’t answer their questions , preferring to sit in silence .
Other times , he challenged his interrogators : “ Why was I taken here if I have not committed any crimes ? ”
They told him they were suspicious because he had traveled many places , many times , by many routes .
He had been to Afghanistan , Pakistan , and Iran .
“ I answered that they could find many people like me , ” he says .
“ Why was it that it had to be me ? ”
They said that the routes he ’d taken were famous , and used mostly by terrorists ; he might have seen the terrorists on the roads .
They asked if he ’d known any of his fellow passengers on his flight to Iran .
“ The people on the plane were mostly American journalists , ” he responded .
“ Why not arrest them ? ”
At Guantanamo , the showers lasted five minutes .
At first he had three showers a week , then he had four , and soon he had showers almost daily .
The frequency of showers went up and the frequency of interrogations went down .
They began calling him in only once a month , then once every two months .
Eventually , they stopped interrogating him altogether .
“ The hygiene was good in Cuba , ” he admits , “ and we were allowed to pray and fast . ”
Each cell had a Koran and a real bed , and , through a mesh fence , Umarov could talk freely with his neighbors .
( Like other detainees , Umarov believes that staring through the mesh has permanently affected his vision . )
He did not wear handcuffs in his cell .
Those were used only during biweekly exercise sessions , when the guards chained his hands to his feet and led him shuffling around a fenced yard .
After his walks , they always returned him to a different cell , and to different neighbors .
He ended up near Mazharuddin once .
He met his formerly silent cellmates from Bagram and a principal from Pakistan and a farmer from Afghanistan and an English - speaking Kuwaiti who liked to talk to the soldiers .
“ Some men were moved constantly , ” he says .
“ They would wake them up , put them in chains , and take them to a new cell or to an interrogation room . ”
Prisoners were left shackled in a standing position until the investigators arrived .
“ They sometimes had to stand for 24 hours , moving only when they were brought to the toilet , ” he says .
“ How could anyone be normal after that ? ” Yet Umarov never heard Bagram - like yells at Guantanamo , and few of his neighbors told him they had been tortured .
What they talked about was injustice .
“ We did not know why we were there or when we would leave , ” he says .
“ At Guantanamo , the torture was n’t physical — it was psychological . ”
Some prisoners went insane .
Abdughaffor was one of them .
He would throw himself against the door and scream .
He tried to hang himself .
He would n’t eat .
He became somebody Umarov did not know .
Others took off their clothes and sat naked in their cells .
“ These people became like children , ” he says .
“ They did not understand their reality . ”
“ During the first five or six months , ” Umarov says , “ I believed they would find the terrorists among us , take them away , and let the rest of us go home . ”
But his detention continued .
He lost hope .
“ I started to believe that America was against Islam , ” he says .
He did not see the soldier write slurs in the prisoner ’s Koran , but he believes that it happened — an Arab told him about it .
“ People did not mind when translators or those who believed in God touched the holy book , ” he says , “ but they were angry with the faithless and godless soldiers who wrote ugly words inside it .
Kafirs — godless people — are not allowed to touch the Koran . ”
Rumors of a desecration swept through the prison .
The next day , 10 prisoners attempted suicide ; by week ’s end , there were 23 “ hanging or strangulation attempts , ” according to the U.S. Army ’s Southern Command , which oversees Guantanamo .
Around Umarov , men tried to hang themselves using prison sheets , twisting there until soldiers came to cut them down .
“ I thought about it , too , ” he admits .
“ But from the Islamic point of view , suicide is a sin .
We advised our neighbors not to do it . ”
He witnessed one or two attempts a day .
In response , the guards removed the sheets from the cells , turned off the water , and stripped every prisoner to a T - shirt and underpants .
Other prisoners , Umarov included , went on a hunger strike .
Umarov joined this strike and two others , going days without food and water , not changing his clothes .
“ I wanted to either be sent back or die there , ” he says .
The military eventually issued an apology over the loudspeakers .
“ They publicly apologized to us in different languages , ” he says .
“ It meant that we could stop . ” Soldiers came to haul them off to the camp hospital .
In extreme cases , doctors came to the cells and stuck tubes into their arms .
“ The American soldiers were like us in a way , ” he tells us .
“ They did whatever was ordered from the top — and they are not guilty for that . ”
He watched as fellow prisoners told their stories to guards , and he watched as guards cried after hearing them .
“ We told them about Islam and how beautiful it is , ” he says .
“ Had they not been soldiers , I am sure they would have converted into one of us without questions . ”
Yet it is the soldiers whom Umarov blames for the worst of his days at Guantanamo .
It was the first day of Ramadan , he recalls , when he decided to go above them and ask an investigator about his status .
After his meeting with the investigator , the soldiers punished him for his insolence .
They threw him into isolation for 10 days .
“ I was taken to the dark room , ” he says .
“ The soldiers took all my clothes and left me there . ”
The room was made of iron ; it measured three feet by five feet .
At night , frigid air was pumped through a hole in its ceiling , and its small window was covered by Plexiglas so the air could n’t leave .
Two electric coils provided dim light , and during the day , they were turned up to heat the cell to a very high temperature .
But night was worse .
“ Some prisoners would n’t last the night and had to be taken to the doctor , ” he says .
“ They kept me there for 10 days — and for no reason . ”
He later spent another 15 days in isolation , but for that , he says , there was a reason .
I ask him what it was .
“ I was standing in the cell block , leading a prayer for 48 people , and a female soldier came up and stood right next to me .
I asked her to move , but she would not .
She was doing psychological pressure .
So I spit on her . ”
IT IS LATE IN THE EVENING NOW , after eight hours of interviews , and Umarov , Kubad , and I pause for dinner .
Ahliddin brings in a meal of bread , boiled potatoes , and tomatoes .
We eat with our hands .
I ask Umarov to demonstrate how he was chained during interrogations , and he rocks forward , crossing his ankles and tucking his arms underneath his knees .
He does it automatically , almost unconsciously , then stares at me with a sickly smile .
I press him for more information about the suicides , more about his time in the air - conditioned box .
His smile fades .
“ What I ’ve already said should be enough for those who want to know about this prison , ” he says softly .
“ It was like being in a zoo , with people coming to stare and laugh at you . ” I keep pressing .
His voice rises .
“ There is no point in telling more of these stories .
Such a prison has never existed in the history of mankind .
No one has ever written about such a prison .
Why did they keep a man for two years with no reason ?
Why ?
They caught me and kept me as a prisoner of war .
What war , may I ask ?
When was I involved ?
I was sleeping when they came and dragged me out of my bed .
People who understand the laws will have already made up their minds about who is who . ”
Ahliddin tries to change the subject .
“ In Pakistan , ” he says , “ I met a family that had lived in America .
They ’d worked as dog washers . ”
He tries to say the words in En - glish : “ dog wah sir . ”
We keep eating , pondering the absurdity that , somewhere in the world , it could be a man ’s job to wash a dog .
“ That ’s what ’s wrong with America , ” Kubad announces .
“ When a dog is dirty , you think it ’s a problem .
When a real problem comes , you do n’t know what to do . ”
IN FEBRUARY 2004 , Umarov played soccer again .
He and dozens of others were moved to a new , lower - security prison camp within Guantanamo called Camp 4 .
The cells were bigger there and the food had taste , and they had meals together in a special room for eating .
“ We could walk and talk freely , ” he says .
“ If we did n’t finish our food , we could keep it with us . ”
He was reunited with Mazharuddin and Abdughaffor , who was now better .
Better … though never again himself .
No longer did they have to wear orange uniforms .
This was an important thing .
In Camp 4 , the uniforms were white , almost like normal clothing .
The prisoners were watched via closed - circuit cameras ; they could spend six hours a day outside in the fresh air .
Umarov was n’t good at soccer anymore , but he was stronger than many of the others .
Some had become too weak to run .
“ We were like two teams of old men , ” he says .
“ Worse than old men . ”
They played every day .
In March , Umarov , Abdughaffor , Mazharuddin , and 13 others from Camp 4 were issued uniforms in yet another color : brown .
They noticed a change in the way the soldiers treated them , and they started getting called in for interrogations again .
Umarov had four in quick succession .
The last investigator he met was an old man , and he was brought to him free of chains .
The investigator was tall , with gray hair and a belly , and he sat at a table that held candies , tea , and cans of Pepsi Cola .
Umarov had never been offered Pepsi Cola during an interrogation before .
He sat down at the table , and the investigtor made a speech .
“ He told me that the main reason America had been fighting and bombing in Afghanistan was to get rid of terrorists and those who create chaos , ” Umarov says .
“ He said that in a war situation , there are always people who are affected who were not guilty .
He felt sad that two years had been taken from my life , and that I ’d been kept away from my family . ”
Now Umarov would be freed .
The investigator advised Umarov to think of his future .
If people approached him to fight against America , he should not join them .
He should have a family and be a good father to his children .
“ He shared the story of his own life with me , ” Umarov says .
“ He was left without a father at a young age — that ’s why he was suggesting that I think about family . ”
They spoke for nearly an hour .
At the end , the investigator stood up and hugged him .
Umarov imagined his mud room with the Soviet map , his parents , his orchard , his apples .
He was not mad at this speech .
He was happy .
At 2 a.m. on March 31 , 2004 , Muhibullo Abdulkarim Umarov , along with his two Tajik friends and a dozen others , walked without chains through a gauntlet of soldiers at the Guantanamo airfield .
Journalists ’ flashes popped and cameras rolled as the procession of detainees passed , and two guards — a man and a woman — carefully helped Umarov board an airplane .
Inside its belly , away from the journalists , they then handcuffed him and chained him down , and they covered his eyes with the same plastic glasses .
They covered his ears with the headphones .
They covered his mouth with tape .
“ But this time we were not chained to the floor , ” he says .
“ We were chained to the benches . ”

BBC News
A US jury has recommended the death penalty for a woman convicted of killing a pregnant stranger , cutting her abdomen open and stealing her unborn baby .
Lisa Montgomery 's lawyers are planning an insanity defence Lisa Montgomery , a mother of three teenage children , was desperate for another child to shore up her marriage .
At a dog show in Kansas , she met a pregnant woman , Bobbi Jo Stinnett , and hatched a plan .
The Stinnetts bred dogs at their home in Skidmore , Missouri and Bobbi Jo advertised rat terrier puppies for sale on the internet .
One morning in December 2004 Montgomery arrived at Bobbi Jo's home on the pretext of buying a dog , but overpowered and strangled her .
She then cut into her abdomen and removed her unborn baby girl before cleaning up and taking the child back to her home in Melvern , Kansas , where she proudly showed her to her husband , Kevin .
Fake pregnancies
Ms Montgomery had been faking pregnancy for several months and told her husband Kevin she had gone into labour while shopping .
Detectives traced her through e-mails on Bobbi Jo 's computer .
M William Phelps , who has written a book on the case , said : " Sometimes these women suffer from a condition called pseudocyesis , when they actually believe they are pregnant .
" But in Lisa 's case she was just a pathological liar .
For three years in a row she said she was pregnant when she was n't and said she had lost the baby .
FOETUS ABDUCTION CASES 1987 : Darci Pierce , 19 , abducted and killed Cindy Ray in New Mexico and cut out her baby .
An insanity plea was rejected and she was jailed for life .
1995 : Debbie Evans was murdered in Illinois , along with two of her children .
A baby son survived , as did the foetus .
Three people were jailed for life .
1996 : 17 - year - old Carethia Curry was murdered by a friend , Felicia Scott , 37 , who stole her baby .
Scott jailed for life .
2000 : Michelle Bica invited a pregnant friend to her home in Ohio , shot her dead and cut out her baby .
Bica later committed suicide .
2003 : Effie Goodson shot Carolyn Simpson in Oklahoma but unwittingly killed the baby too .
She was jailed for life last year .
2004 : Lisa Montgomery killed Bobbi Jo Stinnett and cut out her baby girl , who survived 2007 : 18 - year - old Amanda Howard was abducted in Missouri but freed unharmed .
Two young women face trial for kidnap .
" This time her ex-husband said he was going to use it in court to get custody of their kids .
She had to produce a baby .
" She was backed into a corner .
The lies caught up with her . "
Lisa Montgomery is not the first woman who has committed such a terrible crime .
In the last 20 years , paediatric experts have noticed an increase in such cases , although they still remain very rare .
The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children ( NCMEC ) in Virginia says there have been nine foetus abductions or attempted abductions since 1987 .
That compares with 251 infant abductions between 1983 and September 2007 .
NCMEC spokeswoman Cathy Nahirny says the motive is most often to strengthen a faltering relationship with a male partner .
" Many times the abductor fakes a pregnancy and when it is time to deliver the baby , must abduct someone else 's child , " she says .
" We still do not understand why this small group of perpetrators goes to the extreme of abducting a still pregnant woman and cut the infant from her body .
" My guess , and it is only a guess , is that the female abductor has found it difficult to abduct an infant from a healthcare facility , and is pressed for time . "
Survivor
One woman who came close to becoming a victim was Sarah Brady .
In February 2005 Sarah , who was nine months pregnant , fought off an attack by a stranger , Katie Smith , who had befriended her and lured her to her home in Kentucky .
Smith was fatally injured by Sarah and police later found a padded belly suit - Smith had been feigning pregnancy - and a bag containing surgical gloves , cutting instruments and an umbilical clamp .
Bobbi Jo Stinnett 's baby , Victoria Jo , was reunited with her father Pam Wells , an expert on infant abductions at a hospital in Chattanooga , Tennessee , agrees that the women involved are sometimes driven to desperation by the need to keep a partner .
But she says other psychological disorders can also come into play , and that in some cases the abductor is suffering from " the loss of a significant other " .
" Some of these women genuinely believe they are pregnant .
In fact we get them in the emergency room quite often .
They go through all the tests and can't believe it when we say the ultrasound shows nothing , " she told the BBC News website .
Head injuries
She added : " What has happened in these cases is not rocket science .
It does n't take an extremely intelligent person to plan it out .
It just takes a very determined person . "
In most cases the abductors will take good care of the babies and will often convince themselves the child is their own , Ms Wells says .
Montgomery 's lawyers offered an insanity defence , arguing sexual abuse during her childhood had led to mental health problems .
At a pre-trial hearing , a neuropsychologist also testified that head injuries she had suffered some years before could have damaged the part of the brain which controls aggression .
Bobbi Jo Stinnett 's baby , Victoria Jo , was later reunited with her father , Zeb , although he is thought to have fallen out with Bobbi Jo 's mother over the question of when and what to tell the child about her mother 's death .

SAN FRANCISCO – Google ’s privacy practices are the worst among the Internet ’s top destinations , according to a watchdog group seeking to intensify the recent focus on how the online search leader handles personal information about its users .
In a report released Saturday , London - based Privacy International assigned Google its lowest possible grade .
The category is reserved for companies with “ comprehensive consumer surveillance and entrenched hostility to privacy . ”
None of the 22 other surveyed companies – a group that included Yahoo , Microsoft and AOL – sunk to that level , according to Privacy International .
While a number of other Internet companies have troubling policies , none comes as close to Google to “ achieving status as an endemic threat to privacy , ” Privacy International said in an explanation of its findings .
In a statement from one of its lawyers , Google said it aggressively protects its users ’ privacy and stands behind its track record .
“ We are disappointed with Privacy International ’s report , which is based on numerous inaccuracies and misunderstandings about our services , ” said Nicole Wong , Google ’s deputy general counsel .
Privacy International contacted Google earlier this month but did n’t receive a response , said Simon Davies , the group ’s director .
The scathing report is just the latest strike aimed at Google ’s privacy practices .
The company says it stockpiles data to help its search engine better understand its users so it can deliver more relevant results and advertisements .
As Google becomes more knowledgeable about the people relying on its search engine and other free services , management hopes to develop more tools that recommend activities and other pursuits that might appeal to individual users .
Privacy International is particularly troubled by Google ’s ability to match data gathered by its search engine with information collected from other services such as e-mail , instant messaging and maps .
“ Under the microscope , it turns out that Google is doing much more with our data than we ever imagined , ” Davies said .
Founded in 1990 , Privacy International said it reached its preliminary findings after spending the past six months reviewing Internet privacy practices with the help of about 30 professors , mostly in the United States and United Kingdom .
The group plans to update the report in September .
About one in 4,500 babies show ambiguous genitalia at birth , such as a clitoris that looks like a penis , or vice versa .
For the Insights story , " Going Beyond X and Y , " appearing in the June 2007 issue of Scientific American , Sally Lehrman talked with noted geneticist Eric Vilain of the University of California , Los Angeles , about the biology of sex determination , gender identity and the psychology and politics behind both .
Here is an expanded interview .
When did you first discover your interest in intersex individuals and the biology of sex development ?
I started in Paris as a medical student , and my first assignment was to a unit of pediatric endocrinology in a Paris hospital , and it was the center of reference for all of France for babies born with ambiguous genitals .
And I was actually literally shocked by the way decisions were made on these patients .
I felt it did n't rely on solid scientific evidence .
I mean , I 'm a scientist , I 'm a big believer of you can't just do things without being supported by evidence .
In this case it was more like people would say it was just common sense — if the clitoris sticks out this much , you have to fix it .
Or if the penis is really too small , it has to be bigger .
Otherwise what life is this child going to have ?
And you know , I was never convinced by common sense .
I kept asking , " How do you know ? "
There was no good answer to that .
There were a lot of patients and it was always the same discussions .
And it was mainly about clitoral reduction .
So there were sexual politics there , too ?
Yes .
I was reading at the time this book by Michel Foucault .
He has book that 's called Herculine Barbin .
He basically tells the story of this girl who clearly has a large clitoris .
She goes and gets sexually aroused as she sleeps in the bed of other girls , as it was normal for girls to do .
She goes to this religious institution for girls until eventually someone finds out , and then it 's a big scandal .
She becomes a pariah , and she ends up committing suicide .
I was reading that , I was pretty young , I was like 18 .
Defining normality has always been an obsession of mine .
How do you define what 's abnormal versus normal ?
I guess it 's the philosophical roots of the French educational system .
But why choose to study intersex questions for the rest of your career ?
My scientific inclination was excited by this because not only was it understanding a rare condition that makes people different , all of these social aspects , but also it has scientific implications in the basic biology of developing male or female .
Always in biology , you want to look at the exception to understand the general .
So understanding intersex individuals makes us understand how typical males and typical females do develop .
So what has your research overall been able to say about sex development ?
We 've identified new molecular mechanisms of sex determination .
In particular we 've discovered genes , such as WNT4 , that 's female - specific and not present in males , and that 's sort of shifted the paradigm of making a male as just activation of a bunch of male genes .
In fact it 's probably more complicated .
What we 've shown is that making a male , yes , is activating some male genes , but it 's also inhibiting some antimale genes .
It 's a much more complex network , a delicate dance between pro-male and antimale molecules .
And these antimale molecules may be pro-female , though that 's harder to prove .
It sounds as if you are describing a shift from the prevailing view that female development is a default molecular pathway to active pro-male and antimale pathways .
Are there also pro-female and antifemale pathways ?
Modern sex determination started at the end of the 1940s — 1947 — when the French physiologist Alfred Jost said it 's the testis that is determining sex .
Having a testis determines maleness , not having a testis determines femaleness .
The ovary is not sex - determining .
It will not influence the development of the external genitalia .
Now in 1959 when the karyotype of Klinefelter [ a male who is XXY ] and Turner [ a female who has one X ] syndromes was discovered , it became clear that in humans it was the presence or the absence of the Y chromosome that 's sex determining .
Because all Klinefelters that have a Y are male , whereas Turners , who have no Y , are females .
So it 's not a dosage or the number of X's , it 's really the presence or absence of the Y .
So if you combine those two paradigms , you end up having a molecular basis that 's likely to be a factor , a gene , that 's a testis - determining factor , and that 's the sex - determining gene .
So the field based on that is really oriented towards findingtestis - determining factors .
What we discovered , though , was not just pro-testis determining factors .
There are a number of factors that are there , like WNT4 , like DAX1 , whose function is to counterbalance the male pathway .
Why are genes such as WNT4 and others necessary for sex development ?
I do n't know why it 's necessary , but if they 're doing this then probably they 're here to do some fine - tuning at the molecular level .
But these antimale genes may be responsible for the development of the ovary .
And WNT4 is likely to be such a factor .
It 's an ovarian marker now , we know .
But if you have an excess of WNT4 , too much WNT4 in an XY , you 're going to feminize the XY individual .
Is the conceptual framework for sex determination changing , then , because of these discoveries ?
I think the frame has slightly changed in the sense that even though it 's still considered that the ovary is the default pathway , it 's not seen as the passive pathway .
It 's still " default " in the sense that if you do n't have the Y chromosome , if you do n't haveSRY , the ovary will develop .
[ SRY , or sex - determining region Y , encodes the so - called testis determining factor . ]
That 's probably the new thing in the past 10 years , that there are genes that are essential to make a functioning ovary .
That really has changed , and WNT4 is one of the reasons for it .
What do you feel are your group 's most important contributions to the sex biology field so far ?
The two things that we contributed was , one , to find the genes that are antimale , and reframing the view of the female pathway from passive to active .
And the second thing is in the brain .
We 're the first ones to show that there were genes involved in brain sexual differentiation , making the brain either male or female , that were active completely independently from hormones .
Those were probably our two main contributions .
Do you think this difference in gene expression in the brain explains anything about gender identity ?
About identity , it says nothing [ yet ] .
It might say something .
So those genes are differentially expressed between males and females early during development .
They 're certainly good candidates to look at to be influencing gender identity , but they 're just goodcandidates .
At a recent international meeting to discuss management of people with genital and gonadal abnormalities , you successfully pushed for a change in nomenclature .
Instead of using terms such as " hermaphrodite " or even " intersex , " you recommended that the field use specific diagnoses under the term , " disorders of sex development . "
Why did you and other geneticists feel a nomenclature change was necessary ?
For the past 15 to 16 years now , there really has been an explosion in the genetic knowledge of sex determination .
And the question being , how can we translate this genetic knowledge into clinical practice ?
So we said maybe we should have a fresh approach to this .
The initial agenda was to have a nomenclature that was robust but flexible enough to incorporate new genetic knowledge .
Then we realized there were other problems that were in fact not really genetic , but that genetics could actually answer them .
Ultimately individuals who are intersex will each have their diagnosis with a genetic name .
It 's not going to be some big , all - encompassing category , like " male hermaphrodites . "
And that 's much more scientific , it 's much more individualized , if you will .
It 's much more medical .
How did the conference participants respond to the proposal ?
The majority of health care professionals were very happy with it .
There were some , there was a conservative side that said , " Why change something that was working ? "
There was significant minority dissent that was saying , " Why do we care ? "
Because it was working , for us it's an intellectual frame that has worked .
So it required a little bit of education , saying , you know , it 's important not only because it 's more precise and it's more scientific , but also the patients would benefit from it by removing the word " hermaphrodite " and so forth .
About the change to disorders of sex development , there was no issue at all in the group .
Why is the medical emphasis of this new term problematic for some ?
The one piece in the nomenclature that remains highly controversial is the replacement of " intersex " with " disorders of sex development . "
And I 'll say a few things about that .
One is that intersex was big .
Sometimes we would n't know who to include and who not to include .
" Intersex " was vague and " disorders of sex development " at least is a very medical definition , so we know exactly what we 're talking about .
For instance , if there are chromosomal abnormalities , if you have a patient who is missing one X chromosome — Turner syndrome — or having an extra X — Klinefelter 's syndrome — both those , now wedo include them in " disorders of sexual development . "
They 're not ambiguous .
They do belong in this large category of people with " medical problems , " quote - unquote , of the reproductive system .
So intersex was vague , DSD is not vague .
What were some of the social issues you were trying to address ?
There was another issue with the old nomenclature , which was the actual word , " hermaphrodite . "
" Hermaphrodite " was perceived by adult intersex individuals as demeaning .
It also had some sexual connotation that would attract a flurry of people who have all sorts of fetishes , and so the intersex community really wanted to get rid of the term .
Cheryl Chase , executive director of the Intersex Society of North America ( ISNA ) , said she has been promoting a nomenclature change for some time .
Why ?
People like Cheryl would say intersex issues are not issues of gender identity , they are just issues of quality of life — whether early genital surgery was performed appropriately or not , and that 's really what has impaired our quality of life .
She and others at ISNA do support the change because of an interesting side effect — because it becomes a very medicalized definition , the medical science should apply .
It should apply strongly .
That means it 's not as if now we 're talking about something that 's not a disorder , that is just a normal variant , a condition .
If it 's just a condition that 's a normal condition , then there is no need for medical attention .
So basically my point of view is really , let 's separate the political from the medical , the science .
There 's a whole psychology to this , you know , the surgeons often are under the impression that there is this tiny , vocal minority of activists who just want to destroy their work .
Intersex individuals are really distinct from , for instance , the gay and lesbian community that does not have any a priori medical issue , there is no difference in the development of any of the organs , or they do n't need to see a doctor when they 're a newborn .
I think it 's quite different .
Sure , some intersex are gay or lesbians , but not all are .
Why was it necessary for intersex individuals to take an activist stance at one time ?
Because otherwise nothing would have changed in the practice .
Otherwise this consensus conference would just not have happened .
It was really in response to activism .
They put the problem on the table and it required , it really forced the medical community to address an issue that was rare enough not to be addressed .
Some have called the new term a political setback , because it pathologizes what could be seen as normal human variation .
First of all , we can call normal variants everything ; we can call cancer a normal variant .
Of course , it kills you in the end , but it is a normal variant .
We can play with words like that , but for practical purposes these " normal variants " have a lot of health risks that require lots of visits to the doctor for a bunch of issues that intersex patients have : fertility issues , cancer issues ( the testis inside the body can increase the risk of cancer ) , sexual health issues .
So if you 're to start going to the doctor a lot for your condition , you can call it a normal variant , but that 's not really useful .
You 're calling it a normal variant for political purposes .
I 'm calling it a disorder because I want all the rules and the wisdom of modern medical practices to be applied to the intersex field .
I do n't want intersex to be an exception :
To say , " Um , you know , it 's not really a disease , " so therefore [ physicians ] can do whatever they want .
That 's what has been driving this field , people saying , well , you know , we can experiment , it 's a normal variant .
There has been considerable controversy over whether surgeons should immediately make a decision about an infant 's sex and quickly correct ambiguous genitalia .
The consensus statement seems to promote a more cautious approach to surgery , while still assigning gender rapidly .
What is your view ?
I 'm saying intervene [ with surgery ] only if you 've proven that intervention is actually of benefit to the patient .
Not of benefit to the parent .
Because you know that surgery is used a lot to help the parent psychologically .
It 's a quick fix , if you will .
The child looks different , it 's very distressing for everyone , and one way to make it go away is just to make the kid look like everyone else .
And that 's really psychological help for the parents .
But that should not be a parameter for surgery .
We 're talking about psychological distress to the parents , and that should be treated appropriately by a psychologist or psychiatrist , but not by surgery of the child .
Do you think this consensus statement will change the common practice of performing sex- assignment surgery early on ?
( laughing )
Well , yes .
See , the consensus statement is a house of cards .
You build it once , and there 's no one that really inhabits it ; it can be destroyed .
They 're not guidelines .
I think it will change , but it will require some additional work .
One of the things I think should happen next is to have a few leading clinics actually apply all the consensus recommendations and then do studies showing whether they actually impact the health and the well - being of the patient .
It 's not easy to do , because some of the recommendations require money .
Like saying , " We need a psychologist " — that 's easier said than done .
There 's no funding for having a psychologist in all these clinics .
So I think it will influence some things .
For instance , the nomenclature will change .
I get a lot of phone calls and e-mails from authors of major textbooks , they 're going to change .
Also from editors of journals who publish articles about intersex , so that 's going to change .
But will that change the general outcome of patients ?
I do n't know .
I hope so .
I think it 's a step in the right direction .
Many physicians and geneticists look at intersex simply as a medical condition that should be addressed .
You seem to take patients ' social and political concerns very seriously , too .
Why ?
I 've always been interested in the fact that medicine is very normative , and reductionist — it reduces people to their pathologies .''
Medicine should be in the business of making people as a whole better , rather than just curing the disease .
And anyway , I 'm not the only one saying that .
Actually , I always use cancer as an example .
A lot of cancer doctors are very well aware of this .
They 're offering options that sometimes do not include treatment just because they 're aware of the fact that the treatment would ruin the quality of life so much that it 's just not worth it .
How do you handle working in a field that is so volatile socially and politically ?
Everything that you do , people jump on and make claims about sexuality or gender .
I interpret everything conservatively .
You have to not make the mistake of overinterpreting anything .
That 's my way of trying to navigate that .
You also have to be aware of the social sensibilities .
You can't just have an autistic approach to it and say , I 'm just going to ignore it completely .
If you 're aware of the social sensibilities , and if you do n't overinterpret your data , you 're in good shape .
How do you stay aware and informed ?
Being part of ISNA is one way [ as a member of its medical advisory board ] .
It forces me to listen to what the patients have to say , which is really not part of the medical culture , at least in this field .
The way to assess the well - being of a patient is to really listen to what the patient has to say .
Cholesterol is found in every cell of the body .
This fascinating molecule , found in rich abundance in the tastiest of foods , is the most critical component of mental function  surely one reason the State has waged its historical role on this vilified yet truly magnificent molecule , independent thought being the primary threat to its existence .
The story of the government 's war on cholesterol follows  and an argument for why cholesterol is your best weapon against the State .
Keys : The Anti-Cholesterol Interventionist
In 1953 , Ancel Keys kicked off the anti-cholesterol campaign , under the spell of which American health discourse has persisted ever since .
Keys charted a graph of six countries ' death rates from coronary heart disease ( CHD ) against their respective available amounts of dietary fat , and showed that each country fell neatly on a line demonstrating that the more fat that was available , the more deaths from heart disease that followed .
Yet Ancel Keys was not , first and foremost , an opponent of fat .
Keys was , first and foremost , a proponent of the Interventionist State .
Keys ' 1953 paper argued that the US Public Health Service was too narrow in scope , and should be expanded to the prevention of all diseases  not merely occupational and infectious diseases .
Keys wrote that , even though " direct evidence on the effect of the diet on human arteriosclerosis is very little and likely to remain so for some time , " the strength and money of the public sphere should be mobilized .
It was not the conservative principles of the scientific method that motivated him , but the rush to lay at the feet of Government any problem in sight to solve  with the competence of a drunken elephant .
The proponents of State Intervention will not stop even at burning books when the cholesterol hypothesis is threatened .
You may have thought this phenomenon belonged only to history and futuristic dystopias , but Dr. Uffe Ravnskov 's The Cholesterol Myths , has provoked the wardens of Dogma to such a degree that it was literally set on fire on national television in Finland by its opponents !
The Scientific Bankruptcy of the Anti-Cholesterol Campaign
Ever since Keys ' landmark paper , the anti-cholesterol campaign only gained strength over time , until the point where its claims were repeated so many times they would almost appear to be true .
Yet there was a fundamental flaw in Keys ' chart : while he included six countries , there were sixteen that he did n't include , for which data was available at the time .
In his masterpiece refutation of the anti-cholesterol dogma , The Cholesterol Myths , Dr. Uffe Ravnskov , MD , PhD , adds in the other data points .
Once they are included , the relationship falls to dust .
Countries with similar levels of available fat have widely varying rates of deaths due to CHD .
For example , Mexico and Finland have about the same availability of dietary fat , yet Finland is only second to the U.S. for heart disease mortality , and Mexico , with about 30 times less CHD mortality , has the lowest rate of all 22 countries .
While Keys was infatuated with the " Mediterranean Diet " and the lack of significant heart disease in Italy , it is surprising that he did n't take pause at the findings of George Mann and other researchers who found the Masai , a Kenyan cattle - herding tribe , to be free of heart disease , despite a diet consisting almost entirely of meat , blood , and milk , whose parties sometimes consist of eating four to six pounds of meat per person .
Yet to Keys it was " abundantly clear " that the mission of the Public Health Service could and should be expanded to cut the reins on America 's consumption of fat .
One of the greatest threats to science that the State poses is its monopoly of credibility .
Scientific principles are inherently anti-authoritarian .
A hypothesis must be judged on its merits , not by the identity of its author .
Yet the idea of a central , all - encompassing , " public " institution , representing some sort of mythical synthesis of all humanity , gives an authoritative stamp upon the scientific opinions of a State agency .
In The Cholesterol Myths , Dr. Ravnskov traces the entire history of the cholesterol hypothesis and refutes each of its claims .
He shows how most of the " evidence " in favor of this hypothesis can be traced back to claims in reviews which cite other reviews or studies that do not lend any support to the claim .
All too often , authors of studies will make claims in the abstract ( summary ) that their study does not support , simply to conform to the prevailing orthodoxy .
Then , other researchers will cite the claims in the abstract , rather than the findings of the study itself .
The State , of course , with its monopoly of credibility given to it and its associated Institutes , marks its stamp of approval on the cholesterol hypothesis like a drunken elephant stomps its feet , unaware of what it tramples upon .
The most outrageous misrepresentation of a study that Dr. Ravnskov demonstrates must be that of the Framingham study , where this point is amply demonstrated .
One of the most famous , largest , and often - cited studies in support of the cholesterol hypothesis is one that took place in Framingham in the 1950s .
One of the findings of the Framingham study was that when cholesterol decreased on its own , every 1 mg / dL decrease in cholesterol was met with an 11 % increase in heart disease risk .
Yet a joint statement of the American Heart Association and the National Heart , Lung and Blood Institute in their review , The Cholesterol Facts , wrote , " The results of the Framingham study indicate that a 1 % reduction . . . of cholesterol [ corresponds to a ] 2 % reduction in CHD risk . "
That 's right  they wrote the precise opposite of the relationship that was found !
Yet the credibility of the National Institutes and organizations like the AHA , which is an outgrowth of the government - enforced AMA cartel , can not be stopped .
Countless journalists , doctors , and authors have doubtlessly referenced this authoritative review , while few would be willing to dig up the original publication at a university library .
The Strong Arm of the Tax Dollar
After World War II , the scope of government 's influence in science began to expand through the creation of another layer of bureaucracy known as the peer - review system .
Yet the result brings to question how beneficial government funding of science really is .
Dr. Gilbert Ling ( PhD ) , in his critique of the peer - review system , points out that at the time large - scale peer - review began to develop , the dominant paradigm held that the progress of science was smooth and continuous , progressing in small increments , while later scholarship corrected this view , showing that scientific progress occurs in sporadic leaps .
Some may object that leaving funding to the private sphere would leave out public health concerns as well as general academic knowledge , while private interests and technologies would be over - emphasized .
Yet let us , for a moment , compare the field of computers with that of medicine and the dietary sciences .
Computer technology has progressed at light speeds , such that its products become outdated or obsolete within a few years of going to market , as evidence by the rapid price deflation that this industry has experienced .
On the other hand , with 52 years of the cholesterol hypothesis and countless billions of wasted research dollars , we have yet to be able to achieve what the penniless cattle - herders of Kenya can do merely with possession of a cow for food  achieve freedom from heart disease .
Ling 's own theory of cell physiology , the association - induction hypothesis , which holds that the water in a cell exists in " polarized multi- layers " that behave like the water in Jello , was the basis for the invention of the MRI , a medical success .
The opposing orthodoxy , which holds that cells are a sac of liquid water , has not demonstrated any such success .
Yet Ling 's research has been continually persecuted and he has been deprived of funding and facilities for his unorthodox views .
The massive amounts of money the government throws towards scientific research merely penalizes those with successful theories !
Dr. Alexei Koudinov ( MD , PhD ) has been a tireless struggler against corruption in Alzheimer 's research .
Dr. Koudinov , in his " Written Evidence to UK Parliamentary inquiry on Scientific Publications , " has accused several major scientific journals of covering up the financial conflicts of interest of several major promoters of the " amyloid hypothesis " of Alzheimer 's disease , who are involved with pharmaceutical companies .
The amyloid hypothesis holds that a protein fragment called " beta- amyloid " accumulates in the brain to form plaques that cause Alzheimer's .
The amyloid hypothesis ignores the fact that beta - amyloid is an essential brain protein , and its proponents frequently disregard scientific reasoning in order to support it .
( For a thorough discussion of this , please see my article , " Myth : Cholesterol Causes Alzheimer 's Disease . " )
Yet several of those Dr. Koudinov accuses of corruption have served on the National Institutes of Health , the National Academy of Sciences , and the Food and Drug Administration .
Thus , the result of " public " institutions like the State and its mongrel agencies reflects the reality that there is no such thing as " public , " a meaningless abstraction .
These institutions are composed of their human members , who have their own ideological biases and financial self - interests .
How does this affect researchers in the field ?
One junior researcher wrote to Dr. Koudinov :
“ I agree whole - heartedly with your letter to Science concerning Alzheimer ’s disease and the amyloid beta protein .
It is amazing how this field has been led down the “ amyloid hypothesis ” trail to the exclusion of other viable hypotheses .
If you do n’t go along with the amyloid dogma , you have difficulty publishing and extreme difficulty being funded .
The anti-intellectual , anti-science mentality displayed by many in this field has slowed progress to a crawl .
This is a shame . ”
When researchers feel a pressure to conform to a favored hypothesis , they will pursue only certain avenues and ideas , and will frequently sugar up their abstracts , introductions , and conclusions to fit the standard orthodoxy , even when the finding is precisely opposite to that orthodoxy .
As Dr. Ravnskov has shown in The Cholesterol Myths , this phenomenon has been the primary force driving the bankrupt cholesterol hypothesis of heart disease .
The increased amount of money that is available due to government intervention is actually an illusion .
The monopoly on credibility and monetary resources that the State possesses is like a canal that funnels these huge amounts of tax dollars into the toilet of unviable hypotheses , upheld by human ideological stubbornness and private interests , leading into a common septic tank where it shares lodging with countless billions of tax dollars funneled in from other government pursuits .
State Intervention : The Results
The results of the last half - century 's public health recommendations have been dismal .
Honest farming industries have been hurt , our diets have been turned from rich and enjoyable cuisines to bland and tasteless fake food , and we have become guilty when we eat the things we like .
The demonization of the egg yolk for its rich cholesterol content has caused many people to abandon eggs as a highly nutritious and healthful staple , and others to discard the yolk in favor of consuming the white .
If you do n't know what an egg white omelet tastes like , consider yourself blissfully ignorant .
As I demonstrate in my article , The Incredible , Edible Egg Yolk , the absurdity of discarding egg yolks from a health perspective is shown by the fact that the yolk contains nearly all the nutrition in an egg .
Egg whites serve almost no nutritional purpose , contrary to their companion super - food , the yolk .
And one must consider the health consequences of being chronically deprived of tasteful food .
Dr. Ravnskov describes the beginnings of the anti-cholesterol campaign in Sweden , which occurred much more recently than in the U.S.
When those with high cholesterol levels were notified that they were supposedly at risk for a heart attack , many patients reported shock and fright .
One reacted as if she was " almost paralyzed . "
He cites a Gallup poll showing that 56 % of Americans worry about fat and cholesterol , 45 % think that the food they like is not good for them , and 36 % feel guilty when they eat food they like .
The fruits of the State 's war on cholesterol have not been the abolition of heart disease , but the sowing of seeds of self - doubt and guilt .
What better way to subdue a population , than to have its members constantly feeling like they cannot live up to the noble standards of their Government ?
A War on Cholesterol Is a War on the People
Why is the war on cholesterol of such benefit to the government , despite being bankrupt as a scientific theory ?
The State relies on a submissive population  one in which the individuals do not think for themselves , and preferably do not think at all .
It is no surprise then , that a molecule that plays such a central role in the brain would become the primary target of government .
The brain makes up only 2 % of the body 's weight , yet it consists of a full 25 % of the body 's cholesterol !
The importance of cholesterol to mental function is enormous .
Cholesterol was discovered in 2001 to be the limiting factor in the formation of synapses , which are the connections between neurons , or nerve cells .
A more recent study found that extracting some of the cholesterol from the cell membrane of a neuron causes a loss of functioning of signaling proteins that tell the neurons what direction to grow in , so they can make the proper type of connections .
And , Dr. Iwo J. Bohr has hypothesized that a contributing factor to Alzheimer 's disease is a deficiency of cholesterol in the membranes of brain cells .
Big Business Bed Buddies — Agricultural Subsidies
It does n't stop here .
Big Government 's notorious love affair with Big Business has intimate ties to the cholesterol hypothesis .
Big Government prefers Big Business over small businesses because larger businesses are fewer in number .
How can a population largely consisting of independent self - managers be harnessed into sufficient submissiveness to bow down to the State ?
Conversely , a small number of large businesses can enter into co-management of the society , as government enforces their cartels and monopolies , and transfers wealth into their hands .
The grain and soy industries are much more conglomerated than the beef industry .
More importantly , animal products have a long history of providing independent sustenance to even poor people .
In early 19th century rural New England , for example , even the poorer people tended to own a small piece of land with one or two cows that provided meat and milk products .
A small mixed farm can provide a full dietary range at a smaller size than could a grain - based farm .
A garden , pasture , and animals can co-exist closely , whereas grains would be ridiculously inefficient to harvest unless they were planted as a large , consolidated crop .
Additionally , hunting animals allows for the independent procurement of food .
Public health recommendations capable of making a monolithic shift in the food supply toward wheat , corn , and soybeans result in an overall decrease in the independence of the population .
Additionally , the State - created cartel of subsidy receivers is heavily biased in favor of grain products .
According to this breakdown , between 1995 and 2003 , $ 8.5 billion in U.S. subsidies went to growers of plant - based food crops , while only $ 5.5 million went to animal products , which means that over 99 % of agricultural food subsidies go to plant products .
The largest 10 % of subsidized farms received 72 % of subsidies , but a full 60 % were not subsidized at all .
As Brian Riedl points out , the $ 360,000 per year cap on farm subsidies is easy for large farms to pull loopholes through : Tyler Farms of Arkansas collected almost $ 32 million in farm subsidies between 1996 and 2001 by dividing its farm into 66 individual " corporations . "
Not only has the cholesterol hypothesis helped consolidate the government 's ties to the agricultural industry through a shift in the diet away from animal foods and towards plant foods , but doubtlessly the massive level of soy subsidies  soy is the fifth most subsidized crop  has contributed to a surplus to be disposed of , whose result has been the manufacturing of a massive myth that this odd - tasting , highly estrogenic bean is a " health food . "
Big Business Bed Buddies — The Pharmaceutical Companies
Now that the newest class of cholesterol - lowering drugs , statins , has become a bonanza of profits for Big Pharma , new cholesterol guidelines are promoted , and new junk theories about cholesterol 's relationship to various diseases are being manufactured , to maximize the profit - potential of these drugs by classifying nearly every member of society as a candidate for drug therapy .
Not far behind are the ugly claws of the State ready to abuse the population to enhance these profiteers .
According to this article :
" Fluoride in drinking water is a topic to raise the hackles of those doubting its dental benefits and resenting its addition to the public water supply .
Meanwhile the water additive plot thickens as doctors in England debate whether drinking water might be used to administer cholesterol - lowering drugs to the public in an effort to reduce incidents of cardiovascular disease , the biggest cause of death in the United Kingdom . "
If your fluoridated and chlorinated municipal water supply was n't toxic enough , you may just be a victim of theft in the coming future : the unwilling robbery of cholesterol from your cells , and an extra hit in the wallet to finance the addition of expensive drugs to your water .
Thanks to private enterprise , bottled water will ( hopefully ) still be available .
It is telling that the doctor cited in this article as advocating water - treatment with statins was named " Dr. John Reckless . "
The most preposterous new cholesterol theory blames Alzheimer 's disease on high brain cholesterol .
In my article , Myth : Cholesterol Causes Alzheimer 's Disease , I quote a researcher who was ecstatic that his group was able to reduce normal levels of brain cholesterol in Alzheimer 's patients by over 20 % !
The theory , of course , has no basis in science whatsoever .
As the above article discusses , cholesterol appears to be protective against Alzheimer 's , and the only diet that , based on a sound scientific foundation , shows promise to Alzheimer 's treatment is the super - high - fat ketogenic diet , which was first used to successfully treat epilepsy at the famed Mayo clinic in the 1920s .
In Part II of this article , I demonstrate how a deficiency of DHA , a nutrient found exclusively in animal products ( with the exception of some forms of algae ) , especially cholesterol - rich egg yolks ( from chickens raised on pasture ) , has been demonstrated to play a causal role in Alzheimer 's , as well as insulin resistance , which could be brought on by a diet excessively high in carbohydrates  derived from plant foods .
One more ( fake ) reason for the government to take your money and put statins in your water to return the favor .
And what a grand coincidence that a massive increase in the demand for pharmaceuticals means a massive increase in the demand for Federal prescription drug benefits .
But We Can't Just Do Nothing !
Finally , the State profits from the cholesterol hypothesis simply because it offers the State one more massive campaign in which it can engage .
The State , were it to stand idly by and do nothing , would deteriorate .
If the State was n't active , for what purpose would it exist ?
And if there is nothing to fix , as a mere matter of self - sustenance , it must create a problem to solve .
The State 's philosophy is " If it ai n't broke  break it ! "
The quantity of money that has been poured into researching the cholesterol hypothesis and public health campaigns to hook the public on an unsatisfying , bland , and tasteless diet piles the drunken elephant that thieves that money over its head .
The State derives its sustenance from taxing and spending , like it is the one form of human relationship who was born with a terminal birth defect , requiring an insatiable appetite to fuel its exponential growth  and eventual death through implosion .
This is especially true in a democracy , where the frequency with which a political leader must prove her - or himself , through restless legislative activity , is increased to a level that induces continuous expansion .
You do not get elected in a democracy by making promises to ride the waves and wait for a problem to arise .
Cholesterol Is Your Best Weapon Against the State
The State makes war on cholesterol because it is your best defense against that State :
Cholesterol empowers independent thought by strengthening mental capabilities
Relieving oneself of the notion that cholesterol causes heart disease increases financial independence from pharmaceutical companies and the State , through whom the pharmaceutical companies receive their wealth redistribution
Cholesterol - rich animal foods are more conducive to a more numerous farming population , where small and community - centered can still mean successful
Eating a fulfilling , rich , and tasteful diet without dropping down in guilt before the State encourages ones emotional independence
In truth , to be anti-cholesterol is to be pro-State ; to be anti-State  that , dear reader , is to be pro-cholesterol .

The Best of Chris Masterjohn
Canadians who purchase digital music players and removable memory cards should have to pay an extra tax , according to the Copyright Board of Canada .
The decision ( PDF ) stated that the proposed levy , originally suggested by the Canadian Private Copyright Collective ( CPCC ) , followed the intent of the country 's Copyright Act and Parliament and therefore such a tariff could be enacted .
The decision comes after a series of back - and - forth arguments between the CPCC , the Canadian Storage Media Alliance ( CSMA ) , and the Retail Council of Canada ( RCC ) .
In February of this year , the CPCC asked the Copyright Board to increase the levy on recordable CDs and to add removable media , such as SD cards , to the list .
Also part of that request were iPods and other digital music players .
" We 'd all like lots of things to be free .
But those who create the music deserve to be compensated .
When you go and buy an iPod , the retailer gets paid .
So you can't say that the people who make the music should get a free ride , " CPCC board of directors member David Basskin argued at the time .
The proposal sparked a flurry of motions from the CSMA and RCC arguing against the proposal , saying that Canada 's Federal Court had already ruled that such a levy fell outside of the Copyright Act .
The groups also said that the Copyright Board did not have jurisdiction to decide on the case either way , but those calls fell on deaf ears and the Copyright Board went ahead with the hearings on the levy in June .
The Copyright Board 's decision now not only gives the go - ahead to the " iPod tax , " it also makes some worrying statements regarding potential levies on other everyday electronics .
As the University of Ottawa 's research chair of Internet and e-commerce Law , Michael Geist , observed on his blog , the Copyright Board acknowledged a point brought up by the CSMA that phones and computers could also become leviable because they also happen to have the ability , among other things , to store audio files .
" We see no inherent problem with this scenario , " reads the Copyright Board 's decision .
" A thing that is ordinarily used by individual consumers to make private copies should not be excluded from the private copying regime for the sole reason that it has other uses .
Indeed , all media that are currently subject to the levy can be used for purposes other than private copying . "
If such a levy were to go into law , Canadians who wish to buy iPods , Zunes , and other digital music players will have to pay an extra fee on top of the price of the device simply for having the option of using it as an audio player .
But the ruling has far - reaching implications .
Essentially , the board is claiming that anything with the capacity to store digital data has the potential to hold music and can be taxed accordingly .
Plus , there 's the underlying assumption that users are stealing the music they 're listening to , which is the purpose of the levy in the first place if what Basskin says is true .
Whether the levy will actually be implemented remains to be seen , but worried Canadians should plan their media player purchases soon if they want to avoid paying extra .
A beautiful example of the power of the next trigger took place at the airport in Maui , Hawaii , in 1998 .
I was on United Airlines flight 49 to San Francisco .
When I arrived at the gate to board , I noticed a few people asking for their money back at the check - in desk .
I also observed that the waiting lounge was quite crowded .
When I approached one of the ground personnel at the gate to inquire what was happening , I was told that there was a part on the plane that was n’t working and that nobody could board the airplane .
“ We ca n’t even fix the part and we even have to keep the passengers off the plane while it is being fueled , ” was the reply .
Then the ground person picked up the microphone and made the following statement , “ Ladies and gentlemen .
The pilot is too busy doing his final flight check to explain what is wrong with the airplane .
He mentioned that if anybody wanted to get off the plane , they may do so . ”
At this point , there was a rush of passengers — maybe 20 of them — running up to the
counter to cancel their tickets and get off the airplane .
“ Whew , ” I thought , “ what ’s going on ? ”
The rest of the passengers ’ faces showed great concern in the wake of the announcement .
I asked the man who had just made the announcement , “ What actually is wrong ? ”
“ It ’s the APU or EPU or something like that and it ’s broke so we have to keep the airplane running and people are thinking that this part will affect their safety .
And the pilot wo n’t step out of the cockpit to say anything . ”
I looked at the frustrated man and said , “ May I make an announcement ?
I ’m a pilot . ”
He looked at me , almost relieved , and handed me the microphone .
“ Go ahead . ”
“ Ladies and gentlemen , may I have your attention ? ” I announced as the entire lounge
hushed to silence .
“ I ’m a passenger on this flight just as you are .
But I ’m also a pilot and I think I can shed a little light on what is happening .
When the airplane taxis into the gate , to conserve fuel it is plugged into another electrical power source .
Somebody runs up to the airplane and plugs this huge plug into the belly of the airplane .
That plug is from an APU or ‘ auxiliary power unit . ’
The plug is the APU plug .
“ Apparently the APU is not functioning , so the ground crew must keep the engines running while they fuel the tanks .
By law , you ca n’t board the plane while it is being fueled if the engines are running .
“ There is nothing wrong with the plane .
It is perfectly safe .
In fact , the pilots are bigger chickens than any of us passengers and wo n’t fly this ship if it does n’t check out perfectly .
“ You can feel perfectly safe flying this plane .
Like I said , I ’m a passenger just like you are and I do n’t work for United either .
But I do know that you ’ll have a safe flight to San Francisco .
Thank you . ”
At that moment the entire lounge burst out in applause .
Relief came across the faces of those concerned passengers who a few minutes ago did n’t know what to do .
And the line of passengers waiting at the counter to cancel their flights just filtered away .
A few of the flight attendants came up to me and thanked me , “ You really provided us with incredible damage control . ”
And one passenger commented , “ I do n’t know what you do , but whatever it is you should be in communications . ”
I had just saved United Airlines thousands of dollars in canceled reservations .
I had saved a lot of passengers from plenty of worry and concern and had helped the ground personnel straighten out a confusing situation .
As a result of the power of my credibility , I was able to totally turn around the attitude of the passengers .
Credibility is indeed a powerful trigger .
If you convey honesty and integrity in your message , chances are you ’ve gone a long way toward establishing your credibility .
However credibility is not just honesty and integrity .
Credibility is being believable .
When I got up there to make my announcement , I was a pilot and a passenger who had knowledge to share .
I was credible .
The pilot would have been , too , but he was n’t available .
The ground personnel were not knowledgeable and thus created a near - calamity .
Credibility also means truthfulness .
Does the consumer really believe you ?
Rash
statements , clichés , and some exaggerations will remove any credibility your offer might have had .
One of the biggest factors that can affect credibility is not resolving all the objections that are raised in your prospects ’ minds so that they think you ’re hiding something or avoiding an obvious fault of the product or service .
You need to raise all objections and resolve them .
You are , in essence , sensing the next question the prospect may come up with and
answering it in a straightforward , honest , and credible way .
The integrity of your product , your offer , and your self are all on the line , and unless you convey the highest credibility in your presentation , your prospects will not feel comfortable buying from you .
When I appear on QVC — the TV home shopping channel — it is easy to sell a difficult
product that normally would require a lot of credibility .
The reason : QVC already has a lot of credibility with its customers .
If a product is being offered on QVC , it must be good .
It must have the quality that customers have come to expect .
Chances are the product will be bought by somebody who has bought product from QVC before and already feels that the company is a very credible concern .
In short , I ’ve piggy - backed my product onto QVC ’s credibility , and the combination of QVC ’s credibility and my product ’s credibility is pretty powerful .
The effect of credibility also extends to the magazines or newspapers in which I advertise .
If I advertise my product in The Wall Street Journal , I am piggy - backing onto their credibility and their constant vigilance , making sure their readers are n’t being taken advantage of .
On the other hand , if I placed that same ad in the National Enquirer , I take on the credibility — or lack thereof — that this publication has established with readers .
Again , credibility is affected by the environment in which you are selling .
The same holds true in a personal selling situation .
You can also enhance credibility through the use of a brand - name product .
For example , if I ’m offering an electronic product by the name of Yorx with the exact same features as one whose brand name is Sony , which one has more credibility ?
The Sony would probably sell better even if it were at a higher price .
Adding an appropriate celebrity endorser is another effective way to enhance credibility .
The name of a company can , too .
There was a company by the name of The Tool Shack that sold computers .
This company ’s name actually detracted from the credibility of the product they were selling .
We once ran the same ad in The Wall Street Journal to test the effect of our JS&A brand name against one of our lesser known names — Consumers Hero .
In the test , the JS&A ad far outpulled our other ad .
Only the name of the company was different .
Sometimes a city or state can add credibility .
That ’s why some companies locate in larger cities .
If I were in publishing , I would want my offices in New York City — the publishing capital of the world .
If I was marketing a perfume , I would want offices in London , Paris , New York , and Beverly Hills .
If I had to go in for brain surgery , I would want a top brain surgeon with impressive
credentials — not somebody who walks in with a book entitled Brain Surgery for Dummies .
The credentials , the top people , and even the spokesperson for a company are all important in establishing credibility .
One of the techniques I used in my mail order ads to build credibility was inserting a
technical explanation to add a certain expertise to my advertising message .
A good example of this technique is the following caption , which I wrote for a picture of the integrated circuit in a watch :
A pin points to the new decoder / driver integrated circuit which takes the input from
the oscillator countdown integrated circuit and computes the time while driving the
display .
This single space - age device replaces thousands of solid - state circuits and
provides the utmost reliability — - all unique to Sensor .
Very few people would be able to understand this technical commentary .
In fact , when I sent the ad to the manufacturer for approval , he called my attention to the caption under the picture and said , “ What you wrote there is correct but who is going to understand it ?
Why did you even use it ? ”
Providing a technical explanation which the reader may not understand shows that we really did our research — if we say it ’s good , knowing what we know , then it must be good .
It gives the buyer confidence that he or she is indeed dealing with an expert .
( Incidentally , the watch was one of our best - selling products . )
The product does not have to be a very technical product for you to come up with a
technical explanation .
For example , Frank Schultz wrote an ad after he had attended my seminar .
How simple a commodity is grapefruit ?
Yet in the ad , he talked about his quality control procedures and how he wo n’t accept grapefruit that had “ sheep nose , ” which he defined as having a bulge on the stem .
He was able to include a technical explanation about grapefruit to demonstrate his expertise .
In a mail order ad or in person , technical explanations can add a great deal of credibility , but you must make sure that you indeed become an expert , and your statements must be accurate .
If not , the consumer will see right through the ploy .
This technique could be equally effective in a sales presentation if it is used to establish the credibility and expertise of the salesperson and if the material presented is relevant to the sale .
However , using this technique just for the sake of using it may have a countereffect and reduce your credibility .
And Overuse of technical explanations will only put distance between you and the prospect as the prospect may glaze over and quickly enter a daydream state .
There are a lot of ways to add credibility , and realizing this is important when you ’re crafting your sales presentation and creating the selling environment for your product .
Use the methods explained here as a checklist to determine which techniques make sense for what you are selling , and then use them discreetly .
They are indeed very powerful when included in a well - crafted sales presentation .

increase in the number of available troops and American military volunteers
Victory in Iraq is still possible at an acceptable level of effort .
We must adopt a new approach to the war and implement it quickly and decisively .
. . .
This approach requires a national commitment to victory in Iraq :
. . .
The president must request a substantial increase in ground forces end strength .
This increase is vital to sustaining the morale of the combat forces by ensuring that relief is on the way .
The president must issue a personal call for young Americans to volunteer to fight in the decisive conflict of this generation .
CBS ’s David Martin has learned military commanders told the President they could execute a ‘ troop surge ’ of 9,000 soldiers and Marines into Iraq , with another 10,000 on alert in Kuwait and the U.S .
Washington Post
We need to cut through the confusion .
Bringing security to Baghdad -- the essential precondition for political compromise , national reconciliation and economic development -- is possible only with a surge of at least 30,000 combat troops lasting 18 months or so .
Any other option is likely to fail .

particularly where
One of the two principal architects of the " surge " strategy about to be adopted by the President is Frederick Kagan of the American Enterprise Institute .
He recently appeared at an AEI event with the other surge architect , Ret. Gen. Jack Keane ( along with surge advocates Sens. McCain and Lieberman ) , to detail and defend his plan .
Kagan thereafter issued an " Executive Summary " to accompany a report detailing what the " surge " plan requires in order to succeed ( h/t Chasm ) .
Kagan makes it absolutely clear that anis critical to the success of the surge specifically , and for " victory " in the war in Iraq generally , and he therefore emphasizes how urgent it is for more Americans to enlist in the military if we are to Win :
The reason for Kagan 's plea for more Americans to enlist is clear .
We simply do not have the available troops to sustain the glorious Churchillian war plans for those who want to take a resolute , militaristic stance against Islamofacism .
In fact -- according to the U.S. military itself -- we do not even have close to enough troops to sustain Kagan 's " surge " plan , let alone the broader regional war which our great domestic warriors are urging : Regardless of disputes over specific numbers , Kagan is making clear that " Victory " in Iraq requires that more American volunteers to fight .
According to Kagan and Keane 's Op - Ed advocating their surge plan : According to the surge planners , a failure to provide30,000 troops will doom the U.S. to defeat in Iraq , but we do not have the troops to send .
Both this Op - Ed , as well as Kagan 's new report , leavethat a shortage of willing warriors is a real impediment to American War Victory , and that Victory over the Terrorists -- as this worldview sees it -- requires that more " young Americans " volunteer to fight .
As I 've pointed out before , I do n't personally subscribe to the view , expressed as aproposition , that there is something immoral or illogical about supporting a war that you do n't volunteer to fight in yourself .
As the overwhelming support for the invasion of Afghanistan demonstrates , that is a standard to which most Americans do not adhere ( since most supported that invasion without volunteering to fight ) .
Broad support for military action in Kosovo under the Clinton administration demonstrates the same proposition .
It is true that where there is an amply stocked volunteer military , it is natural and inevitable that many citizens will support a war in ways other than by enlisting .
No additional troops were needed , for instance , at the time of the invasion of Afghanistan ( or during the action in Kosovo ) , and there was thus no tension between supporting those wars and not fighting .
But the current situation is completely different .
Even according to the war 's remaining advocates -- particularly those who want to escalate in Iraq -- there is a serious and harmful shortage of willing volunteers to fight in Iraq and to enable a more aggressive application of U.S. military force generally .
So wenow have a situation where those who are cheering on more war and escalation really are needed not at the computer screen but on the battlefield , in combat .
And their refusal to fight is actually impeding the plans of those on whom the President is relying for " Victory .
"
As a result , it is now morally indefensible for those who are physically able to do so to advocate a " surge , " or even ongoing war in Iraq , without either volunteering to fight or offering a good reason why they are not doing so .
One of the war 's key architects is sending out a desperate plea for volunteers in order to enable the U.S. to achieve " Victory " in Iraq .
How can those who believe in the premise and cheer it on -- all the while depicting themselves as strong and resolute -- possibly justify not taking the necessary action to enable the U.S. to " win " ?
As Kagan put it :
In light of the current troop shortages impeding Kagan 's plans -- to say nothing of plans for confronting other countries and Terrorists beyond Iraq -- how can those who strut around as Churchillian defenders of American greatness in the face of Evil possibly justify their ongoing refusal of this call ?
The World War II values they are constantly invoking in order to justify endless war were n't defined by war cheerleaders but by war fighters . :
Following these premises , it seems one could construct a univerally applicable ( and self - evidently reasonable ) definition of " cowardice " as follows :
What basis exists for objecting to that definition ?
As I indicated , the fact that the war options of the U.S. are now clearly limited by troop shortages renders most of the standard responses to the " chicken hawk " claim inapplicable .
And just to be clear : the term " unique and compelling excuse " most assuredly does not include " justifications " such as this one infamously offered by one youngish , prominent public warrior ( who , to his credit , at least addressed the issue , unlike most of his fellow war cheerleaders ) : " I 'm 35 years old , my family could n't afford the lost income , I have a baby daughter . "
There is nothing " unique " about that excuse since most people who have volunteered undoubtedly have people at home who would be better off with them some place other than a war zone in Iraq .
A " unique and compelling excuse " would be , for instance , physical incapacity .
One true test for whether a war is justified and necessary is whether the citizens of a country are willing to sacrifice for the war .
The fact that so few people seem willing to do so for Iraq ( let alone into Iran , Syria and Beyond ) is compelling evidence ( not conclusive , but certainly persuasive ) that this war is neither . :
The Bush family itself really is a perfect microcosm of this whole dynamic .
As Jay Ackroyd points out , the President 's father fought in World War II despite being the son of a wealthy and powerful U.S. Senator .
Yet none of the multiple Bush family members who are of prime fighting age are fighting in our Epic War of Civilizations against Islamofascism .
That includes not only the President 's two children , but also Jeb Bush 's three children -- " Jebby , " 22 , Noelle , 29 , and George P. , 31 .
In particular , George P. has been marketed as the next great Republican Bush leader .
He was glorified byas being a " container of JFK Jr. charisma and machismo . "
To highlight the " machismo " part , he posed in a denim jacket , riding a horse on a Texas ranch .
But George P. , who envisions a political career for himself ( thearticle touted him as " the Heir Apparent " ) , certainly meets all of the criteria set forth above for " cowardice , " as does most , if not all , of the Bush family members of his generation .
Why is his " machismo " being applied tophoto shoots rather than the " surge " in Baghdad -- a key part of what Kagan calls " the decisive conflict of this generation " (?
Again , the troop shortage we face makes that question far more urgent than ever before -- not as applied to George P. specifically , but to all able - bodied , non-volunteering war advocates . :
In Comments , Diana Powe underscores the paramont point here : " I think the most important point to be made in all this for opponents of the war is not to label this or that war advocate as a coward , but to throw into absolutely sharp relief the fact that the war advocates simply do n't believe their own arguments for why Iraq and Afghanistan are the ' decisive conflict of this generation . ' "
That is particularly true of those who perceive and want " the war " to extend beyond Afghanistan and Iraq .
She also observes : " It will be quite interesting to see how President Bush speaks to this issue of volunteerism and sacrifice given his own questionable credentials in this area . "
That is a difficult problem to navigate .
Incidentally , John McCain shares Kagan 's view that more volunteers are needed for the U.S. to grasp Victory in the War. : Via James Raven this cartoon by Tom Tomorrow yet again provides the perfect illustration of this sad dynamic .
Relatedly , it appears that Fred Kagan himself ( who graduated college in 1991 ) , along with his equally pro-war brother Robert , are both young enough to enlist .
It 's particularly confounding to listen to Kagan 's demand that others sacrifice by enlisting while he does not do so himself .
By contrast , and to his credit , McCain 's call for more troops may very well result in his own son being deployed to Baghdad . :
Despite my best efforts to make clear that I am not advancing the standard , generic " chicken hawk " argument here ( but rather am predicating the argument on Kagan 's emphasis that a shortage of American volunteers may very well cause America to lose the " war " -- both in Iraq and more broadly ) , both James Joyner and McQ posted responses which treated the argument as such .
They each raise the same response , via analogies which are all similar to Joyner 's argument that " one can simultaneously and without hypocrisy want fires put out without becoming a firefighter . "
McQ makes the same argument using those who support education but do not become teachers ( this blogger also makes the same argument ) .
That response would be valid if I had asserted the generic " chicken hawk " claim as they describe it -- that , as a general proposition , anyone who supports the war must fight in it .
Not only did I not argue that , but I expressly repudiated that view .
That makes their analogies plainly inapplicable , because in the cases they describe , nobody is arguing that the fate of the Republic is threatened by a shortage of people willing to do those jobs .
By stark contrast , Kagan and many others are claiming that America 's ability to win " the war " is now threatened by the failure of more Americans to volunteer for military service .
Thus , for those who believe that " victory " in the " war " ( in Iraq or against " Islamofacism " ) is necessary for America to survive as we know it , a shortage of volunteers is threatening America 's ability to exist -- or , as some of the even more shrill hysterics claim , Western civilization itself .
That creates an entirely different set of imperatives than the mundane analogies they raise .
is the whole point .
To take Joyner 's fireman example , if a person : ( a ) were arguing vociferously that the threat of unmanaged fires posed a danger to the Republic 's existence and to civilization as we knew it , and containing them therefore outweighed all other issues , and ( b ) experts accepted as such by that person urgently warned that the fires have become impossible to contain -- and that the fate of our country is therefore seriously threatened -- due to a severe shortage of willing fire fighters , then , self - evidently , it would be natural and entirely legitimate to demand of that person a response as to whyis not acting to confront the fire threat , given thatcharacterizes that threat as civilization - endangering and more important than all others .
Under those circumstances , it would be reasonable -- one might even say necessary ( in the absence of a compelling excuse ) -- to conclude that such a person was either ( a ) too afraid to fight fires or ( b ) disingenuous about his claimed belief that the failure to contain the fires really has the urgency for civilization that he claims it has .
After all , if hebelieved that Western civilization or freedom or the fate of the country depended upon a successful outcome , then it would be expected that he himself would sacrifice in order to succeed , a volunteer shortage is likely to lead to defeat .
And if he did not do so , cowardice or a lack of authentic belief in the goal 's supreme importance would be the most likely -- probably the only -- coherent explanations .

The fate of reduce ( ) in Python 3000
by Guido van van Rossum
March 10 , 2005
Summary
I received an email from a compatriot lamenting the planned demise of reduce ( ) and lambda in Python 3000 .
After a few exchanges I think even he agreed that they can go .
Here 's a summary , including my reasons for dropping lambda , map ( ) and filter ( ) .
I expect tons of disagreement in the feedback , all from ex - Lisp - or - Scheme folks . :-)

About 12 years ago , Python aquired lambda , reduce ( ) , filter ( ) and map ( ) , courtesy of ( I believe ) a Lisp hacker who missed them and submitted working patches .
But , despite of the PR value , I think these features should be cut from Python 3000 .
Update : lambda , filter and map will stay ( the latter two with small changes , returning iterators instead of lists ) .
Only reduce will be removed from the 3.0 standard library .
You can import it from functools .
I think dropping filter ( ) and map ( ) is pretty uncontroversial ; filter ( P , S ) is almost always written clearer as [ x for x in S if P( x ) ] , and this has the huge advantage that the most common usages involve predicates that are comparisons , e.g. x==42 , and defining a lambda for that just requires much more effort for the reader ( plus the lambda is slower than the list comprehension ) .
Even more so for map ( F , S ) which becomes [ F ( x ) for x in S ] .
Of course , in many cases you'd be able to use generator expressions instead .
Why drop lambda ?
Most Python users are unfamiliar with Lisp or Scheme , so the name is confusing ; also , there is a widespread misunderstanding that lambda can do things that a nested function can't -- I still recall Laura Creighton 's Aha !- erlebnis after I showed her there was no difference !
Even with a better name , I think having the two choices side - by - side just requires programmers to think about making a choice that 's irrelevant for their program ; not having the choice streamlines the thought process .
Also , once map ( ) , filter ( ) and reduce ( ) are gone , there are n't a whole lot of places where you really need to write very short local functions ;
Tkinter callbacks come to mind , but I find that more often than not the callbacks should be methods of some state - carrying object anyway ( the exception being toy programs ) .
So now reduce ( ) .
This is actually the one I 've always hated most , because , apart from a few examples involving + or * , almost every time I see a reduce ( ) call with a non-trivial function argument , I need to grab pen and paper to diagram what 's actually being fed into that function before I understand what the reduce ( ) is supposed to do .
So in my mind , the applicability of reduce ( ) is pretty much limited to associative operators , and in all other cases it 's better to write out the accumulation loop explicitly .
There are n't a whole lot of associative operators .
( Those are operators X for which ( a X b ) X c equals a X ( b X c ) . )
I think it 's just about limited to + , * , & , | , ^ , and shortcut and / or . We already have sum ( ) ; I 'd happily trade reduce ( ) for product ( ) , so that takes care of the two most common uses .
The bitwise operators are rather specialized and we can put fast versions in a library module if there 's demand ; for shortcut booleans I have the following proposal .
Let 's add any ( ) and all ( ) to the standard builtins , defined as follows ( but implemented more efficiently ) :
def any ( S ) : for x in S : if x : return True return False def all ( S ) : for x in S : if not x : return False return True
Combine these with generator expressions , and you can write things like these : :
any (x > 42 for x in S ) #
True if any elements of S are > 42 all( x != 0 for x in S ) #
True if all elements if S are nonzero
This will mostly give us back the quantifiers from ABC : ABC's IF EACH x IN s HAS p( x ) : becomes if all ( p( x ) for x in s ) : , its IF SOME x IN s HAS p( x ) : becomes if any ( p( x ) for x in s ) : , and IF NO x IN s HAS p( x ) : becomes if not any ( p( x ) for x in s ) : .
( Except that in ABC , the variables would be bound and usable inside the IF block ; if you need that in Python you 'll have to write an explicit for loop and use a break statement . )
I expect that even if you disagree with dropping reduce ( ) , you will agree that adding any ( ) and all ( ) is a good idea -- maybe even for Python 2.5 !

Scientists say such research is essential
But scientists wanting to use hybrids will still need to make individual applications , the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority said .
An HFEA consultation showed the public were " at ease " with the idea when told it could pave the way for therapies for conditions such as Alzheimer 's disease .
Opponents have said many people would be " horrified " by such a move .
WHAT HAPPENS ELSEWHERE ?
Australia - Embryos allowed to be created for research , but human - animal hybrids banned .
The only exception is to test the quality of sperm Canada - Legislation bans the creation of human- animal embryos US - Federal funds can only be used for research involving pre-existing embryos - such as those left over from fertility treatment - and there is a ban on hybrid embryos Elsewhere - Other countries do not specifically legislate on hybrid embryos .
But Italy and Germany only allow the use of pre-existing embryos and many others including Austria , Norway and Tunisia do not allow embryo research at all
Scientists want to create hybrid embryos by merging human cells with animal eggs in a bid to extract stem cells .
The embryos would then be destroyed within 14 days .
The cells form the basic building blocks of the body and have the potential to become any tissue , making them essential for research .
At the moment , scientists have to rely on human eggs left over from fertility treatment , but they are in short supply and are not always good quality .
Two teams from Kings College London and Newcastle University have already applied to the HFEA to use hybrid embryos .
It is now expected individual hearings for these two applications will be held in November with other scientists expected to follow suit .
Reversed decision
Dr Stephen Minger , of King 's College London , said he " applauded " the HFEA for its decision as it was the only ethically justifiable option if scientists were to push forward with their research .
Lyle Armstrong , of Newcastle University , added : " This is excellent news .
It is a positive outcome not just for our work but for the progress of British science in general and we hope that this will lead to new technologies to benefit everyone . "
And he also said : " It does seem a little abhorrent at first analysis , but you have to understand we are using very , very little information from the cow in order to do this reprogramming idea .
" It 's not our intention to create any bizarre cow - human hybrid , we want to use those cells to understand how to make human stem cells better . "
Our top - class researchers can now proceed with their applications to conduct this world - leading research
Dr Evan Harris
Lib Dem MP
Send us your comments
Lib Dem MP Dr Evan Harris , a member of the Commons ' science and technology committee , which has already given its backing to such research , said : " Our top - class researchers can now proceed with their applications to conduct this world - leading research . "
And Dr Tony Calland , chairman of the British Medical Assocition 's ethics committee , said it could lead to " major breakthroughs in treatments for Alzheimer 's , Parkinson 's and other serious diseases " .
The HFEA decision comes amid government moves to lay down regulations covering such research - the law governing embryo research is out of date and does not cover the issue .
The government originally proposed banning the technique in a white paper last year .
But it reversed its decision this year in a bill which indicated ministers were minded to allow hybrid embryos which were 99.9 % human and 0.1 % animal , following a backlash by scientists and patient groups .
But the HFEA has carried out its own review ahead of parliament passing the legislation so as not to hold back research .
The regulator can grant licences to scientists to pursue such research , but will have to change its criteria if future rules contradicted its own practices .
Dignity
Anthony Ozimic , secretary of pro-life group the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children ( SPUC ) said he " deplored " the HFEA 's decision .
" This is not just a case of the ' yuk ' factor - there are grave ethical and moral objections to this research and the way it is being promoted . "
Using hybrid embryos has never been acceptable - it offends the dignity of humans and animals
Josephine Quintavalle
Comment on Reproductive Ethics
And Josephine Quintavalle , of the campaign group Comment on Reproductive Ethics , said the HFEA was wrong to be pushing ahead with a decision which should be left to parliament .
" Using hybrid embryos has never been acceptable - it offends the dignity of humans and animals . "
A spokeswoman for the HFEA said the decision had been a challenging one to reach .
" This is not a total green light for hybrid research , but recognition that this area of research can , with caution and careful scrutiny , be permitted . "
But she added that public opinion was " very finely divided " with people only supporting it if it was tightly regulated and likely to lead to medical advancements .

Healthy man fired for history of ' superbug ' infection David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday October 25 , 2007

Print This Email This CBS 4 News in Miami reported on Wednesday that hysteria over the " superbug " Methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus has caused a local man to lose his job .
MRSA has been around for years but has recently been responsible for a highly - publicized surge in fatalities , causing more deaths in the US than AIDS and leading to widespread panic .
Morris Yomtov mentioned casually while at work at the Hollywood Telemarketing Company that he'd had MRSA two years ago after getting some scrapes on his arms while clearing trees downed by a hurricane .
About an hour later , his boss called up to say he was fired .
Yomtov told CBS 4 that his boss refused to listen to explanations , telling him , " It was n't around two years ago , it 's only been around now , so you must have it . "
Yomtov 's doctor gave him a note saying he was completely infection - free , but his boss refused to even take it from his hand , asking him to FAX it instead .
Now the company is not returning Yomtov 's phone calls and also refused to talk to the CBS 4 news team .
" I 'm not Typhoid Mary , " insists Yomtov , who has filed a federal employment discrimination complaint .
The following video is from Miami's CBS 4 , broadcast on October 24 , 2007 .

My heart is racing more than when I saw Sarah Michelle Gellar as a brunette for the first time .
The adoption of reflection into main - stream programming tools and languages over the last six or seven years gave developers almost telepathic powers , allowing us to instantly understand any object without having to read through 200 pages of boring manuals .
Code insight , instellisense , class browser , or whatever the feature is called in your favourite IDE , started as a helpful utility but has now almost completely replaced API documentation .
Most developers simply do not read supporting documents at all any more .
This puts a lot more pressure on the API and it ’s authors - not only should it cover all required functionality , but it must also be intuitive to use .
We must acknowledge and understand the effects of those tools in order to make our APIs better .
Longer comments are most likely to be missed
Some reflection tools will show the first few lines of method comments , some will not even display anything except method and parameter names .
Anything longer than a line of text will probably not be read by most developers , at least when they start using the API .
So the effort required to comment the code extensively , or write the accompanying documentation , is probably better spent on making the API more intuitive .
We must not rely on comments to stop other developers from misusing the API – this is especially important for classes with stateful processing .
Just putting a comment like “ Call Clean ( ) before executing this method ” is not enough .
API must take responsibility for workflow pre-conditions – if Clean ( ) should be called anyway , then just call it internally , do not expose it at all .
If the situation is not that simple , than verify preconditions in the code , and throw a runtime exception when they are not satisfied .
Say what you have to say in " Hello - world "
People want a short tutorial to start with , so they will actually read the “ Hello World ” example .
So , that is a perfect place to put warnings , explain key design decisions or whatever messages we need to get through to an average API user .
However , these must be kept short .
A list with five - six bullets is the best way to pass the message .
In any case , key ideas should not take more than a few paragraphs – the longer they are , the more likely they will be skipped .
And there is no point in writing a document that no one will read .
Exceptions can be an effective way of giving more documentation
Some workflow conditions , such as “ This method should not execute in the main thread ” , simply cannot be automated properly .
Sometimes there is no default correct behaviour , or it would have a significant effect on performance .
In those cases , exceptions are an excellent way to give more information - unlike comments , they can not be easily missed .
If the pre-condition is not satisfied , we can and should throw an exception – but let ’s explain why the exception was thrown and give the client developer some ideas how to avoid the problem .
A generic Unsupported Action exception does not help much , but one with an explanation what do to and how to do it will quickly point the developer in the right direction .
Again , too much information can have a self - defeating effect , and if the problem cannot be explained in a few lines , it ’s best to keep the exception message short and provide a link to more information online .
It should take less code to use the API properly then to unintentionally misuse it
This became my litmus test for a bad API – passing the test does not guarantee that the API is good , but failing the test guarantees that we should go back to the drawing board .
People will typically look for the simplest solution , and if it takes more code to use the API properly than to make a big mistake , get ready for late - night support .
Issues with thread - safety are especially delicate , because multi- threaded problems are very hard to diagnose and debug , and correct solutions cannot be enforced with a compiler .
Half a year ago , we had a heated discussion about thread - safety for plugins in our content - generator system .
It made much sense to reuse plugins and not generate them on each request .
One part of the team wanted to make plugins thread safe by default .
The other part of the team wanted to make plugins unsafe by default , and then specify thread - safety explicitly .
The benefit of the first approach was somewhat less code in a general case for us , because we will write the first batch of plugins , and they will be thread - safe .
However , once a 3rd party integrator creates a plugin with an instance variable , we would have support problems .
So we chose the second way : framework can use thread - safe plugins , but that feature has to be activated on demand .
That way , it takes more code to unintentionally misuse the API then to use it correctly .
In good user interfaces , basic functions are readily available , and the more powerful features are typically hiding behind an ‘ advanced ’ button or tab .
This is one principle software API designers should really learn from UI designers - put the simple things in front , provide advanced features for power - users on demand .
In our case , setThreadSafe ( true ) was that advanced tab .
Have a different pair of eyes go through the API
Developers who were involved in building the API and underlying structures do not represent a typical API user – they often know too much .
Most of the time , the API is there to shield the user from complexity of the underlying system , or to simplify it ’s use .
So having a fresh pair of eyes and hands try to actually use the interfaces after seeing just the tip of the ice - berg , can really be an eye - opening experience .
Let ’s give the API to someone who was not involved in development and watch closely how they will try to use it – this will give us a good idea whether we did a good job , and can the system really be used through the API without knowing all the underlying plumbing details .
If they misuse it the first time , maybe we need to hide more details , or provide better defaults .
Whose job is it ?
Shifting more responsibility to the side of API authors might cause some resistance - on the end , if the API author goes through the trouble of documenting intended use of his product , then it is reasonable that the responsibility of the API user should be to utilise it properly .
Just closing our eyes and ignoring the issue will not make it go away - look at Swing for example .
Sun ’s desktop GUI framework is incredibly flexible , with layout management and event processing models that , for years , had no real competition , but it failed to take a significant part of the market .
One of the main reasons for that was the perceived performance - I lost count of times when I had to explain to potential clients that Java is not slow on the desktop , but that the applications they have seen before were poorly written .
And the ‘ poorly written ’ part , almost certainly , was because of misused threading model .
Swing uses a single background thread to process all GUI updates , and by default , developers also use that thread for workflow processing , which freezes the GUI and brings up the famous Gray screen .
Although the threading model is clearly documented online and in many books , a lot of developers chose to just ignore it , at least judging from the effect previous experiences with Java GUIs had on my clients .
It ’s no use discussing whose responsibility was to use the API properly in that case - the client side developers should have done their homework better , but the damage was done to the product .
So let ’s avoid similar problems with our products by doing a bit more to make APIs easier to use .

Laonastes is about the size of a red squirrel .
( Image : Mark A Klingler ) .
A squirrel - like rodent discovered in Laos is the sole survivor of a group that otherwise died out 11 million years ago , according to fossil data .
The animal made headlines in 2005 when it was hailed as the only new family of living mammals to be found in 30 years .
But scientists now believe it is a " living fossil " , the relic of a group of prehistoric rodents once widespread in South East Asia and Japan .
Writing in Science magazine , they say efforts must be made to conserve it .
The rodent , Laonastes aenigmamus , was found by scientists at a hunter 's market in Laos in early 2005 .
Robert Timmins , from the Wildlife Conservation Society , saw it on sale next to some vegetables .
" I knew immediately it was something I had never seen before , " he said at the time .
While previously unknown to the worldwide scientific community , it is familiar enough to local people to have a name , the kha - nyou .
The creature has dark - grey fur and is about the size of a red squirrel .
It has short legs , a hairy tail and a long snout .
Fossil puzzle
After the kha - nyou was discovered , specimens were sent to London 's Natural History Museum , to compare with material in its vast research collections .
Totally new to science
Enlarge Image
Based on differences in the skull , teeth , bones and other body features together with DNA analysis , scientists said it was an entirely new rodent family more closely related to rodents in Africa and South America than in Asia .
But when a particularly impressive fossil of a long - extinct rodent was unearthed in China last summer , a US - led team wondered whether the kha - nyou might be a living member of the long - gone family .
They went back through the fossil evidence and found that the kha - nyou 's skull , teeth , lower jaw - bone and other skeletal characteristics were a striking match to the fossil .
They believe it belongs in the same group - the otherwise extinct rodent family Diatomyidae .
Chief author Mary Dawson , of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh , said it was extremely rare for a mammal to reappear after such a long gap in the fossil record .
" A new family of living mammals does not crop up every day , " she told the BBC News website .
" When we have a living fossil it opens up a way of looking at past biodiversity on the molecular level that we do n't ordinarily have . "
Nocturnal recluse
Laonastes lives in a rocky limestone area dotted by small patches of forest .
It is thought to be nocturnal but has yet to be observed by biologists in the wild .
Dr Dawson said efforts to conserve Laonastes should be given the highest priority .
" We do n't know what its status is - whether there are a lot of them around or just a few , " she said .
" This animal better be protected while it is ( still ) around . "
Exciting finds
The area of South East Asia where the rodent was found is regarded as one of the richest " hotspots " of biological diversity in the world .
Several other new mammals have been found there in recent years , including a new species of bat , a mouse - like rodent and a hedgehog - like mammal .
" It is highly likely that there are more exciting and unusual animals to be found in South East Asia , " said Paula Jenkins , of London 's Natural History Museum , who carried out the original analysis of Laonastes .
The latest evidence is described in the current issue of the journal Science , by authors from the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh , US ; Montpellier University , France ; and the Institute of Vertebrate Palaeontology and Palaeoanthroplogy in Beijing , China .
Cyclists could do as many circuits as they wished
More than 30,000 people rode along a 14 km ( 8.7 mile ) car - free route past iconic landmarks in the city .
Cyclists could use several entry points to access the route , which had no start and finish point , and could cycle round as many times as they wished .
The London Freewheel route was open from 1100 BST until 1600 BST on Sunday .
Expert checks
It passed several London landmarks including the London Eye , Victoria Embankment , Westminster , St Paul 's Cathedral and the Mall .
Riders were led onto the route by experienced cyclists from six " hubs " across the capital .
Participants could also have their bikes checked by experts .
The Hovis London Freewheel event culminated in a festival at St James 's Park for riders , including bike stunt displays , a cycling circus and information on cycling in London .
The number of cyclists on London 's major roads is estimated to have grown by about 80 % over the past seven years , but Transport for London wants to increase it further .
High School failed me .
As a high school dropout , I knew I was taking a risk by rejecting the ‘ normal route ’ and knew I always wanted to be in the business world .
During one assignment in my computer class , I did not show up in a suit and tie for the presentation .
The teacher docked me for not ‘ dressing proper ’ , which I found puzzling .
After all , this class was about desktop publishing – why should this be an issue ?
It should be about the substance of my work and not some preconceived , superficial notion about how I looked .
For me , it has always been about the substance and not the suit .
The good news is that federal aid for colleges has reached its high - water mark .
The bad news is that millions of young adults feel they have no choice but to enroll in a four - year University , something that brings with it an inordinate amount of debt for many students .
I recently had lunch with Patrick Bryant and his son , Pate .
Patrick is a serial entrepreneur , while Pate is a rising high school senior and AP student with enough college - level credits to graduate a semester early .
He ’s also a perfect example of a student who learned code through a third party school , JRS Coding School .
The twelve week 9 - to - 5 school is positioned for adults learning code to enter the workplace , and Pate took the code class during the summer of his Junior year , becoming highly proficient at JavaScript .
“ We were mixed on Pate ’s need to attend college .
He knows he wants to code and is focused on being a tech entrepreneur , ” said Patrick .
“ Of course , college offers other experiences and a social network that are important to his development , but we are proud of his choice to skip college and go directly into the workforce .
He ’s already an accomplished member of the development team at work , and within four years , when his peers are first joining the workforce , he should already be much further along in seniority , experience and income . ”
“ I already have the knowledge and capability to write code that you ’d pay someone who went to four years of college to write , ” said Pate .
“ I love to solve problems , which is why I love coding .
Going to college would be a waste of time for a computer science degree .
Many of the peers I work with are self - taught .
It would make sense for other degrees like law or medical . ”
Harvard Business Professor Clayton Christensen offered a startling prediction last year when he stated that “ as many as half of American universities would close or go bankrupt within 10 to 15 years . ”
Between online education and the emerging tech / coding industry , he sees technology undercutting the traditional four - year college model .
I , for one , welcome this much needed tidal wave of change in how we develop and nurture the next generation of our workforce .
Thankfully , young adults have caught on to the failure of the status quo .
In 2017 , the think tank New America published a survey revealing that just 13 percent of millennials agree or strongly agree with the statement that “ higher education today is fine how it is , while 79 percent said they disagree or strongly disagree with that sentiment . ”
If nearly 80 percent of young adults entering college classrooms view the system as failing , why are we continuing down this path ?
I have spoken before about the benefit of seeking talent in unconventional places and the lack of soft - skills possessed by this younger generation .
From the kitchen to the valet stand , talent is all around us and the static CV is dead .
All that is needed is for employers to jump off the hamster wheel as it relates to recruitment and open up to the idea , however unconventional it may seem , that a degree does not necessarily mean the right fit for a position .
Nowhere is this more prevalent than in the world of coding .
Coders have been outliers in this trend to reject the traditional college degree , and there is data to back this up .
An important 2015 Developer Survey by Stackoverflow revealed that nearly half of the 26,000 developers who responded did not have a computer science degree .
What also caught my eye is that only 25 percent of developers worldwide have more than 10 years coding experience .
This is a young person ’s field , and combined with the high percentage of non-traditional schooling , it creates an environment of risk - taking and contrarian thinking — requisite skills for coding .
So , my advice to high schools is very simple .
Encourage your gifted coders to seek careers now and not just when they secure a college degree .
If these young adults develop the proper coding skills , companies will open their doors to interview them right out of the classroom .
Coding is a zero sum game .
If they possess the proper skills , they will succeed .
From the large tech companies to the many emerging startups , the job boards are ripe with positions that are difficult to fill .

The vendor says the base would make an ideal summer camp
A former US intercontinental ballistic missile base - with a network of underground tunnels and silos , but no nuclear warheads - is on sale on eBay for $ 1.5 m ( £ 750,000 , 1.06 m euros ) .
Located in a remote corner of Washington state and still ringed by its original barbed - wire - topped fence , the 56 - acre site is being marketed as a " gorgeous " property and potential resort .
Bari Hotchkiss bought the former base 10 years ago from owners who obtained the property in the 1970s , after the US government deemed obsolete the Titan missiles it was built to launch .
" We used to use it as a summer camp , for our kids and their friends , " he told news agency AFP .
" The only limit is imagination .
We 've always wanted to see it turn into a summer camp or resort camp , " he said .
20th Century castles
Mr Hotchkiss says there are 18 former Titan bases , most of which were sold off .
But his base , he says , is one of the best preserved .
" Most of those former bases are much much smaller , and most all of them have water problems with water leaking in them .
So they 're filled with water or so wet there is terrible rust , and ours is dry .
Portions of our missile base look like it 's built last year , " he said .
Much of the Cold War era technology was stripped from the site by the military , and to make much of the underground network useable would require several million dollars .
" If you only need one or a couple of the buildings to begin with , several hundred thousand dollars might do it , " Mr Hotchkiss told AFP .
A number of other former US missile bases are also on the market .
The website missilebases.com describes the buildings as " castles of the 20th century " .
Designed to withstand nuclear attack , these unique properties " bring new meaning to the word ' shelter ' , " it says .
In the second century A.D. , it was the Christians who were denounced as “ atheists . ”
JONATHAN BOROFSKY , “ FOUR GODS ” ( 1994 )
Great portents and disasters turn some minds to God and others away from him .
When an unusually bright and long - tailed comet was tracked through the sky in the last two months of 1680 , posters and sermons called on Christians to repent .
A hen in Rome seemed to confirm that the Day of Judgment was near .
On December 2nd , it made an extraordinarily loud cackle and produced an exceptionally large egg , on which could be seen a likeness of the comet , or so it was said .
This added to the religious panic .
But the comet also sparked a small triumph for rationalism .
In the next few years , as Armageddon somehow failed to arrive , a stream of pamphlets across Europe and America argued that heavenly displays were purely natural phenomena .
The skeptics won the day .
From the eighteenth century onward , no respectable intellectual saw comets as direct messages from God — though there were still some fears that one might eventually hit the earth .
The felling of the World Trade Center in New York , on September 11 , 2001 , brought its share of religion .
Two populist preachers , Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell , called it divine punishment ( though both quickly withdrew their remarks ) , and not only the bereaved prayed for help .
But September 11th and its aftershocks in Bali , Madrid , London , and elsewhere are more notable for causing an outbreak of militant atheism , at least on bookshelves .
The terrorist attacks were carried out in the name of Islam , and they have been taken , by a string of best - selling books , to illustrate the fatal dangers of all religious faith .
The first of these books was “ The End of Faith , ” by Sam Harris , which was published in 2004 and was on the Times paperback best - seller list for thirty - three weeks .
Then came “ Breaking the Spell : Religion as a Natural Phenomenon , ” by Daniel Dennett , a philosopher at Tufts University , who has written popular books on the science of consciousness and on Darwin .
Next was “ The God Delusion , ” by Richard Dawkins , an evolutionary biologist and Britain ’s preëminent science writer .
Harris joined battle again last year with “ Letter to a Christian Nation , ” which renewed his attack on Christianity in particular .
And now there is “ God Is Not Great : How Religion Poisons Everything ” ( Twelve ; $ 24.99 ) , by Christopher Hitchens , which is both the most articulate and the angriest of the lot .
Hitchens is a British - born writer who lives in Washington , D.C. , and is a columnist for Vanity Fair and Slate .
He thrives at the lectern , where his powers of rhetoric and recall enable him to entertain an audience , go too far , and almost get away with it .
These gifts are amply reflected in “ God Is Not Great . ”
Hitchens is nothing if not provocative .
Creationists are “ yokels , ” Pascal ’s theology is “ not far short of sordid , ” the reasoning of the Christian writer C. S. Lewis is “ so pathetic as to defy description , ” Calvin was a “ sadist and torturer and killer , ” Buddhist sayings are “ almost too easy to parody , ” most Eastern spiritual discourse is “ not even wrong , ” Islam is “ a rather obvious and ill - arranged set of plagiarisms , ” Hanukkah is a “ vapid and annoying holiday , ” and the psalmist King David was an “ unscrupulous bandit . ”
It ’s possible to wonder , indeed , where plain speaking ends and misanthropy begins :
Hitchens says that the earth sometimes seems to him to be “ a prison colony and lunatic asylum that is employed as a dumping ground by far - off and superior civilizations . ”
He certainly likes to adopt the tone of a bemused Martian envoy hammering out a report for headquarters .
( We hear of “ a showbiz woman bizarrely known as Madonna . ” )
In a curious rhetorical tic , Hitchens regularly refers to people whom he wishes to ridicule by their zoological class .
Thus the followers of Muhammad are “ mammals , ” as is the prophet himself , and so are the seventeenth - century false messiah Sabbatai Zevi and St. Francis of Assisi ; Japan ’s wartime Emperor Hirohito is a “ ridiculously overrated mammal , ” and Kim Il Sung , the father of North Korea ’s current dictator , is a “ ludicrous mammal . ”
Hitchens is trying to say that these people are mere fallible mortals ; but his way of saying it makes him come across as rather an odd fish .
He is also a fallible one .
After rightly railing against female genital mutilation in Africa , which is an indigenous cultural practice with no very firm ties to any particular religion , Hitchens lunges at male circumcision .
He claims that it is a medically dangerous procedure that has made countless lives miserable .
This will come as news to the Jewish community , where male circumcision is universal , and where doctors , hypochondria , and overprotective mothers are not exactly unknown .
Jews , Muslims , and others among the nearly one - third of the world ’s male population who have been circumcised may be reassured by the World Health Organization ’s recent announcement that it recommends male circumcision as a means of preventing the spread of AIDS .
Hitchens is on firmer ground as he traipses around the world on a tour of sectarian conflicts .
He recounts how , a week before September 11th , a hypothetical question was put to him by Dennis Prager , an American talk - show host .
Hitchens was asked to imagine himself in a foreign city at dusk , with a large group of men coming toward him .
Would he feel safer , or less safe , if he were to learn that they were coming from a prayer meeting ?
With justified relish , the widely travelled Hitchens responds that he has had that experience in Belfast , Beirut , Bombay , Belgrade , Bethlehem , and Baghdad , and that , in each case , the answer would be a resounding “ less safe . ”
He relates what he has seen or knows of warring factions of Protestants and Catholics in Ulster ; Christians and Muslims in Beirut and in Bethlehem ; Hindus and Muslims in Bombay ; Roman Catholic Croatians , Orthodox Serbians , and Muslims in the former Yugoslavia ; and Shiites , Sunnis , and Christians in Baghdad .
In these cases and others , he argues , religion has exacerbated ethnic conflicts .
As he puts it , “ religion has been an enormous multiplier of tribal suspicion and hatred . ”
That ’s more plausible than what Sam Harris has to say on the subject .
He maintains that religious belief not only aggravates such conflicts but is “ the explicit cause ” of them .
He believes this even of Northern Ireland , where the Troubles between pro-British Unionists and pro-Irish Republicans began around 1610 , when Britain confiscated Irish land and settled English and Scottish planters on it .
As far as Harris is concerned , Islam brought down the Twin Towers , thanks in no small part to the incendiary language of the Koran ; Middle East politics , history , and economics are irrelevant sideshows .
This thesis suffers from a problem of timing : if he is right , why did Al Qaeda not arise , say , three hundred years ago , when the Koran said exactly what it says now ?
One practical problem for antireligious writers is the diversity of religious views .
However carefully a skeptic frames his attacks , he will be told that what people in fact believe is something different .
For example , when Terry Eagleton , a British critic who has been a professor of English at Oxford , lambasted Dawkins ’s “ The God Delusion ” in the London Review of Books , he wrote that “ card - carrying rationalists ” like Dawkins “ invariably come up with vulgar caricatures of religious faith that would make a first - year theology student wince . ”
That is unfair , because millions of the faithful around the world believe things that would make a first - year theology student wince .
A large survey in 2001 found that more than half of American Catholics , Episcopalians , Lutherans , Methodists , and Presbyterians believed that Jesus sinned — thus rejecting a central dogma of their own churches .
On Monday , Professor Mark Graber , a contributor to the Balkin legal blog , posted a first person account from Professor Walter F. Murphy , a distinguished emeritus Princeton professor of Constitutional law , who was initially denied a boarding pass when trying to fly in March and was told by an airline employee that he was likely on a Transportation Security Administration watch list due to having criticized the administration .
I questioned the conclusion that he was actually on a list and then spoke with both American Airlines and the TSA .
In an interview Tuesday , Professor Murphy discusses what happened , his anger at being told that an Administration headed by draft avoiders considers him a threat , and the possibility that he was quickly removed from the watch list because the NSA overheard his phone calls complaining about his situation .
Murphy flew from his home in Albuquerque , New Mexico on March 1 to start a trip to Princeton , New Jersey , but when he tried to check - in curbside , he was told he could n't .
When I asked the curbside attendant why , he said , " You cant have a boarding pass . "
I had tried to do this online but thought I must have hit the wrong key or something .
" You are on the terrorist watch list so you have to go inside and talk to a clerk , " he said .
The airline clerk was very polite , and I gave him my Marine I.D. , and he looked at that and said , " Let me see what I can do .
Do you mind if I take this to the TSA agent . "
One of them , I do n't remember which one , asked me , " Have you been in any peace marches ?
We ban a lot of people from flying for that . "
I said " No , but I did give a speech criticizing George Bush , " and he said , " That will do it . " 10 minutes later , which felt like ten years , he came back and I was given a boarding pass .
One of the two said they [ TSA ] will ransack my luggage .
I have no problem with people going through the luggage ; I have to be on that plane too .
I do n't like all the security but I know it is necessary .
Being told he was on a government watch list infuriated Murphy , and while on his trip , he told many people about it in conversation , but waited more than a month to publicize it .
I waited to go public until I could chuckle at the irony because I was furious and I did n't want to explode .
I 'm outraged , When my war came up I did n't turn away .
I went to war [ ed .
note : the Korean War ] and was wounded and won the Bronze Star and to be accused of being disloyal by people who artfully dodged fighting their generation 's war …
I can respect conscientious dissenters to the Vietnam War , but neither Bush nor Cheney though the war was unjust , I do n't know how to describe the feeling .
Kafka would have loved this scenario .
Professor Murphy said he initially was skeptical he was deliberately put on a list , but then starting hearing from others and remembering other conversations .
When I gave a speech at Princeton criticizing the President [ on September 19,2006 ] , the speech was entitled " Is the Constitution Dead or Merely Sleeping . "
After the talk a judge came up and congratulated me and said " I liked the talk , " – I got a standing ovation , which did n't surprise me since it was at Princeton – , and he said , " It took a great deal of courage . "
I said , " What do you mean ?
Who can do anything to me ? "
And he said , " But these people will find a way to punish you . "
I just laughed , but evidently he knew something I did n't know .
[ Murphy 's speech used James Madison 's definition of tyranny as the situation when one branch or individual has full power to make decision for the nation and went over Bush 's claims that he was not bound by Congressional statutes that must get a warrant for wiretapping .
He also compared Bush 's vision of executive authority to some of the writings of Carl Schmitt , a German philosopher who was a Nazi wannabe who penned a political justification for dictatorship , including the need for a single strong decider . ]
I did not call Bush a Nazi .
What I do claim is a remarkable similarity between his claims to presidential power and Schmitt 's philosophy .
I did not advocate assassination or even impeachment – although impeachment is sounding good these days .
When Murphy flew back to Albuquerque , he had no problem getting a ticket , but the airline could n't find his luggage when he landed .
The fact he was not singled out again suggests the professor may not be on a list .
I flew back without having trouble getting a boarding pass .
But when I was in Princeton , I had breakfast with former student – a Republican congressman , and called a number of friends in my academic life , and the NSA monitors a lot of phone calls , especially cell phone calls , so I tried to use the words that might trip their computers like starting calls by saying , " I'm on the terrorist watch list " and " I 've been criticizing George Bush " and if indeed these things are monitored , maybe they heard this , I do n't know .
When I got back to Albuquerque , the airline said my luggage was lost .
it was delivered later that night , sometime after midnight .
I do n't know when .
I left a note on the door telling them just leave it .
It arrived some time overnight and I found nothing missing .
That could be a coincidence ; airlines are good at losing luggage .
No one in the government told Murphy he was on a list or why – instead that was an airline employee who likely does n't know why anyone is on a list .
I share your skepticism , and then the more I thought about it , the less sure I was that it was a coincidence .
My initial reaction was maybe I was caught by an IRA name like mine , but then too many things fell into place .
My first thought was that this is just coincidence , but it fits but a small but neat pattern .
[ The airline employees ] are the people who have to deny boarding passes ; they are the ones that administer it .
They would be the people who have to do the dirty deed and sometimes the good one , as well .
Last night , during an interview with the local news the TV person reporter said that he had gotten in touch with the [ Transportation Security Administration ] .
They say they do n’t make up the list at all , but they did not deny this happened and would n't confirm or deny if I was on the list .
Murphy says he 's heard from others put on the list and that it 's similar to the outing of CIA operation Valerie Plame as political payback for her husband 's criticisms of the Administration .
You have Valerie Plame being punished , and then I found at that two other people got put on the list .
That seems to be more than clerical error .
It begins to get a little hard to believe that it is clerical error , of course , One of people who contacted me has been trying for many months to get off the list .
One friend who called me said , " I got put on , too . "
He used to be fairly high - powered mover and shaker .
" How did you get off ? , " I asked .
" I 'm partner in large law firm and I told my secretary to get me off , " he said .
" And I 've been able to fly since . "
I do n't have a bright , highly paid legal secretary but , I 'm in better shape than most Americans .
At least when I scream , some people listen .
No American citizen should be harassed for exercising their First Amendment rights .
Professor Murphy flies out Thursday for a conference in Texas , which will mark the first flight since his trip when he was told he was on a list .
For those that are interested , the government watch list redress system for individuals whose names resemble the names of people actually on the list is here .
There is no real procedure to clear your name if you are actually the person on the list .

The music industry 's lawsuit crusade against defenseless college students and housewives appears to have hit the skids lately .
That might mean it 's almost time for socially responsible investors to start looking at music publishers again , after their long industrywide hiatus from research lists .
Sympathy for the devil
Warner Music ( NYSE : WMG ) , Sony ( NYSE : SNE ) BMG , Universal Music , and EMI ( OTC BB : EMIPY.PK ) , the main movers behind the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) , may have expected easy victories when they began their much - maligned campaign to sue alleged illegal music downloaders .
But instead of settling their cases for a few thousand dollars each , many defendants decided to fight back -- with great success .
Some lawsuits have proven ridiculous from the outset , targeting computer - illiterates and dead people , or accusing grandmothers of downloading gangsta rap .
Others have been dismissed for a lack of evidence against the purported file - sharers .
Nearly every standard weapon in the recording industry 's legal arsenal has been proven ineffectual at best , and unconstitutional at worst .
Flat - fee subscription services like the revamped Napster ( NASDAQ : NAPS ) and RealNetworks ' ( NASDAQ : RNWK )
Rhapsody , as well as pay - per - download distributors like Apple ( NASDAQ : AAPL ) , can't wait to see the old - fashioned music distribution networks go down in flames .
Consumers in general are honest , law - abiding people , and as long as you give them a chance to get what they want by legal means , and at a reasonable price , piracy will be a niche phenomenon .
Today , the opposite is true , thanks to draconian licensing policies and a wrong - headed take on the law .
But that 's all about to change .
Love is a battlefield
If you follow this legal saga at all , you know that the RIAA members have lately been fighting primarily to avoid paying the defendants ' legal fees -- and losing .
Instead of a quick and easy cash machine , the labels ' lawsuit machine has become a costly public relations disaster , and it seems unlikely that any sane and responsible manager would order the madness to continue much longer .
Support for the lawsuits from artists and their representatives seems lukewarm , with a few high - profile exceptions like Metallica .
And it 's easy to see why the lesser lights of the Billboard charts do n't swarm to the cause :
Spreading your music like wildfire across the globe , for free , can be a brilliant word - of - mouth marketing tool .
The Timberlakes and Aguileras of the world , on the other hand , do have something to lose .
Their names are already well - known , and free downloads can cut into their profits more than they increase their market presence .
These are the golden calves of the music industry , the acts for whom the RIAA is really fighting .
Not to reimburse those artists for lost wages , mind you -- just to protect their own easy profits .
88 lines about 44 women
The legal system has a role to play in music publishing , particularly in protecting copyrights and trademarks from profit - taking , mass - producing pirate shops and so forth .
But John
Doe filings against nameless IP addresses is wrong on so many levels that I can't list them all in this brief space .
Let me just name a few of the most important flaws :
It 's a great way to alienate music fans , with very little payoff .
The lawsuits have so far failed to stem the illegal downloading tide , and the costs must rival the settlement payoff by now .
Even if the Internet service provider keeps very detailed access logs , it 's nearly impossible to prove that a certain IP address was used by a particular person at any given time .
Copyright is meant to encourage the creative process , not to fatten corporate coffers or limit the available means of distribution .
Again , we have n't seen any payouts to the actual artists and composers here , only to legal teams and company bankrolls .
Everybody 's free ( to wear sunscreen )
It 's about time for the Luddite music business to come around to the new realities of the media market .
They 've spent a lot of money on payola to get their chosen mainstream fodder played on the radio .
If the computer is the new radio , why should they spend even more money and effort trying to stop that music from being played for free ?
A less restrained distribution model would move some of the control from the music industry 's hands and into the consumer 's , which would be great news for a plethora of struggling , hopeful rockers and popsters .
I 'm thinking " paradigm shift " here -- the end of massive superstars , and the rise of music for the people , by the people , and of the people .
It 'll mean lower marketing costs , since the music speaks for itself ; lower distribution costs , as a meaningful all - digital model takes the place of physical discs ; and freedom for everyone to find their own favorites with a click of the mouse , rather than being told what to like .
Everybody wins .

The world 's largest study of weight loss has shown that diets do not work for the vast majority of slimmers and may even put lives at risk .
More than two - thirds pile the pounds straight back on , raising the danger of heart attack , stroke and diabetes .
Indeed most dieters end up heavier than they did to start with , the researchers found .
They warn this type of yo - yo behaviour is linked to a host of health problems .
And they say the strain that repeated weight loss and gain places on the body means most people would have been better off not dieting at all .
The findings follow other research that shows the UK is in the grip of a dieting frenzy , with one in four Britons at any one time trying to lose weight .
The average woman is estimated to lose and gain 251 / 2 stone during her lifetime - putting on 151 / 2 stone for the ten stone she loses through dieting .
Last night , the U.S. scientists behind the latest research - the most thorough and comprehensive analysis of its kind - said that dieting simply does not work .
The University of California researchers analysed the results of more than 30 studies involving thousands of slimmers .
Although the overview did not name specific weight loss plans , popular diets in recent years include the low carbohydrate , high protein Atkins diet and the GI diet , which is rich in slow - burning wholegrain carbohydrates .
Pooling the results of the various studies clearly showed that while people do lose weight initially , most quickly put all the pounds back on .
In fact , most people end up weighing more than they did to begin with .
Researcher Dr Traci Mann said : " You can initially lost 5 to 10 per cent of your weight on any number of diets .
" But after this honeymoon period , the weight comes back .
We found that the majority of people regained all the weight , plus more .
Sustained weight loss was found only in a small minority of participants , while complete weight regain was found in the majority . "
Dr Mann 's research showed that up to two - thirds of dieters put on all the weight they lose - and more - over a four to five - year period .
Half of those taking part in one study were more than 11lb heavier five years later , while dieters taking part in another study actually ended up heavier than other volunteers who had n't tried to lose weight .
A four - year study into the health of 19,000 men revealed that most of those who put on weight had dieted in the years before the start of the study .
Bleak as these figures seem , the true picture could be even worse , as it is thought that most people lie about their weight - and do n't like to tell researchers that their weight has started to creep up again .
The analysis , published in the journal American Psychologist , concluded dieters may actually be damaging their health .
Research has shown the repeated rapid weight gain and loss associated with dieting can double the risk of death from heart disease , including heart attacks , and the risk of premature death in general .
Such yo - yo weight loss has also been linked to stroke and diabetes and shown to suppress the immune system , making the body more vulnerable to infection .
Dr Mann said : " We decided to dig up and analyse every study that followed people on diets for two to five years .
We concluded most of them would have been better off not going on the diet at all .
" Their weight would have been pretty much the same , and their bodies would not suffer the wear and tear from losing weight and gaining it all back .
" The benefits of dieting are simply too small and the potential harms of dieting are too large for it to be recommended as a safe and effective treatment for obesity . "
The psychologist , who advises would - be slimmers to swap calorie - controlled diets for a balanced diet coupled with regular exercise , added : " Exercise may well be the key factor leading to sustained weight loss .
Studies consistently find that people who report the most exercise also have the most weight loss . "
The finding comes as Britain fights a rising tide of obesity .
A growing reliance on fast food and time - saving technology has led to the UK developing the worst weight problem in Europe , with almost a quarter of adults classed as obese .
Last night , British experts said that fad diets do not work and that the key to maintaining a healthy weight is making gradual , long - term changes .
Dr Beckie Lang , of the Association for the Study of Obesity , said : " Maintaining a healthy weight is n't about going on a diet and coming off a diet when you reach your target weight .
It is about adopting skills that change your eating habits for life . "
• CASE STUDY
Mother - of - two Chris Siveter is a self - confessed serial dieter .
Over the last four decades her weight has fluctuated between 11 stone and 17 stone and her dress size between 12 and 22 .
She first started dieting after putting on three stone during pregnancy .
The pounds fell off and she fitted into size 14 clothes again for the first time in years .
But her resolve did not last and she piled the weight back on .
She tried countless diets including a grapefruit diet , the Atkins diet and even a Cabbage Soup diet but all failed after she went on " sweet rampages " .
In 2003 her weight soared to its highest point - 17 stone .
She has now taken up aerobics and joined Slimming World and at 58 , is 11 stone and a size 12 - hoping her days of yo - yo dieting are over .
Iraqi reporter : Baghdad ' 100 times worse ' than a year ago David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Monday September 10 , 2007
Print This Email This Ayub Nuri , an Iraqi journalist residing in the United States , told CNN on Monday that even when he was last in Baghdad in 2006 , " the situation was very , very dangerous , " but that things are much worse now .
" When I speak to my friends and family these days on the phone , they tell me that it is 100 times worse than when I was there , " Nuri stated .
" Even the regular people cannot leave their own neighborhoods .
...
If you go to another neighborhood , that 's completely unknown to you , and you might not be able to come home alive . "
When asked about General Petraeus ' suggestion last week that " Iraqi soldiers and police are very much in the fight , " Nuri replied , " I think that 's not true at all .
... I have to be honest with you and with everyone else in the world .
When I was traveling around Iraq , in Baghdad or anywhere else , I was afraid of the Iraqi army and the Iraqi police more than I was afraid of a militia or unknown men . "
Nuri explained that after the Coalition Provisional Authority disbanded Saddam 's army , " They were desperate to recreate another Iraqi army , and in case of desperation , of course , you accept anyone to join your army , and many of them were criminals , many of them were drug dealers , and many of them had ... affiliation only to their own areas . "
He said that as a result , many Iraqis these days would prefer to have their neighborhood patrolled by a US unit rather than an Iraqi unit .
" I personally do not have any faith or any hope in the Maliki government , " Nuri stated , though he emphasized that the problem was n't just with Maliki .
" The Iraqi government is neither willing nor they are able to do anything , " he concluded .
The following video is from CNN's Newsroom , broadcast on September 10 .
On Monday , 2 July 2007 , Westchester County , New York District Attorney Janet DiFiore released a Report on the Conviction of Jeffrey Deskovic ( 232 kb PDF ) .
In 1989 , Deskovic , then a highschool student , falsely confessed to the rape and murder of classmate Angela Correa following a ( wrongly ) failed polygraph examination .
New York television station WABC ’s Eyewitness News program summarizes the report in “ Scathing Report into Man Wrongly Convicted ” :
( New York – WABC , July 2 , 2007 ) –
He spent 16 years in prison for a rape and murder he did n’t commit .
Now there ’s a blistering report about the improper conviction of Jeffrey Deskovic .
The Westchester DA , which originally handled the case , called its own investigation of the crime “ a miscarriage of justice . ”
Eyewitness News reporter Marcus Solis has more .
How could an innocent man spend half his life in prison for a murder he did n’t commit ?
Jeffrey Deskovic was 17 when he was convicted of killing Angela Correa , a classmate .
Peekskill Police said Deskovic knew details about the investigation only the killer could know .
Today , a report found police developed tunnel vision , focusing soley on Deskovic and no other suspects ; that investigators relied too heavily on a criminal profile provided by the NYPD and that detectives recorded only select interrogations , and not the eight - hour polygraph exam which ended with the teenager confessing to the crime .
The report claims Deskovic received shoddy defense from the Legal Aid Society .
Prosecutors were faulted for presenting the case to the grand jury before getting DNA results that ruled Deskovic out .
At trial , prosecutors ignored the DNA evidence and offered alternate theories for the killing , and key pieces of evidence , including the victim ’s clothes were lost .
Former DA Jeanine Pirro was criticized for not responding to Deskovic ’s pleas to have the DNA retested .
Her successor did just that .
The result was a match and a confession from Steven Cunningham , the real killer .
For his part , Deskovic disagrees with the report ’s conclusion that although mistakes were made , there was no bad faith involved .
The report states DNA should trump a confession .
It did n’t in this case .
The DA promises a similar case today would be handled differently .
According to the latest Gallup Poll , Congress ’s approval rating is at a low not seen since the days when guys like Tom Foley were in charge :
PRINCETON , NJ — A new Gallup Poll finds Congress ’ approval rating the lowest it has been since Gallup first tracked public opinion of Congress with this measure in 1974 .
Just 18 % of Americans approve of the job Congress is doing , while 76 % disapprove , according to the August 13 - 16 , 2007 , Gallup Poll .
That 18 % job approval rating matches the low recorded in March 1992 , when a check - bouncing scandal was one of several scandals besetting Congress , leading many states to pass term limits measures for U.S. representatives ( which the Supreme Court later declared unconstitutional ) .
Congress had a similarly low 19 % approval rating during the energy crisis in the summer of 1979 .
And what could the reason be for this historic low ?
The Gallup people think there are a few :
Americans elected the Democrats as the majority party in Congress in November 2006 ’s midterm election in large part due to frustration with the Iraq war and an ineffective and scandal - plagued Republican - led Congress .
But any hopes that the elections would lead to change have not been realized as Democrats ’ repeated attempts to force a change in Iraq war policy have been largely unsuccessful due to presidential vetoes , disagreements within their own party , and the inability to attract Republican support for their policy proposals .
Also , many of the Democratic leadership ’s domestic agenda items have not become law even though some have passed one or both houses of Congress .
As the trend in congressional approval makes clear , ratings of Congress usually suffer during times of economic uncertainty , as during the late 1970s and early 1990s .
While Americans ’ ratings of current economic conditions are not near historical lows , there is a great deal of concern about the direction in which the economy is headed .
The latest poll finds a record 72 % of Americans saying the economy is “ getting worse . ”
It ’s not at all surprising that the Democrats have disappointed the public .
After all , the leadership that came into power in January is n’t all that different from the people that were in charge back when Newt Gingrich ’s revolution rolled through the country and brought Republican majorities in both Houses of Congress .
In fact , in some case , the same people who were in charge back then are in charge again now .
That ’s the problem with the “ throw the bums out ” idea .
More often than not , it really means “ throw the bums out and bring back the bums we threw out the last time . ”
In the end , very little gets accomplished .
That ’s why it ’s time to start thinking about some radical ideas .
Like term limits and returning Congress to the citizen legislature it was meant to be .
And , although I know this is never likely to happen , repealing the 17th Amendment for the reasons I named in this post .
It ’s time to start thinking some radical thoughts people .

Feel free to Digg this post .
In the old days , you needed these authority figures to sort out the news for you and tell you what was important and weed out the riff - raff .
But these are n't the old days .
I have a mind of my own .
I do n't need to borrow a news anchor's .
And if I were to borrow one , that 's not the first place I would look .
It 's not him .
It 's us .
We 're not interested in someone regurgitating the news to us and taking a half hour to do it .
We do n't need a professional news anchor to tell us what the news is .
This is n't 1955 .
I 've got all the news in the world at my fingertips , what do I need this guy to tell me what he thinks is important ?
Who cares what Brian Williams thinks is important ?
There 's nothing wrong with Brian Williams .
He is a smooth , professional news anchor .
He 's not offensive , biased or fake .
He plays it straight - and that 's his problem .
In the new media , news is broken down into three subsets .
The Collectors
Associated Press , New York Times , Washington Post , blogs that break stories , etc .
These are our original sources .
They are vital .
Without these sources , there is nothing for anyone else to report .
The Aggregators
Websites like Google News , digg.com , reddit.com , Huffington Post , Yahoo , AOL News and even your local paper ( they aggregate the national and international stories that they do almost no original reporting on ) .
This is where we get a majority of our information .
It 's quick , it 's easy , and often times , it 's personalized .

The Interpreters
Commentators that analyze the news from their ( your ) perspective .
Fox News Channel , Keith Olbermann , Air America , Rush Limbaugh .
Some blogs also fall in this category ( unsurprisingly , blogs are often hybrids that cross many different boundaries ) .
These are people that help bring the news to you in a way you agree with .
They inform you , but they also excite , enrage and impassion you .
Their purpose is analysis / entertainment .
Some people call this category infotainment .
I prefer ( my former co-host ) Ben Mankiewicz 's name for it - entermation .
So , where do traditional news anchors fit in here ?
Nowhere .
How often do television reporters break stories these days ?
Almost never .
Most of them are actors reading the news pretending to be real reporters .
I 'm amused at how other TV reporters feign outrage at Katie Couric becoming the CBS prime time news anchor .
Why , do you fancy yourself a journalist ?
Really , when is the last time you broke a story ?
Most of the people on local news are former models and pretty boys with three brain cells between them .
Are we supposed to be impressed ?
Look on TV , does it look like they are making their decisions based on looks or intelligence ?
Is it just a coincidence that all the pretty people wound up with the jobs on TV ?
I understand there are exceptions and I actually picked Brian Williams as my example because I think he is one of the exceptions .

Let me recount a recent conversation with my dad by way of example .
He recently turned 70 and used to watch the evening news every single night .
My mom would have to drag him away from it to get him to sit down for dinner .
The US is facing growing calls to close down Guantanamo Bay
The move reverses the court 's decision in April , when it refused to rule on whether the men had a right to take their cases to federal courts .
This latest move is a blow to the US government , which wants the cases to be dealt with by military tribunals alone .
Hundreds of men have been held without charge for years at Guantanamo Bay .
The treatment of the men has been heavily criticised by international human rights bodies and foreign governments , including some allies of the US .
Allegations of abuse have dogged the camp , many of whose inmates were captured in 2001 and 2002 , in the early days of the " war on terror " .
Lawyers ' requests
The administration last year pushed a law through Congress that prohibited Guantanamo Bay detainees from challenging their confinement in federal courts .
Now that they are in their sixth year of captivity , the only question is whether these men will still be sane by the time a court actually hears their case
Sabin Willet
Lawyer for detainees
Under the law , detainees ' cases could only be heard in military commissions - not in civilian courts .
In February this year , an appeals court hearing in the District of Columbia upheld this law .
In April , the US Supreme Court rejected the detainees ' request to hear an appeal on the February ruling .
The detainees ' lawyers said dismissing the cases would be a " profound deprivation " of the prisoners ' rights and urged the Supreme Court to reconsider its decision - a request that has now been granted .
The court is expected to hear the detainees ' cases when it begins a new term in October .
US military lawyers are among those who have criticised the military commissions , describing them as inadequate for trying the detainees .
' Risk to sanity '
A Bush administration spokesman defended the government 's stance on Guantanamo Bay .
" We did not think that court review at this time was necessary , but we are confident in our legal position , " Gordon Johndroe of the National Security Council said .
A US lawyer representing some of the men imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay welcomed the Supreme Court decision .
Sabin Willet told the BBC
News website he was " highly optimistic " the court would rule in his clients ' favour after its " very unusual " reversal .
" Now that they are in their sixth year of captivity , the only question is whether these men will still be sane by the time a court actually hears their case , " he said .
The power of CakePHP has a lot to do with conventions .
The framework ( like many others ) harnesses its power by enforcing certain conventions and standards that users must follow .
You name your database tables , file names , etc ; a particular way and boom , models , views and controllers are automatically created and ready for use .
This is the beauty of the MVC structure .
Your URLs also follow thing structure : _www.site.com/controller/action/params._
Straying From Convention
But sometimes , conventions suck .
Sometimes you want greater control over things , but still do n't wanna do them from scratch .
The strictness of the MVC structure dictates how your URLs will look .
Consider this : CakePHP has a basic pages controller , which you can use when you do n't need a model or controller .
You just enter the view and voila , a page .
But your pages have a URL of :
Would n't you rather :
The Routes Configuration examples in the CakePHP manual are a bit simple .
Here 's how to use a bit more advanced routing :
Router :: connect ('/(.*) .htm ' , array ( ' controller ' => ' pages ' , ' action ' => ' display ' ) ) ;
This says , consider everything that comes in with an HTM extension and send the URL as a parameter to the display action on the pages controller .
The idea was stolen from Lumad CMS .
They use the following in Rewrite in .htaccess for their pages :
RewriteRule ^~(.*) content_pages / displayurl / $ 1 [ L ]
They use a prefix of ‘ ~ ’ instead of a suffix of ‘.htm ’ , but you get the picture .
I 'm sorry to disappoint you , I 'm not as creative as you thought .
How I Use Advanced Routing
I maintain a makeshift CMS using CakePHP .
In this project I have a basic model ( contents ) with a title and body fields , among others .
I would use the pages controller , but I need end users to be able to end pages through the database .
Router :: connect ('/(.*) .htm ' , array ( ' controller ' => ' contents ' , ' action ' => ' view ' ) ) ;
Conventions are great as long as they do n't get in the way .
The great thing about CakePHP is that they frequently provide ways to get what you need done easily .
Make your static content look like static pages with Advanced routing .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Eating too much red meat is not only bad for your health -- it is also bad for the planet , according to scientists .
Worldwide , agricultural activity accounts for about a fifth of total greenhouse - gas emissions and livestock production has a particularly big impact because of the large amount of methane emitted from belching cattle .
Tony McMichael of the Australian National University in Canberra and John Powles of Britain ’s University of Cambridge , writing in the Lancet journal , said worldwide average meat consumption could be realistically reduced by 10 percent .
This would help in the battle against global warming and also reduce health risks associated with excessive consumption of red meat , they said .
Global average meat consumption is currently 100 grams per person a day but there is a tenfold variation between high - consuming and low - consuming populations .

2 Hammerhead
3 Follow - through
5 Gambon Corner
The Top Gear test track is located at the Dunsfold Aerodrome in Dunsfold , Surrery , England .
Dunsfold Aerodrome was used by British Aerospace to flight test aircraft such as the Harrier Jump Jet. British Aerospace closed its facility in 2002 and it has since been renamed Dunsfold Park .
The test track is just under 2 miles long and designed by test drivers at Lotus .
Reviewed cars are driven around the test track by the Stig , Top Gear 's very own tame racing driver , and the results are put on the Power Laps board .
Chicago is a steady - state corner that loads up the outside tires .
Hammerhead is a tricky left - right designed to promote understeer .
The Follow - through is a flat - out corner .
Bacharach is a tricky corner designed to test brake balance .
Gambon is a corner in which a badly setup front - wheel drive car will have trouble putting down its power .
Gambon Corner was originally called " Carpenter 's Corner , " but was renamed in honor of Sir Michael Gambon .
He nearly rolled his Suzuki Liana going through the corner during the Star in a Reasonably Priced Car segment of season one 's episode eight .

Tricks to pass drug tests are like cures for the hiccups – there are many to choose from and some are spectacularly dumb .
A report in the November issue of the Annals of Emergency Medicine described four cases of people becoming ill after taking massive amounts of vitamin B3 ( niacin ) to rid themselves of incriminating chemicals .
According to legend , the dietary supplement will cause every trace of illegal substances to disappear overnight , but established recreational drug references , including Erowid , warn that it does not work and can cause health problems .
Apparently , the four emergency room patients did not do their homework before trying the folk remedy .
All of them suffered from itching , a burning sensation , and a rash .
One of them had symptoms far more severe than the others .
Concerned that his parole officer would give him a drug test , a
14 - year - old boy popped eleven huge tablets of extended - release niacin .
After becoming dizzy , suffering heart palpitations , and vomiting several times , he was brought to a hospital .
Lab tests showed that his body fluids were too acidic , liver was in danger of failure , and blood sugar was unusually high .
His urine contained alarming levels of chemicals called ketones .
Initially , the doctors misdiagnosed him with a severe diabetic reaction and gave him insulin .
That treatment got his blood sugar under control , but he remained in the hospital for several more days .
On the third day of his visit , the physicians checked his urine for drugs .
Despite his risky efforts , the kid still tested positive for marijuana .
Manoj Mittal , a doctor at Children ’s Hospital of Philadelphia , and his colleagues from two other medical establishments warned that as drug testing becomes more common , so will incidents of niacin poisoning .
A second paper in the same journal mentioned that sixteen people in Colorado had called poison control centers last year after taking excessive amounts of the vitamin to detox before a drug test .
A similar story appeared in the Washington Post last spring .

We do n’t exactly shy away from wild ideas here in the DANGER ROOM .
But this is straight from the never - ever - never - gonna - happen department :
Sixty miles up , you sit in a chair on the open deck of a small rocket , admiring the stars above , the
Earth far , far below .
The vacuum beyond your visor is cold , but it would boil your blood if your pressure suit failed .
You give your parachute straps a reassuring pat .
It ’s utterly silent .
Just you and your fragile body , hovering alone above the Earth .
“ Space Diver One , you are go , ” crackles a voice in your ear , and you undo your harness and stand up .
There ’s nothing for it now :
You paid a lot of money for this .
You breathe deeply and leap , somersaulting into the void .
The mother planet is gorgeous from up here .
You barely perceive that it ’s rushing up toward you , and your body relaxes .
You streak into the atmosphere at 2,500 miles an hour , faster than anyone ’s ever gone without a vehicle .
The sky lightens , the stars disappear behind the blue , and a violent buffeting begins .
You deploy your drogue chute for stability ; an uncontrolled spin in this thin air would rip you apart .
The thick lower atmosphere slows you to
120 mph—terminal velocity .
After a thrilling seven - minute plummet , you pull your main chute at 3,000 feet , hands shaking , and glide in for landing .
A mile away , your rocket retro- thrusts its way gently to the ground …
Together , the two plan to demonstrate a record - breaking 120,000 - foot jump by 2009 , and the truly unprecedented 60 - mile space dive within two years — an audacious timetable .
If all goes well , they ’ll reach even higher .
“ Our ultimate goal , ” Tumlinson says , “ is to have individual human beings return from orbit alive . ”
That ’s a drop from 150 miles — or more — involving increased heat and near - deadly Gs , essentially turning their divers into human meteorites .

Executive summary of the other important conclusions of this motion
( p100 - p102 ) :
[...]
Novell is entitled to a declaration of rights under its Fourth Claim for
Relief that it was and is entitled , at its sole discretion , to direct SCO to
waive its claims against IBM and Sequent [...]
[...]
The court further concludes that because a portion of SCOs 2003 Sun and
Microsoft Agreements indisputably licenses SVRX products listed under Item VI of
Schedule 1.1 ( a ) to the APA , even if only incidental to a license for UnixWare ,
SCO is obligated under the APA to account for and pass through to Novell the
appropriate portion relating to the license of SVRX products .
Because SCO failed
to do so , it breached its fiduciary duty to Novell under the APA and is liable
for conversion .[...]
The court , however , is precluded from granting a constructive trust with respect
to the payments SCO received under the 2003 Sun and Microsoft Agreements because
there is a question of fact as to the appropriate amount of SVRX Royalties SCO
owes to Novell [... ] .

The case was not about copyright ownership , but about slander of title .
Now
could not SCO at least get a ruling on attempted slander of title , on the basis
that Novell could not possibly have believed to own the copyrights even though
it did ?
Something like that .
Or so .
Anyway , let 's hope that the court handed SCO enough rope to hang itself on three
or four gallows .
And what does this mean for the counterclaims ?
License money , enough to let SCO
go broke .
Will they survive long enough to see their other cases thrown out of
court ?
Basically this leaves only the IBM case , and on the flimsiest legal theories .

As a bit of color commentary on the timing :
Judicial clerks , the judicial assistants who go to work for judges usually right
out of law school , generally work for a judge for a year or two , and generally
from September to September .
They also tend to do the heavy lifting on opinions
like this , and can have a lot of institutional knowledge on particular cases in
their heads .
I suspect that this opinion came out now because it needed to be
finished before the current clerk ( s ) left and the new clerk ( s ) came on board .
This way , Judge Kimball does n't have to get yet another clerk up to speed on the
case . [ Reply to This | # ]

So ... the big question : Will SCOG accept they went down the wrong path completely when they decided to sue IBM or will they still - being as stuborn as they seem to be - insist that they 're in the right ?
My vote is that they 'll insist IBM is all about the contract and that the ownership of the Unix copyrights means nothing because they still control IBM 's works due to the contract interpretation .
After all , they 've used that line already in a few places .

I UNDERSTAND that this is only the Novell case , and IBM , Red Hat and AutoZone
still wait in the wings for their day ...
I UNDERSTAND that this does n't settle all claims on both sides , that we still
have some work to do on what remains ...
I UNDERSTAND that we 've only just scratched the surface on this , what with the
litany train of appeals to come ...
With that said , I just have two words :
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Okay , now that I have that out of my system , this weekend should be about
getting the decision transcribed into plain text , finding out what motions are
still on the table , analyze what this moots in the IBM case as well as RH / AZ ,
and seeing where we go next .
It 's far from over , and the case has been on a downhill slide for some time now ,
but I think we 've reached the point where spin just ain't gonna cover it up any
more .
I think there are also implications with this in terms of the Novell / Microsoft
deal .
Does their ownership of the UNIX copyrights give them an upper hand in
that relationship , or will we see the agreement start to wither ?
Or was the
upfront money that MS ponied up on that deal a portent that Bill et al truly
knew the UNIX technology which Microsoft has dutifully licensed for years ,
stayed with Novell after all ?
There is work to be done , but tonight , everybody raise a
glass / mug / flagon / container of choice in the air and celebrate a milestone .

I 'm double - dog glad that Judge Kimball issued the ruling we 've all been
anticipating , and the the bad guys did n't win .
My only complaint is that the plaintiff of these cases was able to drag them out
for * over 4 years * before the first seriously dispositive ruling was issued .
To put this in perspective : I became an IBM employee a few months after the SCO
debacle started .
I worked there for four years , following the SCO cases here at
Groklaw for most of that time .
Then I quit my job and moved on to a new job , 9
months ago .
And its only now that SCO is finally getting the proper slapdown that it was
obvious ( by 2004 at the latest ) that they deserved .

I like how Judge Kimball very clearly distinguishes between " Santa

extent of replacing something ( presumably " SCO " ) with " [ Santa
Cruz ] " in quoted passages ( e.g. on page 7 of the ruling , where he quotes
from the APA )

How will this affect the IBM case ?
Also , I guess SCO 's slander accusation is void now .
I hope IBM wo n't stop now , and they will prove that SCO knew they had no
copyrights .
So IBM could move forward , and eventually criminal charges agains
McBride and Co. could be filed as well .
Maybe even M$ 's role is revealed as
well ?
Yeah , i know i want too much :)

It is my understanding that if an officer of a company breaches his or her
fucidiary duty they can be held personally liable .
The court ruled SCO breached
its fucidiary duty .
Is there any way Novell can now hold the corporate oficers
liable for SCO breaching that duty , since they had a fucidiary duty to the
company and it was by their management the company breached its duty ?

Entertaining quote from SCO 's website :D
http://www.sco.com/scoip/lawsuits/ibm/index.html
On March 6 , 2003 , The SCO Group filed a civil lawsuit against IBM .
SCO's
principal claims arise out of IBM 's alleged breaches of its obligations under
UNIX license agreements that IBM and Sequent , a company now owned by IBM ,
entered into with AT&T in 1985 .
SCO claims that IBM violated those
agreements when it removed substantial source code from AIX and Dynix , two
UNIX - based products , and dumped that code into Linux .
In addition to multiple
claims for breach of contract , SCO claims that IBM infringed SCO's UNIX
copyrights ;
SCO never owned the UNIX copyrights so the above quote must be a lie .. finally
proven wooot go novell ! [ Reply to This | # ]
Authored by : sirwired on Friday , August 10 2007 @ 06:29 PM EDT
Finally , we know why the copyrights did n't transfer .
Throughout all this copyright tussling and APA Amendment tussling , SCO has
repeatedly asked why they would have paid money for UNIX and
< i> not </i> picked up the copyrights .
I actually thought it was a
pretty good question , even if the documents were clear in the fact that the
copyrights did not transfer .
If you look starting at page 9 or so , you see some declarations I do n't think we
have seen before ( correct me if I am wrong ) stating that SCO could not have
afforded the copyrights , and all they were buying from Novell was the right to
develop their own product based on UNIX .
In addition , the deal was structured
in such a way that if SCO went bankrupt , no title to anything UNIX ( other than
the development rights ) would be part of the bankruptcy estate .
Not even the
license revenue .
( Which is why it was 100 % passed - through to Novell , and then
5 % went back to SCO .
If SCO had taken ownership of the revenue and instead
required to send 95 % of it to Novell , Novell would have just been another
creditor in a bankruptcy . )

No !
This is terrible news !
I kid , of course , but this ruling does have one minor drawback : the question of whether any " stolen " code ever did make it into Linux will now never be examined .
I mean , most of us realize how stupid it would be to steal code just to post it publicly where millions of people can see it , and that stealing GPL 'd code by proprietary developers is far more common .
And now we 've lost an opportunity to drive that point home , and rub it in the face of those who like to accuse FLOSS developers of being a bunch of renegade hippy pirates .
I would rather have seen a ruling on IBM "s alleged infringement of SCO 's alleged copyrights before it was decided that SCO did n't own bupkiss .
I suspect that IBM would have rathered that as well .
But oh well .
I also wish this ruling had come a couple of days earlier .
Linuxworld in San Francisco ended yesterday .
If this ruling had come in during the conference , there would have been dancing in the halls .
I would have loved to have seen that ! :) ---

SCO 's " evidence " about the intent of the APA was pathetic .
Novell had
the actual folks that drafted the agreement , and of course , the plain language
of the agreement itself .
What did SCO counter with ?
A bunch of folks that knew about the agreement , read it while it was being
drafted , in some cases revised it themselves , but all of whom were somehow
surprised that it did n't transfer copyrights , even though it was as plain as day
in the APA .
How exactly did they expect to win bupkis with these clowns ?

Kimball tells SCO that no , SCO does not own the copyrights .
Not from the APA ,
and not from Ammendment 2 .
Not in 1995 , not in 1996 , not in 2003 , and not in
2007 .
Just NO !

PS : For those wondering , 1995 was the APA , 1996 was the ammendment , 2003 was

Not withstanding a few loose threads , ( albeit very strained threads ) , they have
comprehensively * lost * against Novell and IBM .
The Summary Judgment now affirms Novell is the owner of Unix - This means that
when SCO goes broke ( I suspect sometime in the next two weeks ! )
The Unix
Copyrights can only flow back to a Linux " friend " ( fiend ? ) as a court
has proved so without any room for doubt .
Bankruptcy administrators can't sell
this " asset " off to recover money ...
Microsoft can't get to it -
Novell is in a strong position .
If Novell moves this code to the Public domain , Microsoft would be left a
" shag on a rock " with their Linux " patent " threat .
I 'd love
to see that , but I 'm not sure if they will ....

I highly doubt it was the right to use Novell's
patents .
By Monday , I expect to see an announcement by R. Hovsepian of Novell regarding
' good will ' and ' co- operation ' and ' industry leadership ' , which will boil down
to letting TSG do whatever they want , as long as they recognize Novell's
controlling interest .
This is not over , not by a long shot .

No matter how big a " win " this turns out to be for Novell and
subsequently IBM ( and will they really win if they can't recover their costs
from a bankrupt company ? ) :
There 's still something massively broken in the system that allowed the case to
continue for this many years without SCO being forced to present some up - front
prima facie evidence that they had a case to argue .
The problem appears to be the US's " discovery " mechanism - " we
honestly , truly , believe that x did us wrong so we want to go on a three - year
fishing expedition to see if we 're right " .
Instead of - " here is some hard , irrefutable , evidence that x has done us
wrong - we now need discovery of y and z to quantify the extent of that wrong
and identify who the specific guilty people are " .
It 's my understanding - correct me if I 'm wrong - that the latter is how the UK
legal system works .
Certainly , the only cases I know of in the UK that have ever run this long are
antitrust / fraud style cases brought by the government and / or its agencies
against multinationals .
No simple copyright / contract case between two private companies could possibly
survive more than a month without the judge seeing solid prima facie evidence
that a violation of civil or criminal law had occurred .
In the case of SCO v World + Cat that would have been something like the
infringing code - * presented on the first day of the trial !!!*
Having worked for the last couple of years in a legal firm ( in IT , not law ) , and
in reading Groklaw over the same period , I 've now got a massively higher opinion
of lawyers than I used to have .
But you guys over there in the US need to put some brakes on their antics in

I do n't know if anyone else noticed , but Kimball cited an important paraphrase
from the Sun agreement .
As I 've long assumed , Sun 's deal w/ SCOX was so they could open source Solaris ,
which is pretty much canonical SVRX because it was a joint development effort
between Sun and AT&T that gave rise to SVRX .
The operative word is " disclose " ( p. 40 of the ruling PDF ) in both
" source and object ( binary ) code " .
At the same time that SCOX was suing IBM for $ 4 billion ( or whatever that number
morphed into ;-) for disclosing SVRX source code and methods in Linux ( pure BS
as we 've seen ) , they sold Sun the rights to disclose SVRX in Solaris for $ 10
million .
As I see it , even if SCOX won the IBM case ( which seems completely impossible to
me ) , they placed a valuation on the disclosure of SVRX source code that would
limit damages to less than they 've spent on legal fees .
Of course , the really delicious part is that as far as I can see ( IANAL ) , the
Novell trial will be not about how much Novell owes SCOX , but how much SCOX owes
Novell .
What a lovely day !

Judge Kimball asks the parties , in view of the ruling in Novell , which " significantly impacts the claims and counterclaims asserted " in IBM , to prepare by August 31 a statement of its view of the status of this case and , more specifically , the effect of the SCO v. Novell decision on each of the pending motions . "
How long did Kimball consider the PSJ's ?
Months and months and months .
That Kimball is giving the parties just 3 weeks to assess his rulings ' impact on SCO v. IBM is very telling .
I think he thinks there is very little left to decide .

What a way to start the day !
( morning in Western Australia ) .
Congratulations to the Novell and IBM teams for showing us how to litigate with
honour .
Thanks to BSF for demonstrating the opposite ( ' nuf said ) .
Thanks to PJ for keeping a calm , firm guiding hand on the crazy circus that was
the coverage and discussion of the case .
Imagine if , for the past three to four
years , we 'd only heard about this in the press ( SCO's PR , ' fake ' Dan Lyons , the
MOGster , etc. ) .
Sure , there were some other informative community sources out
there , and kudos to them , but Groklaw quickly became ground zero .
Apart from the
lawyers , has anyone had to work as hard as PJ during this ?
Keeping the
information and analysis flowing ?
Keeping the signal to noise ratio as high as
possible ?
No .
Thank goodness for PJ 's passion for the law and her passion to get
to the truth .
Through Groklaw and its sharp - eyed community , PJ demonstrated the power of the
" many eyes make all bugs shallow " approach .
In this case , it 's
" many eyes make all lies shallow . "
There will be appeals , I suppose , and mopping up , and who knows what other
twists and turns remain -- e.g. Hovsepian still worries me , and I wonder if he
too will try to ' monetize '
Unix now that the ownership is clear .
But today is a day to celebrate and reflect and be thankful .
To that end , let me
be the 236,418th to punch the air and voice a mighty " W00T ! "
Reap what you sow , Darl and Ralph !

Happy with the decision today .
But , I think many here , even PJ , still do n't get
it .
The point of this lawsuit was not to " win . "
Not in the sense of a
final court decision .
The point of this lawsuit was to exist - to cast a cloud
of doubt over the legality of Linux .
That , and of course , to make some money for
scox execs .
Before the scam : scox was as good as dead anyway .
Look at their financials if
you do n't believe me .
You may have noticed that it is usually not the strong

I think not .
If I claimed I owned the Brooklyn
bridge , and I sued NYC over it .
And I cost NYC $ 100 million in legal defense .
Then after an astonishing 4.5 years the court finally discovers what was obvious
from the start - that , of course , I do n't own the Brooklyn bridge : would that
show the justice system as being brilliant , or incompetent ?
I doubt I can expect
any honesty from that question .

This ruling , as far as I can understand , is merely a ruling on a contract
between two competing parties .
It has nothing whatsoever to do with the GPL or
GNU / Linux or Free Software .
The GPL remains untested .
I actually would have
preferred to see SCO win against Novell and then have to contend with the mighty
IBM machine .
At this point , all of IBM 's footwork and steelclad lawyering is
moot , if I understand correctly .
So , Free Software has received a setback because of the bad publicity .
M$ succeeded in using proxies in a conflict , and suffered no negative
ramifications .
IBM now will have little to no chance to hone it 's GPL defense skills in what
looked to be a " all but sure to win " practice run .
The GPL remains untested .
Free Software remains under threat from the M$ juggernaut .
BTW , I will no longer use the term Open Source or Open Source Software .
I will
use strictly the terms Free Software when referring to the movement as a whole ,
and the term GNU / Linux when referring to the operating system commonly known as
Linux .
PJ , I love you for what you 've done , and I understand everyone 's desire to
gloat , but methinks the battle has just been enjoined .
What we 've seen thus far
is naught more than M$ testing the waters to see which strategies could bear
fruit .

It looks to me like some of SCOs remaining claims only remain because Kimball has drastically narrowed their scope .
Re unfair competition :
The license in the APA and the TLA does not preclude Novell from pursing its business .
Rather , the license merely restricts Novell 's ability to use SCO 's property and is part of an ongoing relationship between the parties .
So SCOs unfair competition claims seem limited to Novell 's use of SCOs property ( presumably Unix / UnixWare derivatives ) rather than Novell 's business in general .
Sounds like a major limitation to me .

Among other important points , Judge Kimball ruled that Novell did not transfer
the copyrights to Unix SVRX ( and other versions ) to SCO and that it retained the
right to waive violations of the provisions of the SVRX licenses .
It appears that the issue of whether Linux infringes SVRX copyrights is still an
open question .
In his ruling , the judge seemed to imply that the license from
Novell to Santa Cruz gave Santa Cruz the right to prosecute actions for
infringement of the copyrights .
Specifically at issue is whether the sale of
SUSE Linux by Novell violates the terms of its TLA and whether this infringes
SCO 's rights ( as licensee under the APA ) in the SVRX Copyrights .
While Novell
can waive the claims against existing licensees ( e.g. IBM ) , it cannot waive
copyright infringement claims against those who do not hold a license .
It would appear that the question of whether Linux infringes ( Novell's )
copyrights is still open and it would appear that by way of the APA and the
license (s ) granted by it , SCO has the right to pursue claims against non-SVRX
licensees who they claim infringe the copyrights .
Do n't misinterpret what I am saying , I do n't agree that Linux infringes the
copyrights , only that those claims are not yet settled .
The trial of the claims
for breach of contract and copyright infringement against Novell for the sale /
distribution of SUSE Linux , which survive this ruling may ( should ) decide that ,
but the question seems to be very much open in a legal sense .
Am I wrong ? [ Reply to This | # ]

Now that , after the appeals and / or accounts run dry , we can safely assume that
Novell will be compensated with the dry husk of SCO .
It seems like it would then
be up to Novell to decide how to manage IBM 's counterclaims .
Some folks have
bemoaned the fact that , due to Novell going first , IBM did not have the
opportunity to get Linux declared clean of infringing code .
Is it possible that
something like this could be worked out in a settlement between IBM and Novell ?
Or are IBM 's counterclaims really toast ? [ Reply to This | # ]

Whilst the judges ruling that Novell owns the Unix and Unixware copyrights is
welcome it does not exactly come as a surprise .
Moreover , the good news is sadly
tarnished by the dishonourable deal which Novell reached with MS .
Methinks we
need to see some more convincing developments which undercut the MS monopoly
such as a decision by ISO to deny OOXML their seal of approval .
The imminent end of SCO 's bogus cases against Novell , IBM and Red Hat is indeed
a blessing but we still badly need eternal vigilance .

So what if
Novell tries to do the same thing .
Not to stop linux , but to be the only people
who can legally distribute linux ?
What is to stop Novell from starting the whole process again ?
Would IBM fight
again , or tired of the litigation

Not so fast !
The court did not rule that SCO - created copyrighted code ( derivative code ) belongs to Novell .
I believe that means SCO does own its own " Unix " copyrights and those copyrights could still allow SCO to argue that Linux is in violation of SCO - owned Unix copyrights .

I wonder if Darl thinks that opening up the second law suit and suing Novell for
slander of Title was a good move after all .
Had he not there might have actually
been some other issues on the table with regard to the IBM lawsuit .
This ruling
effectively wipes out the majority of the IBM case , although should SCO survive
the next few months they might still be able to get Novell on the no-compete
clause , but I do n't remember if Novell or SCO breached first .

The court also acknowledged that SCO owns copyrights on the derivative code it
created under the contract with Novell .
Does n't that mean that SCO owns Unix
copyrights irregardless of the finding that Novell did n't transfer Novell's
copyrights ?
Methinks that leaves SCO enough wiggle room to still be a nuisance .

All right , all you Doubting Thomases .
I double dog dare you to complain
about the US court system now .
</ blockquote >
< p >I accept that dare .
It has taken the US court system three years to
agree
that a contract avaialble since before the start of the case did not transfer
copyright to SCO .
In that three years , multiple summary judgement requests
on this very point have been denied , IBM and Novell have had to spend tens
of millions of dollars against a baseless claim .
Money that SCO can not repay
even if the court orders them to .
And this does not count for the massive
costs IBM had to pay to comply with SCO 's discovery orders for code the court
now recognizes was not theirs for violations the court now recognizes Novell
properly waived .
</ p>
< p>Before this case started , SCO was teetering on the edge of bankruptcy .
This case provided SCO , the corporation , with massive capital infusions and a
new lease on life .
It has provided SCO directors not just with an opportunity
to profit from stock sales , but a paying job for much longer than it seemed
like SCO would last in 2002 .
</ p>
< p>In short , while this ruling is a tremendous victory against SCO , it has
come several years too late to restore my ( lack of ) confidence in the US justice
system .
I will remind everyone that SCO made similar threats against Linux in
Germany , and a German court was able to stop SCO within 3 weeks .

The purity of Linux with respect to SVRx may not get settled directly as a
result of this order .
It was not one of the issues raised in either the IBM or
Novell case .
It was an issue in the Red Hat case , but only with respect to SCO .
With tSCOg not having the copyrights , the issue becomes moot .
The question is how can a definitive settlement of this issue can be reached ?
I 'm not a lawyer so this is speculation .
Novell , as the nominal copyright holder is key to any solution .
Without their
cooperation , getting an answer becomes much more difficult .
Is it in their
interest to see the issue settled ?
Assuming that it is in their interest and they are willing to cooperate , what
could be done ?
The first step would be a real examination of the SVRx and Linux code .
That
suggests a community project .
A major problem is assuring those that study the
SVRx code will not get tarred by the ' contamination ' brush tSCOg was waving
around .
This would require Novell to provide an ' anti- NDA ' .
Something like the
FSF would need to review it .
Other issues concern resources and methodology .
If the study reaches a conclusion and any problems found can be resolved , the
next question is how to assure that the results are a proper legal precident .
No answers , just questions ...

How much of the ruling directly applies to the IBM case ?
Clearly the part about Novell waiving the contract claims , which certainly takes
most of the ( hot ) air out of SCO 's case .
But does the whole decision transfer
over ?
Is n't the decision based on the evidence presented in this case ?
Could SCO
argue that there was evidence presented in the IBM case that was not presented
in the Novell case .
Or information not presented in the IBM case that was
presented in the Novell case that would change the the outcome ?
Is this why IBM asked to have all the material from the Novell case admitted
into the IBM case ?

Wired said there was a response from SCO on their website , at
http://www.sco.com/scoip/lawsuits/novell/index.html
But , when I went to check , the website was down .
The whole website .
Which
speaks well of their site maintenance , the reliability of the software that runs
it , or how quickly the power company decides whether bills are likely to get

I think I have changed my mind .
Is it possible for Novell and SCOG to settle
over the last of the issues rather than go to jury trial ?
Novell know they are not going to get much of the Sun & Microsoft money .
Perhaps the two sides will do a deal to clear the non-compete and conversion
issues .
Now the big issues are settled it seems pointless to take these side
issues to the wire .
IBM , of course , are still putting their plans to lay waste to SCOG and salt the
earth .
The embarrassment of losing to Novell in no way compensates for the
impugnment of IBM 's reputation .
Settle ?
As if !

So , PJ , you think that this latest ruling vindicates your claims that SCO was full of hot air and bluster ?
You think that they mean that your predictions of ultimate SCO ruin were accurate ?
You think that you think this means that it's all over for SCO but the moaning an knashing of SCO executive teeth , as they worry about the counter - claims ??
You think that this means the death of one more Redmond - financed attack on Linux ?
You think that you now have the right to sit back , suck on a thick , dark piece of chocolate an celebrate ?
Well , well .. well . . .

SCO beleives the recent decision by Judge Kimball reinforces our position .
The court ruled that " Novell 's slander of title claim is still at
issue . "
This directly contradicts Novell 's claim that we slnadered their title .
SCOs copyright entitlements are upheld by the court when it states
" The court also concludes that , to the extent that SCO has a copyright to
enforce , SCO can simultaneously pursue both a copyright infringement claim and
a breach of contract claim . "
Additionally the court has scolded Novell by declaring " The court denies
Novell 's Ninth Claim for Relief for an accounting . "
We beleive that this case is leaning towards a final declaration in favor
of SCO and we fully expect the court to award SCO the punitive and compensetory
relief we are seeking from Novell .

I think Novell 's slander of title counterclaim will be interesting .
For their
counterclaim , they have to establish that Novell has the copyrights ( done ) , SCO
does n't have the copyrights ( done ) , there were special damages ( I think we can
say that , because Novell had to defend itself in a court case because of SCO's
false claims ) .
The open question is that of malice . < br >< br >
I think the criterion is whether SCO could have reasonably assumed that they
own the copyrights .
It has been ruled now that their assumption was wrong , but
was it ever reasonable , was it made up maliciously , or was it one grand self -
delusion ? [ Reply to This | # ]

I asked a question on Slashdot a while back about what the equivalent to open

Soon after that , PJ started Groklaw , answering my question in a very positive
way .
Now we 're seeing the fruits of that first build of open source law .
And not only
that , but we 've all learned so much about patents and copyrights and contracts
along the way .

Because the constructive trust was denied ( dispute of amount ) , SCOX can wait
until it 's decided to have to restate their accounts for the past 4 years , but
that time will most assuredly occur , possibly even if the firm goes into Chapter
13 - indeed at that time it 's quite probable imo .
On a related note , Darl got his $ 1 m bonus based on a profitable quarter , as I
recall .
Once that quarter is restated with no profit , he may ( or may not ) be
liable to refund it as he knew , or should have known , that the money on the
balance sheet did not then and does not now belong to SCOX .
The extensive use of
' plain language of the contract / clause ' in the decision might help that happen .
Sarbanes - Oxley anyone ?

If this fight had been between Linus and SCO Linus would have lost years ago despite not a single legal difference in the issues at hand .
What made the system " work " was injections of huge amounts of cash and time , neither of which the real creator (s ) of Linux would have had access to without the ( much appreciated ) help of IBM and others .

However , as of 11 August , 2007 , @ 0745 , SCO , by way of its ' website ; see below , continues to claim ( that ) : " Linux is a registered trademark of Linus Torvalds .

While I would not wish to dampen the happy sprints of those calibrating personal I do n't see anything worth me popping a cork for .
This is a ruling on who does or does not own some propriety chuck of closed source software .
Unix is dead , long live Linux .
The only relevance this decision has for me is in that it allows the SCO v IBM case to go forward .
So the following questions are in my mind :
If SCO appeal against this decision while that cause additional delay to the IBM case ?
If SCO now owes Novell more money than is has and declares itself bankrupt what happens to the IBM case ?
As SCO does n't own the copyright to Unix how could they grant Sun a license to open Solaris ?
And if they could n't is n't Sun now in volition of copyright law ?
Could n't Novell now sue Sun ( assuming they can prove ownership , after all they did that deal with Microsoft which was n't exactly in the spirit of Free Software ) ?
I thought Groklaw was now dedicated to looking at the legal issues surrounding Open Source and Free Software .
For me that means that the IBM counterclaims which involve the GPL are the important stuff , everything is just bumf , stuff we had to wade through to get to the stuff that matters .
Dobbo Bumf is British slang and is short for bum ( more British slang for backside ) fodder .
I believe if comes from WWII where unwanted printed material was cut into little sheets , tied together with little bits of string and then hung on a nail next to the toilet .

As I expected , Novell has won the most important aspects of this case , and frankly I 'm glad that part of the case /s is over .
Now Novell has to decide what to do with the Unix System V Release X source trees it has the copyright to , since the whole farce has shown rather too openly one of the major problems with the " Intellectual Property Rights " regime currently in force - namely , that deeply hidden historical facts in a science and commercial field as rapidly moving as the computer one is , can turn toxic .
And that therefore , a cleansing of the stables is best before , not after , they turn into the Augean Stables .
Since the SVRx source tree is arguably - and provably - obsolete in the sense that Linux became its equal in about 1996 - 98 , and since there is a group of Unix fans with a suitable web site , my suggestion to Novell is to put it out to pasture , under a suitable OSI - approved license - the GPL v3 would occur to some to be the most appropriate , while other people would argue most strenuously for the BSD or MIT X11 license ;)
And simultaneously issue a declaration that the requirement for a Unix System V Release x license that bedevilled the likes of the OSF / 1 operating system , and similar requirements for other related Unix - based or Unix - like operating systems , was waived , and The Open Group could release as much of the source tree of OSF / 1 as it could , at its discretion .
( actually , the GPL v3 license would be best insofar as it would kill at least two birds with one stone - its software patent provisions would kill off the threat of SVRx and SVRx - based software patents haunting the Free and Open Source Software communities ; and releasing it under the new GPL version would help mollify those amongst us who had written Novell off completely following its " patent peace " with Microsoft .
It would n't mend bridges completely , but being willing to assign a former valuable commercial property to the care of the community , and also sink any related submarine patent threats , would show a care for community values .
my 0.02 c worth . ;)
Of course , Novell could also do something to build bridges , based on its possession of the Unix System V Release x source trees and copyrights thereto - it could do a study of Microsoft 's entire software patent portfolio , comparing and contrasting it with the " methods and concepts " known and used in Unix .
Then it could do a compare and contrast between Unix and Linux and Microsoft Windows , and point out the not - so - novel aspects of the latter .
Microsoft 's in great need of the exercise back - pedalling on its claims of software patents willfully violated by Linux hackers , would provide .
Well , that 's my 0.02 c worth .
Novell is welcome to make whatever use of it that it feels is useful .

Whoah , hold on there .
Are you seriously suggesting that if after several years the courts FINALLY reach the conclusion that was obvious to every informed person from the very first day , this should inspire confidence in the legal system ?
Because , speaking as someone outside the legal profession , I am not reassured .
This thing has been going on since 2002 , and SCO never at any time had anything that even vaguely resembled a legitimate case , but our legal system has allowed them to significantly harrass a number of parties with obviously - spurious suits for the better part of a decade .

Among other items that Hizzoner cites are the evidence that SCOX in general , including Darl and Ralph in particular , knew from the outset that they did n't have the Unix copyrights .

Think again , or be blindsided .
This case has entered a new phase .

Microsoft had already seen this outcome and has been preparing the

Conrad Black 's recent white collar crookery fraud convictions pales in
comparison to SCO 's pretending to " own " something it never did .
All
one needs to do is read SCO 's ( et al. ) prospecti filed with the S.E.C. to see
what SCO has been telling shareholders about what SCO " owns " .
Black could get up to 35 years in jail for just 3 fraud convictions .
I wonder
what the count would be for SCO ( et al . ) ?

The court has ruled that SCOG owes Novell $ BIGNUM for the Microsoft and Sun
licences .
Under UK law ( how does USA law apply ) Novell could now issue a Statutary Demand
claiming in detail the amounts owed and go direct to a Summary Bankruptcy
Petition .
At that point SCOX would have 2 options , the debt having already been proven :-
1 ) Pay the entire amount within 14 days or be automatically bankrupt .
2 ) Petition the Bankruptcy Court disputing in full and specific detail some
detailed items not clearly covered by the judgement within 14 days AND pay the
undisputed amounts within 14 days or be automatically bankrupt .
END of story .
But probably not quite as simple in the USA ?.

It was a long time coming .
Wow .
The Judge clearly was able to sort through all
the bullhockey and focus on the issues .
I also noticed that his decisions were near mirrors of PJ's many analysis 's of
the various filings over all these years .
Way to go PJ !
I have read the the ruling a couple of times now .
I note that SCO can persue
Novell on " breach of contract " for their distribution of Suse linux as
a competing product .
I 'm surprised no one has commented on this .
There is no mention of SCO
distributing linux - and even being a linux company - itself for years .
IBM has
pointed this out about a million times in their filings and it should be
interesting what the Judge has to say in that case .
I guess I 'm wondering what will happen if the judge ( in IBM ) says " SCO -
you did it too ( distributed linux ) " and how that will tie back to any small
hope SCO has left in this case .
Seems odd that SCO could sue Novell for distributing Suse linux as a
" competing product " when SCO did the exact same thing .
I am certain
that the judge will have much to say about it .
In any case , it will be fun watching the final pieces come together as SCO is
crushed into dust .
We know SCO never gives up .
I fully expect to see SCO file an appeal that the
" judge got it wrong because .... " .
Overall it 's a wonderful day for PJ , open source , and for all of us who have
watched this for years .

Novell is asking the court for money from SCO and will probably be awarded more money than SCO has .
Novell can probably bankrupt SCO without anybody else 's help .
IBM has counterclaims against SCO that IBM can pursue .
IBM has not named any amounts yet but IBM could possibly bankrupt SCO without anybody else 's help .
Red Hat has sued Novell for damages .
The Red Hat case has been stalled forever but it will probably start up again as SCO 's cases against Novell and IBM swiftly unravel .
Hopefully Red Hat will be able to do SCO serious damage in Red Hat v SCO .
SCO v AutoZone has been stalled for a long time .
I think that AutoZone is not so much interested in punishing SCO as to just getting SCO out of their hair .
Hopefully the Novell ruling will give AutoZone their wish .
The U.S. Federal government has done nothing about the crimes committed in association with this case .
One reason may be that the Federal government is reluctant to intervene while the case is in civil court .
If so , then the SEC may now enter the fray .
Here is a list of thinks the SEC could investigate .

my sco source tells me that there are now 2 factions in sco management :
optimists and pessimists .
it is unclear which faction will emerge on top .
the pessimists draw pretty much the obvious conclusions from the ruling , and are
talking to the press .
the optimists are biting their tongues and want to press
on .
the optimists believe that sco is still in with a chance to get a decent
settlement .
their reasoning is :
- they avoided the bullet of the constructive trust
- some portion of the sun and ms revenues will need to go to novell , but it will
be considerably less than 95 % ( if it was 95 % then novell would have already been
awarded the money ) .
all the witnesses to the sun and ms deals are either sco ,
sun or ms employees , and all will argue the deals are mainly about unixware and
sco derivative code , and not really much about legacy svrx code / licenses .
- kimball did n't give novell anything on the linux licenses like ev1 .
he did n't
require sco to give an accounting ( in fact he ruled in sco's favor on this one ) .
he did n't classify linux scosource as svrx .
so sco can keep 100 % of future
linux licenses as well as money from previous linux licenses .
- yes kimball said the original unix copyrights belong to novell .
but kimball
also said that the derivative copyrights for sco's versions of unix ( i.e. open
server and unixware ) belong to sco .
sco still have a copyright claim against
novell for infringement of these copyrights .
sco also have breach of contract
( the non-compete ) and unfair competition claims for infringement of these
copyrights .
- they accept sco will lose on novell 's slander of title claim , but damages
novell wins on this claim will be minimal ( things like some attorney fees on
researching and filing copyrights ) .
so for sco vs novell at trial , they think :
- sco will be able to win some copyright related damages from novell , under
copyright , unfair competition and contract ( non-compete theories )
- novell will be able to win some percentage ( much less than 95 % ) of sun and ms
deals .
- novell will win nominal slander of title damages from sco
=> overall : sco comes out ahead in turns of damages won
plus , they still have the derivative code owned by sco stick to scare up some
sco -source licenses .
in fact , they will argue to potential licensees , that
their copyrights though narrower than they originally thought , have now been
confirmed by the court .
now sco v ibm : :
yes , they lose on their contract claims against ibm
but they believe they can make their 5th cause of action , the copyright claim ,
potentially winnable by focusing on derivative code owned by sco found in linux ,
rather than on unix code in linux , or ibm's continued distribution of aix .
they think they can also get some damages on unfair competition and interference
with contract ( but not ibm interference with the novell contract ) .
as far ibm counterclaims are concerned
- the contract claims - they believe they are safe because ibm can't show they
did n't have a good faith belief in their termination , etc .
- the lanham act and slander claims - most of their comments are privileged ,
some nominal damages to ibm
- gpl stuff - ibm may win on these , but they do n't think the damages will be
anything but nominal
=> overall : sco comes out ahead in turns of damages won
so , if both cases go to trial , they think they 'll survive , still have a stick to
beat linux with , and maybe even come out slightly ahead .
and then , they 'll
appeal and try and get some of issues they lost on overturned .
they see
themselves continuing to inflict pain on ibm , novell and linux for several more
years ... unless they are paid off .

MS afraid of other than the facts that their claims will be proven false ?

This opens the door for slander of title , plus the funding by Microsoft has got
to be dug through .
Any chance of seeing Bill Gates prosecuted under RICO ?

Looking at pp. 28 - 29 it could n't be much clearer .
Darl is contacting Novell over and over again about getting the copyrights .
He knew he did n't have them and he also knew that Novell was refusing to give them , but SCO went on with the SCOsource initiative anyway .
So the bottom line to me is ( 1 ) he knew he did n't have them , and ( 2 ) he knew that Novell was n't just going to give them to him .
So he could n't possibly know that they would ever get them .
Obviously the only way to get them would have been to sue for them .
So why did n't they sue , if you want to assume that they had a chance of winning the suit and getting them ?
I guess because it would have been abundantly clear to everyone ( even the EV1's of the world ) that they did n't own any copyrights and did n't have a basis for the SCOSource licensing racket .
But if they thought they had a real chance to get them , would n't they have sued anyway and said to potential licensees " buy the license for $ 699 now , or it will be $ 2,000 when we win the lawsuit and we WILL win the lawsuit . " .
Instead , once Novell did n't go in on the scheme and told the world SCO did n't have the copyrights , they thought it was better to pretend they had them and do a slander - of - title suit ?
Maybe Darl really believed ( though I doubt it ) that it was a clerical error that the copyrights were not transferred to the original SCO , but the fact is he knew they did n't since he was asking for them .
I know they had
A new poll shows that fewer Americans view the Republican Party as “ friendly to religion ” than a year ago , with the decline particularly steep among Catholics and white evangelical Protestants — constituencies at the core of the Republicans ’ conservative Christian voting bloc .
The survey found that the proportion of Americans who say the Republican Party is friendly to religion fell 8 percentage points in the last year , to 47 percent , from 55 percent .
Among Catholics and white evangelical Protestants , the decline was 14 percentage points .
The Democratic Party suffers from the perception of an even more drastic religion deficit , but that is not new .
Just 26 percent of poll respondents said the Democratic Party is friendly to religion , down from 29 percent last year .
The telephone poll , conducted by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life and the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press , was conducted July 6 to 19 among 2,003 adults .
The margin of sampling error was 3 to 4 percentage points , depending on the question .
A team of astronomers has discovered that tiny Mercury has a molten core , just like our own planet .
The discovery was made using three ground - based radio observatories that bounced radio waves off the planet , and then analyzed the return signals .
Before this research , scientists were divided about the structure of Mercury .
Most models predicted that it has an iron - rich core , but it was n’t known if it had completely cooled , or was still liquid inside .
Trace quantities of sulfur and other chemicals could have mixed in with the planet while it was forming , and this kept it from completely solidifying over time .
The astronomers first beamed a series of radio waves at the surface of Mercury , and then measured them as they bounced off the surface and returned to Earth .
The returned signals were analyzed by a trio of radio telescopes : the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico , NSF ’s Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope , and the NASA / JPL 70 - meter antenna at Goldstone , California .
They were able to detect a wobbling of the signal that was double what you would expect from a planet with a solid core , but exactly the right amount for a planet with a liquid core .
Their research is the cover story of the May 4 , 2007 edition of the Journal Science .

Something does n't add up here , eh ?
Just yesterday , Helen Cooper , Mark Mazzetti , and Jim Rutenberg reported for The New York Times on " Saudis ’ Role in Iraq Frustrates U.S. Officials " .
Specifically :
One senior administration official says he has seen evidence that Saudi Arabia is providing financial support to opponents of Mr. Maliki .
He declined to say whether that support was going to Sunni insurgents because , he said , “ That would get into disagreements over who is an insurgent and who is not . ”
The officials speaking to The New York Times had to stay anonymous because " openly criticizing Saudi Arabia would further alienate the Saudi royal family at a time when the United States is still trying to enlist Saudi support for Mr. Maliki and the Iraqi government , and for other American foreign policy goals in the Middle East , including an Arab - Israeli peace plan . "
Nevertheless , the sources were " clearly intent on sending a pointed signal to a top American ally " in part " because it appears that Saudi Arabia has stepped up efforts to undermine the Maliki government . "
Today , though , comes a different Times article , David Cloud 's " U.S. Set to Offer Huge Arms Deal to Saudi Arabia " .
This $ 20 billion package had been getting held up by Israeli concerns , but " senior officials who described the package on Friday said they believed that the administration had resolved those concerns , in part by promising Israel $ 30.4 billion in military aid over the next decade , a significant increase over what Israel has received in the past 10 years . "
Putting this all together , we 're going to give Israel billions of dollars in bribes in order to get them to not object to our decision to sell huge quantities of advanced weaponry to a country that is arming the people we 're fighting in Iraq .
Makes sense to me !

Here 's what Leahy and Specter wrote on June 5 :
June 5 , 2007 The Honorable Glenn A. Fine
Inspector General
The Department of Justice
950 Pennsylvania Avenue , NW
Washington , D.C. 20530-0001 Dear Inspector General Fine :
Thank you for your letter of May 30 , notifying the Committee of the expansion of your investigation into issues related to the dismissals of several U.S. Attorneys .
This letter followed up on your earlier letter of March 26 notifying the Committee of the joint investigation into the matter by your office and the Office of Professional Responsibility .
In your most recent letter , you notified us that you have expanded your investigation to " include allegations regarding improper political or other considerations in hiring decisions within the Department of Justice . "
On May 23 , Monica Goodling admitted during her testimony before the House Judiciary Committee that she " crossed the line " with respect to such considerations .
She also testified about a meeting she had with Attorney General Gonzales that made her " uncomfortable " in the days before she resigned from the Department of Justice .
She testified that Mr. Gonzales recounted to her his recollection of the process leading up to and including the firing and replacement of several U.S. Attorneys .
Mr. Gonzales had previously testified to this Committee that he was being careful not to speak to others involved in the replacement of US .
Attorneys about those matters because he thought that inappropriate .
Ms. Goodling 's testimony prompted Congressman Davis to ask whether the Attorney General was engaged in inappropriately communicating with someone he knew was a participant in and witness to the matters under investigation in order to shape her testimony .
Although you mentioned the expansion of your inquiry with respect to the consideration in hiring decisions of improper political considerations , you did not mention this incident in your recent letter .
Does the expansion of your inquiry include this matter ?
We look forward to your response .
PATRICK LEAHY
Chairman ARLEN SPECTER
Ranking Member
They got their response today .
Read it here ( pdf ) .
It reads in part :
In your letter , you referred to Monica Goodling ’s testimony before the House Judiciary Committee on May 23 , 2007 , in which she stated that she had a meeting with the Attorney General in which the process leading to the removal of certain U.S. Attorneys was discussed .
You asked whether our investigation includes this matter .
This is to confirm that the scope of our investigation does include this matter .
Now the investigation is under way ... Leahy has responded :
" The last time an internal investigation at the Department of Justice got too close for comfort the White House shut it down .
I hope this investigation will not suffer the same fate as the OPR inquiry into the warrantlesss wiretapping program .
This internal investigation is an important step in getting to the truth behind this matter , and they should be allowed to do their jobs without interference from this Administration . "
So what does this mean ?
I do n't know .
Remember that there are two separate issues at stake here .
One is the act itself .
There are penalties just for interfering .
The second issue at hand is that little issue of lying to congress .
Remember that when he testified he claimed he :
never attempted to influence or shape the testimony or public statements of any witness
While there is certainly no reason to be giddy over the prospect of an internal investigation , there is this from the WaPo piece :
The disclosure could represent a serious legal threat to the embattled attorney general .
Fine 's office is empowered to refer matters for criminal prosecution if warranted .
Should that be the case we can be fairly certain there wo n't be another Bush pardon .
You can be sure they will drag that thing out for eternity .
Chase Martyn , Managing Editor of Iowa Independent , says the following :
I ’m somewhat surprised to be saying this , and it took me a while to come to this conclusion , but I think — given the right set of circumstances — Republican Rep. Ron Paul could win the Iowa Caucuses .
I ’m not going to say it ’s likely , but it is n’t impossible .

Bounty on the conflict misery bug

Actually there is .

I 've seen no reports that anybody understands it ; there 's no guarantee > that Jason 's work will really speed things up until there 's a proof > that what Darcs is trying to do is n't NP - hard ( and preferably better > than o( n ^ 2 ) ) .
I 've been pretty quiet , partly because I 've been busy with other things ( I got married last month and moved across the country ) , and partly because I 've been busy hacking on darcs ( and have only a limited amount of time ) .
Most recently it 's been the latter .
Jason 's SoC project did n't progress as far as either of us had hoped , but I 'm now working on this myself .
Although Jason did n't get much code produced , we did have many productive ( in - person ) discussions of how to go about this , and as a result I now have a pretty clear idea as to what needs doing .
The algorithm we 're looking at is definitely polynomial in scaling , and without a particularly high exponent .
The precise scaling will depend on how you define N. Ordinarily , the number of actually - conflicting patches is pretty small .
Normal ( non-conflicting ) darcs merges are currently O ( N^2 ) where N is the number of patches on each side of the merge ( assuming they 're equal ) .
I 'm not planning to change that ( although there are some approaches we could use to make them O ( NlogN ) in the limit that each change is to a separate file ) .
The conflict handling * should n't* involve any additional powers of N , but instead should only increase the cost by factors involving the number of patches that actually conflict .
Right now , all I 've got ( just finished this afternoon ) is a conflict - handling algorithm that passes a few simple tests .
Next I need to implement support for darcs to be able to decide which approach to use ( new or old ) based on the _darcs / format file .
That 'll probably take a day or two , maybe more , since it'll touch many ( most ? ) darcs commands .
The first version ( note : not the first * released * version ) of the new conflict - handling code will actually be terribly inefficient , since I wo n't implement the optimization of keeping track of how far back in the history the last " live " conflict lives .
It 's not a hard optimization , but since it * is * an optimization , I 'll start with getting the code right .
Once we 've got this first round of conflict - handling in , we 'll need to support conflict resolution ( which is distinct , in this approach ) .
I 've implemented ( but not tested ) the low - level core for this , and we 've got a " simple " approach that we can easily hack together for the UI which might actually be beautifully elegant in practice -- but some UI experimentation will be needed .
Fortunately , the UI is distinct from the sematics and internals , so we have as long as we want to take to get the UI right .
In particular , we envision the UI allowing you to select which conflicting branch of development you prefer , which will allow you to avoid future conflicts with that branch , after resolving away the conflict with the previous branch . >
Do n't take my word for it , I have n't been paying that close attention , > so maybe there are assurances .
But all I 've seen promised is that > people will work on it , not that there is a know solution that will > just take some hard work to implement .
It 's actually looking pretty good .
We 're using a pretty simple approach , which * ought * to be " just work " to implement .

Profile
Rhett Aultman
You ’re in a bit of a different situation than the others profiled in this book — is that correct ?
What ’s on your mind ?
How are you basing your decision ?
How did you get all these interviews ?
Did you research the companies ?
How do you approach interviewing ?
Have any memorable questions ?
Have any of your interviews been something other than office interviews ?
What advice would you give someone who is about to have a big interview ?
What would you do different if you could do it all over again ?
Yes , I just finished a whirlwind tour of interviewing and am deciding among Amazon , Microsoft , and Google for a summer internship .
They are all software development positions and are all , by coincidence , in Washington state — located in Seattle , Redmond , and Kirkland respectively .
Well , considering they are internships , I suspect the monetary compensation is comparable .
So , what ’s mainly on my mind is the opportunity the positions can give me in the future , how interested I am in the technology the positions involve , and whether the experience would fit well with my Ph.D. research .
It ’s not an easy decision , every company offered something a bit different :
In my opinion , Amazon has the most hands - on technical challenge of the bunch .
They were very receptive to tailoring a position for me by providing a list of active projects and allowing me to choose the three of most interest .
Amazon also hinted at the possibility of finding something that would fit well as a doctoral thesis topic .
The Microsoft interviews mainly regarded XML , SOAP , web services , enterprise interoperability and such .
They also do some work with COM and COM +.
It ’s definitely interesting because those technologies are in mainstream tech news almost daily .
Google offers a bunch of intangibles such as my favorite location out of the three , a trendier name , and lots of free stuff .
Originally , the position they offered me was a little weaker in comparison with the others as far as interesting technology .
However , they were very flexible after I talked with them a bit about it .
They changed the position to one involving Jabber which is a chat interface and work in founding a new Google Labs project .
Microsoft and Amazon attended a college career fair at my university .
Amazon was all about having a technical discussion right from the start .
Even at the booth I had a discussion about the challenges of dealing with enormous databases in addition to where my interests lie .
I applied at Google through their website .
I also have a friend that works there which helped I think .
Some companies definitely make it easier than others .
For Microsoft , I did the standard review of their college website and looked at their latest research projects .
Knowing about their technology on the fringe that has n’t gotten a lot of press definitely helped me to be more enthusiastic than other candidates .
Amazon was a lot tougher .
For example , I had to resort to the website of the real estate agency that handles their lease to find out what their buildings look like .
Google was a bit easier because they provide information on their corporate life , current active projects , and technologies on Google Labs .
What has been invaluable for me is just chatting with friends in my field .
It can be so helpful to practice chatting with people who are competent in general , work in different areas of your field , and enjoy an open discussion .
Whenever you have time and the environment encourages it , bounce around open ideas with your friends .
I also think it is important to speak your mind while interviewing even if you are n’t sure how to solve a problem .
I do n’t know how many times I have come up with an answer to a question that I knew to be less than perfect and said something like “ I do n’t have proof that I ca n’t do better , but I suspect the solution could be improved if I thought about it a little more .
” During an interview with Amazon , I was asked a technical question which I started to answer with a popular programming language .
Halfway through , I thought I could use a functional language called ML which is rarely used in industry , but sometimes used in research or for teaching .
I suspected that the interviewer would be familiar with it because he had mentioned a functional language previously called LISP .
Boy did his eyes light up .
“ Really ! ” he said .
So , my hunch was correct that he preferred functional languages over the more popular languages of today and I scrambled to try and rewrite the problem .
What ’s interesting is I never got around to finishing the solution , but I think my little attempt and our discussion was the most favorable part of the interview .
Yes .
I had some lunch interviews as well .
They were more casual with engineering discussions and a few brain teasers here and there .
My advice for a lunch interview would be to pick what you eat carefully .
Try to pick food that wo n’t embarrass you !
Also , avoid anything that will take unnecessary attention and can keep you from talking .
You may want to pay attention to what your interviewer gets , because if he or she is vegetarian , a 20 oz steak could affect their perception of you .
Also , try to avoid carbohydrate shock ; you ’ll need to be alert for the rest of your interviews .
One thing that works for me is a caffeine boost .
In my case , a few glasses of iced tea make my mental capacities infinitely clearer .
I like to get my mind going — I usually bring some related material to read .
It ’s very important to know the company ’s products as well .
If you are expecting technical interviews , be sure to brush up on the fundamentals of your field .
I like to go over some basic computer algorithms before interviews .
Finally , the most important thing is to relax .
The interviewers just want to know what you ’re like .
Think of it as a typical engineering discussion with a friend .
Knock down the illusion that the people you will speak with are adversarial .
You are n’t going to war here .
They are just regular people who are looking for someone to help them with their projects .
I think I would have been more selective in designing my resume .
I now realize it is important to emphasize what you are most interested in rather than listing everything you can .
It plays a big role when companies match a candidate to a team .
After the interviews are done , you leave , but the resume stays .
I wish I had gone to grad school straight out of undergrad .
I think if you are passionate about your field and plan to spend the rest of your life in it , there is no better place to be .
I do n’t regret my time working after undergrad which certainly made me a pretty penny , but things get so much more interesting with the knowledge of a quality graduate education .
Now that I ’m in grad school everyone takes me a lot more seriously , there are more interesting things to work on , andopportunities present themselves which simply did n’t exist before .
With increased U.S. pressure on Iran and Israel ’s small - scale invasion of Syria , the stage appears set for an ultimatum concerning Iran ’s nuclear aspirations that many analysts and even foreign dignitaries warn may result in war .
At the same time , both Russia and China have announced that long - delayed energy - development projects with Iran are finally on the move , while the " Peace Pipeline " from Iran through Pakistan to India is lurching into its final stages .
Throw in the Bush administration ’s ever more aggressive stance toward Pakistan ’s President Pervez Musharraf and its more favorable approach to Tajikistan , and the picture becomes altogether unclear and surreal .
While hawks in the West clamor for war with Iran , the energy conglomerates of the world proceed as if the region is in perfect order .
For Central Asia , perhaps this is as orderly as it gets : doomed to be fought over like a juicy bone .
M.K. Bhadrakumar takes the newly constructed bridge over the River Panj between Afghanistan and Tajikistan and creates a portrait of the Great Game ( Modern Edition ) , with the U.S. acting strangely clever in an era of irrational U.S. policies .
If we take wealth as the prime motivator for this and any other great game being played out in the world  with energy being the mother of wealth in Central Asia  then giving China access to the ports of South Asia would seem to be a strange move for the U.S. to make .
But if we take into account that U.S. government documents drafted in March 2001 point toward a war for oil in Iraq , then a bridge built today may not begin to serve its true purpose until several years into the future .
By then , NATO forces and private contractors might be escorting oil from fortified base to fortified port through a blasted land of sectarian wars stretching from Damascus to Islamabad .
China ’s military might will likely never challenge the United States ’ , regardless of how many destroyers it buys , how many satellites it shoots down , or how many times it penetrates Pentagon computers .
Chinese forces will be enough to defend the motherland in case of attack and to crush rebellion within .
At most , Taiwan ’s President Chen Shui Bian may force Beijing ’s hand and cause the PLA to venture as far out from home as it has ever been .
Of course , the recent Peace Mission 2007 , in which Chinese forces were transported to the Ural mountains from Urumqi , the capital of China ’s Xinjiang Autonomous Uighur Province , shows the extent to which the PLA can stretch its hand of forced to .
But for China , expansion into the Great Game is purely wealth , procured through the mutual buildup of wealth between the national and semi-national energy bodies of the stans , Iran and China .
Chinese hope to sell DVD players and prostitution , build roads and docks , and gobble up energy  they definitely do not want to fight in the graveyards of past imperial nations .
Central Asia is another market for the Chinese businessman  fast becoming one of the most ubiquitous in the world  and another source of much needed fuel .
Iran recognizes that its energy reserves , second only to Russia , are the prime motivator in Central Asia and has been frenetically hopping from China to Russia to India seeking lucrative deals that will keep Ahmadinejad ’s government afloat and lock these large countries into an economy - based alliance that will help deter the US goal of a third round of sanctions and ultimately regime change in Iran .
Iran sent Minister of the Interior Mostafa Pur-Mohammadi to China last week to push through deals that can result in more than $ 20 billion in trade and to elicit a statement of support for diplomacy , not sanction or war , in the conflict over nuclear energy development in Iran .
China ’s statement was not an unequivocal condemnation of U.S. policies toward Iran , but it stressed " pragmatism , " nonproliferation , and diplomacy in an overall effort to maintain peace and wealth - generation in the region  above all in China .
Mohamed ElBaradei , under fire from the U.S. for being " lenient " with Iran , expressed admiration for China ’s role in the multi-party talks surrounding the North Korea ’s nuclear program and urged the West to adopt a similar policy toward Iran .
The bridge over the River Panj might be a point of cooperation between the major powers involved in the race for Central Asia ’s wealth , but the real flashpoint will be Tehran .
The outcome of the struggle between Russia , China , and the IAEA on the side of talks and development and the U.S. and EU on the side of sanctions and war may overshadow China ’s great pageant in the summer of 2008 .
And with Alan Greenspan coming out and speaking the unspeakable  that it ’s all about oil  there is another thing that we might as well say : Iran , given the opportunity , will create a nuclear weapon .
It has been proven to be the ultimate insurance against regime change and invasion .
If we hold this to be true , then there can be only two courses : either befriend Iran , as China and Russia have , and make money , or go to war .
The U.S. and Israel are choosing war .
China  mercantilist and free of moral or political constraints  hopes that it will continue doing what it loves best : making money .
Although this approach may not appeal to American militarists , China ’s money - driven policy will do what this region needs most : facilitate energy and infrastructure growth and hopefully stabilize Central Asia .
The true wild cards here are the peoples of the nations being plundered .
Beset by fanatic tribalism , corrupt leaders , messianic Arabs , warmongering Americans , unscrupulous Russians , shifty Chinese , and insidious Pakistani ISI agents , these people have come to hate or mistrust all outsiders and have managed to make life extremely hard for those who have come to feed on the wealth of the land .
For some reason , Iraqis , Iranians , and Afghanis find it hard to accept foreign troops on their soil .
That is a lot of milk .
New Zealand is one of the world ’s largest milk producers , according to IFCN Dairy Research Center in Germany , but it is the largest exporter of dairy products .
Some dairy economists doubt that the world ’s cows are up to the task and say there is a possibility that the shortage of milk now being seen in parts of the world will spread .

In many of the worlds emerging economies , milk is the mark of new money , a significant source of protein in an affluent persons diet .

Others say there are plenty of places where more milk can be produced if the price is right .
One thing they agree on is that milk prices are likely to stay high and rise even higher .
“ No one forecast this rapid shortage of milk , ” said Torsten Hemme , head of the IFCN center .
This is not good if you are in the market for milk .
Pizza parlors and ice cream vendors are raising their prices .
Starbucks has raised the price of its drinks .
Milk is also weighing on profits at Cadbury Schweppes and at Kraft Foods ’ cheese unit .
What is unusual , and somewhat confusing , about the milk boom compared with other booming commodities is that milk is not like oil :
You can not stick it in barrels and stockpile it .
It goes sour .
Even in powder form , the most commoditized version , milk has a shelf life .
As a result , only about 7 percent of all the milk produced globally is traded across borders .
The rest is consumed in domestic markets , which are protected by geography and just as often by tariffs or subsidies .
Big buyers like chocolate makers and grocery stores buy their milk under long - term contracts and so can smooth out sudden spikes or dips in prices .
Thus , the full effect of the global shortage varies from country to country , and not all consumers are yet suffering the full impact .
But because of the local nature of the market , there is little spare capacity .
In the past , the world could always count on the United States and Europe to fill shortages by exporting some of their subsidized stockpiles of cheese , butter and milk powder .
But the United States has drawn down its butter mountain and other stockpiles ; the same is true of the European Union , which started cutting dairy subsidies in 1993 and will finish this year .
Rising dairy demand in the United States and among the European Union ’s new members , moreover , is draining supplies .
As a result , Mr. Hemme said , “ This storage capacity is empty now . ”
At the same time , rising demand for biofuels is pushing up the price of corn and other grains , which is what farmers in the United States , Europe , Canada and Japan feed their cows instead of grass .
Rising feed costs help to push milk prices even higher .
Reporter Arrested While Covering StoryPolice Search Uncovers Concealed Weapon , But Reporter Had PermitPOSTED : 9:55 am EDT October 24 , 2007MIAMI -- A Local 10 reporter was arrested at Miami Central Senior High School while he was on assignment covering a story about school violence .
On Tuesday , Miami - Dade Schools Police told WPLG - TV's Jeff Weinsier he was trespassing and that he needed to leave .
He was not inside the school or inside the fenced - in area that surrounds the school .
School board police told him to leave and go across the street from the school , but Weinsier said he was on a public sidewalk .
Police said they were giving him a lawful order to get off the property and that he was within 500 feet of a school .
Weinsier on videotape tries to convince officers that he had the right to be on the sidewalk and pointed out that other people were on the sidewalk , but after repeated attempts , police handcuffed him .
When police searched Weinsier they found a loaded .38 revolver .
He does have a permit to carry a concealed weapon .
Local 10 reported that Weinsier has received death threats as a result of Dirty Dining television reports that feature restaurants that fail health inspection reports .
Local 10 attorney Isaac Mitrani said that a concealed weapons permit allows a firearm within 1,000 feet of a school , but not inside a school and that Weinsier never went into the school .
"
If they are in a place that other people are -- public or anything -- and you focus only on a reporter and you tell them they need to leave , that would violate the constitution , " said Mitrani .
Weinsier has been charged with resisting an officer without violence , trespassing and carrying a concealed weapon on school grounds .
He bonded out of jail Tuesday .
Last Sunday , the NY Giants and Miami Dolphins played a playoff game at London ’s Wembley stadium .
I know it seems that has nothing to do with politics , but stay with me .
As the game came down to its final two minutes , the Giants had the ball , they were ahead , and they utilized the common NFL strategy of hiking the ball to the quarterback and having the quarterback go down to one knee , ending the play without any attempt to advance the ball .
This is a risk free way to run out the clock and end the game favorably for the team in the lead .
Londoners booed loudly to show their displeasure at the tactic .
To anyone new to the game of football , it must seem a boring , timid and somewhat unfair and cynical tactic .
Underlying this tactic is the fear that if you try to run a play , the risk is too high that your players may fumble the ball or throw an interception .
Democrats have the same fear of running a real play since taking back the congress .
They know that anti-Republican sentiment is so high that the only real chance the Democrats have of losing the congress and not capturing the Presidency in 2008 is if they try to do something significant and it ends up a monumental failure .
It is thus clear that the the back room developed and agreed upon party strategy is one where Democrats are biding their time and attempting to run out the clock and are betting on the election of a Democratic President in 2008 after which , bully pulpit in hand , they will begin their attempts to govern in earnest .
The problem is , we need leadership now and this strategy may turn people off to the party for the foreseeable future .
It is a cynical strategy and it disrespects the people who worked and voted to put them into their offices .
People expect leadership from their elected officials .
When I say people , I mean all people in all countries since the beginning of time .
In the absence of good leadership from good people , people will listen to the first voice that acts like it is providing leadership , or as a character from American President said , “ They will listen to the anyone that walks up to the microphone ” .
The ancient Greeks had a saying , “ Nature abhors a vacuum ” .
What else do we have in American politics today than a leadership vacuum ?
We have a Republican President to whom no one wants to listen , and a Democratic leadership that is n’t saying anything .
The Democratic Party mistake is that they have an opportunity to step up and be the leaders and they are n’t taking it .
If someone else steps up to the microphone who knows how to use it , Democrats could easily again find themselves on the outside looking in for the next several years .
Democrats in congress and at the DNC should take a page from the British Labor party and how they acted when running their successful bid to take power from the conservatives after 18 years of consecutive conservative rule .
The UK conservative party was similarly poorly thought of and Labor ’s strategy could have been one of running out the clock , but they instead chose to put forth a bold set of policies and said “ This is how we are going to run things if elected ” .
Sure , putting those policies forth invites attack , but if your competition that has been in power has failed so miserably , if they attack you , it invites the perfect counter - attack .
“ I do n’t understand how the party opposite can attack our proposals when they have been in power , they have tried their own policies and they have failed miserably .
The people want a change ” .
The only correct way forward is for Nancy Pelosi , Harry Reid , Howard Dean and their assistants to get together , hammer out a list of 3 - 5 major priorities for the next 12 months , and go out and try to get them done .
One of those priorities has to be bringing an end to the Iraq war ( more on one way to do that later ) .
Then they have to go out and sell the people on those priorities and get them done .
These three people in particular have to be out there in agreement and on message explaining why the Democratic Party way is the right way .
As Martin Luther King said , " A genuine leader is not a searcher for consensus but a molder of consensus . "
The power of the purse is the best way to get Democratic Party priorities accomplished if there is the will to do it .
There is no way Bush can stand up to this simple strategy .
Write a package of bills that includes funding for the budget and healthcare for children and bringing home the troops ( & the other major priorities from the 3 - 5 list above ) , pass them and send them to the President .
If he vetoes any of it , pass no funding bills on anything for 45 days , and then submit the same bill ( s ) again .
If he vetoes it , again , pass no funding bills on anything for 60 days and submit the same bill ( s ) again .
Repeat this , increasing the interval by 15 days each time until the President passes it / them or until he is out of power .
By my calculations , there would be a maximum of four iterations of submitting the bill (s ) that would be possible between now and election 2008 and it would stop Bush from doing anything else in that time if he refuses to sign .
Dying in real life is - religious beliefs aside - the end , the last event you 'll take part in .
Not so in computer games , where it 's never worse than briefly infuriating .
In World of Warcraft , the massively multiplayer online roleplaying game ( MMORPG ) that 8.5 million people play every day , your death just means you have to spend several minutes trekking back to the point at which you died .
And your avatar is temporarily weakened .
It 's an inconvenience .
But why is in - game " dying " necessary at all ?
Alternatively , why is n't dying in a game as final as it is in real life ?
In MMORPGs , the latter is in part at least simply answered : it 's economics .
From Blizzard 's point of view , if in - game death were final , people would stop coughing up their monthly subscription .
And the vibrant in - game economy depends to a certain extent on death and regeneration : when your avatar comes back to life , your weapons are damaged and need repairing - for which you pay a fee .
In fact many games , both on computers and in real life , require you to leave the field of play , for structural as much as for narrative reasons .
In childrens ' playground games , team members have to be eliminated to determine the winner before the end of the lunch break .
In arcade videogames such as Space Invaders , your skill determines how long you can play before giving the machine more cash .
Death puts a time limit on those games , just as it does for life .
In other games , " dying " means you have to go back to the beginning of a level and work your way through it again ; so death becomes an indication that you 've not reached a specific skill level .
But where 's the fun in endlessly replaying a level ?
Gamers are unequivocal : " Dying gives a game meaning " , say posters on the PC Advisor forums .
Markus Montola , a researcher at Tampere University in Finland , takes this further : " You have a motivation - to avoid being annoyed by dying .
Motivation is what makes the game meaningful . "
Pete Hines - vice - president at Bethesda , the developer behind the role - playing game Oblivion and its expansion pack , Shivering Isles - agrees .
" Having your character die or fail is important because your actions have to have some meaning in the game , and to you . "
Meaningful death
But is the death of your character the right way to give a game meaning ?
Peter Molyneux of Lionhead , the developer of Fable , Black & White and The Movies , says : " A fight has to cost the player something , or it loses its meaning .
Previously , that cost was time and tedium [ in replaying a level ] .
But is that the right cost ? "
Molyneux argues that designers should look to Hollywood for how to treat the game 's hero - ie you , the player .
" Have you ever seen a film where the hero dies and dies again ?
The tension in an action film almost always comes from hammering a hero so hard that he almost dies - and then he leaps back up . "
In a film , death is usually the climax , a cathartic event .
The battle of Thermopylae is depicted in the film 300 ; commentators remarked on how much like a computer game it is , with its cinematic cutscenes and boss battles .
However , this film ends , as the real events did , with the glorious death of its hero , Leonidas , king of the Spartans , and his plucky army .
Perhaps the difference between computer games and film or television dramas is how we consume them .
TV and film are genres that we consume passively : we can't affect the outcome ( though the popularity of voting in shows such as Big Brother and talent contests might indicate that we like to ) .
Roleplaying games , however , challenge us directly by setting goals , and often one of those goals is to avoid being killed .
There are three types of goals in computer games , says Montola .
Endogenous goals originate within the game ; exogenous from outside it .
" Every game of chess has identical endogenous goals , but the exogenous ones range from having fun to humiliating the opponent to winning a tournament .
Endogenous goals are always about getting a checkmate , or at least not being checkmated yourself . "
Diegetic goals " come in when you start to role - play , " he says .
" If you play World of Warcraft and just grind to get better gear , you never think about this dwarf hunter you 're playing .
But once you start with pretend - play , you have to think ' what would Mr Dwarf Hunter want ?
What are his goals ? '
And those goals are diegetic . "
Montola points to Eve Online , the space - trading MMORPG .
" It is particularly elegant in regard to diegetic goals .
Everyone plays a space trader , miner or pirate , so it 's easy to understand that I 'm a trader and I want to maximise profit and live a peaceful life . "
Eve , he adds , " is a game where you can lose months of work by being shot from the skies .
That game is given exogenous meaning by the extremely strong endogenous and diegetic urge to avoid death . "
Death has been part of computer gaming since its earliest days .
Montola points to Arkanoid , a clone of Breakout and a direct descendant of Pong .
Dating from 1986 , the game involves you moving a bat at the bottom of the screen to try to prevent the ball falling away from the board .
Says Montola : " You probably do n't think you can die in Arkanoid , even if you miss the ball .
But your bat is in fact a spaceship called Vaus , and it gets destroyed when you miss the ball , so missing the ball means dozens or thousands of deaths ... depending on your imagination . "
Reaching even further into the dark ages of computing , he says : " If you think that an abstract bunch of pixels can die , you can trace this back to the earliest computer games , such as Spacewar ! from 1961 .
Since this predates the earliest arcade games by a decade , it 's fair to say that death has always been one of the central punishments in digital gaming . "
Reflect real life ?
But do you need to die at all ?
Eric Zimmerman , a New York - based game designer who helps run the studio Gamelab , says : " Dying in games is a strange artifact of certain kinds of historical forms and content , and there is no good reason for including it in many cases . "
Molyneux concurs : " If we were starting from scratch , we would n't come up with this paradigm . "
There are bigger questions , of course .
In real life , death is more than an annoyance .
So should games reflect real life ?
Or should we redefine " dying " in the context of games ?
Is n't it more like tennis , where you can lose a set but go on to win the game ?
Or are there bigger lessons to be learned from games ?
Says David Ewen , a 46 - year - old gamer : " Kids need to learn that if they 're ambushed by a horde of self - regenerating laser - festooned killer robots on an asteroid far from the main space trade routes in real life , they 're not actually going to end up getting teleported out to the local Starbucks for a nice refreshing break .

Marceau continued to perform until he was in his 80s
Marceau performing
The performer was known around the world for his portrayal of a white - faced clown with battered hat .
Born in Strasbourg in 1923 , Marceau studied under mime master Etienne Decroux in Paris .
His daughter Camille said he died on Saturday evening , adding that details of the burial at Paris 's Pere Lachaise cemetery would be given out later .
Silent films
Marceau , whose real name was Marcel Mangel , became world famous for his 1947 creation of Bip , the sad , white - faced clown in a striped jumper and a battered silk opera hat .
Mime artist Corinne Soum - Wasson , who was a friend of Marceau 's , told the BBC he was an " extraordinary person " .
" He trained with an extraordinary master , and due to his wonderful witty personality he was able to put that into practice .
He was able to captivate people , " she said .
" I was lucky enough to have known him very well , I was teaching at his school in Paris , and was just a generally funny , nice human being . "
Ms Soum - Wasson said Marceau had created Bip early in his career : " He always told me the idea of Bip came to him very early on , when he was a student ... he suddenly had the idea in class one day then developed it . "
Marceau was credited with single - handedly reviving the art of mime after World War II , after two decades of being eclipsed by the silent movie .
Marceau was inspired to become a mime by the great Hollywood actors of the silent era such as Charlie Chaplin , Buster Keaton and Harry Langdon .
His Compagnie Marcel Marceau was the only mime troupe in the world in the 1950s and 1960s - it enjoyed as much acclaim abroad as at home .
HAVE YOUR SAY
His art transcended time and place .
Marcel Marceau spoke for the little man everywhere .

Sept. 27 , 2007  --
In all the stories that came out of 9/11 -- stories of love , loss and heroism -- Tania Head 's tale had it all .
As president of the World Trade Center Survivors ' Network and as a tour guide at ground zero , she told countless people for the past six years about being burned on the 78th floor of the south tower .
Head says she was rescued by a citizen hero , and felt compelled to escape by her promise to return a wedding band to a victim 's wife and by her love for a man she later learned had died in the north tower .
Tania Head 's story , however , was too good to be true , as The New York Times reported Thursday .
Though she 'd spoken to journalists for years and recounted her story hundreds of times among other survivors , the newspaper found that nearly every detail of Head 's tale was false .
Now the many survivors of 9/11 and the families of victims who had come to trust Head , at times suppressing their own grief to help her cope with her enormous loss , are left to wonder why she would perpetrate such an enormous fabrication .
" I 've heard her story over and over , " said Janice Cilento , a social worker and board member of the World Trade Center Survivors ' Network .
" I 've been there anytime she needed someone to listen , even if it was at three in the morning .
She has stolen my time and my soul , " she said .
Cilento said many of the network 's members " feel very upset and betrayed .
" We have members who thought Tania 's trauma was so extreme they did not want to discuss their own .
They gave their time to help her , and she did n't even need it , " she said .
The Times reported that Merrill Lynch had confirmed that no one by the name of Tania Head had ever worked on the 78th floor of that company .
The family of the victim who Head claimed was her killed fiancé , or her husband in some versions of the story , and whom the paper identified only by his first name , Dave , to protect his family 's privacy , told reporters they had never heard of Head .
Head claimed she was rescued by Welles Remy Crowther , an equities trader who has been credited with saving several people on the 78th floor .
Crowther 's father , Jefferson , told ABC NEWS.com he had met Head but at the time had no reason to doubt her story .
" The lady appeared to be truthful and honest .
We had no reason to disbelieve what she was saying , " Crowther said .
" We are mystified by the inconsistencies and feel badly for the survivors , the Network where she was president and the tribute center where she was a docent . "
Crowther said Head met him last year and told him " where she worked , what she did and that her husband had died in the north tower .
It would have been insensitive to probe or ask more questions , and we did n't think there was reason to be suspicious . "
Despite the mounting evidence against Head , Crowther said her lie " does n't detract from what Welles did .
If anything , it again brings light to the bravery and selflessness he displayed . "
According to the Times , Head never attempted to receive financial remuneration for her " survivor " status .
In addition to her work with the Survivors ' Network , she also volunteered as a tour guide at ground zero through the Tribute World Trade Center Visitor Center .
" This is a very difficult and sensitive situation for Tribute .
At this time , we are unable to confirm the veracity of Tania Head 's connection to the events of Sept. 11th .
Criteria for docent volunteers is to be either a family member , survivor , neighborhood resident , recovery worker or an individual who was directly impacted by Sept. 11 , " the organization said in a statement .
In checking Head 's story , the Times revealed that Head had claimed she 'd graduated from Harvard and had received an MBA from Stanford , but neither school reported having a student named Tania Head .
Why Lie ?
Psychologists said there are numerous reasons that people lie , but that in Head 's case she most likely enjoyed the attention she received .
" In most cases , people are very often rewarded for the lies they tell , " said Robert Feldman , a psychology professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and an expert in the motivations for lying .
" This woman got a lot of attention and a lot of sympathy .
Very often when people lie they embellish more and more and can't walk away from it …
They back themselves into a corner and become increasingly trapped by the lie , " he said .
" You have to look at the rewards people get .
People are incredibly sympathetic to 9/11 victims , rape victims or those who bravely performed in otherwise tragic circumstances during a war .
There is a status you otherwise would n't have , so by lying you make others treat you better and probably feel better about yourself . "
According to Paul Ekman , a psychologist at the University of San Francisco , Head probably got away with lying for so long because people are generally trustworthy .
" Why do n't we catch liars ?
Because we do n't want to know the truth .
...
Most liars underestimate how difficult it is maintain a lie .
Do all liars get caught ?
There is no way to know , but I 've always been impressed how often liars do get caught .
You need a good memory in order to be successful .
You need to control your own emotions .
You need to be able to take on the perspective of another person , and plan a number of steps ahead . "
" ' Pathological lying ' is an oxymoron .
Lying is not a disease ; all lying is a choice , " Ekman said .
" Some people lie with greater frequency than others , but there is no treatment for chronic liars . "
Head declined to comment to the Times about its findings .
The investigation began after Head canceled interview requests for a Times story on 9/11 survivors , and became evasive about details of her own story , according to the Times .
A conservative , pro-American , pro-Christian wiki that began as a " class project for a World History class of 58 advanced homeschooled and college - bound students " evokes a common response from visitors : " Is this a joke ? "
Plenty of bloggers have asked this question after learning about the Conservapedia , a new wiki for those " tired of the LIBERAL BIAS every time you search on Google and a Wikipedia page appears . "
But the site , which was launched in November 2006 , is no joke .
It 's the brainchild of Andy Schlafly , son of conservative matriarch Phyllis Schlafly .
The backers
The elder Schlafly is an octogenarian with a fascinating past : she helped lead the charge against the Equal Rights Amendment in the 1970s , a document which said that " equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex . "
When in college , she earned money by working the night shift and test - firing rifles at an ordnance factory — this is a woman not to be messed with .
Andrew , one of her sons , is a lawyer with a degree from Harvard Law .
According to his biography , Schlafly " publishes widely , " though the only listed periodical is the Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons , a magazine published by a group that opposes mandatory vaccinations and is listed as an unreliable source for medical information by Quackwatch .
Andy Schlafly has also taught more than 120 home - schooled students , and is the driving force behind Conservapedia ( he is also a lecturer for the Eagle Forum University , a web site affiliated with his mother 's Eagle Forum political action group ) .
He has set up the Conservapedia to counter the liberal bias exercised by the generally small number of Wikipedia editors who make most of the edits on the site and who tend to be liberals ( his claim ) .
Conservapedia will instead forge a new path , one that will make it one of the most " reliable online educational resources of its kind , " according to the site ( though this goal seems difficult given the wiki's stated main - page mission of " favor[ing ] Christianity and America " ) .
It will do this by following six principles , one of which is a ban on the use of " CE " and " BCE " in dates .
( " Common Era " is a non-Christian alternative to " Anno Domini , " and is commonly used in academic work . )
Problems in " Conservia "
Despite its attempt to root out what it sees as the cause of much bad information , Conservapedia suffers from myriad problems , some familiar to Wikipedians and some not .
The entire effort has been roundly mocked , even by conservatives , many of whom are n't pleased to be linked in the public imagination with Conservapedia entries like , " Modern kangaroos originated in the Middle East and are the descendants of the two founding members of the modern kangaroo baramin that were taken aboard Noah 's Ark prior to the Great Flood . "
The kangaroo entry is a perfect illustration of the fact that Conservapedia will face all of the same problems that plague Wikipedia , including hoaxes and " revert wars . "
This entry does not appear to be a hoax , as it was included in the original writeup for " Kangaroo " and was actually reinstated by the author after another contributor excised it .
( It has since been deleted once more . )
Hoaxes have also become common , as a look at recent edits will tell you .
Many of the fake entries appear to be parodies of conservative positions , which means that pointing to particular Conservapedia entries to show " what conservatives think " can be problematic .
But the biggest problem , and one which still dogs Wikipedia , is accuracy .
Though Conservapedia has published a long list of the inaccuracies found in Wikipedia ( one of which actually references a recent Ars Technica piece on Citizendium ) , it 's absolutely chock full of them itself , and many of the sources cited by users are things like Exploring Creation With Biology published by Apologia Educational Ministries ( a source that shows up quite a bit ) .
Consider the entry for Descartes .
In its totality , it ( currently ) reads : " Renee Descartes was a French philosopher , probably the greatest philosopher of all time ( although Kant , Aristotle and Ayn Rand also lay claim to this title ) .
Descartes locked himself in a stove and meditated , arriving at the unsurprising conclusion that nothing existed .
He then used Anselm 's proof of the existence of God to decide that perhaps he was n't deluded , and perhaps things did exist after all .
He thought the soul lived in the pineal gland , and when you lift your arm it's just an accident because your brain does n't control your body , God does .
This ' god - robot ' theory of consciousness got him into ferocious arguments with Hobbes , but then Hobbes loved a good argument and was usually wrong . "
Again , one wonders if this is a joke , but the article 's contributor appears to be an active and respected member of the community .
( Note to author : Descartes did his meditating in a room with a stove , not in a stove . )
Wikipedia 's article on the same subject is a 2,500 - word piece complete with a picture and a list of Descartes ' writing .
Ideology and knowledge
All attempts at creating a total encyclopedia face the problems of starting without content , though , and perhaps Conservapedia will one day grow into an important resource for conservatives .
But the site and others like it raise a thorny epistemological question : is there such a thing as " conservative " and " liberal " knowledge ?
And if so , what does this imply about " knowledge " ?
The resulting questions about " warrant " and " belief " are so tough to answer that they 've been fueling philosophy conferences for decades , but they 're still worth a bit of individual pondering .
Wikis have also been launched to help defend creationism and liberal media members , so this kind of activity is not limited to one particular viewpoint or end of the political spectrum .
The potential downside to all these experiments is that they make it easier for people to avoid talking to each other , instead preaching only to the choir and reinforcing preconceived beliefs .
The only thing that they can all agree on is that the attempt to do this ( Wikipedia ) has failed , and so truth can best be found by retreating into ideological enclaves .
In a multicultural world and in a politically - divided country , is this really what we want ?

But instead , those labels delivered the death blow to the record store as we know it by getting in bed with soulless chain stores like Best Buy and Wal - Mart .
These “ big boxes ” were given exclusive tracks to put on new CDs and , to add insult to injury , they could sell them for less than our wholesale cost .
They did n’t care if they did n’t make any money on CD sales .
Because , ideally , the person who came in to get the new Eagles release with exclusive bonus material would also decide to pick up a high - speed blender that frappéed .
The jig was up .
It did n’t matter that even a store as small as ours carried hundreds of titles you ’d never see at Best Buy and was staffed by people who actually knew who Van Morrison was , or that Tower Records had the entire history of recorded music under one roof while Costco did n’t carry much more than the current hits .
A year after our shop closed , Tower went out of business — something that would have been unthinkable just a few years earlier .
The customers who had grudgingly come to trust our opinions made the move to online shopping or lost interest in buying music altogether .
Some of the most loyal fans had been soured into denying themselves the music they loved .
Meanwhile , the recording industry association continues to give the impression that it ’s doing something by occasionally threatening to sue college students who share their record collections online .
But apart from scaring the dickens out of a few dozen kids , that ’s just an amusing sideshow .
They ’re not fighting a war any more than the folks who put on Civil War regalia and re-enact the Battle of Gettysburg are .
The major labels wanted to kill the single .
Instead they killed the album .
The association wanted to kill Napster .
Instead it killed the compact disc .
And today it ’s not just record stores that are in trouble , but the labels themselves , now belatedly embracing the Internet revolution without having quite figured out how to make it pay .
At this point , it may be too late to win back disgruntled music lovers no matter what they do .
As one music industry lawyer , Ken Hertz , said recently , “ The consumer ’s conscience , which is all we had left , that ’s gone , too . ”
It ’s tempting for us to gloat .
By worrying more about quarterly profits than the bigger picture , by protecting their short - term interests without thinking about how to survive and prosper in the long run , record - industry bigwigs have got what was coming to them .
It ’s a disaster they brought upon themselves .
We would be gloating , but for the fact that the occupation we planned on spending our working lives at is rapidly becoming obsolete .
And that loss hits us hard — not just as music retailers , but as music fans .
It was n't all black and white
We might enjoy cheap flights , e-mail and plasma televisions , but a report by Somerfield says one in four people want to return to the decade of the Suez War and the Coronation .
Bobbies on the beat ( 80 % ) , district nurses ( 55 % ) , bus conductors ( 41 % ) and rag - and - bone men ( 20 % ) were among the features of life those surveyed most wanted to revive or expand .
This has been presented by some dewy - eyed newspapers as evidence that life 50 years ago was better than now .
A time of decency and strong community ties , yes , but what aspects of that life were not so appealing ?
1. Post - war austerity was characterised by outside lavatories , central heating was rare and many houses were without televisions or running water .
The education system was lauded
3. Food rations until 1954 .
Fruit was a luxury , chicken or sweets a rarity .
Queues outside butchers lined the streets .
Petrol was rationed in 1956 - 57 .
4. Smog , or peasoupers , were thick and yellow , made worse by coal fires .
Some have described the fog as a " yellow wall " outside the front door .
Parents gave children scarves to wear over their noses and mouths and street lamps were still gas .
5. Britain had to come to terms with being humiliated in the Suez War and its influence on world events being greatly diminished .
6. Bomb sites littered British streets , while air raid shelters , unexploded bombs , gas masks and seaside defences provided a reminder of the horror that had gone before .
Bombed buildings became playgrounds
8. Sporting humiliation arrived when England 's football team lost 6 - 3 to Hungary at Wembley , the first ever defeat to a non-British team at home .
9 . Smoking prevalence among UK men aged 35 to 59 was 80 % in 1950 , and half of deaths of middle - aged men were caused by tobacco .
10 . Sexual expression was frowned upon and even criminalised .

This bad view of the fifties was the earlier part of the decade .
The entire ten years had a better legacy .
Kids were allowed to be kids , parents and policemen could make bullies behave .
People had a pride in themselves , their homes , their community .
Sadly there was also racism , low wages and bad working conditions prevalent but we were all in it together .

My family moved from central London ( next to a bomb site ) to an isolated Bucks farmhouse at the beginning of 1952 when I was eight .
From having running hot water , instant gas fires and a proper bathroom , we only had a coal - fired copper boiler for water , no cooker except the coal range in the living room , and the inevitable outside toilet .
How my mother survived the change I will never know .
I clearly remember the first day sweets came off ration and breaking all rules to cross the main road from school to the sweetshop .
Maybe we should have sweet rationing again , and I 'd love to see more bobbies on the beat and district nurses .
Bus conductors might speed up journeys , and rag - and - bone men could help recycling .
I 'd like to see more courtesy , but do n't miss the sexism .

Despite downside of the 50's , most food one ate was fresh and home cooked , children could play out and come home for tea , neighbours all looked out for one and other and could reprimand children if they were doing something they should n't .

Looking at the list of things ' wrong ' with the 50s , most people would agree that getting rid of smog and discrimination was way overdue .
But now there is no rationing , and a lax attitude to sexual expression , we have obesity and rapidly growing numbers of people with STDs .
And is it really good that we all have television now ?

US Senate unanimously passes threatening measure against Iran
By Peter Symonds
14 July 2007
A little publicised amendment to the defence spending bill denouncing Iran for the “ murder ” of US soldiers in Iraq was proposed by Independent Democrat Joseph Lieberman and passed unanimously in the US Senate on Wednesday .
Republicans and Democrats all lined up to support the White House ’s unsubstantiated accusations that Tehran is funding , training and arming Iraqi militias , “ who are contributing to the destabilisation of Iraq and are responsible for the murder of members of the United States Armed Forces ” .
For all their antiwar posturing , not a single Democrat , including the leading presidential contenders Hilary Clinton , Barrack Obama and Joseph Biden , opposed the amendment .
Having supported the Bush administration ’s crimes in Iraq , the Democrats are lending credibility to another campaign of lies , half - truths and disinformation aimed at justifying a new military adventure .
The vote demonstrates once again that the differences between the White House and the Democrats are purely tactical .
What unites all factions of the American political establishment is their defence of the strategic and economic interests of US imperialism in the Middle East .
None of them has any principled opposition to a US military attack on Iran , if it would further American domination in this key region .
In his speech , Lieberman pointed to the underlying US strategic interests involved .
“ One of them was to prevent Iran from dominating parts of Iraq .
Another was to preserve our credibility in the region ... that is important to us in so many ways .
In the most direct way ... we continue to depend too much on oil and gas that comes from the Middle East so we have an interest in keeping it stable , ” he declared .
While it mandates no action beyond regular reports to Congress , the Lieberman amendment effectively endorses the Bush administration ’s propaganda against Iran .
For months , the White House and the Pentagon have maintained a steady drumbeat : the Iranian Revolutionary Guards are training , financing and supplying arms , including deadly armour - piercing devices , to militias that are killing US troops .
No concrete evidence has been provided beyond the occasional display of Iranian manufactured arms and statements purportedly made by militia members locked away in US detention .
Iranian officials have repeatedly dismissed the allegations .
Nevertheless the accusations have steadily escalated .
On July 2 , US military spokesman Brigadier General Kevin Bergner for the first time accused the highest levels of the Iranian government of direct involvement in attacks on US forces , specifically the killing of five American troops in Karbala in January .
The outrage and righteous indignation of Lieberman and others over alleged Iranian “ meddling ” in Iraq is staggering for its hypocrisy and arrogance .
The Bush administration has 160,000 troops inside Iraq waging a criminal neo-colonial war for the domination of the country ’s resources .
It has endorsed covert operations inside Iran aimed at destabilising the regime and has repeatedly declared that in dealing with Tehran all options are on the table , including the military one .
The amendment was only passed 97- 0 after Lieberman agreed to include a proviso that nothing in the measure “ shall be construed to authorise or otherwise speak to the use of armed forces against Iran . ”
But this purely legalistic caveat will not prevent the Bush administration from taking military action against Iran and could well be exploited to justify a US attack in the name of “ self - defence ” .
In fact , US accusations of Iranian support for Iraqi militias have become increasingly shrill as it has become clear that the UN Security Council is unlikely to authorise the use of military force over a second pretext — Iran ’s nuclear programs .
Lieberman , an unapologetic supporter of the Iraq occupation , makes no bones about his stance .
In a comment in the Wall Street Journal last Friday , he bluntly accused Iran of waging a “ proxy war ” against the US not only in Iraq , but also in Afghanistan , Palestine and Lebanon .
While calling for diplomatic efforts , he declared : “ The fact is , any diplomacy with Iran is more likely to be effective if it is backed by a credible threat of force — credible in the dual sense that we mean it , and the Iranians believe it ...
It is time to restore that fear [ of US retaliation ] , and to inject greater doubt into the decision - making of the Iranian leaders about the risks they are now running . ”
“ A credible threat of force ” can only mean one thing : the willingness to attack Iranian military units and installations allegedly involved in Iraq .
As Lieberman told CBS ’s “ Face the Nation ” last month , the US government must “ be prepared to take aggressive military action against the Iranians ” .
The Pentagon has already provocatively stationed two aircraft carrier battle groups in the Persian Gulf and reinforced the military capability of US regional allies .
A third aircraft carrier group led by the USS Enterprise is currently heading towards the Middle East — reportedly to replace the existing two .
Whether or not the Bush administration will authorise military strikes on Iran remains unclear .
What attitude the US will adopt towards Iran is part of the debate raging in ruling circles , including in the White House , over the catastrophe in Iraq .
Lieberman speaks for a considerable layer of the American political establishment that advocates the unrestrained use of US military might to pursue its strategic and economic ambitions .
Far from being held back by the Iraqi quagmire , the advocates of “ regime change ” in Tehran propose to extend the war into a broad regional conflict against Iran and its “ proxies ” throughout the Middle East .
At stake is the control of the region ’s oil and gas .
Any back down or compromise over Iran would leave America ’s Asian and European economic rivals holding all of the stakes in that country ’s resources .
Likewise any US retreat from Iraq would leave the field open for other powers to fill the vacuum .
The alternative is a macabre and reckless gamble that a war against Iran would establish US domination over the region as a whole .
What was significant about Wednesday ’s vote was the willingness of the entire US Senate to endorse the pretext for a new war .
It is a clear signal that the Democrats would rapidly fall into line with any military adventure in Iran , despite the overwhelming antiwar sentiment among the American population as a whole .
In an effort to swing the tide in the high - definition format wars , Toshiba has announced the release of the first set of titles that support Internet connectivity features on second - generation HD DVD players .
Although HD DVD and Blu-ray both launched last year , neither format is currently sporting all of their planned features .
While we 're still waiting for managed copy to appear later this year , Toshiba is talking up some of the interactive features which will be featured in releases that are already out or just around the corner .
The first title is the Japanese animated film Freedom , released last week .
Freedom sports the relatively modest features of downloading an additional movie trailer , changing menu styles , and downloading different subtitles .
A networked HD DVD player will grab all of this content from an online content server .
The HD DVD version of the hit film 300 , due out at the end of July , will offer more substantial bonuses such as a strategy game and the ability to re-edit the movie in a different sequence and upload the results to a server hosted by Warner Bros .
Blood Diamond , coming out on July 3 in HD DVD format , will offer an online poll as part of the special features .
Toshiba and other companies supporting HD DVD may need all the help they can get , as Blu-ray is generally acknowledged to be winning the high - definition battle .
Few would say that HD DVD is winning , but as we have argued , it 's really too early to tell right now .
Nevertheless , Blu-ray has the advantage of greater studio support : five out of six of the major studios are releasing titles in Blu-ray format compared to only three that are supporting HD DVD , and three of the five ( Sony Pictures , Disney , and Fox ) are exclusive to Blu-ray , compared to only one ( Universal ) which is exclusive to HD DVD .
Blu -ray recently got another significant boost when Blockbuster announced that it would be the format of choice in 1,700 of its stores .
In terms of stand - alone players , HD DVD units are doing better than Blu-ray players : over 150,000 HD DVD units have been sold so far , and Toshiba claims that this represents over 70 percent of total stand - alone high definition player sales .
Most of the sales have come after Toshiba 's price cut , which saw their cheapest player selling for $ 299 after an instant rebate — this rebate has now been made permanent .
Sony has responded by cutting the price on their cheapest Blu-ray unit , the BDP - S300 , to $ 499 .
While HD DVD might be out touting these new interactive features , Blu-ray also support interactivity , and it's only a matter of time before we see titles with interactive content coming from that camp .

of HobbyTown USA is located in an old strip mall on the outskirts of the city , in between a Payless shoe store and an H&R Block .
One recent Sunday morning , the assistant manager , Lee Spievack , stood behind the cash register licking his fingers , having just devoured a Krispy Kreme chocolate doughnut .
Spievack is sixty - nine , and the accumulation of years has made him less imposing than he was thirty - five years ago , when he won a Silver Star during the Vietnam war .
He was wearing his HobbyTown USA uniform : a crisp yellow button - down shirt with his name stitched in red letters that was tucked tightly into khaki pants pulled well higher than his waist .
Model airplanes hung from the ceiling , and on the shelves around him were trains , railroad tracks , remote - control cars , rockets , and kites .
Spievack has been building and flying remote - control airplanes since he was ten years old .
If someone in or near Cincinnati has a problem with an aircraft smaller than anything regulated by the FAA , they go see him .
Not long ago , on a Friday evening , a customer who bought a remote - control plane on eBay dropped by because its propeller was spinning the wrong way .
On his own planes , Spievack uses wooden propellers ; if the plane falls out of the sky and lands on someone , which happens more than you 'd think , wooden propellers are less likely to slice anything off .
But this plane had a plastic propeller more than a foot long .
Spievack and the customer took his plane behind the store for testing , and sure enough , after gassing up the engine , the whirling blades spun the wrong way .
Spievack had never seen a plane act this way .
He got down on his knees for a closer look , and just as he said , " You 've got to get rid of this thing , " he pointed at the engine , inserting his middle finger directly into the propeller 's path .
" And that 's how I cut my finger off , " he says .
Over the years , Dr. Stephen Badylak has had problems explaining what he does for a living .
He used to say , " I do biomedical engineering . "
But then he'd have to explain biomedical engineering .
After a while , as a default response , Badylak would simply say , " Well , I 'm in medical research . "
He hoped that would be enough , but it often prompted , " What are you researching ? "
Badylak says , " I got tired of struggling with it .
So now I just tell them I make body parts . "
Badylak has regrown sizable portions of esophagi , tendons , ligaments , bladders , urethras , abdominal walls , blood vessels , and hearts within animals and humans .
Badylak , fifty - four , has sharp blue eyes and is tall and fit .
He walks on the balls of his feet , probably owing to his obsession with running , which he does for three miles every morning at 4:30 .
Endurance is a trademark .
Badylak has trained and worked as a veterinarian , a pathologist , and a general practitioner , and he spent several years as team doctor for Purdue University 's football team .
He now works at the University of Pittsburgh 's McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine , which is located on the site of an old steel mill near the banks of the Monongahela River .
Badylak is the son of an Indiana steelworker , and his office window has a view of the Hot Metal Bridge , but steel is now mostly a memory in Pittsburgh .
Badylak works in one of the city 's more modern successful industries — organs .
The city boasts one of the busiest and most well - known transplant centers in the world .
From his office , Badylak can hear helicopters buzzing by , hauling coolers containing chilled livers , hearts , and kidneys .
The flight path of the choppers reminds Badylak almost hourly of the need for body parts and the fundamental problem with our system of procuring them .
If someone needs a new heart , he often has to wait for someone else to die .
And even if that new heart is a match , the patient must take powerful immunosuppressant drugs for the rest of his life , which can make a person sicker than he was before the surgery .
Many people live happily ever after with transplanted organs , but many more die waiting for them , or because of them .
And then there are people like Lee Spievack , who severely damage or lose a limb .
The answer for them is either a prosthesis or a nub .
That 's because the adult human body has evolved to scar , avoiding infection and moving on with life .
But that life would be a lot better for a lot of people if their bodies could be manipulated into fixing and replacing lost or damaged body parts — similar to what happens to fetuses the first few months in the womb .
If a fetus loses an arm or a leg , it grows back .
" Humans can grow an entire human being in nine months .
That 's pretty remarkable , " says Badylak .
" If you think about it that way , you can say we just want an arm , you know , or we want a leg .
Just give us enough information that we can do that . "
Badylak happened upon this quest twenty years ago , early in his research career , while working on Rocky .
Rocky was a dog , a mixed breed , and Badylak was conducting an experiment that required replacing a segment of the aorta around Rocky 's heart .
Sitting around having lunch one day , Badylak wondered ,
What in the body has the same shape and size as an aorta ?
What 's tubular ?
He settled on the small intestine , and replaced part of the dog's aorta with part of his small intestine .
" When we came in the next morning , " says Badylak , " he was just standing , wagging his tail , and wanting breakfast . "
That was surprising , but not nearly as shocking as what happened next .
Over the next weeks and months , as Badylak examined the new part of the aorta , he discovered that the intestine had not become simply a tube to pass blood through but had literally morphed into an aorta .
And no scar tissue had formed .
This defied what we previously knew about healing .
Badylak had accidentally performed the biological equivalent of a magician turning a handkerchief into a dove .
But this was no illusion .
Lee Spievack 's finger did n't hurt , but the amount of blood squirting from it was worrisome .
He raced inside the store and grabbed a roll of paper towels , furiously wrapping up what was left of his finger .
His coworkers dialed 911 .
Spievack did n't get a chance to examine the damage until paramedics unwrapped the paper towels in the ambulance .
He looked down and saw that it was n't as catastrophic as he feared , but the tip — about half an inch — was gone .
" It was a clean cut , " he says .
" There were no jagged edges .
It was like you took a knife and cut it off . "
If he looked closely , he could see bone .
Back at the store , his coworkers shined flashlights around outside hoping to locate the missing chunk of his finger , but they came up empty .
" It probably landed on the roof and a bird had lunch , " he says .
Seeing that there was nothing left to reattach , the doctors at the hospital bandaged his wound and told him to follow up with a hand surgeon , which he did a couple of days later .
The surgeon was matter - of - fact :
In a few days , he would take skin from Spievack 's forearm or thigh , then paste it over the finger , leaving a nub .
Spievack made an appointment for the procedure , then went outside and called his older brother , Alan , a retired Harvard Medical School surgeon .
He told Alan they wanted to do a skin graft .
" That 's crazy , " he said .
" Instead of having one wound , you will have two .
I want you to go back in there and cancel that appointment . "
Lee Spievack did what his brother advised , and the nurse told him he was going to get an infection .
" She was just madder than shit , " he says .
" But I knew what my brother was up to . "
Nathan Perkel
When they were teenagers , the Spievack brothers raised salamanders .
Alan Spievack was introduced to the creatures during his freshman year at Kenyon College , after acing a biology exam .
Nobody had ever aced this professor 's exam before , and so he asked to see Alan after class .
" Instead of congratulating me , he began to ask questions — suggesting maybe I had cheated , or the test was too easy , or maybe the course was , " Spievack says .
" He was worried about his reputation as a tough guy teaching a tough course .
I almost promised him I would never do it again . "
A week later , the professor called Alan in again and said he had a project for him .
He took him down to the nearby Kokosing River and told him to roll up his pants , get in the water , and catch what appeared to be tiny black insects , which were salamander larvae .
Spievack 's job : raise them , then snip off their arms , legs , and tails , taking notes about how long it took for the limbs to grow back .
Salamanders can regenerate almost any part of their bodies .
Cut off an arm , it grows back .
Gouge out an eye , same thing .
When the semester ended , Spievack took the salamanders back to his family 's home in Cincinnati , where he nurtured them in his mother 's pie pans .
( He made his younger brother Lee feed them once a week with tweezers loaded with hamburger meat and fish food . )
Alan eventually leveraged his interest in salamander regeneration into a Fulbright scholarship , then medical school at Harvard , and then a lengthy career in surgery .
Alan Spievack , now seventy - four , bears a striking resemblance to his younger brother , though he talks a lot more .
One of the striking characteristics of his speech is that he ends every third sentence with the words et cetera .
When asked if he had any children , he explained that he has a daughter who is thirty - two and another daughter who is fifteen and " a typical teenager , et cetera . "
He has so much going on in his head that there are things he would just as soon skip over to get to the important stuff .
Throughout his career , Alan Spievack continued his regeneration research , and several years before the propeller sliced off his brother 's finger , he attended an orthopedic surgeons ' conference in Atlanta , where he saw a speech given by Stephen Badylak .
By that time , Badylak had been chasing answers about Rocky the dog for some time , becoming an expert on the biological components of the intestine — like the fact that the inner lining of the intestine regenerates itself every six days .
Badylak honed in on the layer of the intestine that supported the tissue replacement , called the submucosa .
He put the submucosa into other wounded organs in dogs , and the same thing happened .
Achilles tendons grew back .
Urinary bladders grew back .
The implications of the discovery were profound :
The submucosa stopped the scarring process and promoted regrowth .
Badylak determined that the intestinal material was an extracellular matrix — the part of the tissue in the body that connects cells to one another , like a scaffold .
Only this extracellular matrix from the small intestine — he 'd later use a similar lining from the bladder — tricks the body 's cells into rebuilding instead of scarring .
It 's like the cells are in the womb again , and the extracellular matrix alerts them that the Achilles tendons are not yet done .
The cells kick into gear and go to work .
And they are joined by stem cells , those all - powerful building blocks of life capable of growing into any tissue in the body .
Only the stem cells that show up have n't been harvested from human embryos .
They come from the body 's own reserve in the bone marrow and other places , and although these adult stem cells are not as flexible as embryonic stem cells , they may have more potential than previously thought to aid in the regeneration of multiple tissues .
As his research progressed , Badylak concluded that if there was any shot of this strategy going prime time in humans , he would not be able to use intestines or bladders from domesticated animals like dogs or cats ( which have the strongest intestinal lining of any animals ) .
Using human parts was also out of the question .
Badylak tried zebras , groundhogs , prairie dogs , sheep , and cows before settling on pigs :
They are plentiful , they are similar enough to humans in genetic makeup , and from a regulatory perspective , the FDA is friendly toward them because they have for years been the source of heart valves and dermatological research .
And the extracellular matrix is not rejected by the human body , because all the pig cells are thoroughly removed .
The material can be ground into a powder or made into a sheet like waxed paper or modeled into a shape , like that of an esophagus .
Throughout the 1990s , Badylak published one paper after another reporting his discoveries , but the collective response of the scientific community was basically to ignore him .
In 1996 , he spoke about his research at the conference in Atlanta that Alan Spievack was attending .
Spievack recalls sitting through Badylak 's presentation with his mouth agape :
When this guy gets done talking , everyone in the room is gonna raise their hands with questions .
When Badylak was done talking , Spievack was just about the only person with his hand up .
Well , people are just being coy .
When he leaves the stage , he will be swarmed .
But only Spievack approached Badylak .
At that moment , the two men began a friendship and casual working relationship , with Badylak advising a company Spievack eventually started to use extracellular matrix scaffolds in injured animals .
Spievack still vividly remembers asking Badylak why nobody else seemed interested in his speech .
Badylak answered , " Because they do n't believe it . "
Nathan Perkel
A few days after Lee Spievack canceled his appointment with the hand surgeon , he received a package from his older brother containing a vial of powder that looked like Kraft Parmesan cheese .
His brother instructed him to sprinkle it on his finger every other day until the powder was gone .
Lee Spievack is not a man who asks a lot of questions .
So in the case of the vial , Spievack did n't much care what it contained ( ground - up pig bladder ) or where it came from ( a little farm in Albion , Indiana ) .
Albion is a speck of a town about a forty - minute drive from Fort Wayne on some of the flattest land in America .
The Whiteshire Hamroc farm is located a few miles off the main road and its prim little houses , around the corner from an abandoned nineteenth - century schoolhouse , and down past some cornfields .
The Whiteshire Hamroc farm raises a special line of genetically linked pigs that are reared indoors and sequestered from disease .
The idea is that if pig parts are going in humans — and they have already been used , by the thousands — then the pigs need to be as clean as possible .
The pigs at the Whiteshire Hamroc farm are some of the most pampered swine in the world .
They inhale filtered air .
When they are behaving , they are fed strawberry and vanilla ice cream .
The handlers tried chocolate , but the pigs demurred .
Sherry Ziobro , an attractive former student - loan executive who now brokers pig bladders and other tissues , recently arranged a tour of the facilities .
Before entering , visitors must shower and change into farm - approved clothing — Fruit of the Loom boxer shorts , blue flannel pajama pants , a gray T - shirt , tube socks , and black sneakers — all in an effort to prevent as much bacteria as possible from coming into contact with the pigs .
A filtration mask that covers the mouth and nose is also required , though not for the visitors ' benefit — even through a mask , specially raised pigs smell terrible .
Inside , the pigs seemed remarkably content .
The barn housed litters that had been born the day before ( the mothers resting on their sides while the piglets fed ) , adolescent pigs who tried to nip at their guests , and some older pigs , of an age and size that would soon have them embarking on the hour 's drive to Tippecanoe , Indiana , to visit the Vin - Lee - Ron slaughterhouse ( founded by Vin , Lee , and Ron ) .
About eleven hundred pigs meet their maker each day at Vin-Lee- Ron .
They start in pens , then make their way forward on a conveyor belt , snorting and whining louder the farther they get .
" Pigs are smart .
They know , " explained the slaughterhouse manager .
The pigs ride up the belt until they eventually meet a man who shocks them with two hundred volts , killing them instantly , though they still convulse for a few seconds .
Another man slits their throats , and they bleed out for seven minutes .
The pigs are then conveyed to various cutting stations , where assembly - line workers slice out specific parts .
It takes about two seconds to slice out a bladder , which looks like a water balloon .
It is then stored in a cooler and taken to a lab , where it is processed and either turned into a sheet like waxed paper or ground into powder .
Spievack followed his brother 's directions :
Every other day for the next eight days , he sat down at his living - room coffee table and sprinkled the powder on his finger .
Whatever powder fell onto the table he scooped up with a piece of paper , then dropped back into the vial .
He covered his finger with a Band - Aid .
A few days went by , and Spievack could see something was happening .
There was skin growing , and tissue on the inside , too .
He insists that what happened after four weeks did not surprise him in the least , though it should have .
Because his fingertip grew back .
The fingerprint took a couple more months .
The tip is a little hard on the end , but he can feel things just fine .
Spievack says he was particularly happy this past winter ; while all of his fingers chapped in the cold weather , the new fingertip did n't .
The only side effect during treatment was that his finger began to smell like a pig 's quarters at the state fair .
" It was a pretty offensive odor , " Spievack says .
He does n't much think about his finger anymore , except when he clips his nails .
He usually cuts them once a week , but the new nail has to be clipped every two days .
" That fingernail grows like a son of a bitch , " he says .
Asking Badylak what happened with Spievack 's finger does not produce an exceptionally long answer :
He does n't really know .
He can't fully explain why the scaffolds do what they do , and until he can explain that , he cannot manipulate the technology to grow back entire digits or organs .
He 's getting there , but he 's not there yet .
Still , the scaffolds have already been used in more than a million patients to regrow cartilage in sports injuries , rebuild urethras , and repair hernias , and Badylak 's lab will start testing the technology on human esophagi soon .
Meanwhile , Alan Spievack 's company , ACell , has had tremendous success with veterinary applications .
Not long ago , in his house near Boston , Spievack pulled up an image of a horse with a deep hole in his face as wide as a hand .
" This is Classy , " Spievack said .
" Now , Classy is your typical unlucky horse , et cetera . "
The horse had run into a fence and gouged out his face , including a big chunk of bone .
Surgeons at Colorado State University inserted the pig - bladder material into the hole during several surgeries over about a year .
There were pictures of the operations , which were bloody .
Then there was a picture of Classy , with his face completely healed .
" I know that good things can happen with this as a matrix and that there are a lot of different applications , " Badylak says .
" I 'm also just as sure that people will not regrow whole digits if you just put the powder on .
There 's missing pieces to the puzzle .
The problem is I do n't know how big the puzzle is . "
There are scientists who question whether the powder was really the catalyst for what happened to Spievack 's finger .
Ken Muneoka , a Tulane scientist who has been working on tissue regeneration for two decades , says his own research suggests that fingertips can grow back on their own , even in a man 's Spievack 's age .
He cautions that Spievack 's finger did not grow back in a controlled study — meaning the injury and the response to it were not compared with someone else 's in the same circumstances who did n't undergo treatment .
Badylak does n't deny the controlled - study issue , but he disputes the notion that someone as old as Spievack could grow the tip back on his own .
Some of this back - and - forth is the scientific equivalent of playground trash talk .
Both Muneoka and Badylak are at the center of a sort of Manhattan Project to regrow limbs .
The Defense Department research - and - development agency DARPA , located not far from the Pentagon in northern Virginia , has been closely watching the progress of limb regeneration , given the thousands of soldiers coming home from Iraq after getting body parts blown off .
The agency is now spending about $ 8 million to fund two teams of researchers racing to regrow toes in mice .
The upcoming year is make - or - break :
They must show DARPA that they can successfully take the first step and grow a blastema — a collection of cells that can form a new body part .
If they can do that , a toe is not far behind .
One of the teams , led by Muneoka , is growing extra arms on salamanders to see how the process might eventually be stimulated in humans .
Badylak leads the other team , which is trying to understand the role of the scaffolds .
Meanwhile , Badylak is also advising surgeons at the Army Institute of Surgical Research in San Antonio on a project to use the extracellular matrix to help soldiers returning from the war who have lost digits .
He says the project will be successful if the soldiers can grow back a little more than an inch of tissue .
" There is some sense of competition , " says Muneoka .
" Because at the end of the day , as we move to the next level of this type of work , not everyone 's gonna be sitting in the boat . "
Badylak is confident about his method , but he also believes that his approach alone is n't going to fully unlock the body 's regenerative potential .
There are researchers trying other methods .
Many are adamant that pig material does n't need to be used at all — that artificial scaffolds can work better and faster .
Other researchers are using the scaffolds in entirely different ways .
Anthony Atala , a urologist at Wake Forest and editor of the definitive Principles of Regenerative Medicine , takes cells from his patient 's bodies and grows them new bladders on large part - biological and part - artificial scaffolds in a lab .
Seven weeks later , he implants the bladders in the body .
Badylak says he does not want to be known as " the guy who grows fingers , " because he 's not sure he can do it , at least not yet .
But like it or not , pleas for his help reach him daily in the form of e-mails , letters , and phone calls .
His face sinks as he describes one :
" I'm a mother from Bologna , Italy , my daughter was born with a defective hand .
She 's three years old now .
She 's being made fun of in school .
We 'd like her to have a normal life .
She 's a beautiful child .
You know , we read about this , and we 're willing to travel to the States .
What can you do for us ? "
Badylak pauses for a moment .
" They 're just heartbreaking .
I got another last week from the family of a little girl that fell off a wagon and into a meat grinder — it included a picture of her hand all chopped up . "
For now , Badylak works at that potentially frustrating scientific junction of having achieved something remarkable but not being able to explain exactly how he did it .
" It 's a lot of fun , " he says .
" Much better than not being able to do it at all .
If you know that it can happen , then it 's easy to remain enthusiastic and motivated about looking for the reasons why .
If you do n't know for sure that it can happen , then you start to wonder if there is even an answer at all . "
For Badylak , the wondering is over .
The puzzle may be incomplete , but the answer , he knows , lives in Cincinnati , snapping together parts of model airplanes .

Their methods had echoes of the Gestapo : kidnapping at night by state officials who offered no evidence of identity .
Recently declassified secret documents reveal how at the end of the second world war an elite British unit abducted hundreds of German scientists and technicians and put them to work at government ministries and private firms in the UK .
The programme was designed to loot the defeated country 's intellectual assets , impeding its ability to compete while giving a boost to British business .
In a related programme , German businessmen are alleged to have been forced to travel to post - war Britain to be questioned by their commercial rivals , and were interned if they refused to reveal trade secrets .
The economic warfare programmes are detailed in batches of Foreign Office files , marked " Top Secret " , many of which lay unseen at the National Archives at Kew until discovered by the Guardian .
The files detail the way in which the scramble to uncover the Nazis ' military secrets during the dying days of the conflict in Europe , to assist the continuing war effort in the Far East , turned rapidly to an early cold war campaign to prevent Germany 's scientific and industrial assets falling into Soviet hands .
This , in turn , offered the British government an opportunity to exploit the scientific and technical know - how of the defeated nation , with scientists being regarded as a form of human booty who could help give the UK an economic and commercial edge
While it has long been known that German scientists and technicians worked in the US and Britain after the war , it has generally been assumed they were all volunteers , lured by the promise of good pay and accommodation .
However , the declassified papers make clear that for more than two years after the cessation of hostilities the British authorities were subjecting them to a programme of " enforced evacuation " .
One memo found at Kew , written in August 1946 by a senior civil servant working with the British military government in northern Germany , makes clear how this programme worked .
" Usually an NCO arrives without notice at the house or office of the German and warns that he will be required .
He does not give him any details of the reasons , nor does he present his credentials .
Some time later the German is seized ( often in the middle of the night ) and removed under guard .
" This procedure savours very much of the Gestapo methods and , quite apart from causing great and unnecessary inconvenience to the individual and to the industry employing him , it is bound to create feelings of alarm and insecurity .
" I have not been able to get to the bottom of the matter , but there appear to be two bodies which carry out these kidnappings . "
He was right .
The records show that abductions in the British - controlled zone of post - war Germany were carried out on the orders of an organisation called the British Intelligence Objectives Sub-Committee , or Bios .
This committee was answerable to the cabinet and made up of representatives of the armed forces and Whitehall departments , including the Board of Trade and Ministry of Supply , as well as MI16 - the War Office 's department of scientific intelligence .
The other organisation was the Field Information Agency ( Technical ) , or Fiat , which had been established during the war as a joint Anglo - American military intelligence unit , and which earmarked scientists for " enforced evacuation " from the US and French zones , and Berlin .
The papers even record how 50 scientists were rounded up from their homes in Magdeburg in the Russian zone in June 1945 , with many complaining over the loss of their homes , jobs and pensions .
Bios and Fiat both had offices in the same anonymous - looking Victorian town - house off Baker Street in London , from where investigators would be dispatched to search among the rubble of the shattered nation .
While many factories were being dismantled , as part of a post - war plan to limit Germany 's industrial capacity , the investigators would look for state - of - the - art machinery to be shipped back to Britain , research papers to be taken away and patents to be appropriated .
These teams would often include representatives of firms such as ICI and Courtaulds , and others from the shipbuilding , steel or aerospace industries , usually wearing British army officers ' uniforms .
As well as deciding which equipment and documentation to take , they also identified scientists and technicians to be removed .
The legality was never questioned : the British military government 's Proclamation No2 included a catch - all clause which said Germany would " provide such transport , plant , equipment and materials of all kinds , labour , personnel , and specialist and other services , for use in Germany or elsewhere , as the allied representatives may direct " .
Bios and Fiat also took advantage of post - war legal disagreements over what could be taken as reparations - which had been carefully negotiated by the allies - and what could be taken as " booty " - military material which the victors were entitled to seize from the battlefield .
After six years of total war , the British took the view that anything of scientific or industrial importance had a military potential , and that the whole of Germany had become a battlefield .
Responsibility for seizing the scientists fell to a unique British army unit known as T - Force .
Formed shortly after D Day , this lightly armed and highly - mobile force had raced ahead of allied troops at the end of the war , seizing objects which had a scientific or intelligence value before they could be sabotaged by retreating Germans , or captured by the Soviet Union .
After the war some officers and men from T - Force were formed into the Enemy Personnel Exploitation Section , which would escort the Bios and Fiat investigators and then take away the scientists and technicians wanted for interrogation .
Many of the detainees had indeed been involved in armaments work .
The papers show that among those most sought after were men with expertise in underwater acoustics , infrared technology , electron microscopes , munitions , optical glass and aircraft engine design .
Other target lists at Kew reveal a determination to trace technicians with knowledge of a " method of causing temporary blindness by ultra violet rays " , the manufacture of Sarin gas , and " physiological trials of chemical warfare gases " - which had been conducted on concentration camp inmates .
Also among the Bios teams , however , were British industrialists eager to learn more about anything from the coal mining to comb making , and from latest German printing technology to the secrets of leading perfume manufacturers .
In November 1946 the New Statesman reported that three members of a six - strong Bios team , which included representatives of Pears Soap , Max Factor and Yardley , had called at the home of an elderly woman whose family firm manufactured 4711 eau - de - cologne , a famous brand , and attempted to bully her into handing over the recipe .
When she was taken ill the team threatened to call a prison van to take her to a prison hospital .
Next day they telephoned to try again .
As a young civil servant , Julia Draper was the only civilian and the only woman attached to T - Force , where she would help to track down German scientists .
Now aged 86 , she recalls at her home in London that Bios investigators were as much concerned with capturing the intellectual property of British industry 's German rivals as they were with learning more about the Nazis ' military secrets .
" Many of the requests came from the War Office , but there were also requests from businesses like ICI and the other major industrial firms , " she says .
" Some of these scientists were remarkably important people in their field , and there was a lot we could learn from them . "
She recalls scientists being detained and sent to Britain against their will .
" There were things of that nature .
T - Force was a very , very strange organisation to be in . "
Some of the Germans would undoubtedly have volunteered to help , but others were clearly compelled .
The files show some were imprisoned in an Anglo - American internment camp near Frankfurt , while many were taken to internment camps in Britain .
After interrogation , which could last months , they were either returned to Germany or put to work with government ministries or British firms .
It is unclear exactly how many men fell prey to this programme .
In July 1946 military government officials told the Foreign Office they estimated there were 1,500 scientists who should forcibly be evacuated , 500 of them in the British zone .
" The proposed long - term policy is ... to remove as soon as possible from Germany , whether they are willing to go or not . "
Minutes of a Bios meeting three months later quote one official as saying the organisation could not deal with more than 600 .
The civil servant who complained of the " kidnappings " and " Gestapo methods " wrote that he knew of seven scientists from one IG Farben chemical plant who had been abducted in the previous two months .
Those who were put to work in Britain were paid , with Bios agreeing that each scientist would receive 15 shillings a week to cover expenses .
Initially , however , no provision was made for wives and children left behind .
In May 1946 the British military government urged Bios to make payments to dependants , as " cases of extreme hardship have previously occurred through Germans being removed to the UK for interrogation " .
Fiat was also concerned about this , but wanted the government to provide the funds .
" Several familes ... are completely destitute , " Fiat warned , adding that " this is likely to have very unfavourable effect on cooperation of other German scientists and technicians " .
By October of that year some US army officers were refusing to allow T - Force to remove scientists from the American zone unless they provided payments in advance .
The following month came the British response : each wife and child would be provided with " heavy workers ' rations " , and each family would receive 250 kg of coal a month .
Scientists were not the sole targets .
The papers disclose brief details about Operation Bottleneck , which aimed to extract business information .
In January 1947 Erich Klabunde , head of the German journalists ' union , complained about how this was being achieved .
A British official in Hamburg reported to headquarters that Klabunde told a public meeting : " An English manufacturer would name his German counterpart and competitor and ' invite ' him to England ( whether the man comes voluntarily or not is questionable ) .
They then discuss business and the German is gently persuaded to reveal secrets of his trade .
When he refuses , he is kept in polite internment until he gets so tired of not being allowed to return to his family that he tells the Englishman what he wants to know .
Thus for about £ 6 a day the English businessman gains the deepest secrets of Germany 's economic life . "
The rationale for this had been set out by Herbert Morrison , lord president of the council , who told the prime minister , Clement Attlee : " It is most important at this formative stage to start shaping the German economy in the way which will best assist our own economic plans and will run the least risk of it developing into an unnecessarily awkward competitor . "
The British were not alone in trying to secure commercial advantage from Germany 's scientists : countless numbers had also been snatched by the Russians .
The French used a different approach , luring skilled workers with lucrative contracts , and the Americans offered US citizenship to those they wanted most , including Wernher von Braun , who had headed the V2 rocket programme and went on to be chief architect of the Saturn V rocket which propelled the US to the moon .
While the Foreign Office warned against bringing scientists with " politically undesirable " backgrounds to the UK , the papers show little evidence of industry being concerned about the employment of Nazis .
By early 1947 the Foreign Office , exasperated at the way in which the looting of German industry , by all four occupying powers , was impeding the country 's reconstruction , secured an agreement that it would cease .
Accordingly , the British were expected to stop abducting scientists , and the military government sent a telegram to T - Force ordering that all " industrial and technical investigations will be terminated by 30 June 1947 " .
There was no intention of allowing these scientists to do as they pleased , however , as some may have chosen to work for the Soviets .
In April the Ministry of Defence drew up a list of 290 scientists to be traced urgently .
This formed the basis of a so - called denial list " against whom denial measures should be taken as a matter of urgency " .
Allowing German arms experts to settle elsewhere in Europe would be equally inadvisable , a Foreign Office discussion paper noted .
" It has hitherto been an objective of British policy to encourage the smaller powers , particularly in Europe , to equip their forces with aircraft and weapons of British design .
If these countries were to obtain technical reinforcement by recruitment of German research workers and designers they would be less likely ... to rely upon armaments of British design . "
From now on , however , German scientists were to be given employment contracts - which included a clause forbidding them ever to talk about their experiences - and strongly encouraged , rather than coerced , into travelling to Britain .
By the end of the summer , hundreds were employed across Britain .
While many British industries , particularly aerospace and armaments , wished to employ them , others were not sufficiently well organised to do so and there were too many scientists and too few jobs .
The government sent a few to Canada and Australia , and then appears to have concluded that they should go anywhere - except Russia or Europe .
It must have been in some desperation that Ernest Bevin , the foreign secretary , suggested to the cabinet defence committee : " Would it not , for example , be possible to carry out some fundamental research in Kenya ? "
Beneficiaries
British industrialists were eager to learn as much as they could from Germany , from the mining of coal to the making of perfume .
According to the National Archives , companies that employed German scientists and technicians immediately after the second world war included :
· ICI , the chemicals giant
· Courtaulds , the manufacturer of fabric , clothing , and artificial fibres
· Pears , the soap and cosmetics company
· Yardley , the maker of fragrances and toiletries
· Coal Oil Development , a company based in Swansea
· BSA Tools , the Birmingham machine toolmaker
Krys Wilken has done a great job writing a simple interface on top of PyLucene named TurboLucene .
PyLucene itself uses Lucene .
Lucene is a very popular text search engine , and is used by large systems such as Wikipedia and CNet .
The TurboLucene tutorial uses Kid templates and SQLObject .
I integrated it into my own project that uses Genshi and SQLAlchemy .
It ’s worth mentioning that PyLucene must be installed manually because it is OS dependent .
This adds complexity to making your application easy to install .
You must also disable Auto - Reload in your TurboGears configuration , which may slow down your development process .

Harvey Goldsmith vows to ruin online auctioneers ' lives for allowing touting of reunion tickets .
And he has little sympathy for genuine fans caught in the crossfire
Promoter Harvey Goldsmith has branded eBay the " biggest rip - off merchants in the world " after tickets to the forthcoming Led Zeppelin gig appeared for sale on the online auction website .
Goldsmith , who helped persuade the band to reunite for a one - off show this November , told Kerrang !
Radio yesterday : " I wish eBay would drop dead and die ...
I have begged them to take [ the tickets ] off and they have basically told us to fuck off .
So I will do everything I possibly can to ruin their lives . "
The promoter 's harsh words follow the news that fans who purchased tickets to the gig , taking place November 26 at London 's 02 Arena , on someone else 's credit card may be refused entry .
Those fans who won the right to buy tickets were issued with a password to validate their purchase , but it was announced at the weekend that they may be cancelled if the password holder 's name did not match the credit card holder 's name .
Harvey Goldsmith has responded to criticism of this policy on his blog : " I am fully aware that there seems to be concerns about people who became winners in the ballot and then decided to use somebody else 's credit card to pay for the ticket .
However , I am convinced that those who are bleating the loudest seem to be protesting too much for other reasons . "
Goldsmith added , however , that there may be a way around this problem for bona fide Zep fans .
" Of course there are a few people who genuinely want to come but may not have had a suitable credit card to pay for them , " he wrote . "
The answer to those people is very simple ; if you are genuine you will contact us and give us a justified explanation . "
Goldsmith announced details of the reunion last month , explaining that tickets would be allocated by ballot due to high demand .
Following the announcement , internet service provider Pipex announced that a stampede of Led Zeppelin fans had not only crashed the ticket registration website , but their entire service , and claimed that this meant around 20 million people must have been attempting to purchase tickets at the same time .
Tickets to the one - off show cost £ 125 , but are already nearing bids of £ 1000 on auction sites such as eBay .

It was on the 12th of March this year that I first heard about , and placed my order for , Forbidden Lego , a new book by Ulrik Pilegaard and Mike Dooley , $ 24.95 from No Starch Press .
It ’s finally here , and yes , you want a copy .
Forbidden Lego was written by a pair of Lego master builders , who used to work in designing advanced Lego sets ( e.g. , Mindstorms ) .
While they obviously got to work on lots of cool things while they were there , there were certain projects that just turned out not to be suitable to be made into kits released by the Lego company .
They wrote the book to give some kind of a tantalizing hint at the kinds of things that go on behind the scenes at Lego , and the kinds of neat things that might get released in a world without product liability suits .
The book starts out with an short introduction that explains the authors ’ motivation for writing the book , and an interesting discussion about the process of actually getting a model designed for production .
You do n’t normally think of bureaucracy when you see a Lego model , so it ’s surprising in some ways .
I particularly liked their comparison of the instructions included with Lego kits to dishes at Taco Bell :
In both cases , you want to make several different things with the same , small set of ingredients .
The Lego product safety standards are ( of course ) discussed in some detail , and more or less boil down to the question “ could it poke an eye out ? ”
( And poking eyes out is frowned upon . )
There are also apparently other Lego design rules and guidelines– models might be considered unsuitable for production if they require cutting bricks , using non-Lego components , or so forth .
But , creativity has its ways of oozing around rules , hence the book .
Forbidden Lego features five projects spelled out in the sort of excessive detail that you expect from a set of Lego instructions .
In fact , it ’s an interesting hybrid between a book for adults and a book for kids .
While the introduction is clearly aimed straight at the adult users of Lego , the instructions are in classic Lego style : ( nearly ) wordless and including every step– even the ones that could be instead written out as “ repeat for the other side . ”
On the third hand , these projects all involve cutting up Lego pieces , using non-lego objects in the design , and / or a good probability of poking an eye out .
Gathering up the parts to build one of these projects is different from building any other Lego set : the bricks are n’t included .
You are assumed to already have a healthy collection of bricks before you pick this book up .
Good assumption , I ’m guessing .
One of the things that I like about this book ( aside from the title ) is the level of care that went into the construction of the book itself – the binding is saddle - sewn with a soft cover that lies perfectly flat even when you ’ve only gotten as far as the introduction .
It ’s great since you ’ll need the book open to stay open while you ’re digging for that one little connecting piece .
Of course ( 1 ) it ’s a book about constructing things and ( 2 ) it ’s designed to be used , so it ’s only natural .
Here is where things start to get interesting .
You flip through the instructions and find , among the other parts called for , a plastic spoon ….
and that ’s why that wo n’t be made into a kit .
But , if you take a gander at what this looks like when it runs [ YouTube ] , you ’ll understand why it ’s worth building anyway .
( The video was released by the publisher – I have n’t built that model yet . )
To give the book and its instructions a real - world test , I built one of the models ( within a few hours of getting the book ) , the “ High Velocity Automatic Lego Plate Dispenser . ”
It ’s on the cover , and I ’m guessing that it ’s going to be the part that sells the most books – and with good reason .
It ’s a pistol - shaped Lego gun that fires bricks– 1X8 flat smooth tiles to be specific .
It can hold a clip of 14 bricks and fire them automatically , with a rate of about 3 - 4 per second .
( Check out the promotional video here . )
If you happen to have all the parts to build this lying around , that ’s great .
I did not have enough technical parts to build this model exactly according to instructions –
I had to improvise in several places , in particular completely redesigning the handgrip and trigger .
Here is what mine looked like :
I am entirely grateful that improvisation was required .
The extra difficulty of working without the right set of pieces makes the difference between blindly following a set of instructions ( which I do not enjoy ) and a real building challenge .
Interestingly , the “ important ” parts of the core design are actually more common Lego pieces .
I ca n’t really tell to what extent that ’s intentional .
So how does it work ?
Pretty damn well !
I get a range of about 6 - 10 feet , and I only wish that I had more 1X8 ammo .
( I only have six tiles . )
I made a short video of it ; take a look ( embedded here ) or directly on YouTube .
I do have a few criticisms to offer of the book , none of which is close to fatal .
In building the design , I found that the computer renderings were often dark and hard to read .
That ’s largely due to choosing dark colors of bricks for the builds ; a choice that could have been avoided .
I also think that I might have preferred to have seen more models than five , with a few steps skipped here and there to keep the length down .
Obviously , this is not a book for beginners – so maybe * not * showing the obvious details , or putting more steps per page would be acceptable .
Finally , I was a little puzzled because some of the pieces listed on the parts page were ones that I had not seen before and were not labeled .
That ’s just fine if you ’re opening a kit and just need to make sure that it ’s there – but with the book , it makes less sense if you have never seen that particular component before ….
so a few more labels and descriptions would be nice .
The instructions themselves are of course the real point of the book .
They are very good , unusual , and are sprinkled with little clever tricks .
( Where else is it written down how to make automatic weapons out of Lego ? )
I ’m happy to have my copy of Forbidden Lego , and I think that it belongs on the shelf of most serious , grownup Lego fans .
For the youngsters , be sure to read the warning labels ( “ Adult supervision required . ” ) – we do still live in a world with product liability suits , and I would n’t want to see this book pulled from the shelves .
Foreclosures soar , layoffs mount in US mortgage industry crisis
By Joe Kay
22 August 2007
The US housing market showed further signs of deterioration on Tuesday with the release of a report showing a sharp 9 percent increase in foreclosure filings from June to July .
World financial markets have been rocked in recent weeks by a credit crisis with origins in the US home mortgage market .
The report came a day after Capital One Financial Corp , a major US bank , announced it was shutting down a mortgage branch of the company , laying off 1,900 employees .
Tens of thousands of financial services jobs have been eliminated this year as a consequence of problems in the mortgage markets .
According to Realtytrac.com , a foreclosure research and marketing firm , there were a total of 179,599 foreclosure filings in July — including default notices , auction sale notices and bank repossessions .
This was a 93 percent increase over the same figure one year ago .
Foreclosure filings have been rising for over a year , although they fell seven percent in June .
Foreclosures are heavily concentrated in a number of states in which shifts in the housing market have been particularly devastating for working people .
California , Florida , Michigan , Ohio , and Georgia accounted for over half of the total number of foreclosures in July .
California ’s foreclosure activity is up 289 percent from July 2006 , and six California cities were among the top ten urban centers with the highest foreclosure rates in the country .
Michigan residents continue to be devastated by the attack on jobs and wages in the auto industry .
According to Realtytrac.com , “ Detroit posted a 70 percent month - over - month increase in foreclosure activity in July , pushing the city ’s foreclosure rate to one foreclosure filing for every 97 households — more than seven times the national average and the highest among 200 metro areas tracked . ”
Michigan as a whole had the third highest foreclosure rate in the country — one out of 320 homes .
Nevada had the highest rate of foreclosure , with one out of every 199 homes ( or 0.5 percent ) foreclosed in July .
Because it is a relatively less - populated state , however , Nevada did not rank among the top states for total foreclosures .
Georgia had the second highest rate , with one out of ever 299 homes foreclosed , a 75 percent increase over June .
The rise in foreclosures is bound up with the deflation in home prices , as struggling homeowners are no longer able to refinance their mortgages to meet monthly payments .
The maturing of adjustable rate mortgages has also led to a sharp increase in housing bills for many homeowners in recent months .
A separate report from the Office of Thrift Supervision ( OTS ) , part of the federal Department of the Treasury , reported difficulties in the savings and loan banking sector , which is heavily involved in home lending .
Troubled assets , defined as loans that are at least 90 days past due , have increased by 50 percent over the past year , to $ 14.2 billion .
According to an AP report , “ That ’s the highest level of troubled loans at the OTS since 1993 , with most of the problems in home mortgages , OTS officials said . ”
Meanwhile , Capital One Financial said it would shut down its GreenPoint mortgage arm .
The unit of the bank specialized in “ jumbo ” loans — those over $ 417,000 — and so - called “ Alt - A ” loans — loans to individuals who cannot fully document income or assets .
Capital One , whose main area of operations is credit cards , acquired GreenPoint when it bought up North Fork Bankcorp in 2005 .
North Fork paid $ 6.3 billion for GreenPoint in 2004 .
In a sign of the sharp downturn in the housing market , Capital One announced that it would take an after - tax charge of $ 860 million associated with the closure .
Unlike subprime loans , jumbo loans are generally made to individuals with good credit histories .
However , their large size means that they are ineligible for repurchase by the government - backed mortgages agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
Problems in the jumbo loan market reflect in part the over - extension of many homebuyers as housing prices have soared in recent years .
While such mortgages were once generally used to purchase luxury homes , in recent years even modest residences in states like California cost more than the $ 417,000 minimum that defines a “ jumbo ” loan .
Unable to afford the large monthly payments , buyers have been forced into foreclosure .
In a statement announcing the move , Capital One indicated that it saw broad worries in the mortgage industry extending beyond the subprime market .
“ [ R]ecent and continuing development in the mortgage markets reduce the long - term outlook for profitability in the business , as the company expects markets for prime , non-conforming mortgage products are likely to remain challenged for the foreseeable future . ”
In an internal memo , Capital One CEO Richard Fairbank said the closure was the result of “ an unprecedented set of market circumstances . ”
The layoffs at Capital One are only the latest in a spate of job cuts at US financial service companies , according to a report issued by consulting firm Challenger , Gray & Christmas on Tuesday .
Challenger reported that already in 2007 there have been 87,962 job cuts in financial services , 75 percent more than in all of 2006 .
The number of layoffs has been escalating in recent months , with nearly one quarter announced in the first three weeks of August alone .
Challenger found that 35,830 of the job cuts were tied to the housing market .
In addition , real estate firms have announced 1,950 job cuts , and construction firms 19,670 , so far this year .
The total for these two sectors is more than twice the number for 2006 .
In an interview with news agency Reuters , Challenger CEO John Challenger gave a sense of the magnitude of the shift .
“ Many companies expected the mortgage situation to implode ; they ’ve just been wondering when the bubble would burst , ” he said .
“ But many are stopping on a dime , shutting down operations .
Companies are not surprised by what ’s happening , but the reality of the situation and the speed with which it occurred is shocking . ”
In addition to Capital One , major job cuts have been announced at Bear Stearns , First Magnus Financial Corp , and Countrywide Financial Corp .
Troubles at Countrywide , the nation ’s largest mortgage lender in terms of volume , have been particularly worrisome for investors .
In an ominous sign for the banking system , depositors lined up in many cities on Monday morning to check on deposits and withdraw money from the institution ’s banks , after hearing of the company ’s financial troubles .
Late on Monday , Countrywide announced that it had cut 500 jobs at one of its lending divisions that specializes in Alt - A loans .
In an effort to maintain confidence in its operations , Countrywide took out advertisements seeking to assure consumers that all is well at the company .
Last week , the company reported that it had reached the limit of its $ 11.5 billion credit line , and there has been speculation that it could go bankrupt , or might be bought up by outside investors , including billionaire Warren Buffett ’s company , Berkshire Hathaway .
A series of other actions this week indicate a housing market that is in deep crisis :
* Thornburg Mortgage , which specializes in jumbo loans , announced on Monday that it had been forced to swallow a $ 930 million loss in order to unload top- rated mortgage securities to avoid a cash crisis .
The company had been frozen out of an important lending market after having its credit rating downgraded .
* San Francisco - based Luminent Mortgage Capital Inc. , a real estate investment trust , said on Monday that it would allow Arco Capital to buy a 51 percent share in the company at a deep discount in order to obtain necessary cash .
The company is suffering from a spate of housing mortgage default notices .
* Bank of America moved Toll Brothers , a luxury homebuilder , to a “ sell ” rating .
Many of Toll Brothers buyers use jumbo loans .
Bank of America analyst Daniel Oppenheim said that demand for new homes will likely fall by 35 percent this year .
The problems in the US housing market have set off a broader credit crunch , as investors fear the souring of loans to individuals and businesses .
In a sign of extreme nervousness among investors , the yield on short - term US Treasury bonds on Monday saw their biggest drop since the late 1980s .
Yields fall as investors buy the Treasury bonds , which are considered to be one of the most secure forms of investment .
The flight to treasury bonds came as investors dumped holdings in other assets , including corporate debt and securities related to jumbo mortgages .
Search has changed .
Online consumer information retrieval has reached another
inflexion point – a shift from pure algorithmic search to social search .
Searchers have become increasingly sophisticated , and basic algorithmic web
results are getting diluted out of most mainstream search experiences such as
Google , Yahoo , Microsoft , AOL and Ask .
Search is not solved .
At their most
sophisticated , users are still too often at a loss when executing a search .
According to Jupiter , 41.2 percent of users report that general search results
are often not directly relevant to queries , and 18 percent leave a search engine
without having found the information they were seeking .
First , there was basic algorithmic search ( such as AltaVista ) , and then came
very predictable paid search business models to fuel innovation .
The industry is
now maneuvering through its third era :
social search .
Humans are still better at some things .
Relevance remains
number one .
Throughout the past decade , a search engine ’s most critical success
factors – relevance , comprehensiveness , performance , freshness , and ease of use
– have remained fairly stable .
Relevance is more subjective than ever and must
take into consideration the holistic search experience one user at a time .
Inferring each user ’s intent from a mere 2.1 search terms remains at the core of
the relevance challenge
Social search addresses relevance head - on .
After " on - the - page " and
" off - the - page " criteria , web connectivity and link authority , relevance is now
increasingly augmented by implicit and explicit user behaviors , social networks
and communities .

among total English - language blog posts that mentioned " social search " .

What Is Social Search ?
What is social search ?
To paraphrase Microsoft’s
Ramez Naam , it ’s like every human
being is a neuron , and humanity as a whole is one giant brain , smarter as a
connected whole .
If you can increase the ability of humans to communicate with
each other , you make the whole planet smarter .
As articulated by Chris Sherman , social search is information retrieval , way
finding tools informed by human judgment .
Social search is people helping people
find stuff using plain - language questions and answers , collaborative content
harvesting , directory building , voting and ranking , sharing , tagging , commenting
on bookmarks , Web pages , news , images , videos and podcasts .
The wisdom of crowds – so well articulated by
James Surowiecki –
is at the root of emerging information retrieval tools .
Search engines are
trying to resolve user intent more than content connectivity , and social search
adds a new relevance layer to information retrieval in the form of context ,
freshness and some understanding of personal significance , personalization .
There is a shift underway from the few powerful elite to the empowerment of
the masses , from few - to - many to many - to - many publishing models with an explosion
in consumer - generated media .
According to a Pew Internet and American Life
report , 44 percent of Internet users are content creators .
A significant ratio
of the top 100 results for more queries are consumer - generated media such as
blogs and social networks , which sounds like an invitation for social media
marketers to seed more content .
Internet users are getting a lot more
comfortable interacting with the Web , as illustrated by MySpace ’s 159,271,726
profiles ( as of February 28 , 2007 ) , and the web is getting a whole lot more
fluid and transparent .
That said , not everybody needs to be tagging and voting
for collaborative efforts to reach critical - mass impact and benefit the rest of
us .
There is a shift taking place from the head to Chris Anderson ’s
long tail .
Social search offers a new discovery paradigm .
Internet search is for getting
stuff done ; it ’s an in - and - out navigational tool .
Search is also very much about
discovery browsing and community - driven recommendation engines .
Discovery
browsing is entering a whole new navigation paradigm exemplified by companies
like StumbleUpon .
The traditional
linear directory navigation model is broken .
Most emerging social discovery
engines are adopting tag clouds as navigation tools that complement the search
box .
Altering Search ’s Economics
Web 2.0 innovations are disruptive .
The emergence of open standards , richer
user experiences , content portability , social networks and communities are quite
disruptive to traditional algorithmic search , and are converging toward social
search .
Information retrieval is changing in real time .
Web 2.0 open standards
have in essence separated the content we search from its format and dedicated
application .
More and more frequently , information is being pushed to consumers
before they even have a chance to use a search engine to pull it from the Web .
AJAX and Flash are turning web pages into applications , themselves becoming
platform - independent mashups of RSS feeds , smart widgets , badges , and modules .
Are n’t we all spending more time in aggregators , emails , and applications that
automatically pull in information ?
Is the results page slowly getting
marginalized as the web ’s main information retrieval space ?
Social search levels the economics .
The explosion of consumer - generated
media , the emergence of social search and the rise of the net ’s culture of
participation will eventually force a democratization of the web ’s economics .
Content - generating users , driving traffic and eyeballs , will increasingly share
the wealth .
The web is slowly but surely leveling the playing field for the rest
of us in the tail .
More and more personal blogs , MySpace profiles , and other
communities display advertising and widgets wrapped around democratization of
revenue share including payment .
Consumers will eventually share the wealth in a
more democratic way .
YouTube announced a revenue - sharing program with authors ;
Bill Gates himself discussed rewarding users for searching .
Content - generating
users are increasingly part of the economics as well .
Eurekster already goes one
step further
suggesting how valuable swicky communities are , estimating that some
swickies could actually generate up to $ 30,000 a year in revenue to their owners
and be worth up to $ 300,000 if a buyer used typical methods for valuation .
Advertisers traditionally follow consumers .
Social search is already
channeling significant amounts of traffic and should accelerate the pace of
brand advertising dollars shifting online .
Internet sentiment analysis , buzz
monitoring and online reputation management could very well emerge as the next
significant search marketing era after search engine optimization and paid
search .
Conclusion : Search is the OS
Search is the operating system .
If Web 1.0 was about getting online and Web
2.0 about collaborative networking , then Web 3.0 must be about making all of
this useful and productive .
In more than one way , search is the internet OS
underlying most Web 2.0 applications .
Search is the Internet OS connecting
disjointed pieces of data hosted in totally different places and creating
incremental knowledge value .
Search is the Internet OS bridging communities and
enabling content experiences .

Back in February 's GOP Cattle Call , Trapper John wrote :
See , here 's the problem .
There 's this trend in Republican primary campaigns , identified by jimsaco in the December Cattle Call , where the Establishment Candidate -- the guy who has the money and the institutional backing -- always wins the nomination , no matter how bleak his chances appear at any given time .
Jimsaco dates the trend back to Dewey in ' 44 , and it holds up reasonably well -- with the possible exception of ' 52 , when Ike beat out Taft , and the more concrete exception of ' 64 , when Goldwater upset Rocky .
What we 'll call the " Establishment Candidate theory " has certainly held true since 1980 , when Reagan entered the race with friends and momentum from ' 76 and plenty of money , and ended up fairly cruising to victory in Detroit .
In ' 88 , Poppy Bush overcame Reagan - era scandals , his own inadequacies as a candidate , a well - funded , well - run challenge from Bob Dole , and disillusionment among the hard right cadres to win the nomination -- in what probably is the premier example of the predictive value of the Establishment Candidate theory .
In '96 , it was Dole 's Turn , and he had all the institutional backing he needed ( especially after the flameout of his potential rival for the Establishment nod , Phil Gramm -- more on Gramm later ) to earn the right to lose badly to Clinton .
And in the year 2000 , W was in the lead from the get - go -- check out the polls from as early as late ' 98 , when Bush was just crushing the field -- and bested an inspired McCain campaign due in large part to his institutional support throughout the country ( but especially in the state party in SC ) .
In 2008 , John McCain is most definitely the Establishment Candidate , despite the hoary media narrative of " McCain the Maverick . "
He 's wrapped up the lion 's share of Bush Pioneers and Rangers , he 's the only candidate to have obtained the services of any of the top - level Bush - Cheney operatives ( including media guru Mark McKinnon and former BC ' 04 political director Terry Nelson ) , and he 's obtained support from scores of the state party operatives who were so critical in saving Bush 's bacon in 2000 .
In short , he 's inherited the institutional mantle from his former rival , Bush .
And he did it while keeping his " independent " street cred .
Now , that famed maverick label is beginning to fade , especially in light of Bush 's decision to adopt McCain 's doomed escalation proposal -- but in a normal year , that 'd be OK .
Because history tells us that being the Establishment Candidate means that you win the nomination .
And as Herm Edwards reminded us , you play to win the game , not to be the martyred maverick .
So on one hand , the Establishment Candidate theory should dictate that McCain is the nominee , in spite of the fact that 1 ) substantial elements of the base dislike him , 2 ) he 's going to be identified with the Iraq disaster more than any other GOP candidate , and 3 ) his support is cratering .
After all , Poppy Bush went through some tough times -- finishing behind Pat Robertson in Iowa ! -- but being the Establishment Candidate saved it for him .
And yet . . . one can't help but notice that 1 ) substantial elements of the base dislike McCain , 2 ) he 's going to be identified with the Iraq disaster more than any other GOP candidate , and 3 ) his support is cratering .
And it may be early enough that the GOP establishment , loyal as it tends to be , decides that McCain -- who never was really one of theirs -- is dead meat , and that it 's time to stake another worthy .
That was , to some degree , the case in ' 96 -- when Phil Gramm ( a McCain supporter this time ) lost the mantle of the Establishment Candidate to Dole early on , after it became apparent that Gramm was going nowhere .

A federal judge in San Francisco yesterday temporarily barred the Department of Homeland Security from carrying out new rules to crack down on employers of illegal immigrants , dealing a legal setback to a central part of the Bush administration ’s effort to step up enforcement of the immigration laws .
The judge , Maxine M. Chesney of federal court for the Northern District of California , also ordered the Social Security Administration to suspend a mailing , scheduled to begin Wednesday , of some 140,000 letters to employers advising them that some of their employees ’
Social Security information did not match the agency ’s records .
Illegal immigrants often apply for work with false Social Security numbers .
The mailings , known as no-match letters , were going to be accompanied by a two - page notice from the Homeland Security Department advising employers of the new rules , which give them 90 days to fire any employee who cannot show valid Social Security identification or risk civil and even criminal charges for knowingly hiring illegal immigrants .
The rules were announced in August and were expected to take effect on Sept. 10 .
Judge Chesney scheduled a hearing on the matter for Oct. 1 .
The ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed Wednesday by the A.F.L. - C.I.O. , several California labor groups and the American Civil Liberties Union .
The suit argues that because of errors in the Social Security Administration ’s database , many American citizen and legal immigrant workers could be dismissed because of the new rules .
The suit also claims the rules could lead to discrimination against Hispanic workers .
Image : Frank Rodriguez Dehydrated and exhausted , I approach the gate agent and ask if she can find me a better seat for the red-eye to Chicago .
" Eight flights in one day ? " she asks suspiciously when my itinerary appears on her computer screen .
" You one of those United Airlines mystery shoppers ? "
I assure her I 'm not , and wonder if she 'll decide that my strange trip warrants a call to the TSA .
But a few seconds later she hands me a new boarding pass .
" Exit row , window " she says with a wink .
" Write nice things about me in your report , Mr. Secret Shopper . "
I was n't a secret shopper , but I was 18 spine - crushing hours into a knight 's tour of airport terminals in Chicago , Las Vegas , San Diego and three other cities .
Wired News gave me $ 500 and a mission : Squeeze as many miles as possible out of those five bills , using the tricks and techniques invented by a subculture of airline hackers called " mileage runners " who specialize in accumulating frequent flyer miles at low cost .
Now with more than 6,000 miles and 31 hours booked , my only problem was how to spend the other $ 224 .
Mileage runners are the high - tech nomadic wanderers of the air .
Predominantly male , generally obsessed with flying and miles , and typically employed in white - collar careers that involve significant business travel , they scour the web for cheap flights , phoning in sick or using vacation days to fly the longest itineraries they can string together .
Five Steps to a Successful Mileage Run
Booking long , inexpensive flights can help you run up the maximum miles .
Here 's how :
Use the interactive maps at Travelocity or FareCompare to find a cheap round - trip flight from your home city .
2. Locate full fare and routing rules for the flight .
Many sites offer only a truncated version , but Priceline lists the complete rules .
3 . Study restrictions that apply to the flight you 've chosen , paying special attention to the routing rules , which dictate how many connections you can make and in which cities .
4. Use ITA 's Trip Planner software to build specific itineraries that meet the fare and routing rules .
5 . Once Trip Planner has located a trip that meets your criteria , attempt to book it on the appropriate airline 's website , or on Orbitz , which is powered by ITA 's software .
If this fails , contact the airline by phone to book the itinerary , being sure to give the agent the fare and booking codes provided by ITA .
A mileage runner might extend his New York to Seattle trip by adding a connection in , say , Miami .
Or he might spend 16 hours flying to London , grab a pint at Heathrow , and then immediately board a flight back home .
If the price is right , she might fly back and forth between two cities four times in a single day .
For mileage runners , getting there is n't half the fun – it's the whole point .
" I personally find airlines and airplanes to be really neat , " explains Joshua Solomin , a 28 - year - old mileage runner who works as a software manager in San Francisco .
Solomin began running in 2006 after a year of business travel vaulted him into the Premier tier of United 's Mileage Plus program , giving him his first taste of the first - class upgrades and other coveted perks that come with elite - level frequent flyer membership .
" Mileage runs are a way to maintain that status , " he says .
Of Solomin 's five runs to date , one of the more impressive was a trip from San Francisco to Tampa via Los Angeles , San Diego and Washington , then back with connections in D.C. , Seattle and Portland .
Thanks to his Premier status , he earned double miles for the trip , more 16,000 of them , for just $ 232 .
On Sunday , he completed his first international run : a $ 1,450 round trip between San Francisco and Singapore with stops in Los Angeles , Hong Kong and Tokyo .
Sure , he had only five hours in the middle of the night to explore Singapore , but with United 's July triple mileage bonus he earned a whopping 78,000 miles .
And he flew business class the entire way .
Status is important to mileage runners – Solomin refers to himself as a " United 1 K " the way I refer to myself as a writer – but there 's more to running 's appeal than just the airline rewards .
" If you like puzzles , it 's lots of fun , " says Solomin .
Assembling a mileage run means deciphering complex fare rules and pulling together information from up to a dozen websites .
It 's an achievement that tickles the same satisfying problem - solving centers of the brain as a Sudoku puzzle , and always ends in the deep - rooted human thrills of travel and flight .
To get prepared for my own run , I spent weeks lurking on FlyerTalk.com , a message board that serves as a hub for the mileage obsessed .
It 's the place where runners post their itineraries , search for deals and seek advice from like - minded mileage hounds ( " Need help on AA MR from ORD , " pleads one post ) .
From there I learn the basics , then start planning a beginner 's trip .
Mileage runner Samir Bhatnagar 's first trip between Washington D.C. and San Francisco cost $ 113 , and yielded 27,000 miles .
Photo : Samir BhatnagarUsing Travelocity 's Dream Maps , I scour for cheap round - trip flights originating from my home base in Boston .
Then I carefully parse the applicable rules and restrictions to figure out when I can travel and to map out various routing options ( a BOS - SYR - ROC-BUF -PIT - WAS / BWI - RDU routing rule indicates that if the connections exist , I 'm allowed stops in Syracuse , Rochester , Buffalo and either Washington D.C. or Baltimore on my way to Raleigh - Durham ) .
Finally , I plug potential trips into a little - known travel website run by an airline - software firm that excels at complicated route planning , painstakingly stacking multiple connections like Jenga blocks to create the longest itinerary possible without breaking the fare .
It all seems straightforward enough , but each time I attempt to purchase my flights on Orbitz , a mileage runner favorite that can handle complex , multi-segment itineraries , something goes wrong :
There are no more seats , or a connection is too close for comfort .
Finally though , I have my trip .
I 'll leave Boston on a Tuesday at 6 a.m. and arrive in Las Vegas 13 hours later , making stops in Washington D.C. , San Diego and San Francisco .
After a six - hour layover in the City of Sin , I 'll board the midnight red-eye for Chicago , then fly back through Washington D.C. before finally arriving in Boston at 1 p.m. on Wednesday .
I add it all up using a website called Great Circle Mapper :
While the nonstop roundtrip comes in at 4,762 miles , my run will yield 6,356 .
And the whole thing costs just $ 275.80 .
Image : Frank RodriguezMileage runs began in the 1980s , when the financially shaky and now defunct domestic carrier Eastern Airlines launched a triple - mile promotion for all its flights .
With $ 29 Eastern tickets suddenly yielding up to 6,000 miles , travelers found themselves racking up enough points for a trip to Hawaii in just weeks .
Runs became more popular when airlines tacked new , " elite " levels to their frequent - flier programs in the mid-to - late 1980s .
Not only did these provide upgrades and other perks , but the new levels offered mileage bonuses , effectively giving dedicated runners mushrooming returns .
Then in the 1990s , mileage running took full flight when the web made it possible for runners to hunt for cheap fares without harassing a travel agent and – thanks to sites like FlyerTalk – form communities and easily share information .
Grueling Schedules , Rock - Bottom Fares
The author books two trips in order to test mileage - runner techniques aimed at racking up maximum air miles for the lowest possible price .
These trips are n't for the faint of heart , as the itineraries below show .

Founded by Randy Petersen , a longtime mileage aficionado who quit his job in 1986 to start a frequent - flyer newsletter , FlyerTalk today boasts over a half million monthly visits , and is part of Frequent Flyer Services , a 12 - company multimedia empire that reports on more than 170 travel - loyalty programs .
" When I started this business 21 years ago , people used to tell me to get a real job , " Petersen tells me when I reach him in Colorado Springs .
" Now they 're all jealous . "
I ask Petersen how the airlines feel about mileage runs and tools like FlyerTalk that make them possible .
" Of course they do n't like that so many people are engaged in activities that allow them to get these incredibly cheap fares , " he says .
But he adds that savvy airlines monitor the FlyerTalk boards to gather information about how their frequent - flyer programs are being perceived .
" With FlyerTalk , you really do n't need a focus group , " Petersen says .
" It 's all right there . "
FlyerTalk bills itself as " the world 's largest frequent - flyer community , " offering forums on everything from new routes and information on airline - branded credit cards to travel technology and safety .
It also addresses truly urgent issues like which United flights still offer full - sized wine glasses in their first - class cabins .
FlyerTalk boasts nearly 142,000 members , and the sections dedicated to mileage running contain more than 192,000 posts divided into 16,984 threads .
If FlyerTalk serves as the heart and soul of mileage running , Cambridge - based ITA Software has become its brain .
In the travel industry , ITA is known for selling sophisticated route - planning software to the likes of Continental Airlines , Alaska Airlines and Orbitz .
But mileage runners know it for an unadvertised web service called Trip Planner that uses the same engine – ITA makes it available free to test new features and fix glitches .
" It turns the world into our QA department , " says ITA co-founder and CEO Jeremy Wertheimer , who seems tickled to learn that mileage runners use his site to search for the cheap , multi-segment flights that form the backbone of many mileage runs .
Mileage runners have mastered Trip Planners ' special route language , allowing them to generate trips with very specific properties – " BOS : : DL SLC DL " sends the software searching for a two - segment Delta Airlines trip from Boston with a connection in Salt Lake City , for example .
( See " Behind the Fiendish Complexities of Airfare Pricing . " )
My first flight departs Logan on time at 6 a.m. , and for the next 13 hours I 'm in the air or in an airport .
The connections are tight and United 's coach seats even tighter , but things go smoothly .
I eat several $ 5 United Airlines snack packs and watch Ed Norton die of cholera in The Painted Veil on the long Washington to San Diego leg .
I miss a connection at United 's big hub in San Francisco , but I 'm put on another flight less than an hour later .
I 'm exhausted by the time I arrive in Vegas , and when the nice waitress at the Paris casino buffet seats me in the depressing section reserved for people who travel alone , I 'm too tired to even care .
My spirits are buoyed when I win $ 100 playing video poker , and the gate agent who thinks I 'm a secret shopper gives me a cushy exit - row window seat .
But my flights back to Boston are crowded , bumpy and uncomfortable .
When I finally arrive home on Wednesday , I swear I 'll never fly again .
A week later I 'm fully recovered , and eager to share my tale with a real , hard - core mileage runner and bask in the weary glow of my successful run .
I reach Samir Bhatnagar , a Northwest Platinum Elite member , as he packs for a 10 - day vacation to Romania and Ukraine , a trip he booked after finding what mileage runners refer to as a " fat fingered fare , " on FlyerTalk .
Fat - fingered fares are mistakes , often incorrectly entered into reservation systems by the airlines – a $ 179.00 round trip listed for $ 1.79 , for instance .
They 're usually honored by the airlines , and FlyerTalk members post page after page of them , along with advice on how to book them without tipping off the airline to its error .
I brag to Bhatnagar about my first run : " 4.3 cents per mile .
Pretty good , right ? "
" Um , I think everyone defines ' good ' a little bit differently , " he says kindly , before explaining that he typically wo n't do mileage runs that come in at more than 2 cents a mile .
Bhatnagar , a 28 - year old hospitality - industry employee who lives in the Washington D.C. area , first became interested in mileage running after attending a FlyerTalk function ( Mileage runners sometimes arrange their trips so that groups of them can convene on a certain city for cocktails , dinner and discussion ) .
His first run was a Washington to San Francisco trip that cost $ 113 and earned him 27,000 miles .
" Do that twice and you 've got a free ticket , " he explains .
I decide that I need professional help if I 'm going to achieve a respectable mileage return for Wired News ' money .
Desperate , I go looking for Viajero Joven , a shadowy figure who lives on the fringes of mileage running .
Joven 's website , EliteHelper.com , helps travelers " reach their frequent - flyer goals " by offering $ 19 to $ 49 mileage - run consultations .
Fearing that the airlines will blacklist him for helping travelers game their frequent - flyer programs , Viajero Joven refuses to reveal his real name – his alias is Spanish for Young Traveler ) – and his site provides no contact information , only a PayPal link .
When I finally track him down , he 's at an airport on his way to Europe .
" London , Paris , Milan , Rome , Madrid and Athens – I 'm using miles for the whole thing , " he tells me . "
But I 've got some time if you want to talk . "
He sounds cool and self - assured – like a man who knows what he 's talking about .
Joven is clearly underwhelmed with my mileage - running approach , and patiently explains that living in New England , I should be focusing not on miles , but on segments , which are easier to accumulate in the compact Northeast but still count toward elite qualification .
He suggests I look at US Airways , and nixes my big idea for a South American mileage trip ( " poor return on the dollar , " he explains ) .
Before hanging up , he reminds me that the summer travel season is a tough one for finding good runs , and urges me to keep the faith .
" It takes patience , " he tells me soothingly .
" And do n't just jump at the first thing you find .
Think carefully about your goals before you book a trip . "
I take Viajero Joven 's advice and book my second run with an eye on segments : Boston to Washington to Philadelphia to Detroit , an uncomfortably tight 27 - minute layover , then back to Philly , and up the coast to New York and finally Boston .
Six segments , 17 hours , $ 196.00 .
The trip goes off without a hitch : I make all my connections and I 'm home by 9:30 p.m .
I earn only 3,000 miles , but I 'm six segments closer to silver status on US Airways – the equivalent of another 5,000 miles .
My new rate of return is 3.92 cents per earned mile .
I 'm getting better .
And I still have $ 27.79 burning a hole in my pocket .

So , you do n't mind being followed and tracked ?
You do n't care if your friends can see what websites you 've been to lately , what software you 've been running , or even what music you 've been listening to ?
Then you 'll love the web 's trend towards extreme openness : sharing everything you do on your computer .
Sometimes referred to as sharing your ' attention ' data , this is a growing market .
Below , we round up 12 services that want to track your every move - voluntarily .
Wakoopa is an excellent service which tracks what software you have been running .
It keeps tabs of what software is running in the background , what software you have installed , and what software you actively use .
Every so often the software uploads this data to the Wakoopa site where it then lists all programs you have been running .
The interesting thing here is that you can add friends to track individually or join a team and combine the data .
Thanks to Wakoopa , I have found several useful programs that I now use regularly .
Last.fm has been making news with the site being acquired by CBS for nearly $ 300 million .
If you 're a tech - savvy music fan , you probably already use it .
With Last.fm you download a small program which gathers information on the current song you are playing through your favorite mp3 software application .
Through a process called " scrobbling , " the software determines what song you are listening to and then uploads this song ’s data to the server and then keeps track of it .
On the website itself there are many ways of viewing the data which is fun to play around with .
To be honest though , I think the greatest part is learning exactly how much horrible music you listen to and what songs your friends listen to in comparison .
( Our Last.fm review . )
Cluztr takes it to the web by tracking every site you visit online through your browser .
Not only that , it also keeps a history log or " clickstream " of all those sites .
One word of advice , avoid visiting sites that your mother would not think much of , as it ’s all out there for your friends to view .
Cluztr installs a plug - in to your FireFox or Flock browser ( sorry IE and Safari users , Cluztr is hopeful for a mid to late 2007 release ) where it then captures your entire web surfing history and compiles it into your “ clickstream ” which you are free to share or publish on the web for all your friends to see .
There are also social functions built into the sidebar which allow for posting of messages for that specific site which other users can see when visiting that same site .
( Our Cluztr review . )
AttentionTrust offers services similar to Cluztr .
AttentionTrust installs as a browser plug - in and tracks the sites you visit .
You can then take this data and share it with other applications or development projects that could make use of this data , or simply store it on your desktop .
AttentionTrust 's idea is to let you share this data with in interested parties for a fee - in other words , a form of lead generation .
Atten .TV is another site that allows you to follow what you or your friends are clicking on around the web .
You have the option to share this data or keep it private .
It is completely up to you .
Since you are reading this article , I think it is safe to assume you are leaning towards the former option .
The downloadable application is only for Mac OS currently .
( Our Atten.tv review . )
Me.dium can be considered a competitor to Cluztr .
Me.dium takes the same basic approach , but does n't act as a personal log : instead , it lets you see which sites your friends are on , and join them there .
It is simply personal preference on your decision to use Cluztr , Me.dium , Atten . TV or AttentionTrust .
( Our Me.dium review . )
Plazes is a service that tracks where you are no matter where you are in the world .
So now if you not only want your pals to know where you are online , you can have them know where you are in person .
Just be sure not to get in to trouble with this service .
i Stalkr does n’t keep tabs on you directly , but rather , indirectly by utilizing RSS and ATOM feeds that most social web 2.0 sites are utilizing now .
If you sign up for an iStalkr account and enter some social sites you are a member of , like Del.icio.us and Twitter , iStalkr will then grab the RSS / ATOM feed for that service and will be able to get your updates from the site .
To put it simply , think of iStalkr like as a central hub for your social website information and updates .
( Our iStalkr review . )
SlifeShare is an application built for the Mac OS primarily .
If you are running Firefox you can install the extension regardless of what OS you run .
SlifeShare is similar to iStalkr in that the application tracks data from multiple sources and acts as a central hub , but SlifeShare takes it a step further and collects this data directly .
Music , videos , photos , websites , applications , and more are tracked and then the data is displayed on the SlifeShare website which you can share with friends .
You are only allowed five friends , after which you must either become a premium user or just stick with the five friend limit .
( Our SlifeShare review . )
YouTube Active Share simply allows you to share videos that you watch on YouTube with all your friends .
Your profile will show what videos you have recently watched and when you are currently watching a video while others are viewing the same video , they will see your name appear on a list of people currently watching that video .
Particls is a downloadable application which does n’t necessarily track what you do , but instead tracks what you are most interested in receiving information about .

Democrats wo n't stop funding war , leader says , but no more ' blank checks ' for Bush David Edwards and Nick Juliano

The Senate still is not ready to do everything in its power to end the war in Iraq by completely eliminating war funds , but it is determined not to give President Bush a " blank check " to continue occupying the country either , Democratic Leader Harry Reid said Friday .
Appearing on the Ed Schultz Show , Reid blamed Democrats ' inability to affect a course change in Iraq on the party 's tenuous majority in the Senate .
But with a renewed debate over war funding coming next week , he said they were committed to passing a war funding bill that would require a troop redeployment begin immediately and have all but a " limited number " of troops out of Iraq by June .
" We 're not going to give him a blank check on that , believe me , " Reid vowed .
" We 're going to put conditions [ on ] any money that is given .
...
We 're going to fight as we have every step of the way . "
The majority leader acknowledged that Democrats have the power to simply refuse to fund the war , which would force a de facto withdrawal , but he argued that such an approach would be wrongheaded .
" Sure we have the power on anything to stop the money .
That 's what it 's all about ; that 's why we have three separate branches of government , " Reid said .
" But the thing we have to do is make sure we do it the right way .
It 's not a question of all or nothing , it 's a question of making sure we do the right thing . "
Reid said he and Sen. Russ Feingold ( D - WI ) were crafting a bill that would force the president to being pulling out troops .
While he acknowledged that Democrats did not yet have the support of 60 senators necessary to break a filibuster , Reid predicted they would be able to garner the necessary support before a bill went to a vote .
Schultz called on Reid to go father and cut of all funding , arguing that a majority of the American people want to see an end to the war .
" The American people want the war stopped , you can say a lot about 60 votes senator , but the public 's with you , " Schultz said .
" If you go to the floor or call a press conference and say , ' It 's over , you 're not getting any more money , ' there would be a groundswell of support . "
Reid said even Feingold -- one of the Senate 's most ardent war opponents -- was not calling to cutoff funding completely , and he said the Senate needed to approve some more money , just far less than the nearly $ 200 billion the president has asked for .
" We ca n't just walk away , " Reid scolded , " and nobody suggests we can . "

Jeff Bezos finally gave the world a peek at his rocket .
The billionaire founder of Amazon.com has an interest in space , and more than enough money to pursue his interests .
In 2000 , he registered a company , Blue Origin , and hired rocket scientists .
But the company has been obsessively secretive .
The last time Mr. Bezos gave out any kind of real information , he walked into the offices of The Van Horn Advocate in West Texas to tell the editor that he had bought 165,000 acres nearby and would be testing rockets there .
When the company performed the first test launching on Nov. 13 , it made no announcement .
And that was it , pretty much , until last week , when the Blue Origin Web site ( www.blueorigin.com) showed the first pictures and video of a gumdrop - shaped test craft , dubbed Goddard , rising from the West Texas launch site to 285 feet and then , eerily , returning gently to the pad .

The announcement was , for the most part , a come - on for rocket scientists — or , as Mr. Bezos put it on the site , “ hard working , technically gifted , team - oriented , experienced ” aerospace engineers — to continue development of what the company calls its “ New Shepard ” spacecraft .
“ The pipe draws wisdom from the lips of the philosopher , and shuts up the mouth of the foolish , ” wrote W.M. Thackeray a hundred years ago ; and to this day , pipe smoking retains a certain connotation of sophistication .
The hoi polloi may take their tobacco by cigarette or cigar , but a true connoisseur of the brown leaf would n’t think of any means of fumigation aside from the pipe .
Perhaps the veneration of pipe smoking stems partly from its long popularity , for centuries in Europe , the pipe was virtually the only means of tobacco smoking .
The common myth about the introduction of tobacco in Europe credits Sir Walter Raleigh with bringing the leaf from Virginia to England in the late sixteenth century .
True , Raleigh ’s tobacco created an immediate sensation at the court of Elizabeth I , but tobacco smoking actually first came to Europe by quite another means , involving neither the English nor the North American Indian .
Christopher Columbus observed the Indians of the Caribbean smoking tobacco , writing of “ men with half - burnt wood in their hands . ”
According to one story , the first European to smoke was Rodrigo de Jerez , one of Columbus ’s crew members , who sampled tobacco in the West Indies and brought a pinch home with him to Spain .
Jerez ’s wife , so the tale goes , later denounced him to the Inquisition as a man who “ swallows fire , exhales smoke , and is surely possessed by the devil . ”
Spanish explorers in Mexico found the Aztecs smoking crushed tobacco leaves in corn husks .
Tobacco reached the European continent at least as early as 1558 , when a Spanish physician named Francisco Fernandes , sent to the New World by King Philip II to report on its products , brought back some plants and seeds .
The following year , Jean Nicot , the French ambassador to Portugal , sent tobacco seeds to the French court of Catherine de Medici .
The queen reported that tobacco cured her of crippling headaches , and she immortalized Nicot by proclaiming the new plant Nicotiana , a name recognizable in our word for tobacco ’s most baleful element , nicotine .
Sir Walter Raleigh may not have been the first to introduce tobacco in England .
Some historians claim that one John Hawkins brought back the leaf in 1565 after a voyage to Florida .
In any case , we know that Sir Walter had a large hand in popularizing tobacco smoking in Europe .
Raleigh sent Sir Francis Drake on an expedition to colonize Roanoke Island , North Carolina , in 1585 .
When the expedition failed , Drake returned to Europe .
He brought some tobacco and smoking implements to Sir Walter , who soon became the most notorious smoker in Renaissance England .
According to one story , Raleigh lit a pipe before Queen Elizabeth and was promptly rewarded with a dousing by a member of the court who thought Sir Walter was on fire .
A die - hard smoker indeed , Raleigh even “ tooke a pipe of tobacco a little before he went to the scaffolde . ”
By 1600 , the “ dry drink ” was fashionable in much of Europe .
Many pipe smokers of the time carried hand - carved tobacco rammers , used to press the shredded leaf into the pipe bowl .
Some of the more ornate rammers doubled as large finger rings .
Smokers also had to carry ember tongs to hold the burning embers of juniper wood used to light their pipes .
Cigarettes were little known at the time .
It was the beggars of Seville who get credit for creating the first paper - wrapped smokes .
Seventeenth - century doctors prescribed tobacco as a cure - all , fashioning the leaf into pills , plasters , poultices , oils , salts , tinctures , and balms .
During the London plague of the 1660 ’s , many people smoked tobacco as a preventive .
Even in the later part of the century , doctors continued to prescribe the leaf for such disparate ailments as hiccoughs , imbecility , jaundice , corpulence , syphilis , and “ general lousiness , ” , for everything except a bad cough .
Some physicians even recommended a tobacco - smoke enema for various ailments .
The enema , administered with a device known as the Clyster pipe , was said by one doctor to be “ excellent good against colic . ”
And James I of England proclaimed that the Clyster pipe was the only way to take one ’s tobacco .
Well , different smokes for different folks .
It ’s odd that James would comment favorably on tobacco , in any form or guise , since the monarch had always been a bitter foe of the leaf .
In his Counterblast to Tobacco , James described smoking as “ a custom loathsome to the eye , hateful to the nose , harmful to the brain , dangerous to the lungs , and the black stinking fume thereof nearest resembling the horrible Stygian smoke of the pit that is bottomless . ”
And you thought the Surgeon General was harsh on tobacco !
Tobacco cultivation was important in the American colonies from their earliest history .
In fact , before the Revolution , tobacco was legal tender in several Southern colonies with large plantations .
Virginia enacted a law ordaining that taxes be paid in tobacco .
George Washington , you ’ll remember , was reported to have written from Valley Forge : “ If you ca n’t send men , send tobacco . ”
American cigarette manufacture dates from the Civil War , when Greek and Turkish tobacconists in New York City began hand - rolling expensive imported tobaccos .
By that time , the cigarette , from the Spanish cigarito , was already the favored tobacco product in some parts of Europe .
It was n’t until the 1880 ’s , when natural leaf cigarettes made from domestic tobaccos began to dominate the market and machine - rolled butts first replaced the hand - rolled varieties that cigarettes became affordable by all .
Yet cigars and pipes remained more popular until 1920 .
By the 1950 ’s , cigarettes accounted for over 80 percent of all American tobacco consumption .
In the early days of cigarette manufacture , a factory worker could hand - roll about 18,000 cigarettes per week .
Crude machines for cigarette - rolling began to appear in the mid-1870’s .
In the following decade , the machines replaced hand - rollers almost completely , with one machine doing the job of fifty workers .
A modern machine can turn out about 1,500 cigarettes per minute , or 36,000 packs in an eight - hour day .
In 1880 , American cigarette production stood at a mere half billion .
By 1895 , the figure had soared to 4 billion .
A large increase following World War I pushed the figure up to 124 billion .
Another big rise after World War II brought the total to 400 billion .
In 1975 , cancer not withstanding , American cigarette consumption passed the 600 - billion mark for the first time .
Has the increased awareness of the dangers of tobacco smoking lowered cigarette use to any great extent ?
In 1964 , the year of the Surgeon General ’s first warning regarding smoking , 52 percent of all men of presumed smoking age were regular smokers ; by 1976 , the figure stood at only 32 percent .
But smoking among women showed an increase over the same period , and total consumption has risen since 1971 .
By 1975 , there were an estimated 30 million former - smokers among the ranks of the non-smokers , with some 50 million persons still clinging to the habit .
Despite the Surgeon General ’s warning , repeated on every pack of American cigarettes , the United States still leads the world in per capita cigarette smoking .
In 1973 , the average American fifteen years of age or older smoked 3,812 cigarettes , that ’s about a half pack daily for each person , and well over a pack for each smoker .
Japan is close behind with 3,270 cigarettes per capita annually , the United Kingdom third with 3,190 , and Italy fourth with 2,774 .
West Germany , Denmark , and Sweden round out the top seven .
Cigarettes today are sold in three basic sizes , regular non-filter , regular filter , and 100 - mm .
king size , but in the past , butts have been sold in a wide range of sizes .
In the 1930 ’s , when cigarettes were taxed individually in some places , to save tax , one manufacturer brought out “ Head Plays , ” each cigarette eleven inches long .
“ Lilliput ” cigarettes only one - and - a- quarter inches long appeared in England in the 1950’s .
And “ English Ovals ” are just that , oval in shape instead of round .
Philip Morris ’s Marlboro remains the most popular cigarette on earth , the 136 billion sold annually making the entire world “ Marlboro Country . ”
Long before cigarettes became popular here , the pipe was well entrenched .
Pipe smoking was common even among women for a time , and the wives of two American presidents , Andrew Jackson and Zachary Taylor , were known to light up in the White House .
Women pipe smokers are still numerous in China , where cigarettes are rarely encountered outside the major cities .
Speaking of female pipe smokers , perhaps you ’ve heard the one about the young lady who retired to the cafeteria during her coffee break and lit up a pipe .
“ That ’s a despicable habit , ” remarked an elderly woman sitting nearby .
“ I would rather commit adultery than smoke ! ”
“ So would I , ” answered the young lady , “ but there just is n’t enough time during a coffee break . ”
The first men , or women , to smoke probably managed without any implements at all , simply inhaling smoke billowing from a bonfire of burning leaves .
The Greek historian Herodotus reported that certain Scythian tribes “ drank smoke ” from a fire , inhaling the fumes of what was most likely marijuana .
The first pipe fashioned by man was probably a tube pipe , a simple hollow cylinder of wood or bone .
Tube pipes have been found in almost every cranny of civilization , some dating back as far as 200 B.C.
And the use of a curled - up leaf as a makeshift tube pipe later led to the invention of the cigar .
In some cultures , the earliest pipe was the “ mound pipe , ” a small mound of earth with a depression hollowed out on top to hold the tobacco , and hollow reeds protruding through the mound as rudimentary pipe stems .
To make use of a mound pipe , the smoker had to lie on the ground on his belly and slip the reed through his lips .
These primitive pipes were still being used by Indian soldiers in World War I .
The Indians of South America frequently built communal mound pipes , with as many as 150 people gathering around to share a smoke .
When the first reed and clay pipes appeared among the Indian tribes , smoking was still regarded as a communal pastime .
Thus arose the custom of passing the pipe around among the group .
Europeans exploring America in the sixteenth century found some Indians smoking a kind of tube pipe shaped like the letter “ Y ” , the smoker inserted the two upper prongs of the pipe into his nostrils and aimed the lower tube at a mound of burning leaves .
Archaeologists in Africa have found tube pipes made of clay or reed measuring up to six feet long .
Indians of the Central United States carved stone pipes with either straight or curved stems .
They smoked a blend they called kinnikinnik , made of tobacco , sumac leaves , and the bark of the willow tree .
The Indians , who considered tobacco a sacred herb and regarded smoking as a sacred art , frequently shaped their pipe bowls in the form of animals and other totems .
Historians have been unable to explain why some pipes found in the ruins of ancient Indian settlements were carved in the form of elephants and sea cows , two creatures the Indians had presumably never seen .
The calumet , or peace pipe , was usually a long , slender pipe with a wooden stem and a shorter stone end - piece containing the bowl .
The calumet was considered a token of peace and friendship , and pioneers exploring the American West often took along calumets in the event they ran into hostile Indians .
No instance has ever been recorded of an Indian violating the peace - pipe compact .
Incidentally , the word tobacco comes from the Indian word for the tube of the calumet , not from their name for the plant .
When East Coast Indians introduced smoking to the Europeans , they presented their pipe and repeated the word tobacco to urge the stranger to put the calumet tube in his lips .
The Europeans naturally assumed the Indians were referring to the substance they were smoking , and the leaf was forever after known as tobacco .
The water pipe , a popular means of smoking in the Near East for centuries , was probably invented by the Persians for smoking hashish .
The earliest water pipes were called nargeelehs , from the Arabic word for coconut , since the coconut was used as the base for the first hydro - cooled fumigators .
Later , the Arabs fashioned more elaborate pipes from glass crystal .
The hookah is a kind of water pipe with a number of flexible stems , called narbeeshes , each from six to thirty inches long .
British officers in India often employed servants called burdars , whose sole duty was to attend to their master ’s hookah .
In a water pipe , smoke is drawn from the bowl into the base , where it is cooled by water vapor and then drawn through the stem .
Some Persian men were so partial to the taste of smoke - flavored water that they regularly forced their wives to smoke four or five bowlfuls of tobacco or hashish in succession to produce a well - flavored drink .
The earliest pipes popular in Europe were made from clay .
Clay pipes with small bowls were favored in England , the story goes , because in the first days of tobacco smoking the Englishman ’s desire for the leaf far outpaced the supply ; to indulge frequently , then , the Englishman had to content himself with a small pinch at each light - up .
The clay pipe had the distinct disadvantage of heating up rapidly , which might also explain why its bowl was so small .
The French , true to form , developed clay - pipe making to a fine art , molding their pipe bowls to depict religious , military , and domestic scenes .
There were two basic types of clay pipe popular in seventeenth - century England , the cutty and the churchwarden .
The small cutty , equipped with a stem of about three inches , was the more popular among the general populace , selling for as little as three for a penny .
But the cutty stem was often so short that a pipe took on the nickname of “ nose warmer . ”
The churchwarden was fitted with a stem of some eight to ten inches , and a more decorated bowl .
As a rule , the wealthy opted for the churchwarden , and frequently bought elegant cases in which to carry their prize pipes .
When the lower classes began smoking churchwardens to emulate the rich , the case was still beyond their means , so many an Englishman took to carrying his long pipe in a hole cut through his hat brim .
Washington Irving , in his History of New York , presents a tongue - in - cheek account of Dutch settlers in New Amsterdam who were ardent smokers of the long pipe until their leader , William the Testy , proclaimed smoking illegal .
The furious populace refused to obey the edict , so William compromised by permitting smoking only from short - stemmed pipes .
But the short pipes brought the bowl so close to the smoker ’s face that the fumes “ befogged the cerebellum , dried up all the kindly moisture of the brain and rendered the people , as vaporish and testy as the governor himself . ”
The clay pipe is now but a curiosity piece .
Only a handful of clay - pipe artisans remain to satisfy the smoker with a taste for the unusual .
Today , there are basically five kinds of pipe popular throughout the world .
Many
Alpine people prefer the porcelain pipe , usually fitted with a long , curving stem and two bowls , one for the tobacco and one for the residue of juices .
Other smokers prefer cherry wood pipes .
The most popular varieties by far are the meerschaum , briar , and corncob .
Meerschaum is a magnesium silicate compound mined extensively in Asia Minor .
The Germans thought the substance in its raw form resembled petrified sea foam , and dubbed it meerschaum , literally , “ sea foam . ”
Turkish craftsmen today still carve meerschaum pipe bowls by hand , favoring busts of Cleopatra , Bacchus , and other gods and notables .
The briar pipe owes its existence to a French smoker who journeyed to Corsica in the 1820’s .
Arriving on the island and discovering that his prized meerschaum pipe had been shattered in transit , the Frenchman asked a local artisan to carve a new pipe from the wood of the bruyere , or heath tree , which grows extensively on the island .
The smoker was so delighted by the finished product that he sent heath wood and roots to France and began manufacturing the bruyere , or briar pipe .
Today , the briar pipe is the most popular pipe in the world .
The corncob is an American invention .
John Schranke , a Dutch immigrant farmer living in Washington , Missouri , first whittled pipes from corncobs as a hobby .
In 1869 , Schranke brought one of his creations to the shop of a friend , Henry Tibbe .
Tibbe improved the pipe by filling in the uneven surfaces with plaster of paris , and then he began to market the pipes .
A hundred years later , corncob pipe production stood at around 10 million per year .
The president of the largest corncob pipe manufacturer in the world still uses Tibbe ’s workshop as his headquarters .
Corncob pipes have the overwhelming advantage of being dirt cheap .
At the other end of the scale , the most expensive pipe in the world is the Charatan Summa Cum Laude , a straight - grain briar - root pipe that sells in the vicinity of $ 2,5001 .
But even such an expensive pipe wo n’t guarantee a perfect smoke .
To some tobacco connoisseurs , there ’s only one kind of pipe you can count on .
TAMPA - When a South Carolina police officer pulled over two Egyptian engineering students for speeding last month , he noticed one trying to put away a laptop computer .
That computer contained a 12 - minute video showing how to take apart a remote - control toy car and reassemble the wiring to make it into a remote detonation device , a federal prosecutor said Friday .
The video 's narrator , a graduate student at the University of South Florida , said the device helped " to save one who wants to be a martyr for another battle , " the prosecutor said .
Investigators seized the laptop at the traffic stop .
They later found that the most recently viewed files included videos showing Qassam rockets being fired along with visits to Web sites relating to Hamas and videos involving martyrs .
It was not clear whether those files were being viewed as the two students drove .
Federal prosecutor Jay Hoffer described the laptop 's contents during a bond hearing Friday afternoon for defendant Youssef Megahed .
It was Megahed who was in the passenger seat with the computer on his lap when the police officer stopped the car for speeding Aug. 4 in Berkeley County , South Carolina .
Megahed and Ahmed Mohamed were indicted Aug. 31 in Tampa and charged with illegally transporting explosive materials .
Mohamed also is charged with teaching and demonstrating how to make an explosive device .
The video was uploaded onto YouTube , but later removed by the Web site , Hoffer said .
During their search of the car last month , investigators also found PVC pipe in the trunk filled with an explosive mixture of potassium nitrate , Karo syrup and kitty litter .
Officers also found safety fuse , bullets and a mostly - full 5 - gallon can of gas .
Hoffer called the potassium nitrate mixture a " low grade explosive . "
Megahed 's rented Tampa home was searched by FBI agents .
They found more material used in the explosive mixture , Hoffer said .
In addition , they found a remote control toy boat still in its box .
At a separate storage shed rented by Megahed , agents found a . 22 - caliber rifle and have uncovered evidence he tried to buy a Beretta handgun .
" The United States views this defendant as a danger , " Hoffer said .
Mohamed waived his bond hearing earlier Friday and remains in custody .
U.S. Magistrate Judge Elizabeth A. Jenkins ruled that Megahed could be freed on a $ 200,000 bond , provided he and his family turn in their passports .
He also would be under house arrest , except to meet with his attorney or go to religious services and would be prohibited from any Internet access .
Prosecutors appealed that ruling , so Megahed also remains in custody .
In addition , Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials placed a detainer on Megahed , meaning they could move him to ICE custody should he be released on bond in the criminal case .
Megahed is a permanent legal resident , but the charge against him could prompt ICE to try rescinding that status .
JON CARROLL
As you may have heard , Donald Rumsfeld has been offered a one - year appointment as the Special Distinguished Visiting Something at the Hoover Institution , a right - wing think tank affiliated with Stanford University in a way not clear to me or , apparently , anyone else .
The online petition opposing his appointment has been signed by more than 2,600 " members of the Stanford community , " another fuzzy designation .
The reaction of the Hoover Institution to the online petition has been a hearty laugh and another round for the table .
It has never cared about the opinions of the Stanford community in the past , and it is not about to start now .
A nicer way to say this is that the Hoover Institution is an independent and resolute sanctuary for beleaguered scholars .
This latest controversy is being played as yet another silly " political correctness " controversy .
The usual Fox News - ready conservative commentators have trotted out the arguments about how colleges celebrate diversity but really demand strict intellectual conformity .
Liberals ?
They 're in control .
Conservatives can do nothing except withhold endowments , join think tanks and work for lobbying firms , whereas powerful liberals can be tenured English professors .
Think of the children .
Which is not to say that silly stuff is absent from the halls of academe .
Academic politics are fierce , and cliques scheme to take over departments and impose one or another loony world view on their colleagues .
But universities exist to protect silly ideas and to experiment with new ways of teaching .
A lot of silly ideas are just ridiculous extensions of smart and useful concepts .
It may be that teaching world history from the Inuit point of view leaves out some important events .
On the other hand , 50 years ago the existence of the Inuits was not even noted except in certain obscure anthropology seminars .
So colleges do course corrections ( unintentional pun , but I like it ) and the learning experience is enriched thereby .
But all of this is beside the point .
Donald Rumsfeld is not some guy who opposes sex education in schools , or believes that abortion should be illegal , or thinks that women should just stay home and make babies .
He 's a guy who ordered bombing runs on helpless civilians .
He 's a guy who sent American soldiers to their death .
He 's a guy who displaced 2 million Iraqi citizens .
If the phrase " war criminal " means anything any more , then Donald Rumsfeld is a war criminal .
All war involves senseless slaughter , but that slaughter is often in defense of a comprehensible goal .
If someone attacks you , you attack back .
That 's why the initial war in Afghanistan was a good idea .
( Now the war in Afghanistan is underfunded and ignored - another Rumsfeld legacy . )
But the war in Iraq had no comprehensible rationale .
The rationales presented turned out to be exaggerations or lies .
The prosecution of the war was carried out according to Rumsfeld theories about the utility of small armies , and those theories were not changed even as the death toll mounted .
Rumsfeld never let the facts interfere with his grand visions .
Even when he resigned , he exhibited no remorse .
Now other people , better people , will be left to sort out the grotesque mess he left , and America will carry the burden of his stupid invasion for the next 50 years .
If he 's not the worst person in the world , he 's in the top 10 .
The only comparable example in recent days is Columbia University 's decision to invite Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to speak on campus .
I hold no brief for Ahmadinejad , but he is the ruler of a strategically important nation and it might be useful to hear what he has to say .
It might be useful to tell him a little bit about what we think .
It might even be useful to try to reach an accommodation with him , in the same way that we are trying to reach an accommodation with Kim Jong Il .
Besides , if he had n't been allowed to speak , we would never have learned that there are no gay people in Iran .
Donald Rumsfeld is no longer the leader of anything .
Of the abundant evidence , he will neither say anything interesting nor listen to opposing opinions .
There is no necessity to be polite to Donald Rumsfeld .
Indeed , I think that Donald Rumsfeld should be shunned .
I think people should turn their faces away from him when he comes near .
I think people should avoid him on the street .
I think people who come into accidental contact with him should say , " I shun thee . "
He deserves social discomfort ; he deserves to realize that actions have consequences , and that the hermetic world inside the Bush administration is not the only world in the world .
" Mrs. Herman 's authorial activities are in our view no longer compatible with her role as a television news reader and talk show host , " said Volker Herres , program director for German public network ARD 's northern division Norddeutscher Rundfunk ( NDR ) , in a statement on the network 's Web site .
He also said that some guests had canceled their appearances on Herman 's talk show in response to her public statements on motherhood .
Women in Nazi Germany received monetary incentives and medals for child - bearing
Herman , 48 , who already ruffled feathers last year by arguing that women should raise children rather than pursue careers of their own , was quoted by the media as speaking in glowing terms about the family values that were nurtured in the Nazi era .
" It was a gruesome time with a totally crazy and highly dangerous leader who led the Germans into ruin as we all know , " Herman said .
" But there was at the time also something good , and that is the values , that is the children , that is the families , that is a togetherness -- it was all abolished , there was nothing left . "
Herman 's new book " The Noah 's Ark Principle : Why We Must Save the Family " ( available in German ) is a follow - up to her 2006 bestseller " The Eva Principle : For a New Femininity . "
In both books , Herman openly discredits the merits of emancipation and mourns the loss of traditional gender roles that assigned women to the safe and comforting spot by the kitchen stove .
Motherhood crusade
Many women juggle their careers with obligations at home
Herman told Bild newspaper on Monday that she did n't understand why there was so much commotion about her views .
" I expressly distanced myself from the ' Third Reich ' at several points , " Herman said .
" One has to put my statement into its overall context .
This is n't about Hitler 's values , but about basic human values , which were abused in the ' Third Reich ' and later abolished . "
By praising the Third Reich family values , however , Herman managed to raise the scandal bar to unprecedented heights .
While it is true that the Nazis offered incentives to child - bearing women , their family policies were an integral part of their racist ideology whose goal was the creation of a master race .
" Frau Herman should know that what characterized the Third Reich was n't how mothers were treated , because they were just meant to produce cannon fodder , " author and Holocaust survivor Ralph Giordano told Bild .
" What characterized it was the gas chambers . "
Preaching , not practicing
For almost two decades , Herman was one of Germany 's most popular news presenters
Married for the fourth time , having one child and -- until now -- a stellar television career that included 18 years of hosting Germany 's premiere TV news show Tageschau -- Eva Herman was an unlikely candidate for a champion of antiquated gender roles .
She proved , however , that one does n't have to practice what one preaches and that a successful career woman can tell other women that what they really want is to keep quiet and cook .
" In Eva Herman 's case , even those of us who are women 's rights activists want her to return home to her kitchen stove , " said Renate Künast , a prominent member of the opposition Green party .
It is unlikely , however , that Herman , who was often voted in the past as Germany 's favorite news presenter , will get a chance to become a stay - at - home mom that she never was .
As a proponent of an ultra-conservative , pre-feminist fantasy world in which marriage , obedience and motherhood are considered the ultimate forms of self - fulfillment , she seems busier than ever .
" Frau Herman is free to carry on her ' motherhood crusade , ' but this is no longer compatible with her role as an NDR TV presenter , " Herres said .
In August of 1998 , disaster loomed for the U.S. economy .
Panic among investors after Russia defaulted on its sovereign bonds led to plummeting stock prices and a freeze on global credit markets .
The hedge fund Long - Term Capital Management saw its multibillion - dollar portfolio evaporate in days , and investors pulled their money from any asset that had even a tinge of risk .
But then the Federal Reserve came to the rescue , slashing interest rates three times in the space of a few weeks and pouring huge amounts of cash into the financial system .
The stock market rebounded , and the economy boomed .
Early the next year , Time put the Fed chairman , Alan Greenspan , on its cover , along with the Treasury officers Robert Rubin and Larry Summers , with the headline “ The Committee to Save the World . ”
CHRISTOPH NIEMANN
Nine years later , it ’s been another terrible August on Wall Street .
The meltdown of the market in subprime loans , which over the past six months has led to the shuttering of many home lenders and mortgage brokers , has spilled over into the broader credit market .
Bankers and bondholders are demanding very high interest rates for risky loans and , in some cases , refusing to lend money at all .
Hedge funds and brokerages that invested in subprime securities have found themselves stuck with billions in assets that no one wants to buy , while , in the past month , panicked investors have sent the stock market down almost ten per cent .
As anxiety over a global credit crunch spread , Wall Street implored an apparently reluctant Fed to rescue investors once again .
And , last Friday , that ’s exactly what it did , cutting the discount rate — the rate at which it lends to banks — by half a point .
In response , investors sent the stock market soaring .
For anyone with a 401 ( k ) , it was hard not to greet the Fed ’s move with relief .
But the short - term relief comes with a long - term cost .
Money managers created the current turmoil by failing to take risk seriously , enabling borrowers with sketchy credit records to borrow money nearly as cheaply as blue - chip companies .
In the past weeks , managers had been paying for their folly .
The Fed ’s decision to flood the system with cheap money will create a textbook case of what ’s usually called moral hazard : insulating fund managers from the consequences of their errors will encourage similarly risky bets in the future .
Now , you can take a fear of moral hazard , and a desire to see foolishness punished , too far .
In times of real crisis , we do n’t want the Fed to follow the advice that Herbert Hoover says he got from Andrew Mellon during the Great Depression : “ Liquidate labor , liquidate stocks , liquidate the farmers , liquidate real estate .
. . .
Purge the rottenness out of the system . ”
When the health of the U.S. economy is under serious threat , the Fed should act .
But in this case it ’s far from clear that the turmoil was an actual menace to the underlying economy of the U.S.
Bailing out hedge - fund managers was great for Wall Street , but it may not have been such a good deal for Main Street .
Wall Street so dominates our image of the U.S. economy these days that it ’s easy to assume that what ’s bad for the Street must be bad for everyone else .
But , while it ’s true that a complete market meltdown would have disastrous effects on the economy as a whole , market downturns like those of the past few weeks often have only a small effect on businesses and consumers .
In part , that ’s because much of what happens on Wall Street consists of the shuffling of assets among various well - heeled players , rather than anything that ’s fundamental to the smooth functioning of the U.S. economy .
( The economy did fine before the advent of hedge funds and private - equity funds , and would probably do fine in their absence . )
Similarly , while stock - market tumbles are always painful , they have no concrete impact on most American consumers , who own little or no stock .
( In any case , the S. & P. 500 is still up ten per cent over the past year , which hardly suggests imminent disaster . )
And , in the short run , they ’re irrelevant to most corporations , too , since few companies actually use the stock market to raise capital .
The bond and loan markets do , of course , matter quite a bit to companies and to individuals , because no economy can run without a steady supply of credit .
But , although standards for corporate lending have tightened in recent weeks , and interest rates on corporate bonds may have risen steadily , they ’re still low by historical standards , while the rates for most traditional mortgages have barely risen .
That may be why the economy as a whole shows few signs of imminent doom .
Corporate profits continue to go up .
Unemployment is still relatively low , and wages in the last quarter rose at a surprisingly fast rate .
Likewise , in July , retail sales were healthier than expected , and industrial production was reasonably brisk .
That ’s not to say that the economy has suffered no fallout from the subprime collapse .
The fall in housing prices , the drying up of new construction , and the sharp rise in foreclosures in many areas are having a serious impact on employment and economic growth .
But these are not problems that the Fed ’s action will solve .
Cutting the discount rate is not going to help subprime borrowers get new loans , nor will it get the housing market moving again .
What it will do is reassure investors and save some money managers from well - deserved oblivion .
It may be that the risk of a full - fledged credit crunch was high enough to make this worth doing .
But there is something unseemly about watching the avatars of free - market capitalism rely on the government to pay for their bad bets .
And there is something scary about contemplating the even bigger bets they ’ll make in the future if they know that the Fed is there to bail them out . ♦

Gaming Google - It Really Is That Easy ...
Lance Loveday is founder and CEO of Closed Loop Marketing and has been helping companies with online marketing efforts for the past 10 years .
He ’s interested in user psychology , economics , usability and design .
I gave a talk at Web Design World in Seattle last month on Balancing Design , Usability & SEO .
While doing some research on that presentation , I was trying to find some examples of sites that were strong in only one of these areas .
As I ’ve done some work in the printer ink space and knew there were plenty of well - optimized but really ugly and unusable sites there , I did a search on ‘ ink cartridge ’ and hit the jackpot on the first result .
This site was perfect for my needs : A # 1 ranking for an insanely competitive keyword , ugly as hell , and horrifically unusable .
Score !
Then I did a link : lookup command on Google to get a sense for the link pop this page has , certain that they must have engaged in some serious link - building to get this result .
Little did I know ...
As I scanned the results of the link query , I was struck by how many unrelated sites seemed to be linking to InkandStuff .
I figured they could be paid links , but many of the sites listed did n’t seem like the kind you would normally associate with posting paid links .
So when I saw a listing for the World Islamic Forum Foundation , I clicked through to figure out why in the world this site was linking to InkandStuff .
This is where things get interesting ... because I could n’t find a link on this page .
Now I was REALLY intrigued .
Google was seeing the link , so it had to be there , right ...?
So I did a View Source to check out the code and figure out where the link was , and saw this :
What the ...?
Google is attributing link popularity to sites who have embedded invisible sponsored links in free stat counters ?
Apparently so ...
How else is this awful UK site ranking # 1 on Google.com for “ ink cartridge " ?
So next I figured I ’d check out MyWebStats to see what they were all about .
Sure enough , on their FAQ page they state ( my emphasis ) :
If this service is so good , how can it be free ?
We are lucky to have sponsors who cover the complete cost of running this service .
To show our appreciation we accompany your counter with a small link to one of these sponsors .
“ To show our appreciation ” – I love that .
SO – That apparently is the secret to gaming Google .
All of Google ’s tough talk about paid links and how they ’re so proactive about making sure people can’t spam their way to the top is apparently just that – talk .
This should be SO easy for Google to detect and act upon , but they have n’t ...
If they had , InkandStuff and / or MyWebStats would ’ve been penalized , right ?
I was one of those people who looked down on buying links for a long time .
It just seemed wrong – and surely the brain trust at Google would clamp down at some point .
I just could n’t believe that buying your way to the top of the organic results could A ) be SO easy , or B ) yield sustainable results .
That was three years ago .
This scheme of embedding links in free stat counters in order to juice link pop has been around for at least that long – and should be among the easiest for Google to detect .
It should be a big yellow flag when a site gets lots of inbound links from totally unrelated sites over a short time period .
And it should be really easy to detect the code pattern like the one shown above for those inbound links ( it even says “ invisible " for God ’s sake ! ) .
Finally , it is pretty irregular to have a UK page show up at the top of the results for a competitive term like this on Google.com .
It seems like that might have thrown a flag somewhere along the line as well .
The patterns are easy to spot .
But Google is either oblivious to all of these issues or they ’ve decided not to do anything about it .
I ’m not sure which is worse .
People will point out that Google may already be aware of this and not be flowing PageRank from these links , per Matt Cutt ’s post .
And maybe InkandStuff has enough link pop from other sources that are driving them to the # 1 spot for “ ink cartridge . ”
But I really doubt it .
And that argument misses the point .
InkandStuff is clearly trying to game Google with this and other activities ( or at least they ’ve unknowingly invested in a service which is ) .
And they are doing so quite successfully – to the detriment of searchers and their less - savvy competitors .
Bottom line : Google is letting these guys blatantly spam their engine and get away with it .
Rand Fishkin at SEOMoz ( on whom one of my team members has what she calls an “ SEO crush ” ) wrote an excellent post on this topic a while back : Paid Links – Ca n’t Be a White Hat With ‘em , Ca n’t Rank Without ‘em .
( Rand – If you want to know the identity of your secret admirer , slip me a $ 20 while we ’re on stage at SES .
Just my way of trying to spice up the otherwise sedate SEM Pricing Models discussion )
But I digress ...
It makes it really hard to be white hat SEO practitioners when we see things like this happening .
Sadly , this is the second time I ’ve run across this exact same scenario ( an invisible sponsored link embedded within a different free stat counter ) in the past few months while trying to figure out why a really crappy site was ranking so well for a competitive term .
So count me among the growing legions of grey hats now , I guess ...
Given the competitive environment and the fact that “ everyone is doing it ” now – and it ’s working – it no longer serves my clients ’ best interests to advise against buying links .
I hate saying that , but do n’t feel like I have a choice any more .
It ’s the price of entry if you want top rankings on any competitive terms these days .
I happen to be a big fan and promoter of Google’s .
But they risk killing ( or at least injuring ) the goose that laid their big golden egg if they do n’t get more serious about cleaning up their results .
Granted much of this may be beyond their control .
I do n’t expect them to be able to singlehandedly solve this problem for good .
But it seems like they could be putting up more of a fight and at least making someone have to work to game their engine .
As is , it ’s just too easy .
I ’m going to report this as a paid link .
But their bluster aside , I ’m not going to hold my breath hoping it will do any good .
I first saw this result two months ago , and as of today , MyWebStats shows a PR6 , and InkandStuff a PR7 .

A detailed map that pinpoints the location of every atom in a 450 - million - yeard - old resurrected protein reveals the precise evolutionary steps needed to create the molecule 's modern version , according to researchers from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the University of Oregon .
Until now , scientists trying to unravel the evolution of the proteins and other molecules necessary for life have worked backwards , making educated guesses based on modern human body chemistry .
By moving forward from an ancient protein , the team laid out the step - by - step progression required to reach its current form and function .
The study appears in the Aug. 17 , 2007 , issue of the journal Science .
" We were able to see exactly how mutations in the ancient structure led to the modern receptor , " said lead author Eric Ortlund , who carried out the research as a UNC - Chapel Hill postdoctoral fellow .
Ortlund is now an assistant professor of biochemistry in the Emory University School of Medicine .
In the current study , Ortlund and Matt Redinbo , a professor of chemistry , biochemistry and biophysics at UNC - Chapel Hill , generated a three - dimensional picture of the ancient receptor with an imaging technique called X - ray crystallography .
The nanoscale image revealed the receptor 's structure , down to the placement of every atom .
With the structure in place , Ortlund and his colleagues retraced evolution 's path .
The researchers examined the precursor to a modern protein known as a glucocorticoid receptor .
In humans , the receptor plays a crucial role , responding to the hormone cortisol and regulating the body 's stress response .
The two - receptor and hormone - fit together as precisely as a lock and key .
The precursor preferred a different hormone , so several mutations were necessary before the lock could fit the cortisol key .
The University of Oregon team , which included postdoctoral scientist Jamie Bridgham , resurrected the ancient protein via a large database of modern receptor genes .
This earlier work , which compared the genetic similarities and differences among two of these modern genes , found the receptor descended from a single common genetic ancestor 450 million years ago .
The researchers then recreated the ancient receptor in the laboratory .
Only seven mutations were needed to bridge the 450 - million - year gulf , the researchers found .
However , not every mutation changed the protein 's function .
These " permissive " mutations appear to pave the way for future , more significant changes .
" It 's like they prepared for opportunity to knock in the form of a new hormone , " Ortlund said .
The permissive mutations bolstered the receptor 's structure , like contractors reinforce a historic home 's foundation before making renovations .
After these changes took place , a more extreme mutation repositioned an entire group of atoms , bringing them closer to fitting the cortisol hormone .
Another created the tight new fit with cortisol .
" These permissive mutations are chance events .
If they had n't happened first , then the path to the new function could have become an evolutionary road not taken , " said co-author Joe Thornton , a professor of evolutionary biology at the University of Oregon .
The researchers worked out which mutations came first by synthesizing different versions of the mutated protein in the laboratory .
Had the radical mutations come first , the receptor protein would have lost its function entirely , they found .
###
The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health , the National Science Foundation , a UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center fellowship to Ortlund and an Alfred P. Sloan research fellowship to Thornton .
Bill S wrote in to share some code from an ancient billing system still in use to this very day ...
My first assignment was to make the billing system ’s code Y2 K compliant .
Fortunately , management had given us ample time to prepare : two full months .
The good news was that there were n’t a whole lot of things that needed to be done .
So little , in fact , that I decided to try to fix an error that would randomly occur in the system .
It read “ There is an error with the tax rate .
Program Aborting . ”
The billing system was originally ported from COBOL to C and can only be compiled in Borland 4.5 .
That is just one of its many features .
The other major one is that , because of the COBOL port , most variables were global and all files , memory , and so on are initialized at the start of the program and closed at the end .
I found that the tax rate is read in from a configuration file and used only in a single part of the application .
Here ’s the snip from the beginning of the program :
vtaxrate = valf ( buf ) ; vtaxrate /= 100.00000 ;
And in the main program processing loop ( which for some strange reason is an infinite for loop ) :
for ( ; ; ) { ... if ( vtaxrate != 0.06 ) { cputs ( "
There is an error with the tax rate .
Program aborting . " ) ; exit(0 ) ; } taxtot = ( invtot + reimbtot ) * vtaxrate ; ... }
At first , I thought it was odd to test a variable that was read from configuration and never should change .
All of the other “ configurable ” rates were tested just in this manner .
Obviously , they were changing somehow .
A further investigation revealed that by allocating everything at the beginning , almost 50 K of heap was being used right from the start .
Borland 4.5 ( for the medium model ) uses 64 K of shared heap and stack space .
The stack starts at the top and goes down , while the heap starts at the bottom .
Eventually that stack overwrites some of the heap memory , and the original programmers discovered the tax rates were changing .
Thus the test .
When I asked what I should do about this , management just commented that “ it ’s been working for 10 years , and should be left alone . ”
So I fixed the Y2 K errors , recompiled the program , and redeployed .
To this day , if we get a “ tax error , ” we simply cross our fingers and rerun .
Interestingly enough , the error typically does not re-occur .
Of course , who knows what other heap values are changing … but at least there ’s no abort with a “ Tax Error . ”

Does college matter ?
Your son wants to play in a band .
You think he should be an engineer .
You 're majoring in bioinformatics because your parents told you it was a good career choice , but you hate it .
You love to write code , but now your parents are telling you " it 's a bad move , what with outsourcing and all ... "
You spent your first two years of college maintaining an inhuman blood alcohol level , when it hits you -- you 've taken out loans to pay for this drinking .
We 've all accepted that a college degree == $ .
( Ignoring Bill Gates and Steve Jobs , of course . )
College means higher lifetime earnings , and there 's plenty of research to back that up .
On the other hand , we 've also learned that there 's scientific evidence that money does n't mean happiness ( assuming you 're over the baseline level of poverty ) .
So if there 's almost no correlation between money and happiness , but college means more money ... where 's real happiness in all that ?
I 've watched the wildly conflicting comments on the future of IT / programming as a profession between Dori Smith on " do n't do it " and Robert Scoble on how " Microsoft ca n't find enough programmers " .
But I 'm far less interested in whether majoring in a high - tech field is a good idea today than I am in whether the question even matters .
The average education in computer science , engineering , and even medicine is partly obsolete within 18 months .
Some weird variant of Moore 's law I guess .
The conventional wisdom says that the specifics of what you learn are much less important than the fact that you 're learning the fundamentals , and you 're learning to learn -- things you 'll need to maintain your skills and knowledge in a quickly changing world .
The problem is , you virtually never hear a student say that .
It 's always the parents or someone speaking on behalf of the educational system .
When was the last time you honestly heard ( and believed ) an actual current college student claim that the true benefit of their formal college education is in learning to be a lifelong learner ?
That 's just bulls ***.
With very few exceptions , college in the US is more about drinking than it is about deep learning .
Others claim that the benefit of a college degree is really more about socialization and independence .
I 've heard reasonably smart adults say , with all sincerity , that spending $ 80,000 so little Suzy could learn to live on her own was worth it .
I think there are a thousand different , and often better , ways to achieve that .
Suzy could join the peace corp , for example , or go on one of those " learning vacations " where you do an archealogical dig .
Hell , just a three - month long trip through Europe with a couple friends and a rail pass ( or , as a friend of mine did , a bike trip across Turkey ) is certainly going to do more for socialization and independence than a traditional college environment , and at a tiny fraction of the cost .
The real curiosity , for me and others , is why we spend so much time railing against the decline in public schools for K - 12 in the US , while higher education practically gets a free pass .
The only major complaints you hear are about the rising costs , when to me -- that may be the least of it .
In Declining by Degrees , a PBS documentary and book , one of the central questions is about why we are n't looking more closely at what really happens between admission and graduation .
Or I should say , looking at what does n't happen .
From the intro :
" The decline in the quality of American undergraduate education has not yet become a major public issue .
Americans may be cynical about their public institutions and leaders , but their skepticisim does not extend to the nature and content of a college education . "
" ... the result of this mentality ( we are resisting the temptation to label it " mental illness " ) is graduates who are narrowly educated -- and often are " trained " for work in fields that will have changed before the ink on their diplomas is dry .
Those graduates have scant understanding of civic responsibilities or of the possibilities of life beyond work .
Accumulating a sufficient number of courses and credit hours to earn a college degree is , in the public mind , synomous with being educated .
But having a diploma bears little resemblance to being educated .
" Higher " education has been lowered . "
So here we have a pile of issues :
* Does it still make sense to major in a high - tech field ?
( and the offshoots I did n't mention about whether gender makes a difference )
* Does it really matter what you major in , or is the benefit of college something beyond the actual field of study ?
* If college = money , but money != happiness , what does that mean with respect to a college degree ?
* Does it still make sense to go to college ... at all ?
But I think the biggest question of all is something entirely different :
Where does passion fit into this equation ?
Everything I hear about is whether a kid -- male or female -- should pursue this field or that field , what the long - term career prospects are , etc .
I almost never hear much discussion about whether it matters if they have a passion for .
It 's true that sometimes college is the best way for them to discover their passion , but I 've seen way too many young people traumatized by the thought of telling their parents that after three years of pre-med , they 're switching to something like ... ornamental horticulture ( a big area of study at my alma mater , Cal Poly SLO ) .
The reason this matters to me now is because I 'm right in the middle of it .
I 've been watching Dori with some envy ... going on visits with her son to check out prospective colleges , talking about application forms , entrance exams , all that stuff I naturally assumed I 'd be doing when my daughter Skyler turned 16 or 17 .
The older she got , the better she did in school , and the brighter her teachers found her to be ... the more certain I was that she 'd follow " the natural path " of the countdown to college that starts somewhere around 10th grade .
But it did n't work out that way .
Skyler , it seems , could not care less for conventional wisdom , what her friends do , what the numbers say , and most especially -- what her mom might think .
Skyler believes that life 's too short to spend that many years on something you do n't love .
So she decided to just work for a while until she figures something out .
And then a few weeks ago , she announced the discovery that Boulder is home to a world - class vegetarian cooking school that in addition to cooking classes , includes courses in professional development ranging from creating a business plan for a restaurant , to starting a personal chef business .
Vegetarian cooking is her passion .
She believes in it , she loves it , she takes great pleasure in it .
She evangelizes it to others .
What horrifies me is that even though I knew she felt this way , it never occurred to me that this was something she might consider instead of college .
But she got me with this one :
" Mom , your degree was exercise physiology .
You spent your first five years out of college as a glorified aerobic instructor .
Then you taught yourself programming , took a few night classes at UCLA , and made a huge career switch into computers , and found you loved it .
You have your own computer book series .
Yet you told me you had just a single computer class in college , and you hated it .
So ... tell me again why college was so great for you ? "
And then the kicker :
" I have no idea if I 'll ever open a restaurant or develop this into a professional career , but whatever investment I make in this will serve me and make me happy for the rest of my life .
I 'll be using what I learn here in my personal life , almost every day , regardless of my career .
How many people can say that about 90 % of what they learned in college ? "
The part I still have to get over is that feeling of a missed opportunity .
Of unfulfilled potential ( too many Microsoft ads ? ) .
This was a straight - A kid .
One far brighter at 12 than I 'll ever be .
One of those about whom people say , " She could succeed at anything she wants . " yet what we all secretly meant was , " She could succeed at anything we think she should want . "
Lucky for her , she learned at a much earlier age that passion matters .
That money is far less important than joy ( and that money does n't buy joy ) .
And that whatever decision she makes now , does not determine the rest of her life .
She understands that the chances of anyone having a single career for life -- or even a decade -- are asymptotically approaching zero .
And that nothing -- not finances ( or lack of ) or gender or age -- will stand in her way if she decides to learn something .
And if what she wants to learn at some point in the future is best studied in a formal higher education environment , there 's nothing to stop her from going to college then .
Still , I look longingly at the cute Target dorm furniture and think , " maybe one day ... "
Then I hear what my friends are paying in college tuition , and snap out of it .
I 'm no longer convinced that we should assume a traditional four - year college should be the automatic default for all high school grads , esepcially given the state of these institutions today .
And I seriously wish people would stop looking at me with pity and concern , shaking their head when they realize Skyler ( " but she always seemed so bright ... " ) is n't going to a " real " college .
Wake up and smell the 21st century ...

For some , college is an opportunity to connect with a group of people and some of the connections last a lifetime .
Not to many for me , but for me college was four years of experimenting and learning about state of the art technology ( which would have been inaccessible to me otherwise ) .
Maybe Skyler will be able to pull the same thing off with her professional school (s ) , and maybe she 'll make lifetime connections with others along this path ; but I 'm wondering if she 's missing out on something ( besides the beer ) .

Very interesting post .
I 've done a fair amount of school ( double majored in english and math , with an MS in engineering ) , and I feel that I got a lot out of it .
But I have been blown away with what an interested , focused person can accomplish in software development with no degree ( or even no coursework ) in computer science .
At first , I thought the " self - taught " pheonomenon was a quirk of the software world - that the rapid rate of change in programming was somehow differentiated it from more mature fields ( like medicine or law ) .
But lately , I 've come around to the notion that the presence of experts without degrees in software represents the norm , not the exception , for learning .
People can become truly expert in fields without a " formal " education as long as they have access to information , tools for experimentation , and a passion for learning .
Anyway , this is just a longwinded way of saying : " I agree " .
If you 've spent years reading , writing , experimenting , and so forth , you 're educated in the field - regardless of degree .
If this were the case in other fields , I suspect you 'd fine a lot of self - taught experts over there as well .

Good for Skyler .
It 's a brave new world , and she sounds like she 's jumping into it with courage and the knowledge of what it means .
College is fine if you have a clear and passionate goal that fits into that methodology .
But few careers do anymore .
Hell , even the word " career " is obsolete .
" But she always seemed so bright " ...
Reply : " That 's why she stayed away from college " .
There 's a reason the phrase " college education " is two words - it's a special case of the much broader concept of " education " .
Good luck , Skyler .
Posted by : Kyle Bennett | Jul 14 , 2005 5:57:20 PM
you make some good points and things that i always wondered about when i was in college .
i used to hear our president at school and the school board back in new orleans always talking about what was best for us .
amazing how they never asked for our opinions or input .
how is the average student expected to connexxt ?
i'm 24 , so I 've just been out almost 2 years .
i tried to focus on the internships and the business leaders that would take me under their wing .
it was rare that i was pumped for classes .
not because it was class , but i knew that the useful knowledge , the knowledge that would help me move ahead was outside the ' box . '
i learned much in the box , but i loved to hear the stories of other people who'd been places .
the lunches and business meetings and random emails to professionals i admired ... those were and are my passions .
i always felt the degree was a formality .
i worked hard , did well and graduated , but i never felt as if it would define me .
i just knew i needed it to get into that interview .
i always thought that once i got some place , i'd make some noise .
so far i was right .
i can't wait to see who i learn from next and what i can do .
i'm just one of many .
Posted by : christien | Jul 14 , 2005 7:49:17 PM
I went to college for a couple of years because it was automatically assumed if you were smart and could do well in high school that you would go there next .
This was in the late 80s .
I did n't finish because there was not enough there that I wanted to learn .
Most of what I 'm really interested in , I learn on my own .
In some ways , I think a degree is an insult to the passion for actual learning and the love of it , like religion is an insult to the passion for genuine spirituality and a solid sense of ethics .
On the other hand , my pay scale over the past 15 years has been relatively slim and slow .
Lots of jobs have been taken outside of my interests to keep me afloat and just barely pay the bills .
The student loan had been put off for a long time and I 'm just in the past few years beginning to knock the principal down after letting all that extra interest accumulate ( stupid , stupid , stupid ) .
If I had n't been so passionate about my interests , it would have been much easier to just play the game .
In the end , it 's a gift and a curse to be so devoted to something .
It has a price .
Posted by : Keith Handy | Jul 14 , 2005 8:12:48 PM
After doing something similar to Skyler , " working for a while " before doing the college thing , I 'm finding there is one very good reason to pay the $ 40,000 pricetag on a college education : the piece of paper you get at the end .
As I move up , I 've found this piece of paper becomes more and more important to the PHBs while my self - taught experience becomes worth less ( and worthless ) .
A college grad who can't understand how to do a fraction of my old job now has my old job - and is paid more to boot .
If I 'm lucky , I 'll score a new job paying almost what I used to make in the higher paying economy I now call home .
And all for the want of a paper .

" I 've been watching Dori with some envy ... going on visits with her son to check out prospective colleges , talking about application forms , entrance exams , all that stuff I naturally assumed I 'd be doing when my daughter Skyler turned 16 or 17 . "
You want to borrow Sean for a couple of weeks ?
We'd be happy to send him out to visit you , and you could beat your head against that particular wall .
If Sean announced tomorrow that he did n't want to go to college , and instead wanted to sign up for a training program because he had a passion for [ fill in the blank ] , I 'd be the first to break out the champagne .
But first I 'd have to be revived , because I 'd have fallen down into a dead faint .
The impression I get of Skyler ( not having met her ) is that she 's a passionate , creative kid wiith lots of ideas .
Sean ?
Not so much .
He does n't have a strong desire to go to college , but then , he does n't have a strong desire to not go to college .
He does n't have a strong desire to major in a particular field , but then , he does n't have a strong desire to not major in a particular field .
He has no strong desire to go to a particular school , and no strong desire not to go to a particular school .
And so on .
He 's well aware of the life - long learning issue -- anyone who lives in our house would have to be .
He 's seen that what I was doing 8 years ago is vastly different from what I 'm doing now , and that what I was doing 8 years before that was even more different .
And we 've made it clear that whatever he does end up doing , he should expect that he 'll have to work to keep current , because the 21st century is only going to move faster and faster .
One of the main reasons we 're encouraging bioinformatics for him is because it lets him keep his hand in so many fields -- if it turns out that ( for instance ) pure mathematics is his love , yay .
If it 's something else , that 's good too .
My thought is that he should be exposed to as many different fields and areas as possible , and then he can see which ( if any ) make him sing .
And if none of them do , well , at least he 'll have lots of options because he 's learned so many things .
We make jokes about him going to UCSC and double - majoring in Bioinformatics and Astrophysics ( two of their top- rated departments ) .
He 'd end up knowing a great deal about a great deal , but there ain't a job on earth that will use all of it .
And that 's okay .
OTOH , he 'll be taking Physics for the first time in the fall , and maybe that 'll be The One .
If you 're someone reading this who does n't read our blog and has gotten the idea from the above that he 's a general Math / Science geek : you 're right .
Another school we 're encouraging him to look at closely is Harvey Mudd .
One of the things I like best about HMC is that they do n't let you declare a major until your Sophomore year .
Every Freshman enrolled takes the same " Common Core " courses so they get a broad education .
Side thought 1 : as I tell Sean , if you 're going to use Gates as an example of someone who did n't finish his degree , you have to compare / contrast Ballmer .
What would he be today if he had n't gone to college when / where he did ?
Side thought 2 : some of the heaviest drinkers I 've ever known were the 18 - 25 year olds who did n't go to college .
I think that it 's more the age and not where you happen to be at that age .
Side thought 3 : if you 've ever considered writing a post on bringing out passion in the dispassionate , I 'd love to read it !

I have to say that going to college and getting a degree in computer science would probably be a complete waste .
My degree is Latin American Studies and I went to a solid liberal arts school .
While I have never used that knowledge directly in my jobs , learning to write and communicate ideas and organize thoughts have all been critical to every job I have had , and are critical now that I run my own business .
I do n't regret for a minute getting my degree , although I did n't spend all that much time getting drunk , so maybe my experience was different .
I do n't think college is necessary for everybody , but I do think that if you do go to college , you should study broadly instead or narrowly .
Skyler sounds like she will be fine because she sounds like she will study broadly outside the confines of a college .
Some people can do that , and some cannot , but I am glad she was able to see her way to doing what is right for her .
Best of luck to her ... and to you .
( Having a daughter in college now myself , I assure you that the joys of picking out dorm furniture are easily outweighed by the horrors of watching the way many college students do squander their opportunities )

Hiya Kathy and Skyler ...
I dropped out halfway through an engineering degree .
And I can say , 20 years later , that I 'm realllllly glad I did half an engineering degree .
Here 's what I got out of it :
o I became a dj on the campus radio station , allowing me to get my first job at a commercial radio station as a sound engineer , just 4 days after I dropped out .
o I was a journalist and humourist on the student newspaper , which allowed me to flex my skills as a writer .
I 'm now a professional writer and artist , thanks to the exposure I gave myself back then .
o The problem - solving skills I picked up in engineering are things I use daily .
They fit with my mode of analytical thinking , which I would n't easily have uncovered due to my being hyper creative as well .
o I learned about sex at varsity too .
Hehehehehehe .
Very useful .
o I learned about politics too , and was a student left - winger , albeit a misanthropic , cynical one .
I 'm still a lefty , and I really love the exposure I got to diversity and debate .
o I learned about film and art .
I sat in on history of art lectures , and learned that I have the ability to understand art .
I went to our film library and watched rare classics that I could never have seen anywhere else .
( Well , it 's now possible to buy the dvd of the original NOSFERATU THE VAMPIRE .
But until three or so years ago , nogo . )
I 'm now a filmmaker amongst other things .
o I was a member of the War Games Society , and played hundreds of hours of Dungeons & Dragons ( and similar ) .
This allowed me to flex my imagination , and work out all sortsa things for myself .
Most of the things I learned at varsity were extra-mural .
But those extra mural activities were supported by the structure imposed by being in a learning environment .
I would argue that a classical education is one of the most valuable things a person can get .
( When I dropped out , I started another degree , majoring in philosophy , theory of literature , and English .
Did n't complete it , but got far enough ( 8/10 ths of the way ) to know that I 'm pretty darn clever .
Blue skies
love
Roy

Good for Skyler !
Personally I 'd agree with Robert Pirsig 's take on things - that education for the sake of having a piece of paper is frankly not worth the paper it 's written on , but that the more worthwhile education comes from interest in the subject .
He gives an excellent story of a guy who dropped out of high school because frankly the whole thing bored him .
He became a car mechanic , as shop was about the only thing he'd been any good at , but as he repairs cars , he comes across all kinds of engineering problems , so he decides he needs to read up on metallurgy , on maths , on chemistry , and so forth , till in the end he puts himself through college , driven by passion for the subjects which he has a real love for .
I kind of did this myself - I went to university as a mature student at age 27 , to study French .
I 'm now working for a French company , though that 's as far as my use of the subject goes .
That said , I would n't have swapped that time for anything .
I got to study Japanese there , got my yellow belt in jiu - jitsu there , went and lived in France for a year in a school as part of my studies , came back and cycled the length of the UK for charity , met my wife and fell in love there ( we 're still together nearly 10 years on , and expecting our second child ) , and the company that I work for would n't have looked twice at me without my degree even though I work in IT and I have an arts degree .
I got to study all sorts of interesting things too - like the French resistance , the holocaust in France , the Algerian war , French philosophy , linguistics .
It took me till last year to pay off the loans , but it was worth every penny .
So , my message to Skyler is , do n't write it off , but do what you love .
If you find you need a degree for what you want to do , or if it'd be useful to you , then go study it .
Whatever you do , do it with arete .
In with both feet .

I have no doubt that time in higher education can benefit anyone - sometimes it shows them that they are suited to academic study and sometimes it shows them that this is not the path for them right now .
I think the problem is the assumption that the " best time " ( read " only time for anyone in their right freakin ' minds " ) is at the end of your teens - a hangover imho from a time when careers generally were more formally structured to suit the needs of businesses that were .... well , more formally structured .
This is about living today .
I believe that we 're never finished creating ourselves and we do our best work when we help others to create themselves .
Just as soon as your daughter ever finds that she 's more passionate about going to college than making great food , she will do so .
I say " Go Skyler !
You feed the world . "

BTW , just to add , I was listening to a dharma talk by the Buddhist Society of Western Australia recently , and the speaker , Ajahn Brahm , quoted a study into happiness by the London School of Economics .
Apparently the country that came top in the LSE 's league table of happiness was Bangladesh , one of the most desperately poor countries in the world .

All the way through elementary & secondary school , I was told I was " bright . "
And I was , though I did n't know it .
The problem was , I hated school -- it was boring , and we never got to study stuff that I was interested in .
I almost never did homework , but picked up enough in class to ace the tests .
That made for a lot of B's and C's , with a predictable result on my self - image .
I 'm a 3 - time college dropout , that being the number of times I was convinced , either by parents or friends , that I needed a degree to get anywhere at all .
After doing blue - collar work for a few years , I wangled my way into a word - processing job at a mid-sized manufacturing company .
I discovered some graphic software on my computer ( a Mac -- woohoo ! ) , and started playing around .
I started enhancing some of the documents and Powerpoint presentations I was assigned , and within a few weeks , I was asked if I knew enough to work on some print advertising .
I lied and said " yes . "
In truth I knew next to nothing , but I learned , and quickly -- all from reference books and trial&error ( this was shortly before the rise of the ' net ) .
Long story short : I became a professional graphic designer , working freelance , doing ( mostly ) what I love for the past 10 years .
Looking back , it 's safe to say most of my formal education served only to discourage me from learning .
I learned to read before starting school , and got my love of reading from my parents , not from Lit class , where we were never assigned reading that was interesting to me .
I learned from my father that if I do n't know something , I can learn -- read a book , ask someone , or just try something and see what happens .
That is the foundation of my true education .
And at this point in time , I am certain that nothing is beyond my capability .
For some , college may be a necessity -- some fields require the piece of paper just to get in the door , for instance -- but this is true far less often than it used to be .
Instead of the presumption , it should be the exception , IMHO .

At age 3 , my daughter announced , " Art is my life , Mommy ! "
This fall , she is leaving home for the art department of a small Christian school ( Gordon College ) where the personal standards are high , the students are pretty much self - policing , and the academics look like a real classical education .
Some people 's take on this ?
" What a shame ... she always seemed so bright . "
Answer ~
She is .
She 's a chart topper on every test given , and a straight A+ student .
" How is she going to learn about the ' real world ' without a college experience full of drinking and dating ( a euphemism for casual sex ) ? "
Answer ~
She 'll see the ' real world ' all around her in the surrounding communities , especially Boston , but she 'll emerge without as much baggage , heartbreak , and STDs .
Follow your passion , baby !
I did , with a " useless " non-traditional college degree in Classical Greek , a further non-traditional masters in Folklore , and plenty of job offers at every stage of my life because I am unique in my background , training , outlook , and my ability to think and learn !

I think the bachelors degree is good for one thing .
It gets you in the door for most companies .
While it does n't mean you know how to work , how to learn , or how to solve problems , it 's still the minimum entry level requirement for most jobs .

Talkiog about passion in what you do and what you do with it :
Passion is where your heart lies .
I did physics and it sucked big time .
I never liked it .
I 'd have happily wanted to have followed AstroPhysics but anyways back then ( 13 - 14 odd yrs back ) it did n't matter .
Computers back then were all green screens and it was not really that appealing .
I went sailing and I was in love with the seas .
I 've loved everybit of it , I met people from all parts of the world .
It was an exilirating experience .
I can literally feel like a little kid with a baloon in hands if I can just smell the diesel smoke from the funnels when I drive past the harbors .
I found the love of my life when I met my girl friend ( now wife ) here and I quit saling .
I picked up the trails that I left when I left college .
IT Sector was on the downside ( 1999/2000 ) still I was in love .
So I carried on .
I started afresh and got into databases ( Oracle ) and suddennly I was aroused .
Since then I have done consultancy , DBA related jobs .
It all was possible because I was hooked not because I was calculated or planned it all out .
No way .
Today I'm a Sr.DBA / Architect , I teach english in local school , will be Giving lessons to univ under - grads at my current Univ job , picking up the strands and trying to tie up my own band andv will pick up just about everything that i fall in love with .
The world is changing but it's not the regular joes and janes ( they could be even be thunderbird , stanford , yale , harvard grads / masters -- there are however exception ) , it 's the drop - outs who 're dropping out of the herd .
The world today with so much of text , graphic will change so drastically ( actually it will be all replaced ) that you 'd laugh your a** out looking back at this transitional indulgence of typing ( vlogging will change this very soon ) .
HI ( human intelligence ) is truly the potential that will be exploited and will lead to massive breakthroughs .
Deal is simple .
You just have to fall in love :-) .

Four years at $ 20 k / year for an American ( first ) degree sounds poor value .
Is that a typical state college or Yale / Harvard / UCBerkley standard ?
Why not look at a cheaper European option , with a better degree at the end of it ( and perhaps three years instead of four ) ?
Of course some really bright kids adopt a strategy early on of pretending to be one of the crowd and dumber than they are .
Unfortunately it 's hard to shake that off later on .
The real benfits of University are :
1. Living away from home .
2. Learning how to work on problems , and how to absorb new information ;
3. Meeting * much * cleverer people than you would meet at home .
4. Stretching your mental faculties .
5 . Learning not to give up when things seem hard .
6. Learning to check facts !
Employers value many of these traits , en therefore prefer new hires to have a degree .

Well , these days I 'm in the " get the degree anyway " camp .
In fact , at almost 42 years old , I am planning to start a degree this year .
My story :
I too am a software developer / architect , trainer , presenter , and the author of a few tech books ( listed at my blog ) .
Readers and colleagues are surprised to find out that I do n't have a college degree .
Instead , I traveled the world for five years , visiting 60 + countries , and worked in England , Australia , and Portugal .
I took certification courses and taught myself software development along the way because I enjoyed it and it paid well enough to continue my travels for extended periods .
In between jobs I saw the world and made some great friends .
I highly recommend this to any young person , usually much to the consternation of their protective parents .
It was a great experience that I would not trade for anything else .
However , I regret not taking time to get a degree since I returned from my travels to Canada ( then moved to the USA ) .
In the high - tech business , you work in and with many large companies .
These companies have HR departments .
They do this by scanning candidate resumes for keywords .
If a job requisition has a keyword like " degree " and your resume does not match that keyword , then you are not a match for the job .
Simple as that .
It does n't have to be a pertinent degree , I know many colleagues that have music or philosophy degrees .
But they do match the keyword , so they are a match .
And let 's imagine that I did get that degree in computer science back in 1983 .
In those days the curriculum covered important topics like Fortran , CPM , VAX , punch - card management and top - down programming .
What possible use would that knowledge be in today 's IT world ?
Apparently , that does n't matter .
There are thankfully ways around HR for enterprising individuals , which is why I have a job .
But the HR hurdle is a tough one to overcome .
So based on my attitude , why do I want to get a degree now ?
Because I 'm getting old and there IS a societal glass ceiling for non-college graduates that cannot be ignored .
In small business , it 's hard to get a loan without a degree , even with a good track record .
In the corporate world , having a degree does not become an issue right away .
You do n't need a degree for an entry - level job , but you do need one for other jobs with more responsibility and higher pay .
The result is that if you do n't have a degree , you end up working with and for younger , less experienced people for less money than other people in your age bracket .
As you said , money is n't everything , but getting stuck in jobs later in life that you are under - qualified for can affect much more than your bank account .
So now I 'm getting the degree and looking forward to more keyword matches in the future ...

I know what you mean by that feeling of " unfulfilled potential " .
I always felt this unspoken obligation to do the hardest thing I was capable of doing , even if I did n't like it .
To do something difficult and intellectually demanding .
To leave the easier ( and sometimes more fun ) jobs to those who could n't handle the harder stuff .
I do n't know where this feeling came from , but it 's hard to shake .
Especially when the hard stuff pays so well ...

I 'd like to say thank you for this entry .
It 's really great to know that someone outside my age group understands that college simply is n't for everyone .
You see , two semesters ago , I left school to pursue a basic interest in web development and to work part - time in computer repair until I could figure out something a bit more stable .
My mother , professors , friends , and just about everyone else in my life ( save two or three people ) thought of that decision as being the biggest mistake I 've ever made .
For the first time since I started looking at colleges , I 'm happy .
I 'm finally able to do something that I love and am not forced to wake up each day knowing I 'm going to waste away in three more classes like Intro to Rock & Roll and African Studies in order to fulfill my General Education requirements and come closer to getting a degree in Marketing .
Yes , I 'm making less money than I would be right out of college .
Yes , I 'm living paycheck to paycheck .
And yes , I 'm struggling to find clients in this tiny town .
But I 'm happy and I 'm passionate in what I do .
I could n't ask for more .

Here´s what I do : I am living in Germany where we have , additionally to the classic colleges , a dual system where you apply at a company which will send you study .
This is for 3 years in terms of 3 months of studying and 3 months of working .
You still almost get the same contents as in a classic german college , just very comprimized .
And aside from having a view into actual work life , which regular college kids are miles and miles and miles away from , you get paid for studying , now who can claim that ?
This means : you get a college degree , which is a little less , than the regular one but get to start 2 years earlier two work .
I couldn´t allow to be drunk all the time , hell , I can´t even allow myself to get sick more than three days in a row if I want to keep track of my classes .
Sounds ugly and it is a bit , but I guess it holds a lot of experiences you sooner or later have to make , which will add to your personal growth more than partying on your parents money .
If anyone is interested any further , feel free to inquiry by emailing me or visiting my home page .

One quick note on the financial side of things :
It is far easier for the passionate entrepreneur to turn joy into money then it is for the rich person to turn money into joy .
In other words it is much easier to find money via passion then it is to find passion via money .

Four years @ $ 20 K / year is for a typical state college .
A private college such as Yale or Harvard is 2 - 3 x that .
UC Berkley is , for us Californians , a state college ( and so on the lower end of things ) , but anyone enrolling from out of state has to pay higher rates .
Got any resources you can recommend to learn more about the European options ?
When Caltech or MIT has a bill of $ 160 K for a 4 - year degree , alternatives sound great .

My take on the college thing is if you are not going for a hard science or engineering degree , something that requires access to Big , Expensive Equipment , you are better off just staying home and getting an online degree .
For many companies the sheepskin is important , it 's a right of passage , a subway token that gets you in , but it does n't need to be in a related field for them to hire you .
I have noticed a trend in some companies requiring master 's degrees for certain positions since a Bachelors is n't worth very much to them .
I have a little girl and I want her to be passionate about something .
I am going to try and expose her to as many different learning experiences as I can to help her find her talents and preferences , but I am sure she will end up changing her work several times in her life .
I want her to set up her own business so she can be in control rather then be someone else 's drone .

The comments to this entry are closed .
Like it or not , we live in a media driven world .
We spend 11 hours a day bombarded by television , radio , Internet , and other forms of media , a non -stop onslaught on the psyche , an ever - churning series of images , sound bites , opinions , and advertisements , but precious little substance .
The media provides shared experience , collective memory .
Unfortunately , many of the ideas weâ€™re exposed to are negative and self - defeating .
The pervasiveness of these negative ideas makes them hard to ignore ; easy to internalize .
If youâ€™re curious about the cumulative effect of all this media upon the mind , hereâ€™s a list ofÂ 7 negative attitudes common in the media and tips for dealing with them .
1. Mindless Consumerism : The average American is exposed to 247 commercials everyday .
Buying things has become reflex , due partly to the ideal lifestyle flickering on the television : big house , giant SUV , three - car garage , flat - panel television .
Thereâ€™s nothing wrong with enjoying life , but are you buying things to improve your life ?
Or to compensate for feelings of emptiness ?
Find something to believe in ; fill the void with something real .
2. Poor Body Image : Never before in history have we been surrounded by so many examples of physical perfection , shaped by cosmetic surgeons , airbrushed by artists , and distributed by print and video .
Remind yourself that fitness is more important than perfection .
Â Â
And while it ’s true that Americans outside the media areÂ fatter than ever , even physically fit individuals struggle with a poor body image .
Â
Yes ,
Â attractivenessÂ is an advantage , Â but your valueÂ runsÂ deeper than your appearance , and Â those actors donâ€™t look half as good without make - up and lighting .
3. Roaming Eye : Television gives everyone ( men in particular ) the idea that the world is overflowing with beautiful , willing sex partners ; even if it ’s true ( which depends largely upon your own skills with the opposite sex ) , that roaming eye , that tendency to want what you do n’t have , Â can be destructive if not monitored and controlled .
Â Â Like all the elements in this list , human nature is the root here .
Â Â Remind yourself that relationships are built upon more than physical attraction .
4. Destructive Communication : Electronic media brims with insults and anger .
On message boards , gentle persuasion has collapsed beneath the weight of incivility .
In real life , victory is seldom obtained with witty one - liners or rude put - downs .
Hone those communication skills .
Learn to Persuade without offending .
Connect .
5. Clique Mentality : As if cliques werenâ€™t prevalent enough , television programs often have casts that are socially , ethnically , and racially homogenous .
Thatâ€™s fine ; itâ€™s free enterprise at work , for the most part , and not every story involves a melting pot .
I make no bones about it ;
Iâ€™m simply reminding everyone not to be afraid of diversity in the real world .
6. Stereotypes : As evolved as we believe we are , television is overflowing with stereotypes : the dumb jock , the bubble - headed blonde , the geek with a pocket protector , all products Â ofÂ lazy writing .
Most of us are smart enough to recognize a stereotype for what it is , but I question the subconscious impact of such repeated exposure .
The best defense is to remind yourself that every human being deserves to be evaluated as an individual , no matter how prevalent or justified a stereotype might seem .
7. Danger Fixation :
Weâ€ ™re wired to pay attention to danger , which is why the Discovery Channel broadcasts so many programs that show the world being destroyed by tsunamis , earthquakes , and giant asteroids ; why the news leads with gunfire and bloodshed .
Remind yourself that there are just as many positive forces in the world as negative ; your focus on the negative is a matter of personal choice and perspective .
Listen , Iâ€™m not trying to say all media is bad ; itâ€™s not .
Movies in particular can be wonderful works of art or much - needed distractions , and thereâ€™s nothing inherently evil about television , radio , print , or the internet ; quite the contrary , all forms of media provide wonderful channels of communication .
Furthermore , I ’m not blaming the media for anything .
Â
I want to be clear : I do not believe there is any media conspiracy .
Â
I can attest from my days in radio that the media is simply a collection of independently owned businesses , working for profit .
Â Â
An argument can be made that we have ourselves to blame for all this negative media ( a solid argument indeed ) , and that television , radio , and printÂ areÂ simply providing whatÂ sells .
Of course , I agree with all of that .
Â
But in their quest for profit , the mediaÂ does pander to the lowest common denominator , like a giant lens magnifying and reflecting the darkest parts of human nature .
Â
I ’m not saying it ’s wrong ; I ’m simply saying it is . Â
And we ’re receptive to it .
Earlier this year , I watched a short film entitled Evidence .
More art film than documentary , the film focused on the faces of a group of small children as they watched television : their blank expressions , comatose eyes .
Every now and then , their facial expressions hitched in response to some image on the television , but for the most part , they appeared undead .
Iâ €™ve never forgotten that film .
And now , whenever Iâ€™m watching a sitcom or gameshow , I think of the way my own face must look , staring blankly up at the glowing screen .
Sometimes , this compels me to turn the tube off and go outside , exchanging the gloom of the TV room for the calming brightness of sunlight , the sound of commercials for the chirping of birds ; detaching from the hive mind long enough to find some peace and quiet and develop some memories ( and a few ideas ) of my own .
Was Gandhi an Anarchist ?
Visionary promoted decentralized , direct democracy as key to peace ; power resides in the individual and in self - rule
Josh Fattal
Anarchy is about abolishing hierarchy .
According to the original , Greek meaning of the word , Anarchy stands to create a world where there is no separation between the rulers and the ruled - - a place where everyone rules themselves .
( An-archy in Greek means without rulers . )
An anarchic vision of society is nonviolent , self - managed and non-hierarchical , and Anarchist thinkers hold dear to the ideal of democracy -- rule by the people .
They suggest political confederations of local organizations ; a " commune of communes " was how the 19th century Parisians Anarchists articulated it .
Anarchists seek to dissolve power instead of seize it .
Therefore , they seek a social revolution instead of a political one .
The social revolution throws into question all aspects of social life including family organization , schooling , religion , crime and punishment , technology , political organization , patriarchy , environmental concerns as well as others .
Anarchists are identified " as enemies of the State , " because they do oppose the existence of a hierarchical , top - down State .
Mohandas Gandhi opposed the State .
The State is the military , police , prisons , courts , tax collectors , and bureaucrats .
He saw the State as concentrated violence .
" The State represents violence in a concentrated and organized form .
The individual has a soul , but as the State is a soulless machine , it can never be weaned from violence to which it owes its very existence . "
Gandhi recognized that the State claims to serve the nation , but he realized that this was a fallacy .
" While apparently doing good by minimizing exploitation , [ the State ] does the greatest harm to mankind . "
1
According to Dr. Dhawan , Gandhi was a philosophical Anarchist because he believed that the " [ the greatest good of all ] can be realized only in the classless , stateless democracy . "
2
While Gandhi advocated democracy , he differentiated between direct democracy and western democracy .
Commenting on the parliamentary system , Gandhi says , " If India copies England , it is my firm conviction that she will be ruined .
Parliaments are merely emblems of slavery . " 3
He had no more appetite for majority democracy of America , " It is a superstition and an ungodly thing to believe that an act of a majority binds a minority . "
4
By centralizing power , western democracies feed into violence .
Thus , he thought decentralization was the key to world peace .
In Gandhi's view all the political power that was concentrated in the State apparatus could be dissolved down to every last individual .
He stated " Power resides in the people , they can use it at any time .
" 5 Reiterating the idea of Anarchy , Gandhi said , " In such a state ( of affairs ) , everyone is his own rulers .
He rules himself in such a manner that he is never a hindrance to his neighbor .
" 6 Gandhi had no illusions about the enormity of the task , but he took it on anyways .
He believed that by reforming enough individuals and communities , society at large will change .
Gandhi's concept of swaraj elucidates the connection between the individual and society .
Swaraj translates into " self - rule " or " autonomy " .
For Gandhi , every individual had to take steps towards self - rule in their lives ; then India would naturally move towards self - rule as a nation .
Gandhi insisted , " Everyone will have to take [ swaraj ] for himself . "
7
He continued , " If we become free , India becomes free and in this thought you have a definition of swaraj .
It is swaraj when we learn to rule ourselves . "
8
Gandhi angered some of his cohorts by extending his notion of power and swaraj to the history of colonization .
While acknowledging the British Empire 's cynical intentions in India , he places the responsibility of the disaster of colonization on the India people .
" It is truer to say that we gave India to the English than that India was lost ... to blame them for this is to perpetuate their power . " 9
Because power resides in the people and they can only lose it by relinquishing their own power ( often through coercion by others ) , petitions to the government get a new meaning with Gandhi .
" A petition of an equal is a sign of courtesy ; a petition from a slave is a symbol of his slavery . "
Gandhi will petition the government as an equal and he used love - force to back himself up .
" Love - force can thus be stated : ' if you do not concede our demand , we will be no longer your petitioner .
You can govern us only so long as we remain the governed ; we shall no longer have any dealings with you . '"
10
" The individual has a soul , but as the State is a soulless machine , it can never be weaned from violence to which it owes its very existence . "
- Mahatma Gandhi
The principle of swaraj ultimately leads to a grassroots , bottom - up , " oceanic circle " of self - ruling communities .
In 1946 , Gandhi explained this vision :
" Independence begins at the bottom ...
It follows , therefore , that every village has to be self - sustained and capable of managing its own affairs ...
It will be trained and prepared to perish in the attempt to defend itself against any onslaught from without ...
This does not exclude dependence on and willing help from neighbors or from the world .
It will be a free and voluntary play of mutual forces ...
In this structure composed of innumerable villages , there will be every - widening , never ascending circles .
Life will not be a pyramid with the apex sustained by the bottom .
But it will be an oceanic circle whose center will be the individual .
Therefore , the outermost circumference will not wield power to crush the inner circle but will give strength to all within and derive its own strength from it .
"
11
In apparent contradiction to these ideals , Gandhi battled for national liberation and he expressed a lot of patriotism towards Indian civilization .
He redefined the terms ' nationalism ' and ' patriotism ' to fit his vision .
Nationalism , for instance , meant many different things .
Gandhi said , " Every Indian whether he owns up to it or not , has national aspirations -- but there are as many opinions as there are Indian Nationalists as to the exact meaning of that aspiration .
" 12 Gandhi 's nationalism stood to disband the Congress Party upon independence , " Its task is done .
The next task is to move into villages and revitalize life there to build a new socio-economic structure from the bottom upwards .
" 13 He also understood patriotism differently than his contemporaries , " by patriotism , I mean the welfare of the whole people .
"
14
But Congress did not disband after independence in 1947 .
Gandhi recognized that there would be a national government , and his anarchic , oceanic circle would not yet be possible .
Nevertheless , he used the terms of nationalism to move towards the ideal of Anarchy .
He advocated for a minimal level of State organization to fund some education programs and to promote his economic concept of trusteeship .
Hence , Gandhi was a compromising Anarchist .
To Gandhi , ideas were worth having .
He defended his vision of Anarchy in India on this point , " It may be taunted with the retort that this is all Utopian and , therefore , not worth a single thought ...
Let India live for the true picture , though never realizable in its completeness .
We must have a proper picture of what we want , before we can have something approaching it .
"
15
By trying to understand Gandhi 's worldview , certain questions jump out with contemporary relevance .
First off , what is our culturally appropriate " utopian " picture of America or of the communities in which we live ?
Secondly , what practical steps can we make towards swaraj amidst the current global empire ?
Finally , if Gandhi is right that all power resides in individuals , and that power is derived from an " indomitable will " than how do we reclaim the latent power within us , both individually and collectively ?
Security researchers at Symantec have verified that a large - scale web attack targeting Italian web sites and their users is underway .
The attackers exploited vulnerabilities at the ISP and web hosting provider level to add snippets of IFRAME code to hundreds of popular Italian web sites , including those of IT companies , car rental firms , tax services , city councils , and hotel and travel destinations .
The compromised web sites attempt to use exploits in unpatched versions of Internet Explorer , QuickTime , Windows 2000 , Firefox , WinZip , and Opera , in order to install malware packages on end users ' computers .
The attackers used a " commercial " malware kit called MPack , which is sold by a Russian gang .
Currently at version 0.86 , MPack provides would - be malware installers with a complete package that can be installed on any web server that runs PHP with an SQL database .
The owners of MPack have been selling it to other criminal organizations for between $ 700 and $ 1,000 a pop , with additional exploit modules available for between $ 50 and $ 150 .
For an additional $ 30 , the MPack owners will include a feature that helps prevent the malware from being detected by antivirus programs .
Once MPack is installed , the attackers need to compromise popular web sites ( as was done in the Italian attack ) in order to inject IFRAME code .
The site 's HTML files do not need to be directly compromised , as the code is added dynamically when the page is sent by the server — this makes it less likely that web site owners will notice that anything suspicious is going on .
The IFRAME code then adds a request to the MPack server itself , which analyzes the HTTP request header received from the user 's web browser .
It uses this information to determine which exploit it will try to use against the user .
The MPack server stores data about which exploits have been tried and which were successful , and even provides the attacker with a handy " management console " to keep track of how many hosts have been compromised .
MPack was first discovered for sale in a Russian forum in December 2006 , and the security firm PandaLabs has provided a detailed analysis ( PDF ) on its web site .
The rise of off - the - shelf malware packages is another indication that compromising users ' computers has become a huge business and especially attractive for criminal organizations .
The risk of detection and capture is low : the attackers typically install MPack on a compromised web server , and the malware itself can be hosted on any number of servers .
Even if an MPack server is discovered and shut down , any users who have infected by the exploits that MPack uses will continue to generate revenue from whatever spyware the attackers choose to install on the compromised systems .
The advent of directed attacks on popular web sites makes it harder for users to practice skeptical computing , as one does not typically expect to get attacked by a popular tourist destination 's web site .
The only solution is for both web site operators and end users to ensure that their software — including third - party software — is kept up to date .
Niko Pfund , a publisher at Oxford University Press , said the evolution away from traditional bookstores was natural : ' For hundreds of years , the industry was unchanged , then audio came out .
Now it 's time for digital . '
It is estimated that the books will cost less than 1 p per page - but a machine of your own costs about £ 25,000 .
WASHINGTON , Sept. 5 — With a mixed picture emerging about progress in Iraq , Senate Democratic leaders are showing a new openness to compromise as they try to attract Republican support for forcing at least modest troop withdrawals in the coming months .
After short - circuiting consideration of votes on some bipartisan proposals on Iraq before the August break , senior Democrats now say they are willing to rethink their push to establish a withdrawal deadline of next spring if doing so will attract the 60 Senate votes needed to prevail .
Senator Carl Levin , Democrat of Michigan , said , “ If we have to make the spring part a goal , rather than something that is binding , and if that is able to produce some additional votes to get us over the filibuster , my own inclination would be to consider that . ”
Democrats would need to lure the 60 senators in order to cut off a likely Republican filibuster .
The emerging proposal by Mr. Levin and Senator Jack Reed , Democrat of Rhode Island , would still order the administration to begin pulling at least some combat troops out of Iraq , probably by the end of the year .
It is not clear what other provisions the measure may include .

The interpreter ignores modules , and has a unique global environment .
Compiled code and interpreted code can be mixed together .
That is , interpreted code is allowed to call compiled code and vice versa .
This connection can be use to circumvent the missing features of the interpreter ( see Section see
By default the evaluator assumes that operators from the standard library ( e.g. , + , car ) are immutable .
Hence , it optimizes these operators 's calls .
This optimization can be disabled using the bigloo - eval - strict - module parameter described in the chapter describing the parameters ( see see
Bigloo includes an interpreter .
Unfortunately , the language accepted by the interpreter is a proper subset of that accepted by the compiler .
The main differences are : Compiled code and interpreted code can be mixed together .
That is , interpreted code is allowed to call compiled code and vice versa .
This connection can be use to circumvent the missing features of the interpreter ( see Section see Module Declaration , for a description of how to connect compiled and interpreted code ) .
By default the evaluator assumes that operators from the standard library ( e.g. , ) are immutable .
Hence , it optimizes these operators 's calls .
This optimization can be disabled using theparameter described in the chapter describing the parameters ( see see Parameters ) .
23.2 Eval standard functions eval exp [ env ] procedure
This form evaluates exp .
The second argument is optional .
It can be the evaluation of one of these three function forms : ( scheme - report - environment 5 ) ( null - environment 5 ) ( interaction - environment )
scheme - report - environment version procedure null - environment version procedure interaction - environment version procedure
These three procedures have the definitions given in the R5RS so see info - file `r5rs.info ' , 6.5 Eval , for more details .
byte -code - compile exp [ env ( default - environment ) ] bigloo procedure byte - code - run byte - code bigloo procedure
The function byte - code - compile compiles a Scheme expression into a sequence of byte codes that is implemented as a string .
The function byte - code - run execute such a sequence .
repl bigloo procedure
This invokes the read - eval - print loop .
Several repl can be embedded .
The repl function can be used to implement custom Bigloo interpreters .
For instance , one may write :
( module repl ) ( repl )
When compiled , this will deliver an executable containing the sole Bigloo interpreter .
set - repl - error - notifier !
notifier bigloo procedure get - repl - error - notifier bigloo procedure
Set or get the procedure used in the REPLs to display errors .
The notifier is a procedure of one argument , the error or exception that has been raised .
Example :
( set - repl - error - notifier ! ( lambda ( e ) ( print " === error ====== ) ( exception - notify e ) ) )
quit bigloo procedure
This exits from the currently running repl .
If the current repl is the first one then this function ends the interpreter .
set - prompter !
proc bigloo procedure
The argument proc has to be a procedure of one argument and invoking this function sets the repl prompter .
That is , to display its prompt , repl invokes proc giving it the nesting level of the current loop as its argument .
get - prompter bigloo procedure Returns the current repl prompter .
set - repl - printer !
proc bigloo procedure
The argument proc has to be a procedure accepting one or two arguments .
This function sets the repl display function .
That is , to display the result of its evaluations , repl invokes proc giving it the evaluated expression as first argument and the current output port ( or a file in case of transcript ) as second argument .
Set - repl - printer !
returns the former repl display function .
For instance , one may write :
1:=> ( define x ( cons 1 2 ) ) -| X 1:= > ( define y ( cons x x ) ) -| Y 1:=> y -| ( # 0 = ( 1 . 2 ) . # 0 # ) 1:=> ( set- repl - printer ! display ) -| #< procedure : 83b8c70 .
-2 > 1:=> y -| ( ( 1 . 2 ) 1 . 2 )
native - repl - printer bigloo procedure Returns the native ( default ) repl display function .
expand exp bigloo procedure Returns the value of exp after all macro expansions have been performed .
expand - once exp bigloo procedure Returns the value of exp after one macro expansion has been performed .
It is possible to specify files which have to be loaded when the interpreter is invoked .
For this , see section see
If a Bigloo file starts with the line : #! bigloo - command - name and if this file is executable ( in the meaning of the system ) and if the user tries to execute it , Bigloo will evaluate it .
Note also that SRFI - 22 support enables to run any Unix interpreter ( see
load filename bigloo procedure loadq filename bigloo procedure Filename should be a string naming an existing file which contains Bigloo source code .
This file is searched in the current directory and in all the directories mentioned in the variable * load - path * .
The load procedure reads expressions and definitions from the file , evaluating them sequentially .
If the file loaded is a module ( i.e. if it begins with a regular module clause ) , load behaves as module initialization .
Otherwise , this function returns the result of the last evaluation .
The function loadq differs from the function load in the sense that loadq does not print any intermediate evaluations .
Both functions return the full path of the loaded file .
loada filename bigloo procedure Loads an ``access file '' , which allows the interpreter to find the modules imported by a loaded module .
It returns the full path of the loaded file .
* load - path * bigloo variable A list of search paths for the load functions .
dynamic - load filename #!optional ( init init - point ) bigloo procedure Loads a shared library named filename .
Returns the value of the last top - level expression .
Important note :
The function dynamic - load can only be used from compiled modules linked against dynamic libraries .
In particular , the dynamic - load function can be issued from the bigloo command if and only if the option -- sharedcompiler=yes has been used when configuring Bigloo .
If the bigloo command is not linked against dynamic libraries and if dynamic - load is required inside a read - eval - print loop ( REPL ) it exists a simple workaround .
It consists in implementing a new REPL and linking it against dynamic libraries .
This can be done as :
$ cat > new - repl.scm << EOF ( module new - repl ) ( repl ) EOF $ bigloo new - repl.scm -o new - repl $ new - repl 1:=> ( dynamic - load ... )
If init - point is specified and if it is a string and if the library defines a function named init - point , this function is called when the library is loaded .
Init - point is a C identifier , not a Scheme identifier .
In order to set the C name a Scheme function , use the extern export clause ( see Section see C Interface ) .
If the init - point is provided and is not a string , no initialization function is called after the library is loaded .
If the init - point value is not provided , once the library is loaded , dynamic - load uses the Bigloo default entry point .
Normally you should not provide an init - point to dynamic - load unless you known what you are doing .
When producing C code , to force the Bigloo compiler to emit such a default entry point , use the - dload - sym compilation option ( see Section see Compiler Description ) .
This option is useless when using the JVM code generator .
Let 's assume a Linux system and two Bigloo modules .
The first :
( module mod1 ( eval ( export foo ) ) ( export ( foo x ) ) )
( define ( foo x ) ( print " foo : " x ) )
( foo 4 ) The second :
( module mod2 ( import ( mod1 " mod1.scm " ) ) ( eval ( export bar ) ) ( export ( bar x ) ) )
( define ( bar x ) ( print " bar : " x ) )
( bar 5 ) If these modules are compiled as :
$ bigloo mod1.scm - c -o mod1.o $ bigloo mod2.scm - c -o mod2.o - dload-sym
Then , if a shared library is built using these two modules ( note that on non Linux systems , a different command line is required ) :
$ ld - G -o lib . so mod1.o mod2.o
Then , lib .
so cant be dynamically loaded and the variables it defines used such as :
$ bigloo - i ( dynamic - load " lib.so " ) -| foo : 4 bar : 5 1:= > ( foo 6 ) -| foo : 7
As the example illustrates , when Bigloo modules are dynamically loaded , they are initialized .
This initialization is ensure only if dynamic - load is called with exactly one parameter .
If dynamic - load is called with two parameters , it is of the responsibility of the program to initialize the dynamically loaded module before using any Scheme reference .
Note :
In order to let the loaded module accesses the variables defined by the loader application , special compilation flags must be used ( e.g. , - rdynamic under the Linux operating system ) .
Dynamic - load is implemented on the top of the dlopen facility .
For more information read the dlopen and ld manuals .
dynamic - unload filename bigloo procedure
On the operating system that supports this facility , unloads a shared library .
Returns #t on success .
Returns #f otherwise .
* dynamic - load - path * bigloo variable A list of search paths for the dynamic - load functions .
dynamic - load - symbol filename name #!optional module bigloo - procedure dynamic - load - symbol - get dlsym bigloo - procedure dynamic - load - symbol - set dlsym val bigloo - procedure
The function dynamic - load - symbol looks up for a variable in the dynamic library filename .
If found , it returns a custom Bigloo object denoting that variable .
Otherwise it returns #f .
This function assumes that filename has previously been successfully loaded with dynamic - load .
If not , an error is raised .
The argument filename must be equal ( in the sense of string= ? to the argument used to load the library .
The C name of the looked up variable is name is module is not provided .
Otherwise , it is the result of calling bigloo - module - mangle with name and module as arguments .
The function dynamic - load - symbol - get returns the value of a dynamically loaded variable .
The function dynamic - load - symbol - set sets the value of a dynamic loaded variable .
It assumes that the variable is writable , i.e. , that it has not been compiled as a C constant .
transcript - on filename procedure transcript - off procedure
It is possible to specify files which have to be loaded when the interpreter is invoked .
For this , see section see Compiler Description If a Bigloo file starts with the line : and if this file is executable ( in the meaning of the system ) and if the user tries to execute it , Bigloo will evaluate it .
Note also that SRFI - 22 support enables to run any Unix interpreter ( see SRFIs ) .
23.3 Eval command line options
-i Don't compile a module , interpret it !
Do n't compile a module , interpret it !
- export - all
Make all the bindings defined by the compiled module available from the interpreter .
Make all the bindings defined by the compiled module available from the interpreter .
- export - export
Make all the bindings exported by the compiled module available from the interpreter .
Make all the bindings exported by the compiled module available from the interpreter .
- export - mutable Make all the bindings exported by the compiled module mutable from outside the module .
This option is dangerous !
Either all the modules composing the application must be compiled with or without - export - mutable .
It is impossible to mix - export - mutable enabled and disabled compilations .
This section presents the Bigloo compiler options that impact the interaction between compiled and interpreted code .
The whole list of the Bigloo compiler options can be found in The Bigloo command line
23.4 Eval and the foreign interface
To be able to get access to foreign functions within the Bigloo interpreter , some extra measurements have to be taken .
The foreign functions have to be present in the interpreter binary , which means you have to compile a custom interpreter .
This is described in Section Using C bindings within the interpreter
This chapter describes the Bigloo evaluator .
Street Parade
Over three hundred people participated in this summer ’s CrimethInc. convergence , perhaps one and a half times the attendance of last year ’s .
The two and a half days set aside for workshops were not enough to accommodate all the workshops participants hoped to present , even with four sessions a day and five running at a time .
In a matter of days , an overgrown tangle of wilderness that had been abandoned for twenty - odd years became a fully - functioning campsite capable of hosting workshops , cooking , a full - time arts and crafts center , and a walk - in ’zine library and prisoner support station even in the midst of intense rainstorms .
Everyone had access to camping space , three healthy meals a day , comprehensive health care , nonstop educational and entertainment activities , and great quantities of free literature without any registration fees or mandatory work .
And — to offer a single inspiring anecdote — people who attended a workshop on breaking out of police holds successfully used this skill to escape arrest during the celebratory parade at the climax of the convergence .
Clearly , people are interested in the anarchist alternative ; clearly , the CrimethInc. convergence has become a successful model of what one anarchist pundit unambitiously dubbed the Temporary Autonomous Zone .
When something reaches a certain level of success , it ’s no longer necessary or helpful to cheerlead for it .
To get anywhere , we must begin from the premise that this summer ’s convergence was a failure , albeit a failure that could be improved upon .
What could be more defeatist than to regard any anarchist project as a success with no potential for improvement , when the anarchist struggle has so far to go in North America ?
In that spirit , we present the following discussion questions , focusing primarily on the most problematic and controversial aspects of the convergence .
Those who wish to read more about the basic format of the convergence should consult the report from the one last summer .
Mass
In Crowds and Power , Elias Canetti argues that the most essential characteristic of the crowd is that it always wants to grow .
Immediately before the convergence , I attended a family reunion ; as each carload of relatives arrived , people commented approvingly on how many more were coming and how big the family was .
Anarchists and other evangelists rationalize their desire for mass as a matter of necessity in the struggle to change the world , but growth for its own sake offers no guarantee of improved effectiveness or increased freedom .
At the first CrimethInc. convergence , in 2002 , there were few enough people present that a majority of the participants got to know each other over the course of the week ; in Athens , it was easy for anyone to remain anonymous in the mass .
The greater the number of people in a space , the fewer new bonds tend to be forged .
At the same time , one can hardly say there are enough spaces in North America in which even modest numbers of people can come together to discuss and experiment with anarchist models .
If people are turning out to the CrimethInc. convergence in greater and greater numbers , does this mean that the convergence must take on the role of being one of the primary nationwide anarchist gatherings ?
How do we maintain an atmosphere of intimacy and informal participation while adjusting to fill this role ?
How do we create a space that suits everyone , when people are arriving with an increasingly diverse range of experiences , expectations , and needs ?
On the other hand , what if it proves impossible for the convergence to serve its current function as attendance increases ?
If that is the case , should we discourage people from attending ?
Should we hold convergences in more remote locations , or convergences focused on specific topics , or multiple simultaneous regional convergences ?
Ethnicity and Age
There were a lot of people at the convergence , coming from a modest array of subcultures , and among these people one could find a range of class backgrounds and relationships to gender .
But the participants were overwhelmingly white .
Last summer , anarchist people of color were actually disproportionately represented in organizational roles — but this does n’t seem to have resulted in more general attendance by people of color .
Is the CrimethInc. project more relevant to people coming from a predominantly white cultural context ?
If future convergences attract predominantly white folks , can they still contribute to momentum towards multi-ethnic resistance and solidarity — and if so , how ?
If future convergences attract predominantly white folks , can they be comfortable spaces for folks of color and fulfilling spaces for others ?
Should those involved in CrimethInc. projects defer to the analysis and approach of existing anti-oppression groups such as the Catalyst Project , or develop their own ?
The other significant absence of diversity was in age , and this was all the more glaring an issue in that many participants in earlier convergences were nowhere to be seen .
Are young people really more prone to revolutionary commitments than older people ?
What does it take for a person to maintain involvement in radical projects across decades ?
What can others do to support and encourage this ?
How many older people are committed to revolutionary struggle but choose not to attend convergences ?
How can what happens at the convergence be connected to them and their efforts ?
Specialization
The earliest CrimethInc. convergences were characterized by extremely informal infrastructures : at any time , anyone might find himself or herself digging a fire pit or performing for everyone .
This summer , owing to the great numbers of people involved , the infrastructure was much more rigidly organized : one committee scheduled workshops , another maintained security shifts , yet another especially disciplined group organized the kitchen — which was far and away the most impressive mobile free food kitchen I ’d seen since the Miami FTAA protests of 2003 .
At earlier convergences , each person washed his or her own dish ; at this one , a crack team headed up by one determined individual who never left the kitchen area washed everyone ’s dishes .
There was a quartermaster keeping up with all the tools and supplies , a conflict mediation team , a person responsible for maintaining the free literature area .
Looking around at the campsite , it was easy to imagine that we could reorganize society along anarchist lines — but perhaps not as easy for first - time participants to imagine that they could organize something similar themselves .
The organizing model for this convergence was based on bottomlining — an individual or team volunteered to handle each task , swearing to take care of it come hell or high water .
This model enables organizers with control issues to stop worrying about aspects of the organizing other than the ones they choose to take on — but does it also undermine the participatory environment that was so integral to the charm of the first CrimethInc. convergences ?
One night , after a performance of a selection from Howard Zinn ’s Emma , a fire dancing troupe put on an impressive show .
The play had been cast and practiced during the convergence , and had all the urgency and winsome awkwardness of a brand new project , but the fire dancers were clearly experienced in their field .
Someone who had been involved in the organizing of the first convergence pointed out that , while everyone at that convergence took a turn in the spotlight , in this case we were basically a bunch of spectators watching a small team of professionals .
How do we decentralize attention , or at least access and feelings of entitlement to attention ?
Would we benefit from more structure , or less ?
At the debrief discussion at the end of the convergence , some organizers expressed concern about how much of the infrastructural work had been done by a small proportion of the participants .
On the other hand , these “ insiders ” totally dominated this phase of the discussion !
How can organizational work be more widely distributed , along with personal initiative itself ?
The Festival as Cliché … and as Nightmare
To what extent do the people who are free to drop everything for a week to go camp out halfway across the country represent the demographics that actually read and make use of CrimethInc. material ?
Everyone who is invested in CrimethInc. projects knows others who are similarly invested but would never come to a convergence .
To what extent does the current format of the convergence bring out people who like camping and workshops more than people who are committed to CrimethInc. projects ?
How can CrimethInc. agents who are unwilling or unable to attend the annual convergence undertake other experiments that fill similar roles ?
Are there other possible formats for the convergence ?
If it took place in an urban setting , for example , would the ubiquity of capitalist consumer culture inevitably undermine the possibility of an atmosphere of autonomy ?
As it has attracted more participants and solidified into a set format , the CrimethInc. convergence has taken on pronounced similarities to other events .
Like the National Conference on Organized Resistance , it features two full days of workshops ; like the Earth First !
rendezvous , it involves camping out in a rustic setting ; like any rock festival or youth culture event , the premise is that people of a minority persuasion who are used to being diffused throughout society spend a short , intense period of time together .
Anything that falls into a recognizable category inevitably absorbs the inertia associated with existing examples of that category , and the convergence is no exception .
To gauge the dangers posed by that inertia , let ’s examine the subcultural festival as a phenomenon .
These festivals are characterized by the artificial and temporary establishment of a community comprised of people of a single demographic .
In some instances they are regarded — unconsciously or self - consciously — as models for an alternate society , an absurd pretension considering their homogeneity .
It can be an intensely demoralizing experience for a bunch of isolated rebels who are used to defining themselves by their differences from others to spend a lot of time together .
Without the others against whom they have contrasted themselves , they may feel their personal rebellions have lost their special meaning — and if the artificial society they comprise bears any similarities to the larger society they oppose , that undermines the dearly held faith that “ if only there were more of us ” things would be better .
One might argue that the prevalence of the subcultural festival at this juncture in history is simply a manifestation of the destruction of spatially - based long - term communities .
When people arrive at the Rainbow Gathering , one of the longest - running and most widely attended subcultural gatherings , they are greeted with the words “ Welcome home ” — an ironic greeting , given that they are , spatially speaking , anywhere but home .
Might one compare all these white people tromping from cities and suburbs into the last fragile forests in search of “ home ” to the white people who gentrify neighborhoods , or the white people who brought the scourge of Western civilization to North America as refugees from Europe ?
How are we to make any space into home , anyway , if we are perpetually gallivanting from one temporary community to another ?
Like any epidemic , alienation proliferates by means of its victims ’ attempts to escape it .
Are subcultural festivals , gatherings , and convergences simply another form of this destructive flight that wrecks exactly that which it seeks ?
Granted that the preceding two paragraphs outline a vision of hell — how can the CrimethInc. convergence resist the tendency for any event or social group to revert to default setting as soon as it becomes a known quantity ?
How can we overcome the inertia brought to the convergence by participants familiar with and inured to the limitations of other such gatherings ?
What role , if any , could it serve in building longer term connections and investments ?
Do we have any right staging such events in feral countryside , or would it be more responsible to hold convergences in the spaces we already inhabit on a daily basis ?
Subculture
I ’ve never been to a Rainbow Gathering .
My only context for the Rainbow phenomenon comes from my experience hitchhiking — Jesus sometimes sends his followers to give me rides , but when it comes to looking after hitchhikers the Rainbow Gathering seems to be a far more powerful and attentive patron saint .
Countless drivers have referred to the Rainbow Gathering upon picking me up ; as far as I can tell , it seems to be a space that promotes mutual aid and sharing , and as far as that goes I ’m all for it .
But I have to say I was surprised when people started showing up at CrimethInc. convergences for whom the Rainbow Gathering was their closest point of reference .
As I understand it , the Rainbow Gathering is more associated with pacifism , New Age spirituality , and drug use than with the all - out war on capitalism and hierarchy called for in most CrimethInc. literature .
Are there more common threads than I realized connecting CrimethInc. and the whole Rainbow thing ?
Or are these people showing up at the convergence because it seems to have a similar format to the Rainbow Gathering ?
If the CrimethInc. convergence were to become just another stop on the Rainbow circuit , would that be a positive thing — exposing more people to revolutionary anarchism — or would it just dilute the atmosphere ?
Are there disturbances in the Rainbow ecosystem that are driving people from those circles to our convergence ?
According to one participant in the convergence , Earth First ! has already been through this same experience with their yearly rendezvous , with the result that their rendezvous is now always scheduled to coincide with the Rainbow National Gathering .
That does n’t seem promising .
Does it make a difference that the convergence is a sober space , while the rendezvous is similar to the Rainbow Gathering in that it often hosts a lot of substance use ?
But this specific line of questioning indicates a broader horizon of questions .
As a broader range of people get involved in anarchist spaces , they will inevitably bring with them their own subcultural activities and reference points — whether those be drum circles , moshing , or bowling .
Is it mere bigotry that punk subcultural norms go unquestioned , for example , regardless of the political implications of those norms , on account of punk having long been associated with anarchism — while others are regarded with suspicion ?
Sobriety and Gift Economics
If anything decisively distinguishes the CrimethInc. convergence from the Earth First !
rendezvous and the Rainbow Gathering alike , it is that it is an explicitly sober space .
In a culture that promotes intoxication among radicals as well as everyone else , this is an achievement , though at every convergence the same discussions have to take place all over again to maintain this .
Most inspiring of all were the participants who acknowledged having left the site of last year ’s convergence to drink , but made a point this year of emphasizing the value of the convergence being a sober space to others who wished to drink .
After the unpermitted march at the end of the convergence , the police used false positives from drug - sniffing dogs to justify searching people ’s vehicles .
When it came out that the pigs found no illegal substances in those searches , somebody shouted out “ The policy works ! ”
Why is sobriety not more widely practiced as an aspect of revolutionary strategy ?
How do we create sober environments in which no one feels uncomfortable about or judged for their personal relation to substance use ?
If CrimethInc. is not itself a movement , but rather a subversion of movements , would organizing a sober Rainbow Gathering itself qualify as subversive activity ?
Likewise , if anything distinguishes the CrimethInc. convergence from the various anarchist book fairs , the National Conference on Organized Resistance , and events like the US Social Forum , it is that there is no registration fee and no buying or selling .
It is a powerful thing to demonstrate that we can provide for the needs of hundreds of people across several days by means of volunteer labor and individual donations .
Besides intoxication and exchange economics , are there are other aspects of contemporary society we might try doing without ?
Relating to Other Radical Organizations
This year ’s convergence took place at the same time as the national convention of the new Students for a Democratic Society and the Feral Visions gathering .
The latter was on the West coast , but many committed anarchists had to choose between attending the convergence and the SDS convention , which took place in nearby Detroit .
The dates of both events were announced shortly after we announced the date of this year ’s convergence — to our great frustration , as we had already spent weeks contacting organizers around the country , including some from SDS , inquiring about their schedules for the summer .
It ’s possible that , had the two events not overlapped , more serious student organizers would have been in Athens .
A statement was read at the SDS convention from participants in the CrimethInc. convergence , encouraging more conscientious coordination between the two groups .
It reportedly met a warm reception ; in addition , a collection of hundreds of dollars was taken up at the convention when it was reported that police had made arrests at the parade concluding the convergence .
How can CrimethInc. and more rigidly structured groups like SDS work together in the future ?
What would it look like to collaborate with such groups to organize a convergence that brought together participants from several different strains of radical thought and organizing ?
Could that be a worthwhile experiment ?
Prisoner Support
Last summer there was a prisoner support table offering resources about current political prisoners and defendants and materials for writing letters to them ; some dozens of letters were written and mailed off .
This summer ’s convergence featured a similar prisoner support station , but dramatically fewer letters were written .
Does this reflect simple ergonomic shortcomings on the part of this year ’s support station — the absence of a table and chairs for writing , for example — or a more ominous deprioritization of prisoner support on the part of participants ?
Workshops
Approximately fifty workshops , discussions , and presentations took place in the course of this year ’s convergence , not including caucuses and plant walks .
One of the hallmarks of the CrimethInc. convergence model is that everyone who attends is encouraged to present a workshop , on the grounds that people learn more from presenting workshops than they possibly could from watching others ’ workshops .
Perhaps not surprisingly , many of the workshops were not as interactive as they could have been — there was a lot of one person talking at length .
It needs to be said that a workshop presenter is responsible for giving those who attend a workshop the most entertaining , engaging experience possible : if you choose to speak at people for an hour , it had better be a powerful performance !
There was some talk afterwards of setting higher standards for the workshops .
How can this be accomplished without discouraging inexperienced presenters from offering workshops ?
And how can we further challenge the standard , often boring format of workshops , which the convergence has inherited unquestioned from more orthodox activist conferences ?
By far the most controversial aspect of this year ’s convergence was the workshop entitled “ 2012 . ”
Presumably , this workshop was scheduled with the expectation that it was not simply an introduction to wingnut millenarianism , but it proved to be exactly that .
Not only that , but due to its taking place in the big army tent during the last block of workshops , it ran on for several hours through dinner and into the evening , becoming a clearinghouse for wingnut ideas of all stripes .
The tent was packed for the workshop , though it later came out that many people had circulated in and out of it in the course of its duration , most more out of curiosity than credence .
The unfortunate effect , however , was that the spectacle of a packed house listening to cosmic conspiracy theory at a supposedly clearheaded radical convergence demoralized people .
The effect was similar to what might have happened if the Jerry Springer show was playing on the campsite with a crowd gathered around it : whether or not they approved or believed in it , their attention alone legitimized it and seemed to reflect on the convergence itself .
If we would not have had television on the campsite , if we would not have invited the Church of Scientology to seek converts , why was there space for wingnut millenarians ?
Should there be a policy delineating what kinds of workshops are encouraged and discouraged ?
What about suggested “ tracks , ” directed themes for workshops and discussions ?
Or is that too controlling ?
But the more important question is — why did the 2012 workshop attract so much attention in the first place ?
Was it the result of having a wider range of people at the convergence this year , that some of them are actually prone to believing such nonsense ?
Are some anarchists in fact eager to believe the world is going to end soon ( or reach peak oil or a “ point of singularity ” or whatever ) so they wo n’t have to figure out how to liberate themselves ?
Was it simply the Jerry Springer effect — people can’t help but flock to something ridiculous , even if there are more meaningful options close at hand ?
The schedule was packed all day every day with demanding activities — did people need something light to break up all that seriousness ?
Were the workshop presenters simply more compelling speakers than other workshop presenters ?
Did the workshop fill a role of being whimsical , entertaining , or romantic in a way that no other workshop did ?
Should we have been more conscientious about making sure something worthwhile would fill that role ?
Making Concrete Plans for the Future
There were several efforts to make concrete plans for future projects and mobilizations , but few of these bore tangible fruit ; it seems difficult to achieve concrete results and commitments in open workshop settings .
On the other hand , plenty of agreements and decisions came out of informal conversations during the convergence .
Are formal structures simply less efficient , or is this more the result of the predispositions of those who would attend a CrimethInc. convergence in the first place ?
If informal discussions are bound to be the setting of all the important decisions , how do we prioritize and facilitate them ?
And Hidden Somewhere Behind All This , A Publishing Collective
Of all the workshops , performances , and discussions at the convergence , it is striking how little focus there was on CrimethInc. projects per se .
On one hand , this avoids creating a “ star system ” centering attention on those already engaged in those projects , but on the other hand it contributes to the impression that the convergence is a merely social space , reinforcing the separation between the informal networks that produce projects and the social circles that consume them .
At worst , this suggests a dynamic in which CrimethInc. is invisibly directed by a few people without the input of the vast majority of those who identify with it .
On the other hand , efforts at earlier convergences to organize CrimethInc. projects did not bear fruit .
What would it take for the convergence be a space in which wider participation in CrimethInc. propaganda projects could develop ?
Ambitious Hedonism , Or Going Through the Motions ?
At the end of the event , someone asked organizers who had been involved in several convergences what they would have done for the convergence had it simply been a matter of what most interested them personally .
Their answers were all very different from what they had actually done .
What would have happened if these experienced participants had tailored their efforts to their own personal tastes rather than to the presumed necessities of organizing a successful anarchist event ?
Are these participants unable to concentrate more on subjects and experiments that interest them because others are not stepping forward to handle the basic responsibilities of setting up infrastructure , or because of their own inability to trust others to do that ?
What would it look like to have a convergence that was designed to fulfill the specific wildest dreams of the individuals involved ?
Can we even imagine such a thing ?
If we can’t , can we hope to make a revolution centered around the fulfillment of desire ?
POSTSCRIPT : The Adventure of Our Lives
In August 2003 , after participating in the CrimethInc. convergence described in “ Under the Helicopters , ” my barnstorming group made one more tour stop — in Athens , Ohio .
By that time , following an unplanned parade - turned - riot and subsequent media feeding frenzy , there was an APB out and police officers were waiting for us everywhere we went .
Our final evening of performances and workshops went smoothly enough until the conclusion .
We ’d been ending each event by teaching people how to make the asphalt tile mosaics described in Recipes for Disaster , then affixing one in a street as a token of our passing .
We debated briefly as to whether we should attempt this act of unorthodox vandalism under the watchful eyes of the police , and finally concluded — as we always do — that we had to go for it and let the consequences sort themselves out .
A slapstick scene ensued such as one might see in a European comedy : imagine us running around the campus pursued by police and audience members , attempting to elude the former and put down our tile mosaic in front of the latter .
In the end , we succeeded in deploying the mosaic , but were followed by police to the house we ’d intended to stay at and had to escape through the back alley to sleep somewhere else .
Months later , unbeknownst to us and against all odds , the mosaic remained in the parking lot — somehow the police never bothered to have it removed .
Long before we ever met , the person who is now my lover and partner walked past a colorful heart set into the asphalt on her way to class every day , wondering how it came to be there .
Fast - forward nearly four years , to the end of July 2007 .
The tile mosaics our barnstorming tour put down have been paved over and the passionate friendships that bound our group together have cooled .
All of us are now involved in new projects and friendships — for example , I ’m back in Athens , in an unpermitted parade at the conclusion of the sixth CrimethInc. convergence , surrounded by hundreds of costumed maniacs .
Some of them are spinning fire ; others are beating improvised percussion instruments , including one enormous drum pushed on a shopping cart ; still others have just dislodged an enormous road blockade reading “ ROAD CLOSED ” from a construction site and are carrying it to the front .
Among the whirling dancers and masked faces , through the haze of enthusiasm and good cheer , I can make out a couple people who were with me here four years earlier .
We ’ve covered a lot of ground in that time .
My partner calls me over to a spot in the road .
There , set in the asphalt , as fresh and bright as the day we put it there , is a colorful tile heart .
When experiments like these work , they connect us to spaces and to each other in a magical way , giving our lives back the narrative meaning that capitalism drains from everything .
They may not immediately overthrow the government or abolish private ownership of capital , but they give us the networks , experience , and sense of our own power necessary for tilting at such monstrous windmills .
Separated from our ongoing struggle for liberation they are senseless , but they are n’t only useful as incremental steps towards liberation — they also are that liberation , as we recapture our lives , moment by moment , from routine and obedience .
Missing Appendix
Dear reader , this blog post is where your answers to these questions could be , along with your account from the convergence if you were there .
Feel free to fill in the blanks .
Thus far , other than all the news reporting from the parade at the end , these two accounts are all we ’ve been able to turn up :
In my last article on The # 1 Mistake People Make When Using the Law of Attraction , I stated that every intention has a content component plus an energy component , and both are equally important when it comes to applying the Law of Attraction .
At the end of that article , I asserted that the energy component of every intention has a polarity .
Now we ’re going to explore polarity , which is the key to understanding intentional energy .
Do your best to keep an open mind as you read this article .
The concepts are what ’s important here , so try not to get hung up on the particular words I use to describe them .
What is polarity ?
In order to define polarity , we need to build a bit of conceptual scaffolding first , so let ’s dive in and explore the nature of thought .
As a conscious being , you have the ability to create thoughts .
If you decide to think of an apple , you can obviously do that .
Every thought consists of two primary components : ( 1 ) content and ( 2 ) energy .
I ’m going to define these first , and then we ’ll get to polarity .
Thought content
The content of a thought is the raw information it contains .
If you think of an apple , the content is your internal representation of that apple .
If you form an intention to have a million dollars , the content is the request for a million dollars .
The content portion of a thought contains no emotion itself .
Content is what you get when you reduce a thought to something that could be stored in a computer database or typed up as an email .
Even if the original thought is highly emotional , the content portion is the emotionless representation of that thought , such as the sentence “ I am angry ” to represent the real - life emotion of anger .
This definition of content is simply an abstraction to help us better understand the energy component .
I ’m not suggesting that your thoughts actually separate themselves into separate components .
What I ’m suggesting is that this model will be helpful to you in creating thoughts that have more power to manifest what you desire .
Thought energy
Now let ’s define energy .
Energy is the non-content portion of a thought .
This concept is very difficult to explain in words because as soon as we reduce it to words , we end up with content , not energy .
So my words can never do the concept justice , just as the word “ joy ” can never convey the actual experience of joy .
Intuitively you already have a grasp of the energy component of your thoughts , so I think the best way to define energy is to allow you to experience it subjectively right now .
Here ’s a simple exercise you can do in about one minute to demonstrate thought energy ( this will be very familiar to anyone who ’s studied NLP ) :
Try holding the thought “ I am happy ” in your mind right now .
Just humor me and hold that thought for a few seconds .
Notice how you feel when you hold this thought .
Now hold that same thought ( identical content ) … but with more energy this time .
Do whatever you think is necessary to make the “ I am happy ” thought more intense in your mind — smile , change your position , breathe more deeply , stand up , stick your chest out , look up , move around , etc .
Hold the thought at that new energy level for a few more seconds .
Notice the difference in how this thought feels compared to the first thought .
Can you perceive the increased energy even as the pure content of the thought remains unchanged ?
Now lower the intensity , and bring the energy of the “ I am happy ” thought back down .
Strip the thought of all its energy , and reduce it in your mind to pure content .
It is nothing but a boring sentence .
Hold the thought as pure content for a few more seconds .
Notice how that feels compared to the first two thoughts .
Can you sense the energetic difference ?
Even though the content is the same in all three situations , your subjective experience of these thoughts will be totally different .
Objectively speaking , your breathing , physiology , and movement will change to reflect the energy of the thought you ’re holding .
If someone else were doing this exercise in front of you , you would be able to perceive the differences .
It is n’t difficult to gauge the intensity of someone ’s thought energy by observing their physiology .
This is especially easy to do with children who are less apt to disguise their emotional state .
Energy and emotion
Now you might be thinking that energy and emotion are the same thing .
They ’re related , but they ’re definitely not the same .
Emotion is to energy as heat is to fire .
The flow of thought energy creates emotion , just as fire produces heat .
If you hold a thought with strong energy , you will feel strong emotion .
If you hold a thought with weak energy , you will feel little or no emotion .
Energy is not something you can create or destroy .
It simply exists .
It is ever - present and always available .
What makes you feel strong emotion is not the energy itself ( which is ever - present ) but rather the flow of energy coursing through you .
Some self - help gurus suggest you can increase your ability to manifest your desires ( or achieve your goals ) by injecting more emotion into your thoughts .
That advice is misguided .
It ’s like saying you can make a fire burn hotter by turning up the heat in the room .
Technically that ’s true , but it ’s a highly inefficient strategy , and you ’ll end up investing more energy than you gain .
If you want your fire ( intention ) to burn hotter , you should add more fuel ( energy ) , and you ’ll generate more heat ( emotion ) as a natural consequence .
Once you understand energy and begin to play with it ( especially after you learn about polarity ) , you ’ll find it a lot easier to generate intense emotional states simply by visualizing the energy flow .
It is n’t necessary to flap your arms like a dork in order to whip yourself into an emotional frenzy . 🙂
Contrary to popular belief , an intense emotion like passion does not fuel or motivate activity .
Passion is not the real source of drive and motivation .
Passion itself is a byproduct of high thought energy .
The reason you see passion and motivated action together is that they ’re both outcomes of the flow of thought energy .
Without thought energy , there is no passion , no activity , and no manifesting .
So the process of generating results works like this :
Intention ( Content + Thought Energy ) ->
Passion + Direct Action + Passive Manifesting ->
Results
In every situation the particular mixture of passion , action , and manifesting will be different , but the ultimate cause of the whole chain of events is the original intention .
I view direct action and passive manifesting as basically the same thing because when passion is high , action becomes fun and effortless anyway .
Remember that we ’re talking energy here , not content .
You can spend hours holding low - energy thoughts with great content ( such as by reciting daily affirmations ) , and you will manifest virtually no passion , no activity , and no results .
Similarly you can hold thoughts with really lame content but high energy , and you will feel a surge of motivation to passionately pursue them and generate results .
I ’m sure you ’ve had experiences with both of these extremes .
What ’s really fascinating to me is that when I form a powerful intention , one I ’ve loaded with thought energy , other people ( especially those who are energetically sensitive ) can begin to pick up on it long before the intention physically manifests .
For example , a few people have told Erin about dreams they ’ve had about me doing certain things , including specific details that are rather unusual .
Those details were part of some very strong intentions I put out , but I have n’t told anyone about them , not even Erin .
I think that on some level , this thought energy is beginning to resonate with those who will eventually be involved in its manifesting .
Even though these are intentions that may take a decade or more to fully manifest in physical form , on an energetic level the creation has already been set in motion .
Energy as a practical tool
Depending on your particular belief system , other terms you can use in place of energy are chi , qi , the Holy Spirit , prana , mana , life force , the Tao , morphogenic fields , psychic energy , etc .
It does n’t matter what term you use .
The concept is all that matters .
I ’m not asserting a spiritual philosophy here .
I ’m simply presenting a tool you can use .
I view the concept of thought energy much like a mathematical construct .
For example , consider the mathematical concept of imaginary numbers , based on taking the square root of - 1 .
Imaginary number space does not exist in a real physical sense , but the concept can still be used to solve interesting problems and generate results with enormously practical applications .
Energy flow and skill
As a conscious being , you have the ability to direct the flow of universal energy .
In fact the ability to do this is one of the most fundamental skills of consciousness .
I say it ’s a skill because there are varying degrees of competency .
Like any other skill , you will have some level of innate ability in this area , but you can also improve with practice .
However , expecting to master this skill overnight is extremely naive .
If you ’re having magical fantasies that all your problems will vanish instantly the first time you try this , I suggest you read What Are the Odds of Becoming a Black Belt ?
Becoming skillful at directing energy flow takes dedication , practice , and perseverance .
If you ’re looking to the LoA as a way to get something for nothing , you ’ll need to do a bit of growing up first .
Your ability to successfully apply the LoA depends on your ability to generate energy flow .
If you cannot achieve a strong flow ( as evidenced by your direct experience of intense emotional states ) , you will fail miserably and get no results .
That is n’t the end of the world , but it does mean that you ’ll spend far more time servicing other people ’s intentions instead of enjoying the fulfillment of your own .
A pattern you will see repeatedly with newcomers to the LoA is that they form intentions that are all content and no energy .
They tweak the content again and again , mistakenly thinking that better content is the answer , but they never manage to build sufficient intensity on the energy side .
When these people talk about their intentions , it ’s like listening to a Vulcan .
There ’s no passion , no fire , no energy behind their words .
If they actually injected energy into their intentions , they ’d be speaking like a Vulcan going through Pon Farr .
Many people who achieve poor results when trying to apply the Law of Attraction simply lack skill in creating and sustaining energy flow .
Please try to resist the temptation to conclude that the LoA does n’t work .
That ’s like an American Idol reject complaining that sound waves do n’t work because they did n’t pass their audition .
The problem may simply be that you downright suck .
But it ’s OK to suck .
Remember this line from The Matrix : “ Everyone falls the first time . ”
You just need to build your skill level .
If you really ca n’t suppress the urge , go ahead and throw a “ poor me ” tantrum in the hallway on the way out , but it ’s only going to make you look stupid in the eyes of those who know what they ’re doing , and it wo n’t bring your intentions any closer to manifesting .
On the bright side , your parting shot may be a source of entertainment for others , so just pretend we ’re all laughing with you .
In all fairness to those who are struggling with the LoA and making these newbie mistakes , it is n’t really your fault .
There ’s a tremendous amount of marketing hype surrounding the LoA these days that vastly oversimplifies its true complexities and leaves people thinking they can expect instant results overnight .
The something - for - nothing crowd is going to be disappointed as they always are , but those who look beneath the surface and probe its depths will find something wonderful .
Just do your best to ignore the marketing hype without feeling a need to attack or defend it .
You can continue to pursue the LoA without spending a dime if the hype onslaught makes you nauseous .
Polarity
Now we ’re finally ready to explore the concept of polarity .
This is a very key concept to understanding how to create high - energy intentions .
Thoughts have content and energy , and polarity is a property of the energy component .
When we consider the energy of a thought , we ’re really talking about the energy flow .
But in order to have a flow , we need a direction .
What are the possible directions of energy flow ?
With respect to your consciousness , there are only two directions that make sense : into your consciousness or out from your consciousness .
Energy can flow towards you , or it can flow away from you .
It ’s like you ’re a vacuum cleaner that has two airflow settings : suck and blow .
Boy you have a dirty mind , but let ’s stick with the concept of energy flow for now , OK ?
The polarity of the energy flow is simply its direction .
The in - flowing energy has one polarity , and the out - flowing energy has the opposite polarity .
So here are the two basic ways energy can flow through your consciousness :
You ->
Universe ( you direct energy from your consciousness out to the universe ) Universe ->
You ( you draw energy from the universe into your consciousness )
# 1 is like breathing out , and # 2 is like breathing in , except we ’re talking energy instead of air .
I ’m not saying this is any kind of physical energy flowing through your physical body .
It ’s best to treat this as a conceptual tool .
If you want to argue that there ’s no such thing as this form of energy , I ’ll simply agree with you , just as I ’ll agree there ’s no such thing as imaginary numbers .
However , I ’ll continue using both as tools .
Choosing polarity
The polarity of every thought is either outward or inward but never both .
Actually a thought could be totally neutral as well , which would mean that it has content but no energy , and since it has no energy , it ca n’t be polarized .
An example would be imagining a pencil or holding some other emotionless idea in your mind that you do n’t connect with an energy flow .
Now here ’s the rub .
These two different energy polarities are incompatible with each other .
When you have both polarities present at the same time and in the same magnitude , they cancel each other .
The process works like vector addition .
If you add two opposing vectors of equal magnitude , you end up with a zero vector .
If one vector is slightly longer than the other , you ’ll have some energy left over , but it will be significantly less that the total energy you ’ve invested .
Imagine adding 10 units of in - flowing energy with 8 units of out - flowing energy .
You ’ve invested 18 units total , but you ’ll only end up with a net 2 units of in - flowing energy because 8 units of energy on each side will simply cancel out .
In effect you are working against yourself .
Not understanding polarity is a source of tremendous frustration when applying the LoA , since it ’s entirely possible to inject lots of energy into your intentions but get little or no results if you ’re mixing both polarities together .
Unfortunately it ’s very easy to do this by default .
If you want to manifest a particular desire , you ’ll achieve the best results by picking a single polarity and using it consistently .
Polarizing your intentions
Based on the polarity concept , there are a couple things we can say about intentions :
An intention without a strong polarity is very weak and has little power to manifest
An intention with a strong polarity is very strong and has significant power to manifest
To polarize an intention , you must energize it with directional energy .
The energy must either flow outward or inward but not both .
Understand that with respect to this model , everything is energy , so although the content of your intentions may seem to have nothing to do with energy , ultimately you can think of your intentions in terms of some kind of flow , and that flow is either coming into you or going out of you .
An intention that does n’t align with one of these natural flows will have virtually no power to manifest .
Here are some examples of intentions that align well with outflow ( from your consciousness out to the universe ) :
write a book
build a business
compose a song
draw a picture
throw a party
give a speech
start a blog
And here are some examples of intentions that align well with inflow ( from the universe into your consciousness ) :
get a new car
attract a new relationship
receive a certain sum of money
get a new job
achieve a certain reputation
win a contest
Technically these lists have no energy ( or polarity ) because as plain text they reduce intentions to mere content , but I think you ’ll see there ’s a logical directional choice for the flow of energy for each example .
Outward flowing energy involves creation and giving .
Inward flowing energy involves acquiring and receiving .
Although these two energies may seem similar , they ’re actually very distinct creatures .
It ’s entirely possible to take the same content and apply either energetic polarity to it .
For example , consider the intention of eating a nice dinner .
You can imbue this intention with out - flowing energy by imagining it as a creative endeavor , focusing on the experience of preparing an interesting meal , concocting an original recipe , laying out the table , and perhaps sharing the food with others .
You are adding to the substance of the universe .
On the other hand , you can also fill this intention with in - flowing energy by focusing on appeasing your appetite , enjoying the taste and texture of the food , being served , and feeling satiated at the end of the meal .
In this case you are receiving from the universe .
Your dinner will turn out best if you pick one polarity or the other and stick with it .
If you ’ve never tried doing this consciously , I highly encourage you to do so .
To form a strong intention , think of that intention as either an inflow or an outflow of energy .
Are you primarily creating or acquiring ?
It ’s important to be crystal clear about which polarity you ’re going to use .
If you ca n’t clarify your intention in terms of the inflow or outflow of energy , you ’ll end up with a very weak intention that is n’t likely to manifest .
When you form a true intention , either you ’re giving something to the universe , or you ’re getting something from it .
While you may in fact experience both results as your intention manifests ( giving leads to getting and vice versa ) , what ’s important here is that you focus your intentional energy on either one direction or the other but not both .
Your attention must be concentrated either on sending energy out or on drawing energy in .
There is no right or wrong choice of polarity except not to choose one .
If you imbue your intentions with energy of mixed polarity , you ’re only wasting your efforts .
The two energies will simply neutralize each other .
Polarized emotional feedback
These concepts may be easier to understand if you look at them from another angle : the emotional output of polarized energy .
If you apply highly polarized energy to your intentions , you will experience a strong surge of emotion .
But that emotional surge will be totally different depending on your choice of polarity .
If you use the polarity of creation and giving ( outflow ) , you will experience a surge of related emotions such as love , joy , and inspiration .
If you use the polarity of acquisition and receiving ( inflow ) , you will experience a surge of related emotions such as greed , lust , and power .
These polarized emotional states are incompatible with each other , which is what we ’d expect as a result of the underlying energies being incompatible .
However , a peak emotional state on either side can be labeled as a form of passion .
On either side you will experience intense , highly motivating emotional states .
Based on the emotional consequences , your social conditioning , and your personality , you may have a bias towards one polarity or the other .
( That ’s a whole other article . )
But as far as the universe is concerned , these polarities are equally acceptable .
To say that one is better than the other is to say that breathing in is better than breathing out .
If you experience no surge of emotion when focusing on your intentions , suffice it to say that either you are n’t putting enough energy into them , or you ’re injecting them with energy of mixed polarity .
As an example , to write this article I am using the polarity of outflow .
My intentional energy is focused on writing as an act of love , connection , creation , giving , and contribution .
I am not thinking about what this article will do for me personally , what kind of feedback it will generate , how it will rank in search engines , or how much money I make from ad clicks , since those are all energetic signatures of the polarity of inflow .
Consequently , this act of writing is an extremely enjoyable experience for me .
The creative ideas flow easily and effortlessly , and emotionally I feel blissful and very fulfilled .
The exact words you use to phrase an intention are not that important unless they help you polarize one way or the other .
You do not even need to put your intentions into words — you can hold them as pure thoughts , images , or sounds if you prefer .
Imagine typing an email to someone .
The exact words are n’t that important as long as you get your basic point across .
But the message is n’t going anywhere until you click Send .
Your life experience has probably shown you that when you hold an intention with strong emotions , it ’s very likely to manifest .
For one , you ’ll be extremely motivated to take action , but it may also seem like the universe is bending over backwards to help you get there .
In those situations you were using polarized energy , intensely focusing on either the outward flow of creative expression ( giving ) or the inward flow of acquisition ( receiving ) .
Instead of mixing those two polarities together , you primarily focused on one side or the other .
It was either “ I want to give ” or “ I want to get . ”
And you felt an intense emotional surge as a natural consequence of using polarized energy correctly .
I have much more to write on the topic of polarization , so please stay tuned .
In the meantime I ’d like to challenge you to simply observe energetic polarities flowing through your daily life .
The only way you ’ll truly understand the significance of polarity is by experiencing it for yourself .
Whenever you observe yourself or someone else in an emotional state , stop and take notice of the energetic flow that ’s present .
What is its polarity ?
Is the focus on inflow or outflow ?

Many species are losing habitats or being traded as pets
The report says many apes , monkeys and other primates are being driven from the forests where they live or killed to make food and medicines .
The research is being presented at the International Primatological Society ( IPS ) on the Chinese island of Hainan .
It was compiled by a team of 60 experts led by the World Conservation Union .
Asia threat
The report focuses on the fate of the world 's 25 most endangered primate species , which are threatened by a depressing list of problems .
The authors say all the surviving members of these species combined would fit in a single football stadium .
Of particular concern are the Hainan gibbon from China and Miss Waldron 's red colobus monkey from Ivory Coast , both of which have only a few surviving creatures left in the wild .
The report says the threat to primates is worst in Asia where tropical forests are being destroyed and many monkeys are being hunted or traded as pets .
It also argues that climate change is making some species more vulnerable .
Scientists have been warning for decades about the growing human threat to animal species around the world , but this study says we should be especially concerned about primates because they are the closest living relatives of humans .
Jordon was pulled from the water but could not be resuscitated
Mother 's reaction
Jordon Lyon leapt into the water in Wigan , Greater Manchester , after his eight - year - old stepsister Bethany got into difficulties on 3 May .
Two anglers jumped in and saved Bethany but Jordon became submerged .
The inquest into his death heard the PCSOs did not rescue him as they were not trained to deal with the incident .
Jordon was playing at the edge of the pond , known locally as John Pit , off Wigan Lower Road , in Standish Lower Ground , with his two brothers , stepbrother and stepsister on 3 May .
He was trying to support Bethany as she struggled in the six - feet - deep water before slipping from view .
Anglers managed to pull Bethany out but Jordon was out of sight before they could get to him .
The alarm was raised and the PCSOs arrived on the scene .
Police said they could see no sign of Jordon in the water , so they radioed trained officers for help .
Greater Manchester Police said an officer was on the scene within five minutes .
If you 're walking down the street and you see a child drowning you automatically go in that water
Tracy Ganderton , mother
Members of Jordon 's family also rushed to the scene to join the search .
He was eventually pulled from the pond but despite attempts to resuscitate him he was later pronounced dead in hospital .
A verdict of accidental death was recorded .
His mother , Tracy Ganderton , and stepfather Anthony , of Bluebell Avenue , Wigan , are demanding to know why the PCSOs did not try to rescue Jordon and why they did not give evidence at the inquest held by deputy West Manchester coroner Alan Walsh .
Mr Ganderton told the inquest : " I do n't know why they did n't go in .
I can't understand it .
" If I had been walking along a canal and seen a child drowning I would have jumped in .
" You do n't have to be trained to jump in after a drowning child . "
Mrs Ganderton said on Friday that the PCSOs in question should be named .
" If you 're walking down the street and you see a child drowning you automatically go in that water .
The pond is at a well - known beauty spot in Wigan
" You do n't care if you 're going to lose your job or not , you do n't care do you ?
" I want them to be named .
I want to know why they did n't go in , I want to know why they were n't at the inquest when I had to turn up there , and go through the pain of it all .
" I want to know why they did n't have to be there as main witnesses .
" They should have to be there .
They should n't have a job . "
In a statement after the hearing , Det Ch Insp Phil Owen , of Wigan CID , who led the investigation into Jordon 's death , said : " PCSOs are not trained to deal with major incidents such as this .
" Both ourselves and the fire brigade regularly warn the public of the dangers of going into unknown stretches of water so it would have been inappropriate for PCSOs , who are not trained in water rescue , to enter the pond .
" This was a tragic incident where a young boy lost his life and we would once again want to pass on our heartfelt condolences to Jordon 's family . "
' Life - saving skills '
Paul Kelly , chairman of the Police Federation in Manchester , said PCSOs do not have the same level of training as police officers to deal with life - saving situations .
He said : " The message is clear and unambiguous - it 's the government , they are trying to fool the public .
" They take a person and dress him up as a police officer but they just do n't have the same powers .
" Every single police officer I trained with left training school with a life - saving certificate of some sort . "
He said the PCSOs might not have been able to swim and in that case they should not have risked their lives .
But he added : " People throw themselves into rivers and ponds to save people every day because it 's the right thing to do .
" This is an accident waiting to happen again . "
West Lancashire Coroner Jennifer Leeming said : " Neither myself or the Deputy Coroner can comment on individual cases but the statement put out by Greater Manchester Police reflects the evidence that was given in the courtroom . "
It ’s been more than six years since I ’ve even heard from you , longer since I ’ve seen you .
All was right in the world .
You were someone else ’s problem now .
But after all these years you call me up ( how the fuck did you get my number anyway ? ) and go off on me because you got another DUI .
Six years ago I turned you in because you came by my house and used your car to shred my front yard because I wanted nothing more to do with your drunken ass .
I called the police , described your condition and your vehicle , you know , maybe I saved a life that night .
They stopped you and made you stumble the line , they arrested you , life was good .
But last night , some six years later , you got another DUI , and it ’s my fault that this is your second offense , because if I had n’t turned you in that first time , six years ago , this would only be your –
Never mind all that .
you know the deal .
After all the bullshit you put us through , all those years ago , you have the unmitigated gall to call me up out of the fucking blue and bitch at me because you got a second DUI ( Driving Under the Influence ) , and somehow I am responsible for that ?
You fucking pickled hag !
You putrid , rusty , cum dumpster !
Have you forgotten that you destroyed lives ?
Have you forgotten that you left innocents dashed against the rocks caused by your wake of Kool - Aid and vodka ( but mostly vodka ) night after night and to the rim tea - glass style ?
Do you remember after I finally had enough and left ?
You decided it would be a great idea to get even with everyone .
So you began your campaign of attrition , spreading your legs for anyone that could clip a clothespin on to keep from blacking out in the fumes of your drunken stupors .
How many countless men with no names ground pounded your asshole until it resembled a butter churn ?
How many nameless puss - predators base - jumped their cock off your numb , drunken lips , tea - bagging their balls off your chin , leaving you no evidence of their presence the next morning save for your still glowing sphincter and the impressive collection of crusty pearl necklaces all over your tits ?
your ass ?
your sheets ?
your pillows ?
Oh how your daughters cried to me after the messy breakup !
How you would stagger around the house in the mornings after another headboard - poundage - marathon , your once beautiful hair looking clearly like someone had used it for a post - fuck cock rag .
How your daughters found rubbers on your bedroom floor , some of them torn open but never used .
I guess you were too caught up in the moment .
They called you on it , your 14 year - old and your 17 year - old .
They staged their own half - assed intervention .
They were concerned .
How you turned on them !
How you talked to them !
Then you would apologize and reduce yourself to a smoldering pile of tears and empty promises , informing them how I had done this to you .
This was my fault for leaving .
For not sticking it out .
You forget I endured your drinking problem for two and a half years .
I was through rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic .
I had to get away from you .
I could n’t help you .
And then the next night after your promises to the girls ?
Second verse , same as the first , bitch .
Just another round of drink guzzling and balls - deep , cunt - flap - bashing Olympics with some guy who was resourceful enough to comment in the bar on how enchanting your blue eyes were .
We both know they are brown , but why hold that against the guy when your root - weary vagina would do ?
Christ , did n’t Nickleback write a fucking song about you ?
An Album ?
You eventually ran your daughters off , best thing for them really , plus it freed up more rooms in the house for your empty bottle collection .
Frankly the phone call I received from you last night was shocking not because it had been so long since I had heard from you , but I seriously doubted that you were still alive .
Then I could n’t believe you had only two DUIs total over the years .
But the absolute worst was that when you called last night , you were drunk !
Look , I know your life is complicated .
I mean , it must be a real bitch having your gag reflex bashed in by some loser ’s cock ring night after night .
But why piss on me ?
It ’s been six fucking years !
How about leave me the fuck alone ?
How about taking some responsibility for your own actions ?
Do you remember what that judge said to you ?
I know the restraining order has surly expired by now , but must I really go get another one ?
What else are you going to blame me for ?
Will it be my fault when your meat curtains drag behind you like a fucking bridal train ?
Will it be my fault when you die from some fucking unfathomable sexually transmitted disease that was formed from the ball - sack - bouillabaisse - C®ock - Pot you call a vagina ?
Will it be my fault when your daughters high - tail it out of town to get away from the rumors spreading like wildfire that their mother is so nasty that her crabs bungee jump from her tampon string ?
Will it be my fault when they lock your ass up for plowing into a school bus full of children because it happened to get in they way of your bee - line to the liquor store , where everybody knows your name ?
Will it be my fault when you lose every job that could be had in this town and the last of your most loyal friends leave you with nothing but the tumbleweed of loneliness and the baron wasteland that was once a respectable woman ?
Will it be my fault that I slam the phone in your face when you ’re twelve - stepping your way through the phone book trying to make amends to everyone you wronged and it ends up costing you so much fucking money in phone bills that you have to take out a second mortgage on your duplex home ?
Forget that you ever knew me , you human sump .
Forget my number and my name just as you have your dignity .
Forget about pinning the blame anywhere but someplace where it takes a mirror to get it on straight .
And the next time two fellas are using you for a human rotisserie , and the guy in the ‘ back door ’ pulls out because of some discomfort and investigates your colon only to find a class ring , a half a pack of Rollo ’s , and a note that says , “ You ’re getting warmer ! ” , and in his disgust dives out the fucking window to his death leaving the other guy to decide if he wants to finish up or puke on your face , do not take so much as a nanosecond to even think about blaming me for any of it .
And I know it ’s been six years , but since I am on a role :
Fuck you with a backwards porcupine for keying my car .
Fuck you with a flaming 747 for filing false police reports in a vain attempt to get me arrested .
Fuck you with a polar bear after being jerked off with a fistful of fish hooks for stalking my family and my new girlfriend ( who is now my wife ) .
Fuck you with your daddy ’s dentures for trying to get me fired from a job I held for nine years by calling the CEO of the fucking company and making up lies .
Fuck you with a rabid , pregnant wolverine ( after being shown pictures of your vagina then beaten ) for forging my signature on credit card applications and leaving my score in ruins .
Fuck you with a flaming copy of ** War and Peace ] / b ] for attempting to use cunt for currency in an attempt to have me killed .
Fuck you with a lit Molotov cocktail for the countless terroristic threats .
Fuck you with a cheese grater dipped in battery acid for turning your children into emotional basket cases .
You got another DUI ?
Could n’t have happened to a nicer person , you fucking jiz - guzzling , monkey - spunk junkie !
I hope the judge locks you up , and breaks the key off in the lock !
Worthless cunt .
BlueCross Secret Memo Re : ' Sicko ' ... " You would have to be dead to be unaffected by Moore 's movie ... "
July 6th , 2007
Friends ,
An employee who works at Capital BlueCross has sent us a confidential memo written and circulated by its Vice President of Corporate Communications , Barclay Fitzpatrick .
His job , it seems , was to go and watch " Sicko , " observe the audience 's reaction , and then suggest a plan of action for how to deal with the movie .
The memo , which I am releasing publicly in this email , is a fascinating look at how one health care company views " Sicko " -- and what it fears its larger impact will be on the public .
The industry 's only hope , the memo seems to indicate , is if the movie " flops . "
Mr. Fitzpatrick writes : " In typical Moore fashion , Government and business leaders are behind a conspiracy to keep the little guy down and dominated while getting rich . "
No .
You do n't say !
That can't be !
BlueCross V.P. Fitzpatrick seems downright depressed about the movie he just saw .
" You would have to be dead to be unaffected by Moore 's movie , " he writes .
" Sicko " leaves audiences feeling " ashamed to be ... a capitalist , and part of a ' me ' society instead of a ' we ' society . "
He walks out of the theater only to witness an unusual sight : people -- strangers -- mingling and talking to each other .
" ' I did n't know they ( the insurers ) did that !' was a common exclamation followed by a discussion of the example , " according to Fitzpatrick .
He then assesses the film 's impact : " [ T ] he impact on small business decision makers , our members , the community , and our employees could be significant .
Ignoring its impact might be a successful strategy only if it flops , but that has not been the history of Moore 's films ...
If popular , the movie will have a negative impact on our image in this community . "
The BlueCross memo then suggests a strategy in dealing with " Sicko " and offers the BCBS " talking points " to be used in discounting the film .
My heartfelt thanks to the employee who sent this to me .
And now a word from me to Capital BlueCross :
How 'bout a debate ?
No more secret memos and hand wringing about the millions seeing " Sicko . "
Just me and your CEO openly debating the merits of a system that kills thousands of innocent Americans every year .
In the meantime , I hope you do n't mind me sharing your thoughts and impressions in your well - written memo .
And if the rest of your executive team has n't seen " Sicko , " it opens in an additional 100 cities tonight for a total of over 700 screens across North America .
Attendance went up a whopping 56 % on the 4th of July , higher than any other film in the theaters right now .
But do n't be scared , and certainly do n't be ashamed to be a capitalist .
Greed is good !
Especially good for you .
There 's nothing like having the pre-existing condition of being rich , should you ever get sick and need help .
Yours ,

After your powerful man lost his job and was no longer powerful you dumped him to prove that you ’re not with him just because he ’s powerful .

An Even More Confusing Presentation of the Two - Income Trap and Taxes :
In my first post on the " two - income trap " and in my Wall Street Journal column , I took note of the peculiar way in which the authors presented their data , which led them to overlook the crucial role of the rise in tax liabilities between the two periods and the impact that has on the average family 's household finances .
When the Warren & Tyagi compare the average family of the 1970s to the 2000s , they present the data on all expenses ( mortgage , cars , health insurance ) in terms of the change in the actual dollar expenditures between the two periods .
The rise in the tax burden , however , is incongruously presented in terms of the percentage of household income dedicated to paying all taxes ( federal , state , and local ) .
Thus , the authors state that the percentage of household income paid in taxes increases from " 24 percent " of household income to " 33 percent " of household income .
As I noted , the difficulty with presenting the data in this manner is that it obscures the underlying dynamic of what is happening in the example .
Adding the second worker increases household income by 75 percent -- this is actually a greater increase than the expenditures on mortgage , automobiles , and health insurance , all of which increase by less than the income growth of 75 percent .
The problem is that total tax obligations over this period increase from about $ 9000 to about $ 22,000 - - an increase of about 140 percent .
Thus , assuming that the authors ' argument is theoretically sound ( a proposition open to question ) it seems clear that the increase in tax obligations is the driving dynamic in their example .
Nonetheless , the authors apparently even confused themselves , as they completely ignore this massive growth in the tax burden on the household budget , even though use the actual dollar values in calculating the " fixed costs " portion of the average family budget .
Apparently this idiosyncratic presentation style confused most readers as well , as even though the book was reviewed and featured in a large number of mainstream media outlets , it appears that none of those commentators observed the growth in the tax burden either .
A list of reviews of the book , with links , is available here .
Fortunately , the authors presented all of the raw figures necessary to convert the percentages to actual dollar values , which made it possible to figure out that the importance of the growth in the tax burden .
Now I see that in May 2007 , Professor Warren provided testimony before the United States Senate Finance Committee on the same topic .
At the hearing , Professor Warren presents all of the data in the book in a different format -- but the end result is that she actually presents the data on taxes in an even more confusing and idiosyncratic style than in the book , making it even more difficult to understand the underlying dynamic .
In her Senate testimony , Professor Warren no longer actually presents the actual dollar values for the changes in expenditures between the two periods .
Instead , she presents the data for everything but taxes in terms of the percentage change in the amount expended by the household on various categories of the household budget .
So , for instance , she reports that the average family now spends " 32 % less " on clothing , " 18 % less " on food , " 52 % less " on appliances , etc. , than the family of a generation ago .
They also spend " 76 % more " on mortgage payments , " 74 % more on health care " and " 52 % more " on automobiles than in the past ( the data here is apparently updated from the presentation in the book ) .
She also notes that families are spending more on electronics , such as DVD players , televisions , and computers .
As before , she then recalibrates all of these percentages into a figure for " fixed costs " and " discretionary expenditures " that actually uses the actual dollar values , rather than these percentages .
Moreover , she never indicates what percentage of the household budget each of these categories comprise , so it is difficult to figure out what impact these percentage changes in isolation have on the overall household budget .
But here 's where it gets confusing .
For each of these other expenditures , she present the percentage change in the actual amount of money the household actually pays for each of these obligations .
If a similar measure were used for taxes , as noted above , it would indicate a massive increase of about 140 % in tax obligations over the relevant period , which would make clear that this increase dwarfs the increase in every other expenditure .
But for the presentation in the change in taxes alone -- Professor Warren presents the change in the " average tax rate " -- the percentage change in the percentage of household income dedicated to paying taxes .
So , under this approach , because tax obligations increase from 24 % of household income to 33 % of household income -- and increase of 9 percentage points -- she reports the change in " the average tax rate " between the two periods as being 25 % .
But had she applied the same methodology to taxes as she does to every other expenditures -- i.e. , the growth in actual household expenditures on various categories of goods and services , rather than the percentage change in the percentage of the household budget dedicated to a particular category of expenditures -- the " apples to apples " comparison in the have been about 140 % , not 25 % .
If she applied to the other categories of expenditures the same methodology she applied to taxes ( the percentage change in the percentage of the budget dedicated to those expenditures ) , then each would have actually declined or stayed approximately the same as a percentage of household income than previously , so they would be either zero or negative , while taxes would have increased by 25 % .
Instead , she presents a true apples to oranges comparison with absolutely no resemblance to one other for purposes of comparison .
In fact , this confusion leads to a misreporting of the data in Figure 3 of her testimony , which is labeled " Median Family Spending by Category , Percent Change , 1972 - 2005 . "
She does in fact reporting the percent change in " family spending " for each of the other categories , she does not do so for taxes .
But what is reported for taxes quite plainly is not the percent change in spending on taxes -- it is the percent change in the percentage of the household budget dedicated to paying taxes , a completely different and unrelated number .
I do n't know why all of this is presented in the way it is , but it does n't make any sense to me .
Presumably Professor Warren understands that the data she reports for taxes is not based on the same methodology as for all expenditures .
And I assume that she is aware that the change in the " median family spending " on the category of taxes is actually about 140 % , not 25 % , such that the number reported in her Figure 3 is incorrect .
More fundamentally , I do n't understand why it is thought useful to put any expenditure in terms of the percentage change in the percentage of the household budget dedicated to a given category expenditure .
And if that is useful , why would it be useful only for reporting taxes but not for any other category of expenditures ?
Perhaps there is some logical reason why it makes sense to present the data in this peculiar and heterogeneous fashion .
But if so , it is not obvious to me .
As a result , it makes even more difficult to understand what is going on than even the original presentation , which already seemed to have been confusing to most readers ( and perhaps even the authors themselves ) .
I just do n't understand why this one obligation - - taxes -- is consistently presented in a unique fashion that invariably makes it more difficult to understand what is going on with that expenditure from the household budget and thus to understand how the change in the tax burden compares to the changes in the burdens of other expenditures .
And in fact , it seems likely that the average Senate Finance Committee member or staffer would be likely to look at this presentation and be misled into concluding that the increase in the tax burden is a relatively small part of the overall change in the household financial burden , when in fact it is the largest change .
Furthermore , unlike the previous presentation of the data , where one could at least replicate what was going based on the information provided ( however obscurely ) , in this iteration the actual dollar values expended on various budget items are never presented , nor are the percentages of the household budget dedicated to certain expenditure categories ( which would allow one to back out those values from the total income figures which are presented ) .
In fact , from what I can tell , Professor Warren never even presents in her testimony the 24 % and 33 % figures for the percentage of the family budget dedicated to taxes , which I had to infer from her book that was where her new 25 % figure of the percentage change in the percentage of income dedicated to tax payments is coming from .
As a result , it is unclear in her testimony exactly how much the tax obligations rise , but the underlying expenditures on taxes seem to be basically the same as the original data on this score .
By suggesting that the increase in household expenditures on taxes is only 25 % , rather than its actual increase in value of about 140 % -- Professor Warren 's testimony unfortunately leaves the Senate with the impression that the growth in tax obligations is much smaller than the growth in categories such as mortgage and health care expenses , when in fact the growth in taxes is much , much larger and more important .
Whatever the rationale for reporting the data in this fashion it appears to have once again confused the logical policy recommendations that follow .
Professor Warren recommends five types of policy responses to her version of the " two - income trap , " that range from the affordability of health care and college education , to improvements in education and public schools , and a novel proposal for government " safety regulation for credit products . "
All of these may or may not be sensible ideas , but they seem like they'd have a relatively minor impact on this particular problem when compared to the elephant in the room -- taxes .
This is especially so given that government at all levels could do something about the tax burden much more easily , with greater direct impact , and with fewer unintended consequences than trying to address these more difficult social problems .
Because Professor Warren either does not recognize or for some reason simply chose not to report the massive contribution of increased taxes to the overall household budget crunch , none of her policy recommendations address the dramatically increased tax burden , which as we have seen , is the underlying factor driving the whole two - income ( tax ) trap .
Moreover , it goes without saying that if the average tax burden had increased at the same rate as income during this period ( 75 % instead of 140 % ) , then this would provide a huge amount of money for savings , for college , to pay for a home , or to pay for the other household expenses she enumerates .
Or , at least , tax reform seems like it is worthwhile to at least consider in this context .
More generally , I still do n't really understand why this data is presented in such a heterogeneous and confusing manner , especially when it consistently leads to confusion about what it actually demonstrates .
Furthermore , this confusion results in policy recommendations that do n't seem to follow from what the data actually show .
It seems like it would be more effective to just pick a uniform presentation format and use that for all of the numbers , thereby permitting a more transparent comparison among them .

There was no time for social niceties , table manners or even a please and thank you .
When little pigs insist on stopping for lunch , there 's nothing much a mother on the move can do .
This sow and her litter had been roaming the New Forest in Hampshire when the youngsters decided it was time to tuck in .
Scroll down for more ...
Rather than battle the might of a half dozen little squealers , she pulled up in the middle of the road and let them have lunch .
Motorists were forced to wait , with tailbacks stretching along the road .
Roaming pigs are a common sight this time of year as the pannage season gets under way , an ancient custom which allows pig farmers to turn their animals on to Crown land for up to 60 days of grazing .
" The sow was feeding her piglets in the middle of the road and there was no way of moving her , " said Bernie Bedford , a local doctor who took the picture .
Dr Bedford , of Hythe , near Southampton , said : " I was driving along the B3079 Bramshaw to Landford road when I turned a bend and suddenly saw this amazing sight .
" Local radio even broadcast a warning that the pigs were a traffic hazard on that road .
" Cars had to carefully crawl around her but it was n't easy . "
That is just one of the questions hovering over a handful of similar sightings at political events in Washington and New York .
Some suspect the insect - like drones are high - tech surveillance tools , perhaps for the Department of Homeland Security .
No agency admits to having deployed insect - size spy drones , though several US Government departments say they are trying .
But several federally funded teams are growing live insects with computer chips in them , with the aim of mounting spyware on their bodies .
The robobugs could follow suspects , guide missiles to targets or navigate collapsed buildings to find survivors .
The technical challenges of creating robotic insects are daunting , and most experts doubt that fully working models exist yet .
" If you find something , let me know , " said Gary Anderson of the Defence Department 's Rapid Reaction Technology Office .
But the CIA secretly developed a simple dragonfly snooper in the 1970s .
And given recent advances , even sceptics say there is a chance that some agency has quietly managed to make something operational .
" America can be pretty sneaky , " said Tom Ehrhard , a retired air force colonel and expert in unmanned aerial vehicles who is now at the Centre for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments , a Washington - based research institute .
Pentagon documents describe nearly 100 different models of robotic fliers in use today , some as tiny as birds , and some the size of small planes .
The nation 's fleet of flying robots logged more than 160,000 flight hours last year - a fourfold increase since 2003 .
A recent report by the US Army Command and General Staff College warned that if traffic rules are not clarified soon , the glut of unmanned vehicles " could render military air space chaotic and potentially dangerous " .
But getting from bird size to insect size is not a simple matter of making everything smaller .
" You can't make a conventional robot of metal and ball bearings and just shrink the design down , " said Ronald Fearing , a roboticist at the University of California at Berkeley .
For one thing , the rules of aerodynamics change at very tiny scales and require wings that flap in precise ways - a huge engineering challenge .
Scientists have only recently come to understand how insects fly .
The CIA was among the first to tackle the problem .
The " insectothopter " , developed by the agency 's Office of Research and Development 30 years ago , looked like a dragonfly and contained a tiny petrol engine to make the four wings flap .
It flew but was ultimately declared a failure because it could not handle crosswinds .
An agency spokesman , George Little , would not talk about what the CIA may have done since then .
The Office of the Director of National Intelligence , the Department of Homeland Security and the Secret Service also declined to discuss the topic .
But the Defence Department researchers are experimenting with putting computer chips into moth pupae - the intermediate stage between a caterpillar and a flying adult - and hatching them into healthy " cyborg moths " .
The Hybrid Insect Micro-Electro-Mechanical
Systems project aims to create camera - toting insects whose nerves have grown into their internal silicon chip so that wranglers can control their activities .
Even if the technical hurdles are overcome , insect - size fliers will always be risky investments .
" They can get eaten by a bird , they can get caught in a spider web , " Professor Fearing said .
The protesters probably saw dragonflies , said Jerry Louton , an entomologist at the National Museum of Natural History .
Washington is home to some large , spectacularly adorned dragonflies that " can knock your socks off " , he said .
But , he added , some details do not make sense .
The eyewitnesses all reported seeing at least three dragonflies manoeuvring in unison .
" Dragonflies never fly in a pack , " he said .

Star quarterback Michael Vick 's guilty plea on dog fighting charges has shone a light on a vicious blood sport that appears to be thriving in the US .
Pit bulls can suffer serious injuries or die in the ring ( image : Peta )
Evidence gathered by animal welfare groups suggests that , despite the fact dog fighting is illegal in all 50 US states , it is both widespread and growing .
An estimated 40,000 people in the US are thought to be involved in " professional " dog fighting , using some 250,000 dogs .
These dog fighters train their pit bull terriers for maximum aggression before putting them in the ring to fight matches , publicised by underground networks .
Crowds watch and often place bets as the dogs , their jaws trained to grip ferociously hard , seek to tear each other apart for an hour or more .
As much as $ 100,000 ( £ 50,000 ) can be staked on a fight between champion dogs , according to the Humane Society of the United States .
The dog that wins will live to fight again .
But the loser is likely either to die from blood loss , shock and injury , or be killed by its owner as no longer profitable .
Meanwhile , tens of thousands more people - often gang members - take part in so - called street fighting , where dogs are pitted against each other in impromptu bouts in alleys or empty buildings .
Dogs ' executed '
Court papers in Vick 's case expose some of the brutality involved in a practice that seems to be concentrated in America 's South and eastern states .
Michael Vick has agreed a plea deal on dog- fighting charges
The American footballer and three others , all of whom have agreed plea deals , are accused of running an organised dog fighting operation called Bad Newz Kennels over several years .
When Vick 's property in Virginia was raided , 54 pit bull terriers were found , some with apparent dog fighting injuries , as well as training equipment like a treadmill and a stick used to pry open dogs ' jaws .
The men took their prize dogs across state lines for matches on which thousands of dollars were wagered , court documents say .
Vick has denied betting on the fights but admits bankrolling them .
Three of the men , including Vick , also " executed " several dogs that did not perform well in training , by hanging , drowning , electrocution and slamming them to the ground .
Animal welfare groups point out that the 54 dogs found by the authorities will almost certainly have to be put down too .
Although properly - raised pit bull terriers can make good pets , according to reputable Georgia breeder Tara Vickers , fighting dogs - having been trained to attack other animals - are impossible to re-house safely .
In the UK , the breeding , sale or exchange of pit bull terriers is banned under the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 and people who already own pit bulls must keep them muzzled and on a lead in public .
Gang culture
No - one knows what motivated 27 - year - old Vick , with his multi-million dollar American football contract , to venture into the murky world of dog fighting .
Dog fighting has become popular in gang culture
John Goodwin
Humane Society of the United States
But there is evidence to suggest that its growth nationally is related to its adoption as a part of violent street culture .
John Goodwin , an expert on animal fighting for the Humane Society , says one way to track the prevalence of dog fighting is to monitor the number of pit bulls coming into animal rescue shelters .
Whereas 15 years ago 2 - 3 % of the dogs brought in were pit bulls , the breed now makes up 30 % of the total nationally and 50 % in some areas , he said .
One shelter in Mississippi reported taking in 300 pit bulls , of which 60 % had scars indicating they had fought .
" Urban areas are where a lot of the growth has been and the shelters get inundated with the castaways from dog fighting , " Mr Goodwin said .
" Dog fighting has become popular in gang culture . "
He cites a study by the Chicago Police Department , which found that of 332 people arrested over three years for dog fighting and animal cruelty , three - fifths had known gang affiliations .
Of course , many pit bulls , particularly in the rural South , do not make it into shelters , Mr Goodwin adds , because the owners simply kill them if they are no longer of use .
Pumped with steroids
Life as a fighting dog is neither pleasant nor long , according to investigations by animal welfare groups such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals ( Peta ) and the Humane Society .
Professional dog fighters spend months training their dogs to fight
Pit bull puppies bred by an organised operation will be taunted to make them more vicious and kept chained and hungry .
They will be forced to run on treadmills with " bait " animals such as cats dangled in front of them - the reward usually being to maul them afterwards - and encouraged to hang by their jaws from chains to strengthen their bite .
Their strength built up , they then progress to " test " fights against older animals .
Only the young dogs that display sufficient aggression and " gameness " - the willingness to carry on fighting even when exhausted and bleeding - will be used in competitive matches .
The others are usually culled .
The fights , staged in a small , square enclosed pit , can last an hour or more .
Some breeders cut off their dogs ' ears so that rivals cannot bite onto them , file their teeth to make them sharper and pump them with steroids , said Dahpna Nachminovitch , of Peta .
While the dogs keep winning , they can earn their owners thousands of dollars in gambling profits and by producing puppies with a " desirable " bloodline .
But pit bulls that lose or give up in the ring will not normally live long , either dying from their injuries or being despatched by their owners .
' Power and control '
So how do dog fighters justify the suffering caused to their animals ?
Causing an animal suffering is about power , experts say ( image : Peta )
Dr Randall Lockwood , a psychologist and senior vice president of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals , says that historically dog fighters did not see the dogs as sentient , feeling creatures , but did profess to care for them .
However , he says , there seems to have been a shift recently towards more brutal and vengeful treatment of the animals as dog fighting has been increasingly adopted by gang culture .
" Part of the psychology of dog fighting is the same as other forms of animal cruelty - a lot of it is about power and control , " he said .
Add to this the dog fighter 's identification with his animal in the ring - and desire to win " bragging rights " - and the scope for violence is great .
" The dog fighter sees his dog 's victory as having a direct reflection on his strength and manliness , which I think is one of the reasons that we see brutal treatment of animals that do n't perform well , " Dr Lockwood said .
" The failure of the animal is seen as a personal failure , an embarrassment , and something where you need to prove your strength and dominance by getting even . "
Strong penalties
Those convicted of dog fighting in the US face up to five years in prison and a possible $ 250,000 fine .
But the problem for the authorities is tracking down either the secretive organised networks or the individuals involved in street fights .
Law enforcement officials are cracking down on dog fighting , in part because of frequent links to drugs and other organised crime , said Mr Goodwin .
But the entertainment some find in its brutality - and more importantly the money involved - still make it irresistible to many people .
" If you have $ 100,000 bet on two grand champion dogs that are fighting , someone is going to win big and someone is going to lose big , " Mr Goodwin said .
" But there is a potential for financial gain - that 's why there have to be strong penalties there to discourage people . "

Religion Briefs Coalition of nuns calls for impeaching Bush and Cheney
JOURNAL WIRE REPORT
A progressive group of U.S. nuns has called on Congress to impeach President Bush and Vice President Cheney because of their roles in the war in Iraq .
“ The National Coalition of American Nuns is impelled by conscience to call you to act promptly to impeach President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney for … high crimes and misdemeanors , ”  the group wrote in a letter written on behalf of its board members .
The letter says that impeachment is warranted for their “ deceiving the public under the false pretense that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction ”  and “ destroying ”  the reputation of the United States and the good will of other nations .
“ The time for impeachment is now — before the example of George W. Bush ’s regime is set in stone , ”  they wrote .
“ Future generations will thank you for preserving the freedom of our nation and its relation to the entire human community . ” 

Those of you who have followed the literature examining potential connections between violent video games and real - world violence know that the evidence for such a connection is pretty tenuous .
Studies purporting to show such a connection appear on a regular basis , often alternating with other studies that suggest that the connection is illusory .
If it 's any consolation , researchers in the field find the contradictory results just as confusing as you do , and some have called for efforts to be focused on understanding the reasons underlying the confusion .
A paper that 's in press at Psychology , Crime & Law claims to have accomplished just that .
The authors of the study note that the literature contains a combination of studies that show a connection between aggression and violent games , others that showed no such connection , and a few studies showing that gaming reduced aggression .
They claim that their study is unique in that it considers the possibility that these represent three distinct responses to gaming , and suggest that prior studies may have produced conflicting results by trying to shoehorn these into a binary classification .
They designed a study in which measures of anger levels acted as a proxy for violent behavior .
They recruited 135 children , but were forced to kick some out of the study due to bad behavior , leaving them with about 110 boys and 15 girls with a mean age of 14.6 years , all of them familiar with the game of choice , Quake II .
The children were given personality profile tests and measured for anger levels , at which point they were set loose for 20 minutes of gaming .
Anger levels were measured again following the gaming session .
Crunching the numbers indicated that there were three clear groups .
The anger levels of 77 of the subjects remained unchanged after the gaming session .
In 22 of the subjects , anger levels nearly doubled from a starting point similar to that of the unaffected children .
But 8 of the test subjects started out at this high anger level ; for them , 20 minutes of gaming dropped them down to levels similar to those seen in the unaffected group .
The research team then correlated these groups with the personality profiles , and an clear pattern emerged .
Those with personalities that were scored as stable largely wound up in the unaffected group , while the remaining two groups were populated by personalities that were considered less stable .
The authors propose that gamers fall into two groups : stable personalities , and those with emotional states that are susceptible to being influenced by game play .
Within the latter group , the response to violent games largely depends on the emotional states of the gamers when they begin play .
Angry gamers will cool off , calm gamers will get agitated .
They also note that only two of the cases of rising anger reached levels that would be considered cause for concern , suggesting that dangerous levels of anger were rarely triggered by gaming .
The authors made it clear that their study should not be viewed as the final word on the matter .
The link between anger and aggression is far from clear , and they would like to see similar results reproduced with other test groups and using different games and experimental setups .
It 's also worth noting that they attempted to measure a wide range of additional factors during their study , but many of these measurements produced statistically insignificant or contradictory results .
Nevertheless , the study appears to be significant in that it is the first I 've seen that attempts to move beyond adding to the large body of confusing results that already exists , and instead tries to identify the reason that it 's so easy to produce contradictory findings in the first place .

SYDNEY , Australia –
In the 1960s film The Graduate , a meddling family friend takes aimless collegiate Ben aside to proffer unwanted career advice : " plastics . "
More than 30 years later , the planet is choking on the stuff – plastic packaging in particular .
With green consciousness now taking root from Boston to Bangalore , the new hot career tip might be : " biodegradable plastics . "
The business involves using non petroleum - based commercial wrappings that look , feel and act like traditional plastic , but break down later into organic components .
One example is starch - based packaging , generally made from agricultural commodities such as corn or potatoes .
These dissolve in prolonged contact with water and heat .
However , if you 're hoping you can toss your disposable plastics into the shower and watch them disappear any time soon , you 'll be disappointed .
Most biodegradable packaging takes weeks , often months , to break down .
Furthermore , eco-friendly packaging probably needs a few more years , and a few more breakthroughs , before it 's ready for prime time .
Nonetheless , early birds are staking out positions .
Earthshell of Santa Barbara , California , now provides biodegradable packaging to fast - food giant McDonald's , as well as selling biodegradable picnic utensils .
These are all made from a proprietary mixture of limestone and potato starch .
Others players – which include Minneapolis - based Cargill Dow LLC ; Novamont SpA of Novara , Italy ; and the German BASF Group – provide biodegradable packaging that is based largely on corn starch .
These companies and others are being drawn to a global market now estimated at about $ 25 billion a year .
A key testing ground for biodegradable packaging was the 2000 Sydney Summer Olympics .
Thanks to pre-Games pressure from environmental groups , food vendors for the Games used only biodegradable and recyclable packaging .
More than three - quarters of the 660 tons of garbage generated each day at the Games was kept out of landfill , with much of it composted instead .
But that was the Olympics , the ultimate controlled environment .
The challenge now is for biodegradable plastics to succeed in the chaotic real world , closing a roughly 2 - to - 1 price gap with traditional packaging .
The good news is that consumers and most businesses are keen on greenery .
The bad news is they do n't want to pay anything more for it .
Without government mandates , this price differential is likely to hinder the spread of biodegradable packaging in the short - term .
" I figure it will be at least five years before fully biodegradable packaging becomes really widespread , " says Leo Hyde , research and development manager for DuPont Australia .
" Without legislation to help it along , this packaging will just have to be price competitive . "
DuPont 's entry in the race is a water - soluble form of the more traditional recyclable material polyethylene terephthalate .
Meanwhile , Melbourne 's Plantic Technologies is commercializing a form of corn starch - based biodegradable plastic packaging , which it claims will break down into carbon dioxide and sugar in as little as an hour after contact with water , says David MacInnes , Plantic 's managing director and chief executive .
If the company can deliver , it really would pass the " shower " test .
But it 's too soon to know , and the company has no firm contracts .
Nonetheless , research points to the emergence over time of a viable , biodegradable packaging industry offering competitive prices .
Some researchers already assert that biodegradable packaging is price - competitive when environmental costs such as greenhouse gas emissions , energy usage in production and total life - cycle costs are properly accounted for .
For instance , some corn-derived food packaging requires almost one - third less non-renewable energy to produce than packaging made from conventional sources such as petroleum - based polypropylene , according to Greg Bohlman , assistant director of the Process Economics Program at SRI consulting , a technology markets consulting firm in Menlo Park , California .
While environmentalists are cheering the market on , they add that further work needs to be done to reduce the environmental costs of biodegradable packaging .
These include developing ways to create packaging from agricultural waste rather than actual crops and reducing pesticide and chemical use in its production .
But greenies do believe that biodegradable packaging is a big step forward from the nasty status quo .
" They can't be any worse than wrappings such PVC ( poly - vinyl chloride ) , which basically is just a bunch of toxic chemicals , " said Matt Ruchel , a toxics campaigner for Greenpeace in Sydney , Australia .
PVCs are a common element in robust plastics such as plumbing piping .
But derivatives are used in such things as moisture - proof clear plastic wraps .
One ace that the starch - based biodegradable packaging industry may have up its sleeve is the relative price stability of commodities such as corn and potatoes compared to the volatile price of petroleum .
Another added benefit may be that you could – if you really had to – eat biodegradable packaging .
" It 's unlikely to taste very good , but it wo n't kill you , " McInnes said .
" And it could keep you alive – at least for a short time . "
Official Air Force document outlines military assistance to insurgencies Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday August 23 , 2007
Print This Email This The Air Force is ready to aid insurgencies .
According to a lengthy new Air Force document , which outlines US strategies for " Irregular Warfare , " military resources will sometimes be needed to help insurgencies in foreign countries .
The 103 - page document , published earlier this month , takes lessons from the last six years of fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan to outline Air Force policies in " a violent struggle among state and non-state actors for legitimacy and influence over the relevant populations . "
Secrecy News first reported on the document .
Gen. T. Michael Mosely , the Air Force 's chief of staff , observes the document is meant to be " broad , enduring , and forward - looking , rather than focusing on any particular operation , current or past . "
Much of the document outlines US Air Force policies in helping allies fight insurgencies to maintain stability within their countries , but the document acknowledges that in some instances the US may side with non-state guerrilla groups .
In the types of asymmetrical conflicts outlined in the Air Force Doctrine Document 2 - 3 , US government organizations may need to " recruit , organize , train , and advise indigenous guerrilla or partisan forces . "
Counterinsurgency is not the military 's only objective .
" Given certain risk factors and political considerations , the Air Force may help non-US aviation assets conduct special air operations supporting indigenous / surrogate surface forces , " the document observes in a section on " Support to Insurgencies .
" In some UW ( unconventional warfare ) operations , the use of US military aircraft may be inappropriate , tactically or politically .
In those cases , training , advising , and assisting the aviation forces of insurgent groups , resistance organizations , or third - country nationals may be the only viable option . "
The document focuses solely on Air Force policies for irregular warfare , but implies the same strategies would be used by other branches of the military and government agencies .
" The complex nature of IW requires the combined capabilities of all military services , government agencies , and partner nations , " the document observes .
" While this document focuses on Air Force doctrine , IW is inherently a joint and inter-agency fight . "
IMAGINE getting inside the mind of a shark : swimming silently through the ocean , sensing faint electrical fields , homing in on the trace of a scent , and navigating through the featureless depths for hour after hour .
We may soon be able to do just that via electrical probes in the shark ’s brain .
Engineers funded by the US military have created a neural implant designed to enable a shark ’s brain signals to be manipulated remotely , controlling the animal ’s movements , and perhaps even decoding what it is feeling .
That team is among a number of groups around the world that have gained ethical …
Rossel ’s father , a suit importer , was killed while packing the family ’s belongings into cars to move out of Dora , an area in southern Baghdad controlled by Sunni Islamists .
The Muhammads were never able to return , though a kindly neighbor drove their car to them in their new , mostly Shiite , neighborhood in Baghdad .
They lost their past — photograph albums , diaries and heirlooms .
Not everyone in the family wanted to know what happened to the house , but Rossel was told that a Sunni family she did not know had moved in .
“ I try to imagine my room and what they do in it , ” she said , her voice intense .
Rasheed Hameed , a Sunni Kurd , was forced out of his house this summer in Baya , another southern neighborhood , and moved his family to safety in Syria .
Back in Baghdad , he saved some of his furniture with the help of neighbors who have militia connections .
His dresser , kitchen chest and bed frame stood awkwardly in a courtyard at his new house on Friday .
Inside , several large printing machines sat like giant unwanted guests , the property of a previous owner .
“ They destroyed all my life , ” Mr. Hameed said , gesturing at the furniture .
“ For what ?
We do n’t know .
What is our crime ? ”
Early in the war , it was extremely rare that an Iraqi would know his or her attacker , but as time went on the violence moved closer to home .
In the Karbala study , 47 percent of families said that their neighbors were directly or indirectly responsible for their flight .
The men who tipped off the killer of Rossel ’s father lived in the neighborhood and were working as movers for the family on the day he was shot .
Omar , an 18 - year - old Sunni who withheld his family name for his safety , said that as Shiites took over his neighborhood in western Baghdad , childhoods spent together seemed never to have existed .
Now he and his cousins change the subject when old Shiite friends walk past his stoop .
Safe topics : electricity , girls and soccer .
“ It ’s true we used to play with them , ” he said , “ but we could n’t read what was inside their hearts . ”
The Everest FAQ Answers [ CLICK FOR INDEX ] 1 . )
How do you go to the bathroom ?
Many of us were schooled in such matters at a fairly young age by our parents and we 've tried to deviate as little as possible over the years from the old family traditions .
At Base Camp and ABC ( Advanced Base Camp ) , we 've found that a good way of keeping things neat is to build a single latrine ( perhaps a ditch for the waste and a set of rock walls for privacy and wind protection ) with a plywood cover and seat arrangement .
Within easy reach , we often place a substantial cardboard box with a slot in it for paper deposits .
This is an effort toward keeping down the " white man 's prayer flags " as the Sherpas call TP fluttering around in the windy Base Camp .
At the trip 's end , we will burn the latrine with kerosene for a day or two and then bury it .
The box of paper , if it has not been stolen by some misguided Tibetan box collector , is burned as well .
At ABC , some teams are now working to figure a system whereby barrels of waste can be yakked down to Base Camp as the burning at ABC is not always very practical .
In any case , concentrating the waste is the important thing .
In the higher camps ... it is n't really much fun to think about .
Urination is usually straightforward ... ponder that .
The other is a bit more complex .
The best thing is to just go about once a day .
In a perfect world , that would be a little after breakfast , after the boots are on and before the climbing harness gets threaded , on a nice calm sunny morning .
In the Third World , however , the reality might well be an overpowering need to go just before you are fully awake , or perhaps when you are working a dicey bit of cliff face without a rope ... or let 's suppose that you are profoundly moved during a raging snowstorm at 27,000 feet .
How do you go then ?
In the words of a famous sporting ad campaign , you ... just do it .
With a little experience , you will have learned to wait until the last possible moment ... you will have on gear with compatible openings for such maneuvers ( only a rank ... so to speak ... beginner would combine a horseshoe zipper on his down suit with a crotch zipper on his pile suit with a drop seat on his one - piece long underwear .
Things need to match up . )
You will remember that tidy elimination is not worth dying for and so you wo n't hop urgently from your tent onto a steep and snowy slope without proper footwear and possibly a rope to hold onto .
You will not give a rat 's ass who is watching your progress ( nobody ) , and you will do your best to get the waste down a steep uninhabited slope ( flat rock ... toss it carefully ) or into a crevasse ( direct deposit ... you are a good sport , or shoveled in for the faint of heart ) .
Above all ... you will keep your sense of humor when things go awry in this department .
When you try to pee in a 50 mile an hour swirling wind and you find that nearly every drop has found its way back onto your high - tech outerwear , your goggles and your coolest looking hat , you will smile , brush off what you can , thank your lucky stars that you did n't freeze anything that might be useful in courting rituals or matrimony in the unimaginably distant future , then get back in your tent and start laughing at your partner .
You 've gotten it over with , he or she is nursing a full pee-bottle , a full bladder and a foolish belief that the storm will end soon .
People that do n't climb invariably think that this bathroom thing is a big deal .
Particularly for women climbers , they figure it must be some embarrassing and horribly uncomfortable exercise .
For some it might be , but those people do n't climb very long after they experience such humiliation and tribulation ( on a cheap mountain close to home if they are smart . )
They can take up bowling or billiards or some such extreme sport with access to his and hers , modern , well lit and private commodes .
For the rest of us , men and women alike , elimination is just one of a number of discomforts and chores that do n't come anywhere near to compromising or defining our love of the mountains .

EVEREST FAQ
The 660 - tonne church , built 750 years ago , is being moved so that coal deposits beneath it can be mined .
The church has been lifted from its foundations and lowered onto a rolling wooden base that is expected to reach the nearby village of Borna next week .
Heuersdorf 's residents are also being relocated to make way for the mine .
The village 's 59 inhabitants earlier lost a legal battle to prevent the Mibrag company from building its mine .
The firm agreed to move the church in order to secure the right to mine under the village , near the city of Leipzig in what used to be East Germany .
A spokeswoman for Mibrag told AFP news agency the church is expected to arrive at its new home on 31 October .
The cost for the project is estimated to be 3 m euros ( $ 4.2 m ; £ 2 m ) .
Heuersdorf was built atop large deposits of lignite , a type of brown coal used to fuel power plants .
There are more subtle touches , too , like the wider spacing of the keys on a new Sony ultraportable computer notebook that goes on sale next week .
It accommodates the longer fingernails that women tend to have .
Some of the latest cellphones made by LG Electronics have the cameras ’ automatic focus calibrated to arms ’ length .
The company observed that young women are fond of taking pictures of themselves with a friend .
Men , not so much .
Nikon and Olympus recently introduced lines of lighter , more compact and easy - to - use digital single - lens - reflex cameras that were designed with women in mind because they tend to be a family ’s primary keeper of memories .
The Nikon D40X is 20 percent smaller than a standard Nikon digital S.L.R. camera and can be easily carried around the neck or slipped into a handbag .
It has many of the automated features normally found on a point - and - shoot camera like preset shooting modes .
Camera makers wanted to reach the female market with digital S.L.R. cameras because they carry a higher profit margin than the point - and - shoot models .
The consumer electronics industry has generally come to accept the fairly obvious : many , perhaps most , electronic products are meant for the home and the home is largely controlled by women , whether or not men and children live there , said Robert F. Gee , vice president for marketing at Coby Electronics , based in Queens .
“ Women are becoming more of the decision makers , ” Mr. Gee said .
“ When large - screen TVs first came out it was all about sports .
Now it ’s much more about features used in seeing movies .
Women are a big part of that audience and the designs are reflecting that . ”
Coby has begun to speak more directly to women by advertising some of its products , like a portable dual - screen DVD player for the car , in Cosmopolitan magazine .
JERUSALEM , Oct. 28 — Israeli officials said today that Israel had begun reducing fuel supplies to Gaza and had closed down one of the two crossings through which food , medicine and other supplies pass into the strip , in line with a recent government decision to respond with sanctions to continued rocket fire from the Hamas - run territory .
Shlomo Dror , a spokesman for the Coordinator of Activities in the Territories , the Israeli agency that oversees supplies to Gaza , said the plan was to reduce the amount of fuel by 5 to 11 percent .
He said that the industrial fuel needed to operate the Gaza power plant would not be affected , but that there would be cuts in the supply of benzene , which is mostly for private use , and diesel , which is mostly used for public transportation and service vehicles .
Mr. Dror said that the Sufa crossing had been closed , leaving the Kerem Shalom crossing in the south as the only point of entry for goods into the strip .
The main commercial crossing on the Gaza - Israel border , Karni , has been closed since the militant Islamic group Hamas took over Gaza in June .
Hamas routedthe Fatah forces there , including the elite Presidential Guard that used to secure the Palestinian side of the border crossings , by agreement with Israel .
The Rafah crossing on the Gaza - Egypt border has also been formally closed since June .
In previously undisclosed details in the government ’s final report , the Iraqi police documented that Blackwater guards shot in almost every direction , killing or wounding people in a near 360 - degree circle around Nisour Square .
The thick file amassed for the investigation asserts that bullets reached bystanders who were as far as 200 feet away and nearly on the opposite side of the square .
The police investigation also shows that a second shooting , in which one person was killed and two wounded , occurred about 600 feet from the initial one on the opposite side of the square , along the departure route that the Blackwater team took from the first shooting .
Although American diplomats have worked with personal security companies for most of the time since the American invasion in March 2003 , it appears that State Department officials only now have started to thoroughly look at every aspect of the relationship .
As part of that effort , Patrick Kennedy , who heads the State Department ’s team reviewing the relationship with personal security companies , met in recent days with the private security industry in Iraq .
He posed nearly 20 questions to representatives of the firms that make clear that American diplomats have been largely in the dark about some of the most basic procedures of the people who protect them .
A list of the questions was provided by a participant .
Using abbreviations for the Department of State and personal security company , among the questions he posed were : “ Do we provide weapons for P.S.C.’s ?
Does the D.O.S. travel outside the Green Zone too much ?
What is the ultimate method of discipline for P.S.C. individuals ? ”
“ They were in complete receive mode the entire time , ” said an American official after meeting with Mr. Kennedy and his colleagues .
“ They were saying , ‘ Tell me more , tell me more , tell me more . ’”
Many shops have had empty shelves for months
" It is now clear that Zimbabwe 's crisis has reached the tipping point , " the MDC 's spokesman , Nelson Chamisa , told the South African Press Association .
But Central Bank governor Gideon Gono has promised to end what he called the " anarchy " resulting from instructions to firms to halve their prices .
There have been acute food shortages since the policy was imposed in June .
Businesses were ordered to slash some products by at least 50 % or freeze prices for items such as bread and milk .
Maize rise
" Of what use are cheap goods when they are not available ? "
AFP news agency quotes Mr Gono as telling a press conference in the capital , Harare .
Mr Gono said he was working with manufacturers to refill the empty shelves in shops .
" There is going to be return to normalcy , but in an environment that respects the viability of producers of goods and services and we must not be tempted to go back to the anarchy of the last three months , " he said .
The Consumer Council of Zimbabwe has said has been a 30 % rise in the cost of living for a family of six in the last month .
The latest CCZ inflation figures , published in Zimbabwe 's state - run Herald newspaper , also show a 222 % rise in the cost of the staple maize meal .
Zimbabwe 's annual inflation is nearly 8,000 % - the highest in the world .
Meanwhile , news reports on the ZimOnline website say the call by Mr Gono to stop farm invasions , blamed for Zimbabwe 's economic downturn , continues to be ignored .
Much of Zimbabwe relies on food imports and handouts from international humanitarian groups because of the failure to maintain production on farms .
" The central doctrine of Christianity , then , is not that God is a bastard .

So says the New York Times :
Broad new surveillance powers approved by Congress this month could allow the Bush administration to conduct spy operations that go well beyond wiretapping to include — without court approval — certain types of physical searches on American soil and the collection of Americans ’ business records , Democratic Congressional officials and other experts said .
Administration officials acknowledged that they had heard such concerns from Democrats in Congress recently , and that there was a continuing debate over the meaning of the legislative language .
But they said the Democrats were simply raising theoretical questions based on a harsh interpretation of the legislation .
They also emphasized that there would be strict rules in place to minimize the extent to which Americans would be caught up in the surveillance .
The dispute illustrates how lawmakers , in a frenetic , end - of - session scramble , passed legislation they may not have fully understood and may have given the administration more surveillance powers than it sought .
The Amazonian wilderness is at risk of unprecedented damage from an ambitious plan to improve transport , communications and power generation in the region , conservationists warned yesterday .
Development plans have been drawn up to boost trade links between 10 economic hubs on the continent , but threaten to bring " a perfect storm of environmental destruction " to the world 's oldest rainforest , according to a report from Conservation International .
Projects to upgrade road and river transport , combined with work to create dams and lay down extensive power and communications cabling , will open up previously inaccessible parts of the rainforest , raising the risk of widespread deforestation that could see the loss of the entire Amazon jungle within 40 years , the environmental group said .
Tim Killeen , a scientist with Conservation International , examined the projects funded under the multinational government - backed Initiative for the Integration of the Regional Infrastructure of South America ( IIRSA ) .
He found that the environmental impact of individual projects had often been well assessed , but there had been a failure to look at their collective impact on the region .
Part of the planned improvements will see motorway - style roads built from the Andes , across the Amazon to the Cerrado tropical savannah , linking the Pacific to the Atlantic .
" Failure to foresee the full impact of IIRSA investments , particularly in the context of climate change and global markets , will bring about a combination of forces that could lead to a perfect storm of environmental destruction , " Dr Killeen said .
Damage to the ecosystem could have wide - ranging implications , according to the report .
The Amazon river basin is the world 's largest reserve of fresh water , while the surrounding wilderness regulates the continental climate and rainfall that drives a multimillion pound agricultural industry .
Improved transport networks throughout the Amazon will make it easier for inaccessible areas to be logged and burned , disrupting the ecosystems that support native species and indigenous populations , the report concludes .
The group urged the governments backing the IIRSA to take greater account of the ecological impact of the projects and encourage more sustainable use of the region 's resources .
If Amazonian countries agreed to reduce deforestation rates by 5 % a year for 30 years , the saved forest would potentially qualify as a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and generate more than £ 3bn a year over the lifetime of the agreement , Dr Killeen said .
Biofuel crops , such as sugar cane , could be planted on the 65 m hectares ( 250,000 square miles ) of land that has already been deforested , and fish farms could exploit the natural water reserves , he said .
By David Swanson — Congressman Sam Farr ( D. , Calif. ) is the latest member of Congress to respond to intense pressure from his constituents and co-sponsor H Res 333 , articles of impeachment against Vice President Dick Cheney .
The official list of co-sponsors at thomas.loc.gov includes 11 names , plus the original sponsor Congressman Dennis Kucinich ( D. , Ohio ) .
That makes 12 .
In addition , Congressman Bob Filner ( D. , Calif . ) has said he will sign on , and has said so publicly in media interviews including this one : http://www.atlantaprogressivenews.com/news/0189.html
That makes 13 , or 14 with Farr .
Then there is Congressman Jesse Jackson Jr. ( D. , Ill . ) who has not signed onto H Res 333 or introduced his own articles of impeachment against Cheney or Bush , but who recently released this statement :
“ In her first weeks as leader of the Congress , Speaker Nancy Pelosi withdrew the notion of impeachment proceedings against either President Bush or Vice President Cheney [ actually she did that 8 months earlier , and Jackson began parroting her line right away , but who ’s counting ] .
With the president ’s decision to once again subvert the legal process and the will of the American people by commuting the sentence of convicted felon Lewis ‘ Scooter ’ Libby , I call on House Democrats to reconsider impeachment proceedings .
Lewis Libby was convicted of lying under oath to cover up the outing of active , undercover CIA agent , Valerie Plame .
It is beyond unthinkable that the president would undermine the legal process to protect a man who engaged in treason against the United States government , threatening the security of the American people .
In November ’s election , voters put Democrats in charge of Congress because they believed our pledge of oversight and accountability .
Now it ’s time for us to honor that pledge .
The Executive Branch should be held responsible for its illegalities .
Our democratic system is grounded in the principle of checks and balances .
When the Executive Branch disregards the will of the people , our lawmakers must not be silent .
Today ’s actions , coupled with the president ’s unwillingness to comply with Senate and House inquiries , leave Democrats with no other option than to consider impeachment so that we can gather the information needed to achieve justice for all Americans . ”
If Jackson signs onto H Res 333 , there will be 15 cosponsors .

Newswise — Nurturing neuronal connections can protect your memory and help you stay mentally alert .
A sharp mind and strong memory depend on the vitality of your brain 's network of interconnecting neurons , and especially on junctions between these neurons called synapses .
Since many of the brain changes that accompany aging and mental disorders are associated with deterioration or loss of synapses , learning ways to strengthen and protect these important connections may help you delay or avoid cognitive decline .
These findings appear in the February issue of Mind , Mood and Memory , a newsletter from Massachusetts General Hospital , a leading center of excellence in the field of cognitive fitness .
( For more information click on http://www.mindmoodandmemory.com.)
The synapse is the point of communication between one neuron and a neighboring neuron , muscle cell or gland cell .
It is the site where virtually all important brain activity emerges .
At this gap between the message - relaying axon of one brain cell and the message - receiving dendrites of its neighbor , chemicals called neurotransmitters are released and absorbed in a process of information transmission that spreads throughout extensive networks of cells .
There are trillions of synapses in the brain : Each one of our more than 100 billion neurons may be connected to hundreds of other cells by as many as 10,000 synapses .
Together they form a complex and flexible instrument upon which the music of our thoughts , behaviors and feelings is played out .
Research has established that , among its many functions , the synapse plays an important role in learning and memory .
New information is absorbed and retained through a process characterized by changes in synaptic interconnections among neurons in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex , regions of the brain associated with memory .
But the ability to learn and remember , along with other mental and emotional processes , can be influenced by the effects of lifestyle and environment on the synapses .
Studies suggest that neurons that are adversely affected by factors such as stress , lack of stimulation , or neurotoxins may be hampered in their ability to form new patterns of connectivity and may lose synaptic connections .
" Psychiatry essentially deals with brain issues that transpire at the synaptic level and at connections between neurons in different brain regions , " says Eric M. Morrow , MD , PhD , Instructor in Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and a researcher in neuroscience and genetics at Massachusetts General Hospital .
" Most medications that have been developed to treat mood and other neuropsychiatric disorders work at this level .
In psychiatry , the emphasis is generally on problems and benefits that come from the functioning of the brain 's synapses and chemicals , whereas treatment for lesions of the brain such as those associated with stroke or brain injury is done by neurologists .
" Researchers are developing ways to study neurotransmitters in the synapse to measure their effects on brain plasticity ( ability to change in response to experience ) , learning and memory , and to discover their association with disorders such as mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) , Alzheimer 's disease and depression , " he adds .
" While the associated symptoms of mental health are not subtle , visualizing the functioning brain at the level of the synapse is difficult .
This is a very challenging but important problem .
New tools are on the way that may one day help scientists develop a deeper understanding of synaptic function . "
How the synapse functionsNeurons send and receive messages using their single axon — a tubular filament that conducts electrical signals away from the cell — and dendrites — projections with a tree - like structure that receive signals from other cells across a synapse .
When one cell communicates with another , it sends a wave of electrical activity down its axon to one of a cluster of presynaptic terminals — branches at the end of the axon that are positioned close to a neighboring cell 's dendrites .
In most cell communication , once a signal reaches the presynaptic terminal , the nerve impulse is transformed into a message composed of one or more neurotransmitters .
These neurotransmitters are then released into a gap called the synaptic cleft , where they relay their message by binding with receptors on the post - synaptic membrane of the neighboring cell .
It is generally agreed that learning occurs when the acquisition of new information causes synaptic changes , but scientists are not yet certain precisely how these changes come about .
Several theories have been proposed .
In one , called the Hebbian theory , it is thought that any two cells or systems of cells that are repeatedly activated at the same time will tend to become " associated , " so that activity in one makes it more likely the other will become active .
Repeated co-activation of connected cells is thought to make physical changes in the brain — such as the development of new synapses between neurons or more receptors in the post - synaptic membrane — that lead to a lasting memory .
Another theory ascribes learning to the strengthening of existing synapses .
It is thought that the developing brain overproduces synapses early in life .
Subsequently experience , by activating certain nerve cells repeatedly and ignoring others , determines which synapses become mature and stable and which ones wither away in a process of synaptic pruning .
Over time , this process leaves us with only highly functional synapses .
Learning and memory are thought to result when repeated stimulation of sets of neurons causes the communication across synapses to be strengthened , a condition called long - term potentiation .
Keeping synapses healthy Maintaining brain cells and synapses in good condition is critical , since mental performance is totally reliant on the health of the brain 's complex network of trillions of synapses .
Deterioration or loss of synapses can result in changes in mood and cognition , and in alterations of brain functioning such as those associated with neurological disorders or aging .
Stress is a major cause of synapse dysfunction ..
Research shows that prolonged exposure to stress can interfere with the function of neurotransmitters .
Excessive amounts of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate may accumulate in the synapse .
In high concentrations , glutamate becomes a toxin that can interfere with learning and cause cell damage in the brain 's memory regions .
Research presented at the 2006 American Psychological Association convention suggests that repeated stress remodels the brain and causes neurons in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex to shrink .
Stress can also lead to depression , which is associated with memory difficulties .
A number of studies suggest that lack of stimulation is associated with a reduced number of synaptic connections in the brain , a factor that may increase vulnerability to Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) .
For example , scientists who used an electron microscope to compare post - mortem brain tissue from the prefrontal cortex of 16 subjects found that those whose professions required greater amounts of skill or education had 17 percent more synapses for each neuron than those with less education .
Another study suggests that seniors who enjoy a variety of intellectually challenging activities ( such as playing a musical instrument , solving puzzles or reading ) have a lower risk of developing dementia .
It is thought that the larger number of neuronal interconnections associated with regular intellectual activity may provide extra insurance against cognitive decline .
The synapses are vulnerable to neurotoxins , as well .
Excessive alcohol consumption , exposure to certain pesticides and heavy metals , and to drugs such as phencyclidine ( PCP ) and ketamine can cause memory problems and synaptic loss .
The toxin from the bacteria that causes poisonous botulism acts directly on the synapses by blocking transmission of neurotransmitters , as does the deadly toxin curare .
Following these tips may help you keep your mind active and alert by protecting and strengthening your synapses :
1. Reduce stress :
Make time for leisure activities .
Learn relaxation techniques such as meditation .
Cut down on unnecessary responsibilities and avoid over - scheduling .
2. Stimulate your brain : Avoid routine .
Enjoy new sensory experiences .
Challenge your mind and body with new situations .
3 . Exercise : A brisk walk or other cardiovascular workout oxygenates the brain and promotes brain growth factors .
4 .
Challenge your mind : Tackle puzzles , games and demanding intellectual tasks .
Make an effort to learn new information through classes or reading5 .
Stay healthy :
Eat a nutritious diet , get adequate sleep , avoid smoking , and if you use alcohol , drink in moderation .

A former neuroscience lab drone , the 26 - year - old Rhodes scholar would devour pages of Marcel Proust 's Swann 's Way whenever he was n't spinning down DNA .
In the process , he made a discovery : Artists have something to teach researchers .
In his new book , Proust Was a Neuroscientist , Lehrer argues that many artists have foretold the scientific future —
Proust revealed the inaccuracy of memory , chef Auguste Escoffier anticipated the fifth taste sensation we now call umami , and post - impressionist Paul Cézanne proved that the brain fills in what a painting does n't show .
Wired asked Lehrer to explain why the white coats should go all black - beret .
__Wired :
__Do you really think that we 'll find answers to science 's Big Questions in the arts ?
__Lehrer : __Virginia
Woolf is n't going to help you finish your lab experiment .
What she will do is help you ask your questions better .
Proust focused on problems that neuroscience itself did n't grapple with until relatively recently — questions of memory that could n't be crammed into Pavlovian reinforcement :
Why are memories so unreliable ?
Why do they change so often ?
Why do we remember only certain aspects of the past ?
__Wired : __Has the separation of the disciplines held them back ?
__Lehrer : __It has affected both cultures adversely .
You read the diary of Woolf and the letters of Cézanne and realize they thought they were discovering something true — in the same real way that science is true — but we do n't think of artists that way anymore .
The separation has also led science to neglect this other side of the mind .
It 's important to acknowledge that when you discuss the brain only in terms of proteins and enzymes , you 're missing something .
__Wired : __Which artists are making the discoveries of tomorrow ?
__Lehrer : __Maybe my next book will be Kanye West Was a Neuroscientist .
He 's making use of the same musical principles as Beethoven , the same idea of building toward a pattern but then denying the listener that pattern by injecting randomness , because that unexpectedness is what your auditory cortex really craves .
__Wired : __What scientific advances are affecting artists today ?
__Lehrer : __Neuroscience has come up with some amazing things in the past couple of decades , like the idea that there is no you in the brain , no neuron that is you or that cares about you .
You 're just a massively distributed parallel network .
And the idea that from the perspective of DNA we 're all so incredibly similar .
That feels very novelistic to me .
__Wired : __Which of today 's artists and scientists would you pair up ?
__Lehrer : __Sculptor Richard Serra should read about string theory and figure out a way to simulate what 11 dimensions might be like .
I would love to put Serra and physicist Brian Greene together .

How My Father Taught Me Non-Violence
-- by Arun Gandhi , posted Sep 18 , 2007
I was 16 years old and living with my parents at the institute my grandfather had founded 18 miles outside of Durban , South Africa , in the middle of the sugar plantations .
We were deep in the country and had no neighbors , so my two sisters and I would always look forward to going to town to visit friends or go to the movies .
One day , my father asked me to drive him to town for an all - day conference , and I jumped at the chance .
Since I was going to town , my mother gave me a list of groceries she needed and , since I had all day in town , my father ask me to take care of several pending chores , such as getting the car serviced .
When I dropped my father off that morning , he said , ' I will meet you here at 5:00 p.m. , and we will go home together . '
After hurriedly completing my chores , I went straight to the nearest movie theatre .
I got so engrossed in a John Wayne double - feature that I forgot the time .
It was 5:30 before I remembered .
By the time I ran to the garage and got the car and hurried to where my father was waiting for me , it was almost 6:00 .
He anxiously asked me , ' Why were you late ? '
I was so ashamed of telling him I was watching a John Wayne western movie that I said , ' The car was n't ready , so I had to wait , ' not realizing that he had already called the garage .
When he caught me in the lie , he said : ' There 's something wrong in the way I brought you up that did n't give you the confidence to tell me the truth .
In order to figure out where I went wrong with you , I 'm going to walk home 18 miles and think about it . '
So , dressed in his suit and dress shoes , he began to walk home in the dark on mostly unpaved , unlit roads .
I could n't leave him , so for five - and - a - half hours I drove behind him , watching my father go through this agony for a stupid lie that I uttered .
I decided then and there that I was never going to lie again .
I often think about that episode and wonder , if he had punished me the way we punish our children , whether I would have learned a lesson at all .
I do n't think so .
I would have suffered the punishment and gone on doing the same thing .
But this single non-violent action was so powerful that it is still as if it happened yesterday .
That is the power of non-violence .

Five Women Arrested Outside Pelosi’s Office
by Jody Paulson
My elected representative wo n’t have a public dialogue with her constituents about peace , and Code Pink wants to know why .
Nancy Pelosi , Speaker of the House and congressional representative of my district in San Francisco , has n’t held a public meeting with her constituents about anything since Jan. 2006 — months before she became Speaker .
One could easily argue she would still be Minority Leader were it not for the dedicated work of peace activists all over the country to get Democrats elected in November … yet Pelosi ’s aid has told us she has no room on her agenda this recess to publicly dialogue with any of her constituents about peace .

The prospect of holding back the years with a simple injection could be closer than we think .
Scientists have taken a step towards developing a treatment that could erase the health problems associated with ageing .
While their breakthrough relates to rogue genes behind two rare genetic diseases , the approach they used could one day be harnessed to slow down the ageing process - creating an " elixir of life " .
The research focuses on mitochondria , sausage - shaped " powerhouses " in every cell of the body except red blood cells .
They turn the food we eat into energy that can be used by the heart , muscles , brain and other parts of the body .
Research has suggested their deterioration is an important cause of ageing , according to a report in New Scientist magazine .
About one in 5,000 children and adults are at risk of developing a mitochondrial disease , which include disorders of the nervous system and blindness .
One unique feature of mitochondria is that they have their own DNA , known as mitochondrial DNA , which is inherited from the mother only .
Defects in this mitochondrial DNA are blamed for a range of rare genetic diseases , including some forms of diabetes , blindness and heart problems .
They have also been linked to ageing - suggesting that fixing the flaws could slow down the onset of old age .
However , all attempts to fix flaws by inserting healthy DNA into mitochondria - a technique known as gene therapy - have failed , with the fresh genes stubbornly staying outside the powerhouses .
Now , by labelling the functional genes with an " address code " - which
effectively tells them where to go - French scientists have succeeded in smuggling them inside the mitochondria .
Once there , the pair of genes repaired the damage behind a rare form of blindness and a muscle wasting disease , says the New Scientist report .
In time , the same approach could be used to create injections of genes that will erase flaws thought to be linked to the ageing process .
However , while this might slow down ageing , it would not halt it completely , as mitochondria are just one of many factors involved in the ageing process .
Professor Patrick Chinnery , a leading British expert on mitochondrial disorders , said : ' It is not a panacea but , if successful , it might potentially correct part of this ageassociated damage to mitochondria which might be important in slowing down ageing .
" What they are doing sounds potentially a very clever idea .
" There is no treatment for these diseases , so any advance is clearly of great interest . "
The researchers , from Marie Curie University in Paris , now plan to move their experiments from cells to rats , with human treatments the ultimate aim .
There are , however , many hurdles to be crossed .
For instance , researchers need to be confident that genes act as billed and do not disrupt other vital processes .
They also need to work out how to get them to the right parts of the body without causing harmful side effects to other tissues .
Gene therapy offers hope of new treatments for a raft of illnesses , from cancer to Parkinson 's disease .
In a recent trial reported in the Lancet , injections of genes into the brain significantly helped relieve the symptoms of Parkinson 's disease .
Tremors and rigidity were reduced by up to 65 per cent , with no ill effects .

Amnesty said the rocket attacks were deliberate and indiscriminate
It says the Lebanese militant group deliberately targeted civilians with rockets in the 34 - day war - a " serious violation of humanitarian law " .
Amnesty has already accused Israel of committing war crimes by targeting Lebanon 's civilian infrastructure and is urging a UN inquiry into violations .
Hezbollah rejected the report , calling it a result of US and Israeli pressure .
Hezbollah MP Hassan Fadlallah said Amnesty should analyse the number of civilians killed on each side , before accusing Hezbollah of war crimes .
Amnesty says what it calls Israel 's violations can in no way justify Hezbollah 's actions .
' No justification '
The latest Amnesty report said : " Hezbollah 's rocket attacks on northern Israel amounted to deliberate attacks on civilians and civilian objects , as well as indiscriminate attacks , both war crimes under international law . "
It said Hezbollah had fired nearly 4,000 rockets into northern Israel , killing 43 civilians and forcing hundreds of thousands to flee .
Amnesty said Sheikh Nasrallah did a U - turn on civilian targeting
It quoted Sheikh Nasrallah as saying : " As long as the enemy undertakes its aggression without limits or red lines , we will also respond without limits or red lines . "
Amnesty International 's Secretary General , Irene Khan , said : " Civilians must not be made to pay the price for unlawful conduct on either side . "
Amnesty repeated its call for " a comprehensive , independent and impartial inquiry " by the UN into the violations and to ensure there was " full reparation " to victims .
It said those responsible for civilian suffering were " escaping all accountability " .
Ms Khan said : " Justice is urgently needed if respect for the rules of war is ever to be taken seriously . "
' Collateral damage '
Amnesty 's report on 23 August said Israel had targeted homes , bridges , roads and water and fuel plants as an " integral part " of its strategy .
It said Israeli claims of " collateral damage " were " simply not credible " .
Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev said Israel 's actions during the war were " in accordance with recognised norms of behaviour during conflicts and with relevant international law " .
Amnesty says it will publish further reports about other aspects of the war , including attacks by Israeli forces that resulted in heavy civilian casualties and charges that Hezbollah used Lebanese civilians as a cover for their operations .
About 1,000 Lebanese , mainly civilians , died in the fighting , while 161 Israelis , mainly soldiers , were killed .
Israel launched its offensive after Hezbollah militants seized two of its soldiers and killed several others during a cross - border raid on 12 July .

The pips can be heard rattling when the orange is shaken
The fruit belonged to Joseph Roberts who was injured in an explosion at a Stoke - on - Trent colliery in 1891 .
It had been kept by his family but has been donated to the Potteries Museum .
Spokeswoman Deb Klemperer said it may just be a piece of dried fruit but the story behind it made it an amazing piece for the museum .
Underground blasting
She said Mr Roberts , 37 , of Hanley , had taken it to work at the Racecourse colliery in Etruria for his lunch on 19 February .
Unfortunately , he was badly injured when underground blasting at the colliery went wrong .
He died in hospital leaving a wife and six children .
The lunchbox was one of his effects handed back to his family , who kept it .
Now his great - granddaughter Pam Bettaney has donated it to the museum .
The orange is completely blackened and dried out - the pips can be heard rattling when it is shaken .
" His death was just one of many of the tragedies of the time .
He was just one of many who died while working down the mines , " Ms Klemperer said .

The London Daily Mail reports :
A convicted rapist was freed from jail after it was discovered a juror had been doodling during his week - long trial .
The juror made two sketches of the judge while he should have been concentrating on the evidence .
As the proud curator of the American Gallery of Juror Art , I 'm struggling with this story .
Jurors can't doodle ?
What about counting the tiles on the ceiling , tracking the number of times defense counsel wears the same shoes , checking the second hand of the courtroom clock against their watches , planning their holiday outfits ?
Jurors are bored , bored , bored , and if we 're going to start overturning verdicts because a juror 's attention wandered , we really ought to shut down the prisons right now .
It had to be the underwear
So I 've decided not to believe it was the juror 's sketches that botched this conviction .
I 've decided the final straw was the jury 's experiments with women 's underwear .
In England , they 're called knickers :
The trial hinged on the victim 's pink knickers which were torn in three places , and formed a major exhibit in the case .
It was [ when the defendant was to be sentenced ] that the judge revealed that a juror had asked an usher at the end of the trial on Friday to dispose of a pack of women 's pants .
The judge said : " They bought a pack of five knickers .
" One is torn .
They had been trying the strength of knickers and comparing them with knickers in this case .
" The juror said they had been conscientious , but they decided the case on evidence not before the court . "
Juror artists , keep drawing .
You 're doing great work .

This morning 's revelation -- just one in a series of similar revelations -- that Condi Rice was " not inclined " to honor the subpoena of the House Government Oversight committee leads us to this question :
What happens if she does n't ?
It 's territory we 've been over before but we probably should review .
Let me start by explaining the title .
Those are the words of Speaker Pelosi , spoken before the 2006 election :
Pelosi was asked what was most important about regaining majority status .
" Subpoena power , " she said .
But to give that some context , let 's look at the set - up from the article :
Perhaps most significant among the changes if the Democrats take over is that the new Democratic committee chairs would be able to launch myriad hearings and investigations -- the oversight Republicans have virtually shut down .
That includes contracting scandals and governing breakdowns in the executive branch , constitutional abuses by this President and the gaping holes in America 's system of elections .
The House could become center stage for the war debate , with Bush 's lieutenants under oath required to answer their critics .
Oversight is one of the core functions of Congress .
Because Republicans have willfully shunned it , oversight hearings have the potential to expose scandal and produce shocking headlines .
Pelosi was asked what was most important about regaining majority status .
" Subpoena power , " she said .
Here 's the problematic part :
The House could become center stage for the war debate , with Bush 's lieutenants under oath required to answer their critics .
But what does Rice say about that ?
She 's " not inclined " to do it .
Does that sound like someone who thinks she 's " required to answer " to you ?
Maybe it 's time to review , then , how this " most important " function of Congress works .
Or rather , why it works .
A subpoena issued by Congress is ignored on pain of being held in contempt of Congress , for which you can be both fined and imprisoned .
There 's just one hitch :
The law pronounces the " duty " of U.S. Attorney is to empanel a grand jury and for its action on the matter .
But dispute exists over whether or not the Congress can properly compel the U.S. Attorney to take this action , as the U.S. Attorney is a member of the Executive Branch and ultimately reports to the President .
( The Courts have been reluctant to decide this question , claiming it is a " political question " for resolution by the elected branches of government . )
Oops !
The U.S. Attorney .
Seems to me that those guys have been in the news of late , but " I can't recall " exactly why .
At this point , you might wonder whether the U.S. Attorney has ever declined to prosecute a contempt of Congress charge against an administration official who had defied a Congressional subpoena .
The answer is yes .
In 1983 , the Reagan administration 's Department of Justice declined to prosecute EPA Administrator Anne Gorsuch , though she had been held in contempt by the House .
The current thinking in Congress , as far as I can tell , is that they 'll ultimately seek enforcement of their subpoenas in court .
That 's a dangerous concession in itself , in that a co-equal branch of government could be construed as conceding that it lacks independent enforcement power absent the courts -- another co-equal branch .
But even beyond that , we run into a more practical problem :
What does it mean when the courts say you " must " do something ?
Essentially , they issue some paper saying what 's expected of you , and maybe what the penalties will be if you do n't do it .
But how does that differ from the situation we already find ourselves in ?
We 've already got paper saying what the executive branch " must " do , and even what the penalties are if they do n't do it .
We 're already there , and still Rice says , essentially , go fly a kite .
What makes it worth paying attention to when the courts issue that paper is that if you do n't comply , there are guys with guns whose job it is to make you either do what you 're told , or pay the price for not doing it .
The problem is , those guys with guns are part of what the " administration " calls the " unitary executive , " and it is President Bush 's belief that they work for him .
Further , it is his belief that if he tells them to take the day off and scram , rather than enforcing what 's on the paper , it 's all perfectly legal , because he 's The Decider .
So that 's the difference between " investigative power " and " enforcement power . "
And it 's exactly why the Constitution requires that the president " take care that the laws be faithfully executed . "
Because if those laws -- up to and including the laws against standing in contempt of Congress -- are not executed as faithfully against executive branch officials as they are against anyone else in the country , then essentially we have no control over the executive branch whatsoever .
And that 's not in accord with anyone 's basic understanding of our constitutional system of government .
Now , here we are , facing Condi Rice 's rejection of the subpoena , at least for the time being .
Eventually , a deal may be worked out , under which she comes to the House and says she does n't recall anything , or that if she does , whatever she recalls is perfectly legal .
But here 's the question : If " subpoena power " was the most important thing there was about winning back the majority , for how long ought the majority tolerate being told that authority does n't apply to the executive branch ?
There are many conclusions you can draw from the situation .
I have my favorites , and no doubt many of you have your own as well .
But going forward , I think it 'll be important to keep in mind these few basic facts about oversight and subpoena power :
MEXICO CITY ( Reuters ) - Mexico , widely considered the birthplace of corn , is close to finalizing rules governing experimental planting of genetically modified corn strains , a senior biosecurity official said on Tuesday .

In Mexico , where tortillas made from corn are eaten with almost every meal , the government is determined to boost output in the next few years to offset rising prices driven by U.S. demand for corn - based ethanol fuel .
Mexico ’s biggest grain farmers have long lobbied to lift a 1998 ban on GMO corn plantings , arguing it would help lift lagging crop yields .
But environmental activists say GMO would put Mexico ’s numerous local corn strains at risk .
Reynaldo Alvarez , who heads Mexico ’s biosecurity commission , said the president ’s office now had a copy of the proposed regulations .
“ They are revising the final draft , ” Alvarez told Reuters .
“ I would hope it will be ready in the next two months . ”
Mexico last year passed a biosecurity law designed to permit plantings in certain regions under controlled conditions to be set in the regulatory document .
The rules would likely prohibit farmers in regions that contain the oldest strains of corn from planting GMO material , Alvarez said .
Even with the rules established , he said , it could still take time for test requests from biotech firms to be approved .
He said such requests would be resolved with within 90 days .
U.S. companies like Monsanto Co. and DuPont Co. want to enter the Mexican seed market with GMO strains .
A large group representing small corn farmers recently signed a good - will deal with Monsanto .
Scientists have found evidence the grain was grown in Mexico as far back as 5,300 BC , placing it as the likely cradle of corn cultivation .
The country has a huge variety of locally specific corn strains that farmers have bred over generations .
Despite that history , Mexico imports millions of tons of corn each year and was hard hit when grains prices rocketed in January as demand for ethanol fuel soared in the United States .

Hard drives are reaching the limits of data storage
We 've had agriculture for about 12,000 years , towns for eight to 10,000 years , and writing for about 5,000 years .
But we 're still living in the dark ages leading up to the dawn of history .
Do n't we have history already , you ask ?
Well actually , we do n't .
We know much less about our ancestors than our descendants will know about us .
Indeed , we 've acquired bad behavioural habits - because we 're used to forgetting things over time .
In fact , collectively we 're on the edge of losing the ability to forget .
For the past 50 years we 've become used to computers getting cheaper and more powerful exponentially - doubling in performance ( or halving in price ) roughly every 18 months .
WHAT IS THE TECH LAB ?
The world 's leading thinkers give a personal view of future technologies
The core trend , described by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore , describes the transistor count in microchips .
But a parallel trend in data storage means that storage space is becoming twice as plentiful on a similar time scale - and our ability to generate data to store is also increasing , as witness the 4 m CCTV cameras around the UK , and about 70 m cellphone accounts , of which maybe half are associated with camera phones able to record video .
Sooner or later they 're all going to be switched on , all the time and our data storage capacity is growing so fast that we need not delete anything ever again .
In the long term , almost all human experiences will be recorded
There are huge legal , ethical , and privacy issues connected with recording this much information , never mind sharing it ; as security expert Bruce Schneier has said : " ... managing data privacy is going to be the big legal problem of the 21st century " .
But I 'm assuming , for the sake of argument , that we will find answers or compromise solutions to these questions .
We 'd better , because those cameras are n't going to stop recording and go away .
How far can it go ?
Moore 's law has an end in sight , dictated by physics .
We can't build circuits out of components smaller than atoms .
But we can envisage building data storage devices that use individual atoms to represent one bit of information .
Consider a carbon crystal , created ( and edited ) one atom at a time by nanomachinery ; there are two stable isotopes of carbon , and we can use a Carbon - 12 atom to represent a binary 0 and a Carbon - 13 atom to represent a binary 1 .
ONE PETABYTE EQUALS 1024 terabytes 1,048,576 gigabytes 1,073,741,824 megabytes
One gram of this substance could store 10 to the power 21 bytes ( 887,808 petabytes ) - the equivalent storage of more than 11 billion typical PCs .
By way of comparison , in 2003 we as a species recorded 2,200 petabytes ( 2.5 x 10 to the power 18 bytes ) of data - enough to fill the hard drives of more than 28 m typical PCs .
If we can figure out how to read and write data on the atomic scale , you could store the sum total of all the data we recorded in 2003 on a grain of sand .
We 're only a few years away from the cost of data storage dropping so far that we can record " everything " that happens to us : our location at any given time , what we are hearing , what we are seeing , and what we are saying or doing .

With your phone converting all the speech it hears to text ( and storing that , too , and indexing it by time and location it becomes possible to search it all - like having Google for your memory .
You do n't ever need to forget a conversation again , even if all you can recall about it is that it was with a stranger you met in a given pub about two months ago and someone mentioned the word " fishhooks " .
If you 're a police officer , it means never forgetting a face and always logging all your interactions with the public .
If you 're suffering from the early stages of dementia , or if you 're simply over - worked and expected to keep track of too many tasks at the office , it means you 've got a memory prosthesis to help you keep track of things .
And if you 're a student , it means you can concentrate on understanding your lecturer , and worry about making notes later .
This technology is available now -- some researchers are using it - in a few years ' time , it 's going to be as cheap as owning a mobile phone , and a few years later it 'll be just an extra feature of your mobile phone .
For the first time ever , the human species will have an accurate and unblinking , unvarnished view of its own past
It sounds strange right now , but there are too many uses for it to remain an eccentric niche .
In the long term , almost all human experiences will be recorded .
And in the very long term , they 'll be a gold mine for historians .
Using nanoscale diamond as data storage , six hundred grams ( about one and a quarter pounds , if you 're my generation ) can store a lifelog , a video and audio channel , with running transcript and search index , for six billion human beings for one year .
Sixty to a hundred kilograms is all it takes to store an entire 21st Century of human experience .
And some time after our demise , this information will be available to historians .
And what a mass of information it will be .
For the first time ever , they 'll be able to know who was where , when , and what they said ; just what words were exchanged in smoky beer halls 30 years before the revolutions that have n't happened yet : who it was who claimed to be there when they founded the Party ( but did n't join until years later ) : and where the bodies are buried .
They 'll be able to see the ephemera of public life and understand the minutiae of domestic life ; information that is usually omitted from the historical record because the recorders at the time deemed it insignificant , but which may be of vital interest in centuries to come .
For the first time ever , the human species will have an accurate and unblinking , unvarnished view of its own past as far back as the dark ages of the first decade of the 21st Century , when recorded history " really " began .
There 's nothing like baseball to bring out the masochist in many of us .

Mets
Take it from a lifelong Mets fan :
The only thing we like as much as -- and sometimes better than -- a Mets win is a Yankees loss .
Yeah , I know , everyone hates the Yankees , but nobody can hate them like Mets fans do .
And that 's why the Past 10 days or so are shaping up as our worst nightmare , as the Mets and Red Sox compete to see who can squander their division lead more quickly .
I do n't know who needs to be put on a plane to Siberia sooner , Guillermo Mota or Eric Gagne , but I do know they 're both ruining my September ( and , hence , my entire sorry life ) .
My team doing an unprecedented choke + my most hated team pulling off an unprecedented comeback = worst season ever .
Nearly every day , the Mets ' lead falls by another game , and so does the Yankees ' deficit -- it 's like watching the world collapse in slow motion .
Wake me in November , because I can already see this is gonna get worse before it gets better .
-- Paul Lukas
Mariners
Are you nuts ?
YOUR TEAM IS STILL IN FIRST PLACE !
You 're still probably going to the postseason !
What kind of pain is that ?
I would LOVE to trade places with you .
Try being a Seattle fan .
We just went through a week - long root canal without Novocaine followed by a two - week colonoscopy .
The Mariners were 3½ games up on the Yankees in the wild card Aug. 28 , and now they 're six games back .
And you think you 're miserable ?
Did you have Horacio Ramirez in your rotation ?
Did you have Rick White in your bullpen ?
And do n't give me this , " Oh , no one else can feel our pain when it comes to Yankees " B.S. Trust me , New York Mets fans do n't have a monopoly on hating the Yankees .
WE HATE them out here , too .
DAMN YOU , David Justice !!!!!
-- Jim Caple
Braves
I have known the pain of Horacio Ramirez in the starting rotation , so let me get next .
Try remembering your enthusiasm when your team made the biggest , splashiest deadline deal of the season ( Mark Teixeira ) , realizing that addition has raked since he got to town , that your team has a better Pythagorean record than either team ahead of it in the standings , and your team still wo n't sniff the playoffs .
How you like that ?
You knew the Mariners were n't good .
I know the Braves are , I think .
The Mets ' tailspin should be opening the door to October for the Braves .
Atlanta should be preparing to find a 14th way in 17 seasons to blow a postseason series .
Instead , we 're where we 'll be until April -- third place .
And it just does n't make any sense .
Great , now my head hurts again .
As for the Yankees , there 's only one reason you know Jim Leyritz 's name , and the thought makes my stomach hurt .
-- Bomani Jones
Red Sox
The Red Sox are in first place .
Yeah , I know that .
Get back to me this weekend when they get no -hit by Scott Kazmir .
What , because we won it all in 2004 we 're supposed to be content ?
We should n't want to win it again ?
So , once a team wins it should play dead until everyone gets a chance to own a ring ?
We already have that in baseball -- it 's called the NL Central .
The Sox are in first place .
I heard all of you the first time .
But right now I live in a world in which my team plays it old school .
And by old school , I mean they show up to play 150 games a year .
I live in a world in which the answer to Linda Cohn 's question is , " Ass - clown rhymes with Gagne . "
I live in a world where apparently everyone on the roster has tickets to Disneyland because they can't wait to get to Anaheim .
I hope all of your cable boxes break today and the only thing that comes in is " Fever Pitch . "
Now someone please inject me with whatever cocktail they put in Roger Clemens ' elbow .
-- Mike Philbrick
Pirates
Seriously ?
You 've got to be kidding me .
Oh !
Woe is me !
My team is in contention for the playoffs every year , yet sometimes we do n't win the World Series and sometimes we do n't even make the playoffs !
It 's terrible !
Shut up .
The Pittsburgh Pirates have not had a winning season in 15 YEARS !
Fifteen years .
Not one winning season .
Not one lousy 82 - 80 season .
Not even 81 - 81 .
Heck , their best season since 1992 was a 79 - 83 record and that came 10 YEARS AGO !
So , please , kindly shut up .
Fifteen years , people .
Fifteen years .
Every year being virtually eliminated by the end of May .
Fifteen years .
One more is an all - time record .
Yankees fans , you 've won four World Series in that time and still had time to go on a World Series " drought . "
Poor , poor you .
Red Sox fans just just shut up .
In general .
You never stop complaining .
Everyone else , let the Pirates know when you get to FIFTEEN consecutive losing seasons and then you can complain .
By that time they 'll be in the thirties .
-- DJ Gallo
Dodgers
I envy all your heightened sense of drama , your steep peaks and deep valleys .
Dodger fans know nothing so dynamic .
We 're hovering , hanging in , dropping back , dropping a little further back , surging for a bit , and then dropping three straight games to the Rockies , which , while painful , is hardly the stuff of great theater .
We 've had key injuries -- Jason Schmidt and Randy Wolf .
We 've aged some -- Luis Gonzalez and Nomar Garciaparra .
We 've had young guys contribute and plateau .
We 've had experienced vets start off rough and then find a groove .
We 've lingered , tantalizingly close to glory but never quite arriving , never quite claiming it .
I asked a friend the other day how he thought it would end , whether he thought the Dodgers would make it to the postseason .
" I think they 'll hang around just long enough to truly disappoint me , " he said .
" I think they 'll make me think it 's possible and then leave it lying on the floor . "
Not as passionate as the anguish you guys are feeling , I guess , but miserable nonetheless
-- Eric Neel
Orioles
I 'm not an Orioles fan , but I can imagine what one would say if one still existed :
My fellow baseball fans , you have not suffered like us .
You see , we have this pitcher named Daniel Cabrera .
Big , tall guy , can throw a baseball through a cement wall .
In the past month , he 's started games the Orioles lost 30 - 3 , 15 - 8 and 18 - 6 .
Yes , our baseball team gives up more points than our football team .
But that 's just the beginning of our misery .
Every season , we go in the tank in the second half like a bunch of farm - raised salmon .
This year , we 're 14-31 since Aug .
1 . Last year , we went 29 - 43 after the break .
In 2005 , we were 47 - 40 at the break , and in the playoff chase ; we went 27 - 48 the rest of the way .
And who can forget 2002 , when we collapsed with a 4 - 24 disgrace in September ?
We 've had 10 straight losing seasons -- even though we 've been in the top half of team payroll eight times .
This offseason , we spent $ 41.5 million on three free agent relievers .
Who spends $ 40 million on set - up guys ?
Guess which team has the 29th worst bullpen ERA in the majors ?
Thank you , Danys Baez , for your three saves and 6.44 ERA .
Thank you for making me watch games standing next to Boog 's Barbecue because that 's the only way I escape the stench you have filled Camden Yards .
And finally , we have as our owner he who should not be named .
-- David Schoenfield
Tigers
Buck up , fellas .
Has your team ever lost 119 games in a season ?
Huh ?
Hello Bueller ?
The Tigers went 19 years without a postseason berth , and for all we know it could be another 19 until the next .
Even the Pirates have n't gone 19 years between playoff appearances !
Detroit has lost 100 - plus games three times since 1996 and had 12 consecutive losing seasons prior to last year .
The Brewers have lost 100 games only once in their history .
Sure , the Tabbies clawed their way to the AL pennant last season , but if it were n't for the " craftiness " of Kenny Rogers , they would 've been swept by the worst World Series champ ever .
After this week 's sweep at Cleveland , 2006 looks like a mere tease for the 38 - year postseason drought to come .
Has your favorite team ever traded six players in order to rent Juan Gonzalez for a year ?
Did your team ever trade Luis Gonzalez and cash for Karim Garcia ?!?!
Now you understand why we riot after a championship .
-- Thomas Neumann
Brewers
I 'm going to refrain from hyperbole .
You all know of Milwaukee 's woes .
Other teams may be bad , but as Thomas illustrated , the Brewers are the italicized punchline that baseball scribes use when describing those mediocre clubs .
We had accepted the truth .
Then , 34 games into the 2007 season , it happened : The Best Record In Baseball .
We were soaring high on wings crafted from a rotation that could n't lose , a " game over " bullpen and a lineup that only hit homers .
But the swellness was fleeting .
Our wings fell apart .
Mercifully , we 're playing chicken with the Cubs , challenging them to see who can lose the most games and still reach October , and so long as that 's happening , we 're staying out of the water .
But should the Brewers succumb in the end , after their most promising season ever ?
then you will see suffering never known by fans of the other teams on this list .
Then you will see true heartbreak .
And then you will see hyperbole .
-- Neil Janowitz
Cubs
Forget Bartman .
Forget the goat .
Forget the 99 - year curse .
None of those alleged maladies -- assuming there 's truth to any of them -- have anything to do with why the Cubs wo n't win again this season .
No , the 2007 edition of the Chicago Orphans is a flawed team .
Start with the lack of chemistry and go from there .
So even if they win their minor - league division , Lou Piniella 's band of misfit toys can plan their vacations for the second weekend in October .
And I do n't want to hear about the how the Cardinals -- an organization with a championship mentality -- came from nowhere to win the 2006 World Series .
Or that you do n't have to be a great team to win it all , you only have to get hot at the right time .
If that 's all it takes , then the Cubs have been on the receiving end of Mr. Snow Miser 's touch for the last century .
The only thing easing the pain this fall is the sheer folly of watching Notre Dame try to reach the end zone .
But I 'm convinced the Irish will score a touchdown -- even win a bowl game -- before the Cubs reach ( notice I did n't say " win " ) another World Series .
After all , that streak will officially reach a not - so - mature 62 years and counting in the next couple of weeks , and then it will be time to close down the West Addison Beer Garden for another season and focus on the second longest drought in professional sports -- compliments of the Chicago Blackhawks .
That makes the rest of the complainers in this space nothing more than futility rookies .
-- David Albright
Yankees
I 've had enough .
Stop your whining .
None of you have had as trying a year as me .
I had to watch Carl Pavano start on Opening Day .
I had to watch Kei Igawa flounder worse than Hideki Irabu ( while Dice - K and Okajima starred for the Red Sox ) .
I had to watch guys like Chase Wright , Matt DeSalvo , Tyler Clippard , Darrell Rasner and Jeff Karstens make starts -- and Kyle Farnsworth come out of the pen .
The Yankees were so desperate for pitching , I had to watch them throw a prorated $ 28 million at a 45 - year - old , as well as break the team travel rules , to get him .
I had to watch good hitters like Bobby Abreu , Robinson Cano and Johnny Damon get off to atrocious starts .
Heck , I had to watch the entire team get off to an atrocious start .
And the one bright spot back then , A - Rod ?
I 've spent the entire season waiting for the other shoe to drop .
In addition , I had to watch Brian Cashman fail to make a significant deal at the trade deadline , losing out on Eric Gagne .
( On second thought )
And do n't forget about the loss of The Scooter .
Fortunately , we 've gotten a boost from some young prospects -- particularly Joba Chamberlain -- and standard clutch performances from the veterans you refer to as " True Yankees " : Jorge Posada , Mariano Rivera , Andy Pettitte and , of course , El Capitan .
( The second - best shortstop in New York , right Mets fans ?
LOL . )
Above all , you people just do n't understand how it feels to have the entire baseball world -- really the entire sports world -- hate you and root against your team .
You do n't understand how it feels when anything less than winning a World Series seems like failure .
And you probably do n't understand how much fun it is to be a Yankees fan right now .

Sound off to Page 2 here .
Imagine that an earthquake creates cracks in San Francisco 's Bay Bridge .
Instead of collapsing , the bridge 's girders patch up their own fractures .
That 's the vision behind an unlikely collaboration between an industrial designer and a microbiologist who think they ’ve found the key to creating materials with some of the characteristics of life .
" Ultimately , we want material that is capable of repairing itself , " said David Bramston , a senior lecturer in product design at the University of Lincoln in the United Kingdom .
" That led us to slimes and jellies . "
The slimes he 's referring to are known as biofilms , which are three - dimensional colonies of bacteria that secrete a starchy covering that protects the tiny creatures from predators , UV radiation and antibiotics .
If scientists could weave them into building material or fabric , the result could be self - regenerative structures and even clothing .
The plaque on your teeth is a biofilm .
So is the slime under rocks .
Biofilms kill cystic fibrosis patients , and they create problems for engineers by clogging oil pipelines .
Most scientists are trying to get rid of biofilms .
After all , they are 1,000 times more resistant to antibiotics than free - floating microbes .
And the National Institutes of Health estimate that biofilms account for more than 80 percent of microbial infections in the human body .
Bramston said microbiologists " are intrigued that an industrial designer is flying around the world saying , ' I like biofilms . ' "
He believes that some biological jujitsu could turn biofilms ' virulence into a force for good .
Films large enough to see are the best candidates .
" In papermaking facilities , the pulping liquor contains a lot of organic carbon , which grows huge biofilms , " said Paul Sturman , a senior research engineer at the Center for Biofilm Engineering , a National Science Foundation - funded engineering research center at Montana State .
" The bacterial colony is so thick that you can pick it up and hold it in your hand . "
These bacterial colonies function as a unit , cooperating and communicating to stay alive .
They have entirely different properties from free - floating , so - called planktonic , bacteria .
" The genes that are expressed when they 're in a biofilm are very different from the genes expressed in a free - floating state , " said Derek Lovley , a professor of microbiology at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst .
Those genetic differences have startling repercussions .
Bramston and his collaborator , Ron Dixon , head of forensic and biomedical sciences at the University of Lincoln , have focused their research on the actual material that their bacterial strain , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , often grows on : slag from the sewers of England .
By studying the surface contours of the slag , Bramston wants to learn to grow better biofilms that he can turn into usable material .
The researchers are also broadening their search for lifelike materials outside of slimes .
One promising area they ’ve identified is microcapsules , which were used by Scott White of the University of Illinois to create a self - repairing plastic .
His group inserted tiny beads of " healing agent " into a material .
The agent is activated by impact , like a glow stick , to patch up any fractures .
Bramston and Dixon even believe they might contribute to efforts in preventing unwanted biofilms .
Using industrial - design materials - research techniques , Bramson said , he 's found that smoother surfaces could actually aid biofilm formation , a retrograde thought in the microbiological world .
So , rougher surfaces – counterintuitively –might be better in places where you do n't want biofilms , like your kitchen or a hospital .
" Biofilms are still mysterious in many ways , " Sturman said .
" I think anybody studying them would agree that there is a great deal to learn about how they interact with each other and the mechanisms they use to survive . "
Scientists are examining the Indonesian catch
Enlarge Image
The 1.3 m - long ( 4.3ft ) , 50kg ( 110 lb ) coelacanth is only the second ever to have been captured in Asia and has been described as a " significant find " .
An autopsy and genetic tests are now being carried out to determine more about the specimen .
Coelacanths provide researchers with a window into the past ; their fossil record dates back 350 million years .
These fish are odd in appearance , looking almost as if they have legs because of their large - lobed fins - they are sometimes dubbed " old four legs " .
The blue fish can also perform headstands , hovering with their head just over the sea floor , possibly to detect food .
Scientists previously thought the fish group had died out about 70 million years ago , but were shocked when in 1938 they discovered that a specimen had been caught in a fishing net off the east coast of South Africa .
Since then , more than 300 specimens of the modern coelacanth species ( Latimeria chalumnae ) have been found in the waters around the Comoros Islands , which are situated in the Western Indian Ocean , and the eastern coast of Africa .
Their unusual fins make the fish look like they have legs
However , scientists were surprised once again when a coelacanth was discovered thousands of kilometres away in Indonesia in 1998 .
It looked similar to the coelacanths found near Africa , but genetic analysis revealed that the genomes differed by about 3.5 % , and it was described as a new species called Latimeria menadoensis .
Peter Forey , a coelacanth expert at the Natural History Museum , London , said : " When the Indonesian coelacanth turned up in 1998 , lots of people went out to look for more around this area , but nobody ever saw anything until now .
" The fact that another specimen has been found is significant ; it confirms that this is a genuine location for another coelacanth 's population . "
A fearsome catch
Justinus Lahama , an Indonesian fisherman , caught the fish two months ago off the coast near Manado , on northern Sulawesi Island .
He told AFP news agency : " It was an enormous fish .
It had phosphorescent green eyes and legs .
" If I had pulled it up during the night , I would have been afraid and I would have thrown it back in . "
Justinus Lahama caught the fish
He took the catch back to the port where it remained alive for 17 hours in a netted pool outside a restaurant .
It was then frozen and is now being examined by scientists .
Genetic fingerprinting tests to be carried out by an international team of scientists will confirm if it is the same species as the coelacanth found in 1998 .
The tests , said Dr Forey , could also help to reveal more about how and why the two species exist thousands of kilometres apart .
" The fact that the two populations are separated by this enormous gap of thousands of miles begs the question of how long ago and why they separated , " he said .
" Estimates from the genetic fingerprinting carried out on the fish caught in 1998 suggest that they separated about four to five million years ago , however if you look at the geology of the oceans , it suggests that they should have separated about 30 million years ago .
" More sequences taken from this new fish will help us to calibrate these estimates . "
Various efforts to conserve these ancient fish are underway .
They are considered to be endangered and are protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ( CITES ) .
On Wednesday , another group of scientists announced that they had discovered a 400 - million - year - old fossil of a coelacanth fin .
The find was reported in the journal Evolution and Development .
Researchers from the University of Chicago said it had been excavated from sediments at Beartooth Butte in northern Wyoming and would reveal more about the evolution of the creatures .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Some 40 percent of Americans would curb their driving habits if retail gasoline prices shot up to $ 3.50 a gallon , according to a Reuters / Zogby poll released on Wednesday .

Surging energy costs have already forced many Americans to consider cutting back on travel , retail , and entertainment spending to ease sticker shock at the pump , according to the poll of 524 people across the country .
Gasoline prices in the United States , the world ’s largest energy consumer , hit a record average in late May of $ 3.23 a gallon but have since slipped back to just above $ 3 a gallon , according to auto and travel association AAA .
“ It ’s so hard to read what consumer behavior is going to be at higher price points -- be that $ 3.50 per gallon or $ 4 per gallon -- because we ’re all in uncharted territory , ” said Geoff Sundstrom , a spokesperson for AAA .
Price thresholds for cutting time on the road varied , with about 19 percent of participants responding they would cut back at $ 4 per gallon .
Another 9 percent said it would take $ 4.50 , while 7 percent said prices would have to reach $ 5 a gallon before they would scale back .
Some 19 percent indicated that they could not cut their road travel no matter how high prices climb .
The only time AAA has observed flagging consumer demand for gasoline was after prices soared to $ 3.07 a gallon after Hurricane Katrina in August 2005 , Sundstrom said .
Prices hit a fresh record this year due to a spate of refinery problems that cut fuel production during the spring and as geopolitical tensions raised the cost of crude -- the main feedstock for gasoline .
“ With each passing year , we ’re experiencing new highs , ” said Sundstrom .
But he added , “ We ’ve not had a climate where large numbers of Americans are fearing for their economic future . ”
As energy costs rise , 39 percent of the people in the poll said they would compensate by limiting their energy use , while 22 percent said they would cut entertainment spending and 12 percent said they would cut retail spending .
Economists have been concerned that high energy costs could have a knock - on effect on the U.S. retail sector .
In some parts of the United States , gasoline prices are already near or above $ 3.50 per gallon .
Motorists in Juneau , Alaska , are paying $ 3.47 while in Wailuku , Hawaii , they are paying $ 3.59 a gallon , AAA said .
The Reuters / Zogby poll also reflected the increasing popularity of gasoline - electric hybrids , with 45 percent of people polled saying they expected to own a hybrid in 10 years , compared with 20 percent who said they expected to own a gasoline - only car .
Hybrid car sales have grown by more than 50 percent during the last year , according to HybridCars.com , while the overall car market shrank by 3 percent .
Sales of the Toyota Prius , the most popular hybrid in the United States , rose 83 percent .
The findings are the result of questions asked between July 12 and 14 of 524 U.S. voters who identified themselves as members of an “ investor class . ”
The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points .
The respondents were a subset of a broader survey of 1,012 likely voters who were asked about topics ranging from President George W. Bush ’s performance to whether they shopped at Wal - Mart Stores Inc .
Most of the players in the United States Rugby side probably would n’t know where to point if you asked them to indicate Tonga ’s position on a map , and thus it must have been quite satisfying for the small island to serve a cold can of whip -ass to the world ’s only remaining superpower yesterday when the shamed Eagles lost 25 points to 15 .
The USA ’s dismal performance in the Rugby and Soccer World Cup all serve as a startling reminder of the tremendous lack of interest in world affairs on the US ’s part – and that when it comes to world sport , environmental protocols and UN resolutions , the US is not a team player .
Of course it is not only in sport that the US are beaten by small and obscure nations , it would seem that recently the score - board in War has n’t been to flattering either ( think Vietnam , Somalia and Iraq where most of the soldiers who have been thrown into wars there probably could n’t have found the country they ’re fighting in on a map before they were stationed there . )
Perhaps the lesson in all this is that aside from at a bit of geography in high - school , it would perhaps be good foreign policy to try prime the pumps of worldly curiosity within the Nation .
I dare say that there ’s no better way to get to learn a little geography and some history than by drinking wine and having a love of food .
Imagine people switching off the mind - dulling and hate spewing Fox News , and switching over to the Food Network for a cooking show in Tuscany , a wine tour in Syria or a cuisine pilgrimage to Morocco .
Perhaps we could do away with some of the demonization of the Middle - East if we were to explore their culture .
Hell , how ’s this for an idea : instead of trying to destroy the rest of the world , how about enjoying it !
What a crazy thing that would be , enjoy and do n’t destroy .
There is after all such a thing as soft - power , which is where you win wars not with bullets and rifles , but with culture and ideas .
This is no new idea , in fact it was a great American who said it best :
Men often hate each other because they fear each other ; they fear each other because they do n’t know each other ; they do n’t know each other because they can not communicate ; they can not communicate because they are separated .
Martin Luther King ( 1958 )
What brings people closer together than wine , food and music ?
Most men would rather share a meal with their neighbour than spend all night wishing him dead .
I ’ve done a bit of travelling in the Israel , Lebanon and Egypt – and I ’ll tell you this : all that crap you see on Fox about people wishing American ’s dead is claptrap .
Representing the middle - east as Al Qaeda is like representing the USA as the Klu Klux Klan .
I think a shared appreciation of culture , poetry , music , literature and food could do a lot for US foreign policy .
Who would have thought 30 years ago that some of the most successful contemporary Asian cuisine in the USA would be Vietnamese or Japanese ?
Mind you , Korean food is pretty good nowadays too .
George Bush wants America to believe that terrorists target the USA because they hate their freedomâ€ ¦ but if terrorists hate freedom : then why have there been no bombs in Sweden ?
And also , lets not forget that terrorism is in no way peculiar to the middle - east .
Americans have committed acts of terrorism in America : the Unabomber , Columbine , Virginia Tech , Timothy McVeigh , Gacey , Ted Bundy , Jeffrey Darma etc .
Also , terrorism is not peculiar to Islam , as we ’ve seen in Northern Ireland ( thus it is ironic to see how Bill O’Reilly and Sean Hannity promote Guantanamo on Fox , hell , I would love to have seen O’Reilly ’s reaction if the British had started throwing innocent Irish people into their own Guantanamo during the IRA bombings . )
In the words of Dr. King again :
The ultimate weakness of violence is that it is a descending spiral , begetting the very thing it seeks to destroy .
Instead of diminishing evil , it multiplies itâ€ ¦
In fact , violence merely increases hate .
So it goes .
Returning violence for violence multiplies violence , adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars .
Darkness cannot drive out darkness : only light can do that .
Hate cannot drive out hate : only love can do that .
Hate multiplies hate , violence multiplies violence , and toughness multiplies toughness in a descending spiral of destruction … .
The chain reaction of evil â€ ” hate begetting hate , wars producing more wars â€ ” must be broken , or we shall be plunged into the dark abyss of annihilation .
Martin Luther King ( 1963 )
American soldiers are simply making the world a more dangerous place .
Of course , they have the best intentions , but what they ’re doing is fruitless .
We ’d be better off investing in poets and filmmakers in Iraq .
Giving people guns will just give other people reason to pick up guns .
Training Sunni militias is a mistake , rather educate Sunni children .
Training Americans to be killers is another grave error , rather make our soldiers teachers and engineers .
What can a Marine do when they return to normal life besides obsess over atrocities committed in the State ’s name ?
On the contrary , if you train a young American to be constructive rather than destructive , that is state - resources well spent .
Rather set up feeding tents in Shi’ite neighbourhoods , giving local people Iowa corn on the cob , corn - bread , coca - cola and organizing soft - ball games .
Yes , there will be bombings : but people will be more willing to harbour terrorists in their homes if there are uniformed men with guns in the streets .
If Americans are to die on foreign soil rather let them die trying to feed other people than die whilst exchanging gun fire with them .
What can we do at home on American soil to contribute to the world situation ?
I think being open to other cultures and participating in world events in a positive and engaged way will do lot for world security .
I think America makes awesome wines ; some my favourite novelists are American ; American cuisine is awesome , some of the world ’s greatest luminaries are American and of course , half my family is American .
Having spent a fair bit of time in the South and the middle - East I can honestly say that I see more cultural similarity than anyone would think .
Southerners are middle - Easterners all love richy , hearty meals : Brunswick stew in the South and Lamb Kofta in Morcocco ; iced tea in the South and Bedouin tea in the middle - East .
We ’re more similar than Cheney wants us to know .
Nothing in the world is more dangerous than sincere ignorance and conscientious stupidity .
Martin Luther King
Let us not continue to destroy the world , but rather lets enjoy it and enjoy the cultural differences and the fruits thereof .

Officially , Mr. Wolfowitz and the bank are now to wait for a full report by the bank ’s board on his leadership and charges of favoritism in dealing with Ms. Riza , who was employed at the bank until 2005 .
But bank officials said that in delaying a finding , the board seemed to be buying time for Mr. Wolfowitz to consider resigning .
European officials close to the bank said that if anything , Mr. Wolfowitz ’s apparent dismissal of the criticism on Sunday would increase the determination of the wealthy European donor nations of the bank — especially Britain , France and Germany — that he needed to step aside for the good of the bank .
Although the storm over Mr. Wolfowitz has flared in the last few weeks because of his handling of Ms. Riza ’s case , unhappiness with his leadership began almost from the day he was appointed two years ago .
Staff and high - ranking officials , uneasy over being led by an architect of the Iraq war , grew increasingly rebellious over many of his policies , particularly those cracking down on corruption in the granting of loans to poor countries .
Staff members angrily accused him of seeing them as accessories to corruption .
Several European officials said their concern now was that Mr. Wolfowitz would not be able to carry out the job of raising $ 30 billion over the next three years for the International Development Agency , the arm of the bank that provides low - cost loans and assistance to the poorest countries .
Mr. Wolfowitz signaled that raising the $ 30 billion was already a major challenge over the last year , not because of recent events .
“ The donors are now unfortunately in a position of not fulfilling their promises , ” he said .
Concerns about the future of this money were conveyed during the weekend to Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. , European officials said .
“ This was a point conveyed in several meetings , ” said a bank official .
“ I think Paulson knows this . ”
Late Sunday , a Treasury spokeswoman , Brookly McLaughlin , said Mr. Paulson “ is counseling all parties to allow the process to proceed in a fair and respectful manner . ”
Cabel Sasser of Panic dropped a shirt off with me shortly before my first presentation at WWDC .
For those of you still using Lynx , the shirt reads , “ Hi , I make macintosh software . ”
While Jimmy Eats World was ripping the tunes at the WWDC campus bash , I proudly wore the aforementioned shirt all over the campus .
Co-workers quickly pointed out , “ You do n’t make software anymore … you tell others to make software . ”
That ’s right .
I do .
Let ’s get started .
You ’re a manager now .
Congratulations .
Either you sucked at programming and wanted to try a different influence avenue or you ’re fed up with every other manager you ’ve worked for and now you ’re going to REALLY GOING TO SHOW US how it ’s done .
I ’m here to help .
Your first five years as a manager are going to be full of lessons galore .
Lesson # 1 begins the moment someone asks you a question and you realize they ’re asking you not because you actually know the answer , but because the term manager is in your title and they ’ll believe any reasonable answer .
Some folks call that power , I call it responsibility .
There are other lessons , as well .
There ’s the big three : hire , fire , and layoff .
All of those are a nice kick in the teeth that ’ll be the source of significant insomnia .
There ’s the little stuff , too .
You ’ll find yourself saying “ We ” a lot .
You ’ll notice you ’re repeating yourself … saying the exactly same thing to twelve different people .
Some of it ’s entertaining , some of it ’s dull , but it none of it compares to when you ’re Screwed .
The state of being screwed is unique .
You know when things are going smoothly because you can arrive in the morning and quietly sip your hot beverage until your first meeting at 11 am .
Screwed is the opposite .
Screwed is being accosted the moment you walk out of the elevator and being unable to even check your mail … until Winter .
Screwed is mental paralysis .
Screwed is career panic .
Screwed is also an opportunity to hit it out of the park .
Overcoming screwed will give you confidence , experience , and respect , but you need to figure out how screwed you actually are and then figure out and how to fix it .
If you are n’t interested in unscrewing yourself , I ’d suggest this article is not for you .
I ’m assuming you have passion regarding your professional career .
You want to do more .
You want make more money and , if it all works out well , you want to change the world .
Maybe I have n’t been kicked in the shins enough , but it baffles me when I run into folks who are coasting through life .
Doing the bare minimum to get by and … enjoying it ?
What exactly are you enjoying ?
Hey , maybe your day job is n’t your gig , but I like mine , so let ’s begin :
#1 ) I ’m Missing A Document and People are Yelling at Me
Screwedness : Low
Early on the product development process , everyone is talking about writing it down .
Marketing specifications , engineering specifications … specs , specs , specs .
Milestones are often constructed around these specifications , but , usually , these milestones come and go and no one really gets fussy about missing or incomplete specifications .
That ’s the good news .
The absence of a particular document really is n’t that relevant to your screwedness .
The real question is “ Who is asking for said specification and why ? ”
If the requestor is someone who has a legitimate need for the information , your potential screw - i- tude is high .
Someone somewhere is not able to do their job and that means someone could fail in their work and that ’s bad because they ’re going to be pissed off and pointing at you .
A tip : Do n’t confuse the request for information as a request for a complete answer .
You completionists out there do this a lot .
“ I must answer the question thoroughly and completely ; therefore , I must start by selecting a template for the information that best structures my response and BLAH BLAH BLAH ” … two weeks later and the requestor has moved on .
You have officially missed your window to sound like you know what you ’re talking about and , guess what , you ’ve also been pegged as hard to work with / unreliable .
Way to go .
Larger organizations really believe they need to document more and they ’re right .
Communication in big organizations is tricky because everyone ’s got an opinion and you never know who is going to have a bright idea .
Big company policy on requiring documentation is furthered by layers of management struggling to ascertain / measure what is actually going on in large groups of people .
( See : Status Reports Must Die )
If you ’re feeling screwed by the absence of some important document , again , look at who is giving you that screwed feeling and ask yourself , “ Is this an honest request for facts or a management boondoggle ? ”
If the answer is facts then face - to - face communication is always the way to go especially if time is of the essence .
This section reads like I ’m anti-documentation which is silly because HELLO I WRITE A WEBLOG .
Remember the context of this column , “ When you ’re screwed … ” .
I ’m talking about situations when it appears the sky is falling and you need to move quickly .
I could easily argue that diligent and frequent documentation is a handy way to avoid sky - falling - situations because writing stuff down is a great way to make information scale … because you do n’t .
# 2) A Significant Development Tool Does Not Exist on My Team
Screwedness : Varies by tool
There are an endless pile of tools engineers are fond of using in their development process , but there are only four that they really need :
Editor
Compiler
Version control
Bug tracking
I ’ve never seen any engineering organization that has n’t had some form of an editor and compiler , but I ’ve been shocked to find both version control and bug tracking missing when I ’ve walked in the door .
If you ever find yourself in this situation , your first job … before you even sit down at your desk … is to get these tools in place and in use or you and your organization will be forever screwed .
Any engineering organization with more than two people will fall flat on it ’s face as soon as the product development process gains any sort of momentum unless version control and bug tracking are in use .
These tools empower engineers by allowing the entire team to :
Collaborate without stepping on each others toes .
You do this , I ’ll do that .
Be accountable for their work .
Who ’s got that checked out ?
Who ’s bug is this anyway ?
Measure their work .
How many bugs do I have ?
How about you ?
Remember what they did .
Uh , who the hell checked in this crap ?
You ’ll find early on in your management stint that main reason people make the trek to your office is that they need conflict resolution .
Once the conflict participants stop yelling , you need to get them looking at facts because facts will ground them and grounded means less yelling .
All of the tools I describe above are excellent repositories of cold hard facts and that can help .
# 3 ) I Ca n’t Stand My Product / Program Manager or They Plain Do n’t Exist
Screwedness : Medium
As an engineering manager , you need to have two significant peers .
First , you have a product manager … marketing .
This person represents your conduit to your customer and their needs .
Second , you have your program manager .
This is your process and communication czar .
The program manager role is a bit harder to define because most engineering managers confuse a program manager ’s role with their own .
A program manager owns the entire process of shipping a product .
Think of it like this , you , the engineering manager , hand a DVD with your final product to the program manager and they make sure it shows up in Fry ’s in the right box .
Do n’t think that is n’t a huge amount of work because it is .
Again , both product and program managers are information brokers .
For the product manager , they represent the customers needs … they tell you what the customer wants and you build it .
Once you ’re done , they tell you how it went .
The program manager ’s information is organizational .
For any given question , they know the answer or know who to ask .
Good ones are also process wienies which means things just do n’t fall through the cracks around them .
Program Manager Sidebar :
My strong belief in the role of program manager comes from first hand screwedness .
My start - up was twenty folks when I arrived as the first engineering manager .
Over the coming two years , we grew to 250 people where I was managing three product lines .
The executive management team created the program office around that time and I was immediately suspect .
“ What do these boobs do ?
Take meeting notes ?
Jesus , what a waste . ”
Wrong wrong wrong .
Good program managers are detail drivers .
They handle the piles of minutia surrounding a release and you ’ll be shocked the amount of time they ’ll save the average engineering manager .
If you ’re unable to work with these co-workers or if they just do n’t exist , you ’re pretty much at the same state of screwedness .
You ’re going to have to do their jobs for them and that means less time to actually be an engineering manager .
This is n’t going to feel like screwed because you ’ll be busy , but you are , bit by bit , cheating your team and your product out your time while you making sure the box art looks right .
Of the two , a missing or moronic product manager is probably more of an issue since their data affects the work of your entire team .
You ’ll likely make things worse when , if pressed for time , you declare , “ Well , I know what ’s best for the customer . ”
Again , wrong .
Unless your product is targetted at software engineering managers then it ’s unlikely your opinion is relevant .
Sorry .
# 4 ) My Product is Nowhere Near Done
Screwedness :
Less than you think ( hopefully )
Let ’s first remember that product development team loses their minds the last month of any significant product development cycle .
Really .
They ’re insane .
They ’ve been staring at this damned product for so long that they ’ve developed a serious emotional attachment with the bits and that means irrational , goofy behavior that is not based on reality .
This is you .
Mr. Insane Engineering Manager .
It ’s two weeks until your product ships and you are sure there is no way you ’re going to make it .
Your claim is , “ The product is crap ”
Now , there are two possibilities both of which are equally possible .
First , you might be too close to the product to make a quality judgment .
Your intimacy with your product has clouded your judgment and what you ’d consider ready for prime time has nothing to do with what a customer would be happy with it .
If , in a moment of lucidity , you realize that this the situation you ’re in , it ’s best to find a person / party who ’s judgment you trust and get a sanity check .
Your instinct will be to go to your QA organization , but they ’re likely equally in love with the product and probably more wacked about quality than you .
Maybe your boss ?
Maybe another engineering manager ?
I do n’t know who , but it ’s got to be someone who has not spent the last three months living and breathing this product that ’s NEVER GOING TO SHIP .
When you do find a designated sane person , they should ask questions like this :
Are the features done ?
How done ?
Are they testable ?
How many bugs are left ?
How many bugs are you fixing on a daily basis ?
How many bugs are you willing to ship with ?
What ’s your bug deferral criteria ?
What ’s your update strategy ?
This sane person ’s job is not to decide for you .
Their job is to be neutral and to help you frame your decision by asking great questions .
As a rookie manager , you ’re not going to seek external input because you ’ll think asking for help is a sign of weakness and , boy , are you wrong .
Asking for help of team members allows these folks to apply their unique experience to whatever the problem might be and that ’s how you make better decisions while also building a stronger team .
Asking for help is a big deal .
Do it .
Often .
That ’s situation # 1 … getting a second opinion .
This leads us to situation # 2 which is , you ’re right … your product is nowhere near ready for customers and you ’re fourteen working days from shipping .
You and your team are charging forward to the ship date , but most everyone is shaking their heads slowly and murmuring , “ It ’s not ready ” .
And it ’s not .
No need to get a second opinion .
You ’re still finishing features .
QA is sufficiently pissed off and your program manager is crying in his / her office .
Yes , it ’s really not ready .
As an individual contributor , your job is to bitch about the situation .
I mean that in a good way .
Bitching is one way to conveying data and if your manager is listening , they ’ll register it as such .
Problem is , you ’re the manager and it ’s now YOUR JOB to make initiate a course correction because late is better than crap .
If this is your first ever course correction , you ’re going to believe you ’re more screwed than you are .
Here ’s the truth :
Most everyone believes that engineering is lying when they propose a schedule .
It ’s what fancy word talkers call a truism .
If engineering says it ’s going to take a month , it ’ll probably take three .
Ok , maybe lying is a bit strong .
We ’re actually not lying , but we ’re doing the best we can , I swear .
We honestly do n’t know how long it ’s going to take to finish that feature until we ’re halfway done .
Organizations insulate themselves in different ways against the lack of engineering certainty .
Some product groups build in slip time .
Others have mysteriously named milestones POST ship which are the actual ship dates .
The point is :
If this the first proposed slip for any given product , you ’re going to be pleasantly surprised when the product team says , “ How much time do you need ? ”
Did n’t know you were playing poker did you ?
Well , you are .
DISCLAIMER : If you ’re interested in building any sort of credibility in your organization , I suggest that slipping your product late in the game is just bad PR .
Any good engineering manager + program manager team is going to build in feature and schedule checkpoints where mid-game adjustments are made that give everyone higher confidence in a final schedule .
Last minute schedule changes violates Rule # 3 of Rands Management No No’s : “ No surprises ” .
# 5) My Company / Job Sucks or Is About To Suck
Screwedness : High
True story .
In the early 90s , Borland was taking it on the chin from Microsoft .
Borland ’s big transition of their office applications to Windows was going abysmally .
The Microsoft monopoly was in full force … they bundled their first version of the Office suite and were underpricing the competition .
Good - bye Quattro Pro , Paradox , and dBase .
After years of expansion and a move into a ( still ) amazing campus , Borland was about to implode and I was aware of this .
That ’s the first step to get yourself unscrewed in this situation … detection … knowing the ship is sinking even though those execs continue to sound eternally optimistic in those all hands meetings .
Of course they sound positive , if the rank and file universally believe the sky is falling , those all hands meetings will become utterly devoid of hands .
What ’d I do ?
I jumped ship .
I took my engineering title and moved up the peninsula to a now - defunct database company .
Problem was , the new company was in much worse shape than Borland having imploded about a year earlier .
I did n’t know this until my hiring manager who had portrayed a portrait of enthusiasm and vision was gone one month after I started .
I was suddenly debugging build systems and drinking really bad coffee with a bunch of chronically depressed database developers .
Ooops .
It ’s obvious , but there are two parts to getting descrewed when your company sucks .
First , detection .
There are people still at Borland who , to this very day , are still bitching about that company the same way they were over a decade ago .
Let ’s call them faux - Bitchers because for all their bitching , they ’re never going to do anything about it because bitching about , apparently , is enough .
You are not faux - Bitcher because you ’re still with me .
You want to do something about your screwedness .
You want to make an upwardly mobile move .
You want to go somewhere where you ’re :
Getting a raise Getting a promotion Getting to do something that interests you Working for a company that does n’t suck
In my post -Borland move , I succeeded in A and B , but I blew D… and , it later turned out , C . It was my worst career transition ever and it took me a year to get back to a place that I felt I was moving forward .
Good managers keep their teams , their products , and their careers full of velocity .
Velocity .
That ’s a better term than upward mobility .
Constant forward momentum .
How you are going to achieve your own personal velocity is your own deal .
My apparently endless stream of management advice is just that … advice .
What you really want is my experience , but you ca n’t have it because there is only one way to get it … you ’ve got to put yourself a situation that allows you to get screwed .
When you ’re deep in it and terrified , maybe some useful acquired advice will pop into your mind or maybe you ’ll construct a more elegant solution .
Either way , you ’ll come out the other side moving faster … or maybe slower .
The Museum 's list of the Top 100 April Fool 's Day jokes celebrates the best of April 1st .
But sometimes April 1st inspires attempts at humor that do n't turn out so well .
Some attempts are , in fact , truly awful .
# 1 : Hijinks of Hussein and Son
# 2 : Releasing The Prisoners
# 3 : The Phony Deadline
# 4 : The Dead Dog
# 5 : A Fake Hanging
# 6 : A Fake Robbery
# 7 : Revival of the Warsaw Pact
# 8 : Fake Death Report
# 9 : Fake Disaster Warnings
# 10 : The Iraqi Ambassador 's Final Joke
Saddam Hussein and his sons may have been ruthless , power - hungry dictators , but that did n't stop them from trying to give the people of Iraq a good chuckle every April Fool 's Day .
On April 1 , 1998 thenewspaper , owned by Hussein 's son Uday , informed its readers that President Clinton had decided to lift sanctions against Iraq , only to admit later that it was just joking .
One can imagine the knee - slapping guffaws when readers realized how they 'd been taken for a ride .
The laughs continued in 1999 when Uday mischeviously announced that the monthly food rations would be supplemented to include bananas , Pepsi , and chocolate .
Again , just a joke .
At this point , the Husseins appear to have run out of material , because in 2000 they recycled the sanction - lifting gag , and in 2001 trotted out the ration - supplement crowd - pleaser one more time .
The merciless quality with which the same joke was repeated year after year had an almost surreal quality to it .
In fact , it almost makes one sympathize with Saudi Arabia 's chief cleric , the Grand Mufti Sheikh Abdul Aziz bin Abdullah Al al - Sheikh , who in 2001 decreed that the celebration of April Fool 's Day should be banned altogether .
It 's not known if the Sheikh had his neighbor 's hijinks in mind when he issued the ban .
Imagine reading that your husband or brother who has been held in a squalid Romanian prison for years is finally going to be released .
You make the long journey to the prison and stand outside the prison gates , waiting desperately for the moment you 'll be reunited with your loved one , only to hear ...
' April Fools !
No one 's being released !'
This experience happened to sixty people in April 2000 who read in thenewspaper that their loved ones were going to be released from the Baia Mare prison in Romania .
They made the long journey to the prison , only to learn that the paper had played an April Fool 's joke on them .
Thelater published an apology .
Glenn Howlett 's colleagues at London city hall thought they had dreamed up a great gag .
They sent him a memo informing him that the really big report he was working on was going to be due early , in just two weeks .
The tip - off was that the memo was dated April 1st .
Ha Ha. Except Howlett did n't realize it was a joke .
He received the memo while on vacation and immediately cut his vacation short and phoned the office to tell everyone to start getting busy .
But as he contemplated the new deadline he worked himself up into an increasing state of panic , until soon he began to experience heart palpitations .
Finally he collapsed from the stress and had to take leave from work .
As he was recovering he realized it just was n't worth risking his health to finish the report , so he filed for early retirement .
At which point someone told him the early deadline was just a joke .
He responded by suing for damages .
As a consequence of his lawsuit , city hall banned employees from pulling any more pranks .
The film National Lampoon 's Vacation includes a scene in which Chevy Chase ties a dog to the bumper of his car , then forgets the dog is there and drives away .
Inspired by this scene , Paul Goobie tied a dead chihuahua to the bumper of his co-worker 's car .
His co-worker , Kevin Meloy , got in the car and drove off , unaware that the chihuahua was there .
Obviously passing motorists were horrified .
But what made the situation even worse was that Meloy was deaf , so he could n't hear the other motorists frantically honking at him .
Happily he drove on for miles until finally someone was able to get his attention .
Police charged Goobie with unlawful disposal of a dead animal .
Randy
Wood 's marriage was over , but apparently he was still a little bitter about the divorce .
So he decided to play a prank on his ex-wife .
He called her up and asked her to come over , telling her that he had something to show her .
Obligingly she drove over , only to find him hanging by a noose from a tree in his front yard .
Terrifed , she immediately dialed 911 .
Emergency services , including firefighters , policemen , and paramedics , soon showed up .
But when they went to cut Wood down they discovered he was n't dead .
He was n't even hurt .
He had strung himself up as a prank to scare his ex-wife , using a lineman 's harness similar to those used by utility crews .
The authorities warned that he would face a fine of up to $ 1,000 and a year in jail for his prank .
Sitra Walker was an employee at a clothing store in Columbus , Ohio .
She had only been working there for two weeks , but already she felt that she knew the manager well enough to joke around with him .
So on April 1 , 2003 she called him up at his home and told him that armed men were robbing the store .
The manager immediately called the police , who promptly dispatched four cruisers .
Minutes later Walker phoned the manager again and screamed ' April Fools ' .
Too late .
When the police arrived moments later they were n't amused and charged her with inducing a panic .
Walker 's manager fired her .
In 1996 the Russian news agency Itar - Tass reported that the Russian parliament was debating whether to revive the Warsaw Pact .
The startling report was immediately repeated by news agencies in the Czech Republic and Bulgaria , causing widespread panic .
A few hours later Itar - Tass admitted that it had just been joking , and apologized for any confusion it might have caused .
In 1986 Israel Radio broadcast that Nabih Berri , leader of the Shi'ite Amal movement , had been assassinated .
The news caused an immediate flare - up of tensions in the region .
However , Israeli officials quickly denounced the report as a hoax .
The false report was traced back to an army intelligence officer who had planted the news item in the broadcasts of the Israeli Army 's intelligence monitoring unit , from which it had been picked up by Israel Radio .
Apparently the officer had meant it as an April Fool 's joke ( because hey , nothing says funny like stirring up tension in the Middle - East ) .
Israel 's Defence Minister , Yitzhak Rabin , announced that the unnamed officer would be court - martialed .
" Berri Berri funny , " one foreign correspondent wryly commented .
In the category of ' really bad fake death reports ' one must also note the time in 1998 when Boston DJ's Opie and Anthony announced that the mayor of Boston , Tom Menino , had died in a car crash .
Because City Hall could n't immediately reach the Mayor to confirm that he was actually alive , many believed the report , including members of the Mayor 's family .
The next day Opie and Anthony were suspended without pay .
In 1999 DJs at Oregon radio station KSJJ announced that the Ochoco dam had burst , threatening downstream areas with massive flooding .
What made the warning believable was that hundreds of houses in these areas had been damaged the previous year when the Ochoco Creek had flooded , so terrified homeowners who heard the news quickly prepared to flee .
Later the DJs informed their listeners that it was all a joke .
They had just been ' having a little fun ' .
The homeowners were not amused .
In the same genre of non-funny disaster warnings , there 's also WNOR 's 1992 April 1st report in which it warned that a large build - up of methane gas was about to cause a fiery explosion at Mount Trashmore , a landfill near Virginia Beach .
Residents were warned to evacuate the area , causing the local 911 to be flooded with calls .
The DJs responsible for the prank were suspended without pay for two weeks .
On April 1 , 2003 , as thousands of American - led coalition troops stormed across Iraq , the Iraqi ambassador to Russia , Abbas Khalaf Kunfuth , held a press conference in Moscow .
Many were expecting him to announce that Iraq conceded defeat .
Instead Kunfuth chose this moment to hold a gag press conference .
Holding up a piece of paper that he identified as a news flash from Reuters , he read aloud from it : " The Americans have accidentally fired a nuclear missile into British forces , killing seven . "
Immediately the room full of reporters went silent with shock .
Then Kunfuth grinned and shouted ' April Fools ! '
Only a few days after this unexpected moment of levity , the Iraqi government completely collapsed .
To analyze the world in which we find ourselves , it is necessary to have an interrogatory starting point : a foundational principle upon which we , brick by brick , can build the knowledge we think , with some confidence , that we possess about this world .
Much like how I , when I get my vision checked every few years , look through a variety of lenses to see which one gives each eye the sharpest , most in - focus image , the process of choosing an interrogatory starting point — a
First Principle — is one in which less compelling principles are rejected in order to embrace the single one most able to serve as an enduring foundation .
The First Principle upon which I have settled , that being evidentialism , can be summed , at least in my case , as follows : Evidence is the best , most reliable way for humans to approximate truth as we interrogate the world of experience .
All of my reasoning — which is to say , all conclusions I draw that are not obvious , manifest facts of the world — is driven by this principle .
Given the centrality of the evidentialist principle to my reasoning , it is worthwhile to parse the actual statement a bit .
What is “ evidence , ” first of all ?
According to the Cambridge Academic Content Dictionary , “ evidence ” is anything that helps to prove that something is or is not true .
Typically , when I am asked to define the word , I say something along the lines of , “ Evidence refers to the relevant facts pertaining to any matter of controversy , uncertainty or dispute . ”
Thus , following my First Principle , if there is a dispute about a matter for which an actual answer exists — for example , either Harry did kill Sally , or Harry did not — weighing relevant facts is the most reliable method to approximate the correct answer .
The word “ approximate ” also appears in my statement of evidentialism , and this is because , even though recourse to evidence has proven repeatedly to be our best tool for discovering truth ( i.e. , in the legal / judicial world , in medical settings , in day - to - day life , etc. ) , it is not an infallible tool ; we , as mere evolved creatures with large and advanced brains , cannot hope to possess absolute certainty .
We are forced to settle for provisional truths in which our level of confidence is commensurate with the available evidence .
The last part of my statement of evidentialism refers to “ the world of experience , ” as distinct from a hypothetical “ world of actuality ” to which , for whatever reason , I might not have access .
Think of it this way : For Dr. Cliff Huxtable , the main character in “ The Cosby Show , ” the world of that show was his actual world .
Dr. Cliff Huxtable does not live in our world ; rather , he is a character who exists only in the world of the television program .
In an analogous way , consider the possibility that , in actuality , I am a brain in a vat ; some kind of super - intelligence has merely created the illusion that I exist as a free - roaming primate when , in fact , I am just a brain soaking in a vat .
Because this fact , presumably , is inaccessible to me in the illusion in which I live , I could gather no evidence of this “ actual world ” to which I have no access .
By the same token , though , an “ actual world ” from which my consciousness is permanently isolated and of which I have no evidence might as well not exist at all ; its existence is indistinguishable from its non-existence and , thus , inconsequential .
The only world about which I care — the only world consequential to me and , thus , worthy of interrogation — is the one in which I find myself : that being , the world of experience .
What , then , is so persuasive about evidentialism as a First Principle , anyway ?
Why , to use the eyeglass - lens analogy , is my vision so much better with evidentialism than with , say , a First Principle centered on biblical Christianity ?
As hinted at earlier , evidence can easily be adduced in support of evidence 's pervasive utility in approximating truth , thus making evidentialism a self - subsisting , rather than self - annihilating , First Principle .
Criminal justice systems that are driven by evidence gathering and examination are clearly much more likely to zero - in on criminals than are systems in which evidence is shunted aside when trying to determine guilt .
In the medical field , those doctors who ascertain what symptoms a patient manifests ( gather symptomatic evidence ) before reaching conclusions about what afflicts that patient are clearly much more likely to diagnose the illness correctly than are doctors who gather no symptomatic evidence .
And , inarguably , in nearly every person 's everyday life , he or she constantly gathers , and acts upon , evidence .
For example , when , upon seeing brake lights illuminate in front of us , we apply our own brakes , having realized that the evidence of the brake lights indicates the car in front of us is slowing .
Stated simply : Evidence works .
There are some who mischaracterize me as a doctrinaire materialist or naturalist ... as a committed and unshakeable atheist or physicalist .
In fact , though , the only commitment I make — the only notion to which I have presuppositionally wedded myself — is to the validity of evidentialism as First Principle .
I am , in ascending order of importance , an atheist , a naturalist and a nihilist , and I am all of these things as a result of my evidentialism ; theoretically , all three of those descriptors could change — indeed , could be negated entirely — if the evidence were contrary .
That is why the oft - heard charge that , through my presuppositions , I have ruled out biblical Christianity rings utterly hollow .
Biblical Christianity is , in principle , fully compatible with evidentialism .
This is demonstrated even within the bible — in 1 Kings 18 , for example — leading Jaco Gericke , in his contribution to the book The End of Christianity , to note that , presumably , Christians have confected their own reasons “ why these things no longer happen and why no philosopher of religion will agree to a contest on Mount Carmel . ”
I would be foolish , indeed , to reject supernaturalism entirely if the world looked fundamentally different from how it actually looks .
For instance , suppose that true , pious Christian believers were able to resuscitate the dead , a feat that nobody of any other religion — and no impious , casual Christian — could ever do .
Surely , if such a thing were actually the case , it would be meaningful , and it would be difficult to maintain a purely naturalistic stance .
Consider also a hypothetical possibility raised by Richard Carrier , who , in his extended essay on why he is not a Christian , envisages true Christian bibles that are all indestructible , unalterable and self - translating .
It might be a bit primitive for one to shout , “ Lo , a miracle ! ” in response to such a phenomenon — surely , a natural explanation might exist , however unlikely — but any evidentialist would have no choice but to reweigh the odds of the supernatural existing .
I am a naturalist because , in interrogating the world of experience , I find no compelling evidence for the supernatural , and no need for recourse to it .
In the same way , I am an atheist because I have discovered no persuasive evidence for gods , and no need to appeal to them .
Finally , and most importantly , I am a nihilist because , given the current evidence , the cosmos , and everything in it , seems to be ultimately meaningless , purposeless and lacking objective value .
Although , as noted , “ nihilist ” is the most important appellation that I apply to myself , it is worthwhile to explain , especially given my relentless criticism of the religion , exactly why I reject biblical Christianity and embrace atheism .
The reasons are numerous and include the flood — the word just seems right — of absurd claims contained within the bible 's pages ( not absurd in the sense of being self - contradictory but , rather , in the sense of failing utterly to comport with the world of experience as we all collectively know it ) , the text 's seeming incompatibility with Darwinian evolution and a 13.7 billion - year - old universe , prayer 's uselessness in actually effecting desired results , people 's pronounced tendency to embrace the religion of their parents and peers , and the problem of statistical improbability regarding a hugely complex being — god — simply existing without a satisfactory explanation of origins .
There are , however , three principal reasons I reject Christianity , each of which is probably sufficient to falsify the faith and that , when taken collectively , ring its unmistakable death knell for all but the most presuppositionally committed .
Why , then , am I not a Christian ?
First , because god is absent or , at the least , silent .
In essence , those of the Christian faith proclaim that our universe , and all that is part of it , is in the hands of an omniscient , omnipotent , omnipresent creator deity who takes a personal interest in human affairs .
It is completely inexplicable , then , that this creator deity would be entirely undetectable and utterly absent from day - to - day life .
If one reads the bible , one finds an active , present , immediate god ; moreover , one finds copious miracles and prodigies that are unlike anything with which we are familiar .
The reliably perceptive David Hume , in Of Miracles , writes :
It forms a strong presumption against all supernatural and miraculous relations , that they are observed chiefly to abound among ignorant and barbarous nations ...
When we peruse the first histories of all nations , we are apt to imagine ourselves transported into some new world ; where the whole frame of nature is disjointed , and every element performs its operations in a different manner , from what it does at present .
Battles , revolutions , pestilence , famine and death , are never the effect of those natural causes , which we experience .
Prodigies , omens , oracles , judgements , quite obscure the few natural events , that are intermingled with them .
But as the former grow thinner every page , in proportion as we advance nearer the enlightened ages , we soon learn , that there is nothing mysterious or supernatural in the case , but that all proceeds from the usual propensity of mankind towards the marvelous ...
Hume rightly adds , " It is strange , a judicious reader is apt to say , upon the perusal of these wonderful historians , that such prodigious events never happen in our days . "
Why would a god who , in barbarous and ignorant times , was so clear , present and active suddenly , upon the emergence of a scientific understanding of the natural order , become a silent , inert sluggard whose presence could only be discerned in the most obscure , skepticism - baiting ways ?
Where are the miracles and prodigies for our scientific age ?
Because god , if existent , would be a do - nothing layabout , Christianity is falsified .
Second , the bible , despite the fact it is purported to be inspired by god himself , wallows in pitiable prescientific primitivism and yawn - inducing mundanity .
Certainly , considering its alleged divine inspiration , one might expect the bible to be full of dazzlingly specific information of which no one had been previously aware .
In light of its purported inspiration , one might expect the pinnacle of all intellectual achievement .
This is not so .
Sam Harris , in The End of Faith , writes , “ [ The bible ] does not contain a single sentence that could not have been written by a man or woman living in the first century . ”
There is nothing about the actual age or size of our universe .
There is nothing about the germ theory of disease , heliocentric theory of the solar system or atomic theory of matter .
Earth 's vast geography is shrunk down to claustrophobically local levels .
It is not even clear from the bible whether the creator of our universe is aware of Australia .
The bible is not a product of divine inspiration but , rather , lamentable ancient ignorance .
How , Christopher Hitchens asks in god is not Great , can Genesis be proven the mundane work of ignorant humans in merely a paragraph ?
He writes :
Because man is given “ dominion ” over all beasts , fowl and fish .
But no dinosaurs or plesiosaurs or pterodactyls are specified , because the authors did not know of their existence , let alone of their supposedly special and immediate creation .
Nor are any marsupials mentioned , because Australia — the next candidate after Mesoamerica for a new “ Eden ” — was not on any known map .
Most important , in Genesis man is not awarded dominion over germs and bacteria because the existence of these necessary yet dangerous fellow creatures was not known or understood .
And if it had been known or understood , it would at once have become apparent that these forms of life had “ dominion ” over us , and would continue to enjoy it uncontested until the priests had been elbowed aside and medical research at last given an opportunity .
The bible 's mundanity belies the claim of divine inspiration , thus proving Christianity false .
Third , I am not a Christian because worship of Yahweh as the singular creator deity did not arise independently among numerous geographically isolated populations .
Any delusional belief system , if designed with sufficient cleverness , has the potential to “ catch fire , ” as it were , and spread pervasively throughout our species .
Much less easily explained , however , would be for the same delusional belief system to arise independently — as though through universal identical revelation — in many different places .
Imagine if , around 2000 BCE , worship of Yahweh had arisen , nearly simultaneously , in the Middle East , China , the Americas and central Africa .
What would the odds have been of an identical god character — with distinctive quirks , commandments , preferences and fetishes — having been invented by completely different populations ?
They seem infinitesimal .
There is , however , no evidence of Yahweh - worship arising independently among geographically isolated groups .
However spiritual they might previously have been , primitive populations began to worship Yahweh specifically when believers in Yahweh arrived at their shores :
The omniscient , omnipotent , omnipresent deity 's message , therefore , is spread by the veritable Pony Express method of human beings .
Christopher Hitchens , in god is not Great , writes , “ One recalls the question that was asked by the Chinese when the first Christian missionaries made their appearance .
If god has revealed himself , how is it that he has allowed so many centuries to elapse before informing the Chinese ? ”
Whatever deities might have haunted Chinese history , none was distinguishably Yahweh .
The failure of god to reveal himself independently to several geographically isolated populations , then , also falsifies Christianity .
As noted earlier , though , I am not principally defined as an atheist or a non-Christian but , rather , as a nihilist , particularly a moral nihilist and an existential nihilist .
As explained on Wikipedia , moral nihilism is the meta-ethical view that nothing is moral or immoral .
Indeed , moral nihilists reject the very concepts of objective good and evil ... right and wrong ... righteous and wicked as pertains to the actual , existent world .
Wikipedia defines existential nihilism as the belief that life has no intrinsic meaning or value .
Broadened a bit , existential nihilism refers to the belief that the universe is meaningless and purposeless , as is its every component .
On this view , humanity , for instance , is to the universe as a single grain of sand on a beach is to the Earth .
The entire species could go extinct in an enormous nuclear blast — indeed , the Sun could incinerate the entire solar system , or the Milky Way could vanish — and the universe would not take the slightest notice , nor would the event have the faintest objective meaning .
And , as previously explained , my nihilism , both moral and existential , directly results from my evidentialist First Principle .
The natural starting point is with existential nihilism , because , in my view , moral nihilism follows quite directly therefrom .
The foundational background knowledge with which I approach the issue includes , but is not limited to , the fact of Darwinian evolution by natural selection , the fact of an old universe ( about 13.7 billion years ) and an old Earth ( following some 9 billion years later ) , and the utter absence of compelling evidence for the veracity of religious revelation , including that of Christianity .
The cumulative discoveries of science over the past two centuries have confirmed that all living creatures on this planet share common ancestry .
That is , there is a single Darwinian tree of life , of which every species , including human beings , is part .
Although different species possess different traits — some have eight legs and some have large brains , some have antennae and some can fly — every variety of creature is fundamentally connected through common Darwinian ancestry .
With respect to the cosmos , we live in a universe whose size and age exceeds man 's ability to imagine adequately .
The Milky Way , our home galaxy , is a hugely vast cluster of stars and their planetary systems .
The Milky Way contains roughly 300 billion stars , of which our Sun— inside which 1 million Earths could fit — is merely an ordinary one .
Our solar system is only a speck as a component of the Milky Way , which is but one insignificant galaxy among perhaps 400 billion galaxies in the observable universe .
The Big Bang is estimated to have occurred 13.7 billion years ago , with Earth 's formation following long after ( again , 4.54 billion years ago ) .
Perspective can be gained by putting this in the context of a calendar year : Imagine that the instant of the Big Bang equates to the stroke of midnight on January 1 , and the present day equates to precisely midnight on the following January 1 .
On this imagining , Homo sapiens sapiens would appear on the scene seven - and - a- half minutes to midnight on December 31 .
It is surprising that man , according to Christianity , is made in the image of god and is the object of god 's special attention and love , but then does not appear for aeons and aeons in a universe in which humans are confined to the tiniest conceivable speck of available space .
In the absence of compelling evidence for a god , and lacking persuasive evidence to support any religion , I have provisionally concluded that we are alone in the universe : not alone in the sense of there being no extraterrestrial life but , instead , in the sense of being unsupervised and uncared for .
Sure , we , as human beings , care for one another , particularly for family members , friends and others for whom we have developed feelings .
But , in a quite literal sense , we — and all creatures — are composed of the same dumb “ stuff ” that also composes inanimate objects , like rocks and concrete .
The molecules of which we are constructed are made of atoms whose origins trace to the crucibles that were the cores of high - mass stars , whose chemical contents exploded into the galaxy aeons ago .
We are the universe become conscious , a thought that , while exhilarating , is also humbling .
We , like rocks , are a mere atomic assemblage — albeit , yes , a conscious one — whose existence is accidental and , thus , objectively purposeless .
We certainly can imbue our lives with personal , subjective meaning , and we can assign personal , subjective value to those we love , but none of those things can be considered an actual fact : not in the same way the speed of light in vacuum can be so considered .
“ Value ” is a concept that requires an assigner or assessor .
As noted , one atomic assemblage can assign value to another one , but , inasmuch as any living creature is destined to die — and , in the grand cosmic scope , to do so almost immediately — any value assignment is ephemeral : not enduring ... factual ... objective .
On the universal scale , none of us matters and none of us is significant , thus undercutting the consequentiality of any value assessment any of us might assign .
Essentially , all of this is to say that if one meaningless , insignificant thing declares another meaningless , insignificant thing important to it , that importance , itself , is meaningless and insignificant by extension , since importance cannot come from unimportance , nor the meaningful from the meaningless .
It is with all of this in mind that I proffer moral nihilism .
To call an action — any action — righteous or wicked is to imply that the action is a significant one and , moreover , either comports with or transgresses an established moral code .
Again , though , there is no reason to believe that significance can arise from insignificance , making it quite difficult to say that any action undertaken by any human has a moral dimension .
To whom might human actions matter ?
To other humans ?
That is to suggest , to other accidental atomic assemblages whose vanishingly brief existence will ultimately come to nothing ?
Well , on the scale of the universe , so what ?
The question also arises of against whose moral code human behavior might transgress .
In the absence of god , there is no moral code handed down from on high .
Those who subscribe to the superstition of actual , objective morality must be appealing to some source of right and wrong ....
There is , of course , the natural moral framework inculcated by Darwinian evolution , which essentially is a utilitarian code intended to permit survival and , most importantly , gene propagation .
Richard Dawkins , in The Greatest Show on Earth , gives an illuminating explication of natural selection , writing , “ It is all about the survival of self - replicating instructions for self - replication . ”
He continues , “ Viruses and tigers are both built by coded instructions whose ultimate message is , like a computer virus , ‘ Duplicate me . ’
In the case of the cold virus , the instruction is executed rather directly .
A tiger ’s DNA is also a ‘ duplicate me ’ program , but it contains an almost fantastically large digression as an essential part of the efficient execution of its fundamental message .
That digression is a tiger , complete with fangs , claws , running muscles , stalking and pouncing instincts .
The tiger ’s DNA says , ‘ Duplicate me by the round - about route of building a tiger first . ’”
This is whence objective , prescriptive morality is meant to come ?
The whole purpose of Darwinian evolution , as Dawkins writes , is gene propagation .
There is no right or wrong ... no virtue or wickedness ... just cool , unfeeling , ruthless efficiency .
A human being is no less a fantastically large digression than a tiger is ; we just like to enchant our existence with delusions of meaningfulness .
The evidence is unmistakable :
There are no gods , no revealed religion comports with reality , human existence is wholly accidental , no human being — either singularly or as a collective — has any enduring meaning or value , and morality is but a useful illusion inculcated into us by Darwinian means in order that our genes might be more effectively propagated .
This is simultaneously diminishing and liberating , much as the realization that we are organic products of the universe — stardust from long - dead worlds — is at once humbling and exhilarating .
We live in a world with no “ shoulds ” and no “ oughts ” ... no “ shouldn'ts ” and no “ ought nots . ”
None of it matters , and none shall be remembered .
One might as well have fun — if one chooses , that is — because , in the last analysis , one is only answerable to oneself .
PCはもういらない？
最近の大学生は携帯メールでレポートを書くらしい
「最近の大学生は授業のレポートも携帯メールで送って来るんだよ」。奈良先端科学技術大学院大学
教授の砂原秀樹氏はこう苦笑いする。ある年齢以上の人にとってはPCを使った電子メールがまずあって、その後に携帯メールが登場した。しかし、いまの大学生世代ではまず携帯メールに触れ、その後、PCメールを始める人が多いのだ。ガートナー ジャパンは 「今後5年で電子メール利用が半減する」とも予測しているが、電子メールの将来は……。
砂原氏は、理事を務め るMozilla Japanの3月9日の記者会見後、記者にコメントした。砂原氏は「大学生は1000字くらいのレポートでも平気で携帯メールで送ってくる。ぼくの授業では携帯メールのレポートは禁止しているけど、学生にとっては携帯メールが普通になっている」と語る。国内ではインターネットに接続する端末で、携帯電話がすでにPCを上回っている。インターネットの主役はPCではなく、携帯電話が担いつつあるのだ。
ガートナーのリサーチ IT デマンド・リサーチ担当 リサーチ ディレクター 志賀嘉津 士 氏 は2006 年 11月 、 「今後5年でビジネスワーカーの電子メール利用が半減する」と予測した。既存の電子メールは線的なつながりで、複数間でのコミュニケーションが難しい。SNSやブログが電子メールの代替となり、「複数人とのコミュニティ構築や顧客とのホットラインなどに利用されるだろう」と推測する。
考えてみればPCの電子メールはあまりに多くの役割を持たされている。1対1のコミュニケーションが基本のはずだが、ファイルを添付したり、システムと組み合わせたり、複数間での意見調整に使われたりと、担っている役割は、多い。
電子メールのコア技術がすでに成熟しつつあるといわれる中、過剰な利用の弊害が出てきているのも事実だろう。企業では情報漏えいを警戒し、社員の電子メール利用を監視するケースが増えてきている。PCメールの役割をほかのコミュニケーション手段に適切に振り分ける、“メール利用のリストラ”が必要かもしれない。

Some Lib Dems have doubts over Sir Menzies ' position
Carbon debate
Environment spokesman Chris Huhne said tackling global warming would need an " enormous economic change " .
He set out plans to make Britain carbon neutral by 2050 at the party 's annual conference in Brighton .
The Lib Dems are trying to regain the initiative after high profile Tory and Labour green announcements .
Look you need a thick skin in this business ... and the one thing the public does see through is if you try to be something you are not
Sir Menzies Campbell
At -a- glance : Day one Send us your comments
Mr Huhne warned that climate change means " far more wild weather " following the devastating floods over the summer .
Setting out his " green vision " , Mr Huhne warned there was little time left to change the way people live .
Some of the other key proposals in the Liberal Democrats ' Zero Carbon Britain plan are :
Introduce green mortgages to encourage more environmentally friendly homes
Charging lorries to use the UK 's roads in order to double rail investment , possibly creating a high speed line running north to south
Boosting spending on flood defences to respond to climate change
Encouraging microgeneration by paying a higher rate to producers who export energy to the National Grid
Creating a climate change levy of £ 10 on domestic flights
The conference voted to reject a call by MEP Chris Davies to end the party 's opposition to nuclear power .
Before his conference speech , Mr Huhne told reporters : " With these plans we can restructure the economy towards a basis that is based on renewable energy not on fossil fuels .
" It 's an enormous economic change but it's an economic change in line with changes which we 've seen in the past , for example between the end of the 19th Century and beginning of the 20th Century moving from steam power to the petrol engine , moving from gas light to electric light . "
Mr Huhne 's proposals received the overwhelming backing of the party conference .
Nuclear motion
Lib Dem leader Sir Menzies Campbell said his party was the only one to stand up and say what has to be done to address climate change .
" We should be working towards a carbon - neutral Britain by 2050 .
We should be working towards the elimination of petrol - driven motor cars , " he told BBC1 's Breakfast programme .
" We should be really radical in what we do - the urgency of the problem is really enormous . "
The conference motion says the scientific evidence for climate change is " overwhelming " and that " if decisive action is not taken in the next decade , any prospect of a stable climate may be lost " .
This is being challenged by Chris Davies , the party 's climate change spokesman in the European Parliament .
Unfair
He said : " I have always been opposed to nuclear power .
It is expensive , creates a legacy of radioactive waste and has absorbed public resources that should have been used to develop alternative technologies .
" But the imperative now is to fight global warming .
We cannot ignore the fact that our existing nuclear power stations do not release carbon dioxide .
" Carbon emissions will rise as they come to the end of their lives . "
Meanwhile , Lib Dem Treasury spokesman Vincent Cable attacked the government over the Northern Rock crisis .
He unveiled research suggesting voters believe the wealth gap in the UK is unfair .
Hear more on the Lib Dem 's views on airport runways and petrol taxation in a Newsnight interview with Sir Menzies Campbell - Monday 17 September , 2230 BST , BBC Two .
The Dawn mission to the asteroid belt passed a critical test last weekend , exercising its gentle , yet reliable , ion-propulsion system to accelerate its mission to two destinations during an eight - year voyage through our solar system .
The key : Ion propulsion only needs a tenth of the fuel of a chemical rocket system to reach the same destination , and that means a smaller rocket – and a lot less fuel – is needed to launch missions , such as the Dawn probe .
The miserly use of propellant will allow the Dawn probe to become the first to orbit two separate objects – in this case , the asteroid Vesta in 2011 and the dwarf planet Ceres , where it 's expected to arrive in 2015 .
Ion propulsion uses positively charged atoms , or ions , to propel a spacecraft .
An electron gun is used to knock electrons from a reservoir of xenon atoms , turning them into ions .
Then , two charged plates accelerate the ions and eject them from the back of the rocket engine at speeds of 35 kilometers per second , or about 77,000 mph .
To avoid accumulating a negative charge , the probe shoots electrons back into the stream of xenon ions leaving the engine .
Pushing a probe farther into space on a light stream of atoms is a trade - off .
While it is 10 times more efficient than chemical propulsion , and thus only requires a tenth of the fuel needed by a chemical thruster , it also lacks power .
Marc Rayman , chief engineer on the Dawn mission , has dubbed ion propulsion " acceleration with patience . "
" The force of the ion thruster on the spacecraft is comparable to the weight of a single sheet of paper , " he stated in an online explanation of the technology .
" So here is an ion propulsion experiment you may conduct safely at home :
Hold a piece of paper in your hand , and you will feel the same force that the ion thruster exerts . "
If the craft 's ion engine continuously thrusts for 24 hours , the probe will only expend 10 oz . of xenon .
( It carries more than 900 lbs . )
To go from zero to 60 mph takes the Dawn probe nearly four days .
Yet the probe 's thruster is 10 times more efficient than a chemical thruster .
A typical chemical spacecraft could accelerate to 1 kps in about 20 minutes , but would require 300 kg of propellant , according to Rayman .
The Dawn spacecraft 's ion propulsion system could attain the same speed with only 25 kg of xenon , but would take nearly 100 days of continuous thrust to reach that velocity .
Based on concepts dreamed up by rocket scientists nearly a century ago , ion propulsion has been used in just four interplanetary spacecraft , including the Dawn probe .
But if the technology continues to prove itself , manned and unmanned missions will explore more of the solar system for less money , according to Chris Russell , a professor of geophysics and space physics at UCLA and principal investigator of the Dawn mission team .
" We initially modeled the mission and found that if we did it chemically , there is no rocket in our arsenal that would allow us to go to two objects , " Russell said .
" The cost of launch , the cost of operations and the cost of the spacecraft is just about $ 450 million .
With a chemical system , it would have been three times more . "
In 1998 , Deep Space 1 became the first spacecraft to use ion propulsion to reach destinations in the solar system .
Using more than 160 lbs. of xenon , the probe debuted a dozen new technologies and flew by two asteroids , operating its ion engine for 678 days – the longest any propulsion system had been continuously run .
The Dawn mission is expected to surpass that record .
" Ion propulsion has come of age now , " said John Brophy , project element manager for the Dawn ion propulsion system at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory .
" It has been around for a long time .
But it pretty much is the system of choice for ( keeping satellites in orbit ) and for certain types of deep space missions . "
While the space program has only recently adopted the technology , the theories are not new .
Noted rocket scientist Robert Goddard first suggested a propulsion system using electric fields to accelerate charged ions as early as 1906 .
And , like much of modern rocket science , the technology owes part of its founding to Wernher von Braun , once a Nazi scientist who created the V - 2 program for Hitler .
The United States snuck him out of Germany during the scramble for rocket technology at the end of World War II before the Soviets could .
Von Braun led the American response to the Soviet Union 's Sputnik launch in 1957 .
His mentor , Hermann Oberth , had suggested as early as 1930 that electric propulsion could be used for space flight .
After reaching the United States , von Braun requested that a colleague , Ernst Stuhlinger , look into possible applications of the theories .
The research continued until the 1960s , when the United States pushed aside electric propulsion efforts in favor of the chemical rockets needed to reach the Moon .
The Dawn spacecraft uses giant solar panels – the largest ever to grace an unmanned probe – to generate the electricity needed to power the engines .
As the probe moves farther from the sun , however , the arrays will not produce enough energy for the craft to operate at the highest throttle levels .
For that reason , future deep - space probes may need to be powered by nuclear generators .
" As humankind engages in ever more ambitious missions in deep space , opening our frontiers , revealing otherwise inaccessible vistas , and seeking answers to new and more exciting questions about the cosmos , the tremendous capability of ion propulsion will be an essential ingredient , " Rayman stated online .
Tests will continue for the next two months to evaluate the performance of the systems .
Amazing Beer Tricks
for some reason my friend Greg became obsessed recently with popping the bottom out of a beer bottle by hitting the mouth of it with your hand while it had water in it .
he said he ’d seen someone do it online .
after all trying it for like a half hour we all thought it was impossible , but then Joey was finally able to break it .
after seeing that , we all were eventually able to do it ( except for Greg , ironically ) .
it ’ll be a fun party trick to use at some point , as long as the host doesnt care about shattered glass all over their living room .
it got me thinking though , theres gotta be a ton of crazy beer tricks you can do , and they ’re probably all chronicled on youTube .
so , heres what I found :
( oh , and uh try these at your own peril )
this is the trick we did ( uh , thats not us tho ) ^
awesome ^
and theres zillions more out there but i dont have the time .
post them in the comments if you want to

A scientist takes forensic samples from a honeybee colony to find the cause of the mysterious ‘ colony collapse disorder ’ ( Image : ARS / USDA / Jay Evans )
The mysterious disappearance of droves of honeybees in the US may be down to an imported virus , suggests a new study .
Beekeepers have witnessed a dramatic drop in their bee numbers since autumn 2006 , though some saw signs as far back as 2004 .
Now a genetic analysis of more than 50 honeybee colonies suggests that a virus called Israeli acute paralysis virus ( IAPV ) might be behind this bizarre phenomenon .
Experts say they have “ circumstantial evidence ” linking the arrival of honeybee imports from Australia with the emergence of IAPV in the States .
First identified in Israel in 2004 , IAPV causes bees to develop shivering wings and eventually become paralysed , leading to death just outside the hive .

Scientists are quick to add , however , that a great deal of research remains necessary to know whether the virus truly is to blame .
About 50 % to 90 % of commercial honeybee colonies in the US have suffered from colony collapse disorder ( CCD ) – a strange phenomenon in which entire bee populations disappear from a colony within a matter of days , sometimes leaving behind only the queen and a few stragglers .
The bee die - off has sparked great concern as these insects play an essential role in the pollination of more than 90 fruit and vegetables worldwide .
Experts place the value of these crops at $ 14.6 billion in the US alone .

In recent months entomologists have pointed to a wide range of potential explanations for CCD – blaming everything from heavy pesticide use , to genetically modified crops , and even radiation from mobile phones .
To help unravel the mystery , Jeffery Pettis at the Bee Research Laboratory of the US Department of Agriculture in Beltsville , Maryland and his collaborators collected genetic samples from 51 colonies across the US , 30 of which had been devastated by CCD .
By comparing the gene fragments they found against the recently published honeybee genome sequence , Pettis and his colleagues quickly spotted the presence of foreign DNA belonging to the Israeli acute paralysis virus .
Among all the pathogens they identified , only IAPV was tightly linked to colony collapse – the virus appeared in all of the 30 colonies devastated by CCD , but only one of the apparently healthy colonies .
Imported bees
Because the US started allowing bee imports from Australia in 2004 – around the time that bees started dying in the states – the scientists also tested the genes of apparently healthy bees imported from Australia as well .
These tests identified the presence of IAPV in the Australian sample , hinting that the imports might be to blame .
The new insights into IAPV are “ a step forward ” according to Daniel Weaver , president of the American Beekeeping Federation .
For now , all researchers have is an association between the virus and CCD .
Future experiments in the lab will prove whether it can in fact cause healthy bees to develop the bizarre hive - deserting behaviour seen in CCD .
“ At this point it ’s still circumstantial evidence because their samples were from very sick bees , ” entomologist Greg Hunt at Purdue University in West Lafayette , Indiana , US says of the possible IAPV link .
Royal jelly
“ I think we have new leads , ” Pettis says of the bee disappearance .
“ I still believe multiple factors are involved in CCD . ”
He points out that the varroa mite , which is prevalent in the US , weakens the immune system of bees , perhaps making them susceptible to IAPV .
This could also help explain why bees infected with IAPV in Australia where the mite is absent do not show as dramatic changes in their behaviour , say scientists .
The authors of the paper also note that the Israeli acute paralysis virus strain in the US might have a slightly different genetic sequence making it more virulent than the IAPV found elsewhere .
Scientists are consulting with the US Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to determine whether the country should consider blocking honeybee imports from Australia that carry IAPV .
And since Pettis and his colleagues found traces of IAPV in Chinese “ royal jelly ” – a type of honeybee secretion used to feed the insects – they are considering whether US beekeepers should cease using this foreign product too .

Not that you needed any kind of study to prove that your shiny new personal stun gun was safe to use , but Dr. William Bozeman and colleagues have just wrapped up an independent study that " suggests the devices are safe , causing a low occurrence of serious injuries . "
The research was conducted at Wake Forest University , and it showed that out of " nearly 1,000 cases , 99.7 - percent of those subjected to a taser had mild injuries , such as scrapes and bruises , or none at all , " while the remaining sliver received injuries severe enough to warrant a trip to the hospital .
Granted , Dr. Bozeman did admit that tasers could " clearly cause injuries and even deaths in some cases , " but insinuated that the risk was quite low .
Tase on , we guess .

Summary : A site did most things right , but still had a miserable 14 % success rate for its most important task .
The reason ?
Users ignored a key area because it resembled a promotion .
Putting the answer to a typical user 's main question in big red type at the top of your homepage would guarantee high usability , right ?
Wrong — at least for the U.S. Census Bureau 's homepage , where 86 % of users failed to find the country 's current population when it was presented in large red numbers .
Homepage for www.census.gov, as tested .
In a reduced screenshot , the population count is the only information that 's clearly readable , so it makes the task easier than it is in real life .
On the actual site , users often ignored the big red characters .
The following heatmap from one of our eyetracking studies shows how users looked at this homepage .
Their task was to find the current population of the United States .
The areas users looked at the most are colored red ;
the yellow areas indicate fewer views , followed by the least - viewed blue areas .
Gray areas did n't attract any fixations .
At first , the heatmap seems fine :
users scanned the main parts of the page ,
the categorization of the main content area worked particularly well , and
users gave considerable attention to the Population Clock and the Population Finder .
On closer inspection , however , it 's clear that users only fixated on the first third of the number that shows current population .
In other words , people scanned that area , but did n't actually read the number .
( Only a small percentage — as indicated by blue coloring — looked at the last 2/3 of the number . )
Where People Looked
As the following pie chart shows , only 14 % of participants used the Population Clock to answer the question .
None of the remaining users found the correct answer , though most did find the population for an earlier year somewhere inside the site .
How users reacted to the Population Clock in the upper right of the Census homepage .
Only 14 % of test participants used this feature when asked to find the current population .
Most people saw the feature , but did n't use it to complete the task .
Although it 's not the major reason this homepage design failed , banner blindness does play a role here .
Users tend to ignore heavily formatted areas because they look like advertisements .
Thus , about 1/3 of users never even saw the Population Clock .
However , most people did fixate on this area because it's not as overly formatted as most promotional features .
So , most users saw the Population Clock ; they just did n't use it , even though it contained the exact information they were looking for .
Beyond banner blindness , the major reason this homepage failed is that it used made - up terms or branded descriptions rather than plain - spoken words .
Terms like " Population Clock , " " Population Finder , " and " QuickFacts " are not as descriptive as a simple line of text that says :
Population of the United States : 302,740,627 ( as of Aug. 31 , 2007 )
Search - Dominant Users and Other Behaviors
The heatmap above is averaged across users , so it's not the best way to analyze the Census homepage 's usability .
In this case , there were 4 distinct user behaviors at play , and we need to analyze each separately .
The following gaze plots show examples of the 4 main classes of user behavior :
Each gaze plot shows one user 's eye movements :
each blue dot is a fixation , with bigger dots indicating longer periods of looking .
Plot A shows a classic search - dominant user .
This user looked around the page briefly and then went straight to search .
This was the predominant behavior in this study , accounting for 57 % of users .
The specific user shown in gaze plot A did n't look at the Population Clock at all ; other search - dominant users had a few fixations in that area , but quickly abandoned it in their dash for the search box .
( Note that even this very search - dominant user took a quick look at all the other parts of the page — such as the left - hand navbar and the main content categories — but never looked at the right column with the ad - like areas .
The user also stopped scanning the navbar when it turned into a graphical promotion and stopped scanning the content categories above the banner promoting a new survey .
Banner blindness in action . )

Plot B shows a navigation - dominant user .
This user looked at the navigation options — both in the center of the page and down the left - hand navbar — before clicking on the most promising link .
Navigation - dominance was a rare behavior in this study ; it 's more common on sites that do n't feature homepage tools , such as those that attracted users in plots C and D .

Many sites do n't have such interactive features , but when they do exist , they tend to attract a good proportion of users : people like parts of websites where they can do something and thus feel in control ( even though they often fail , because of poor application usability ) .

Plot D shows a successful user who found and used the Population Clock to answer the question .
This specific user was actually a search - dominant user , as indicated by the many early fixations in the search area .
However , just before searching , the user was drawn to the Population Clock screen area and gradually engaged with it enough to realize that it contained the answer , freeing the user from having to search .
( Also note the long fixation on the " Census 2000 " logo in the upper left of the content area : many users considered — or even clicked — this option , but of course it led to numbers that were 7 years out of date . )
Sadly , in this case , neither search , nor navigation , nor the Population Finder led the majority of users to the correct answer .
Indeed , search was particularly bad on this site .
One user said , " I know where I can probably find it faster : Google , " and promptly abandoned the official Census Bureau site 's own search .
( In fact , she did find a reasonable — though less accurate — answer on another site using an external search . )
Although most users found some population number , whether from 2000 , 2005 , or 2006 , it was n't the current number .
As one might expect from the Census Bureau , the site was rife with population statistics .
The problem was that the outdated statistics were n't supplemented with links to the current numbers , violating the guideline to situate follow - ups in context .
Conflicting Usability Guidelines ?
The Internet manager in charge of this losing design might defend the work by pointing out that it complies with # 4 of my top - 10 guidelines for homepage design :
Offer a clear starting point for the main tasks users will undertake when visiting the site .
Clearly , something was done right , with a task analysis that concluded that it would be a primary goal of visitors to this site to identify the current population of the United States and to have an easy way to find the populations of individual states and cities .
Even better , the site follows several recommendations from the full list of published homepage usability guidelines :
Guideline # 4 : Emphasize the highest priority tasks so that users have a clear starting point .
so that users have a clear starting point .
Guideline # 29 : Use examples to reveal the site 's content .
Rather than just describing what the site offers , the Census homepage states the actual population number .
Juicy content for this type of site .
.
Rather than just describing what the site offers , the Census homepage states the actual population number .
Juicy content for this type of site .
Guideline # 53 : Offer tools for high - priority tasks directly on the homepage .
The Population Finder is exactly such a tool , and obviously attracted users .
( We also asked people to find the population of Texas , and the success rate was much higher for this task . )
( This site does many other things right ; here I 'm listing only those guidelines directly related to finding the population number . )
Despite obeying so many usability guidelines , the site has the miserably low success rate of 14 % for its most important task .
The site fails users because it violates several other guidelines for homepage usability :
Guideline # 19 : Do n't use clever phrases and marketing lingo .
and marketing lingo .
Guideline # 63 : Limit font styles and other text formatting .
and other text formatting .
Guideline # 91 : Do n't look like an ad .
So what good are usability guidelines if — as this example seems to show — they are always in conflict ?
Actually , the guidelines do n't contradict each other when it comes to the Census homepage .
( Sometimes we do have conflicting guidelines , as in the matter of intranet staff directories .
That 's why we call them guidelines : because they are n't always firm and sometimes require interpretation or , in rare cases , deviation . )
In this case , though , it 's possible to feature the high - priority tasks , show the main number directly on the homepage , and have a tool for the rest without using marketing - style terms , heavy formatting , and otherwise making the important area look like an ad or a promotion .
That is , the designer could have followed all 6 guidelines simultaneously .
In many studies of corporate and e-commerce sites , we observe users ignoring the very page sections that have the most business value because the site is selling them too hard .
Learn from the Census Bureau 's mistake : try a softer approach with more straightforward , user - centered information .
Let go of the fancy formatting and the fancy words .
Murtha : Iraq
War incites homegrown terror groups
David Edwards and Josh Catone
Published : Sunday June 3 , 2007 Print This Email This
Rep. John Murtha ( D - PA ) , on ABC 's morning news show This Week , argued that the US presence in Iraq is being used by al Qaeda as a recruitment tool .
When asked by host George Stephanopoulos if " homegrown terrorist plots , " like the one to attack JFK airport , were " being inspired by the US work in Iraq , " Murtha responded , " Absolutely . "
" Our presence in Iraq , our occupation of Iraq gives these people the inspiration , " continued Murtha about terrorists planning to carry out attacks on US interests .
" We did n't have this kind of a problem before , they came from Afghanistan , but now we even have them in the United States .
So I 'm absolutely convinced that this is the kind of thing that inspires these people . "
" We did have 9/11 before we went into Iraq , " said Stephanopoulos .
" Yeah , we had 9/11 , " replied Murtha , " but that came from Afghanistan .
There was no al Qaeda in Iraq . "

Who made reddit ?
Today I noticed that Aaron Swartz ’s name is missing from the list of those who made reddit .
For some reasons I think the name is missing on purpose .
When I read Aaron ’s post Office Space , I felt the same as I felt When I read How Software Company Dies .
These are the mistakes done every day everywhere by so called decision makers .
As far as I can tell , in my opinion , firing Aaron Swartz is one of the biggest mistake a software company can make .
There are n’t many Aarons in the universe , and if you were lucky enough to came across one , and shake his hand , leave your hand at there , that is , do n’t let the person go .
It seems like the guys at Wired probably do n’t get it .

Letters from a Christian extremist last week threatened the lives of evolution biology professors at the University of Colorado at Boulder .
The letters claimed to be on behalf of a group , but newspapers and at least one blog have reported that an individual , Michael Korn , a Jew - turned - Christian extremist , is likely behind the threats ( an image from his web site is at right ) .
CU police spokesman Brad Wiesley told me they have n't officially named a suspect but the Colorado Daily wrote that others " close to the case " named Korn .
The Colorado Daily describes some of the perpetrator 's escapades :
Last weekend more than a dozen envelopes bearing the image of skull and crossbones and containing letters threatening the lives of
CU - Boulder evolutionary biology professors were slipped under the doors of CU - Boulder buildings … .
Several sources say Korn has distributed flyers on campus and has barged into offices of biology professors and administrators in the past year .
But in recent days the threatening e-mails and letters have occurred with increasing frequency and intensity .
On Friday an e-mail sent to CU - Boulder ’s evolutionary biology department bore the subject line " a final CU Boulder EBIO appeal ” and repeated the line " every true Christian should be ready and willing to take up arms to kill the enemies of Christian society . "
That line , as well as “ they must go , ” have been repeated in a number of communiqués , said a source .
The Panda 's Thumb posted the letters last week .
It still seems a bit early to be implicating Korn .
Wiesley said police are interviewing people and trying to determine whether criminal charges are appropriate .
On Korn 's blog profile , just fyi , he describes his occupation as " fisher of men " and his industry as " publishing . "
God help us .
His favorite movies are " Forrest Gump , The Jesus Film and The Passion of the Christ . "
I have a call and email in to Korn , will keep you posted .

Should You Improve Your Life or Watch Television ?
If you ’re happy with the way things are going in your life , you can stop reading and change the channel to some other site .
If on the other hand , there are things about your life that you ’d like to change then stay tuned and turn up the volume : )
TV Schedule
I was listening to some co-workers talk yesterday about the upcoming fall TV schedule and could n’t believe the conversation they were having .
As they planned out their evenings based around TV shows they reserved 3 hours of their life a night plus a few hours on weekends .
Based on their schedule , they ’ll spend 15 - 20 hours a week in front of the TV this fall .
Time is Money
I do n’t know about you but I would LOVE to find an extra 15 - 20 hours throughout my week to do something productive .
For example , I ’ve been neglecting my eBay business lately due to other projects and sales have fallen as a result .
If I spent 15 - 20 hours a week working on it , I could make hundreds of dollars more a month !
Check out this great article on the Opportunity Cost of Watching TV .
Improving Your Life
Of course using your time wisely can be about many things other than making money .
Think about some of the New Year ’s Resolutions you ’ve come up with over the years that you have n’t achieved .
If you ’d have spent 15 - 20 hours a week working towards them do n’t you think you probably would have been successful in reaching more of the goals ?
Take a look at some of the things people decide they want to do :
Lose Weight
Learn a New Skill
Get a New Job
Get Out of Debt
Travel the World
More Family Time
Get More Sleep
Do n’t these all sound like better things to do than watching television ?
The TV Trap
I ’m horrible about walking through a room and getting sucked into a TV program but I do my best to fight off the tractor beam of the TV as it pulls me in .
It is nice to spend 30 minutes zoning out in front of the television but it ’s so easy for 30 minutes to turn into several hours .
One of my least favorite feelings is when I get up from the TV and I realize I ’ve wasted the night away in front of the screen .
Break Free from TV
Just remember , most anytime you hear a radio report or read an article about someone reaching their goals despite the odds or accomplishing some great feat , that person likely did n’t do it by sitting in front of the television .
Keep that in mind next time you think you hear your entertainment center calling your name .
WASHINGTON - JULY 26 - Green Party leaders reaffirmed the party ’s support for impeachment of President Bush and Vice President Cheney and demand for immediate withdrawal of US forces from Iraq , and sharply criticized Democratic Party leaders for retreating on impeachment and troop withdrawal .
Greens also demanded that Congress act to repeal President Bush ’s July 17 executive order titled “ Blocking Property of Certain Persons Who Threaten Stabilization Efforts in Iraq , ” which effectively outlaws antiwar protest by allowing the White House to confiscate the financial assets of anyone who openly opposes the war .

Introduction
Buddhism is a subject I knew almost nothing about until I stumbled across it on E2 .
There is quite a bit of information on the topic here and I 've taken to studying it , both on and off E2 .
As it turns out , once I got past my own misconceptions about the practice , Buddhism seems to be very similar to my own view of the world .
My Own Misconceptions
First and foremost , I am what most people would call an atheist or nontheist .
I had thought that since many people refer to Buddhism as a religion that it required a belief in some sort of deity that I could n't see .
Buddhism is actually a bring - your - own - deity philosophy .
Buddhism does n't supply any deities for you , but you can have your own if you like .
No one is going to get upset about it either way .
Another misconception I held about Buddhism was that Buddhists are all vegetarian .
I knew that Buddhists are supposed to refrain from killing things , even ants and such , so it stands to reason that they would n't eat meat since it would require the death of an animal .
It turns out many Buddhists , even some Buddhist monks , eat meat .
There are a couple of great nodes about this under Buddhist vegetarians .
For various reasons I do eat meat , although I would probably never kill an animal myself or directly cause one to be killed for my diet .
My third ( and just plain silly ) misconception was that Buddhists would n't like my gun collection .
I enjoy target shooting and do n't own guns so I can kill people or animals ( I do n't hunt ) .
So it stands to reason that my guns are n't specifically offensive to Buddhists .
I have n't confirmed this with actual Buddhists , so if you are one and / or happen to know how Buddhists get along with guns , please enlighten me .
Becoming a Buddhist
So what does it take to become a Buddhist ?
Most of the sources I 've found on this question indicate that you simply have to declare yourself a Buddhist and try to accept the teachings of Buddha .
Fortunately Buddhism is big on lists and there are three main checklists of Buddha 's teachings , at least for lay - Buddhists ( for monks the lists are more complicated and are n't covered here ) .
The simplified lists ( with links to the more complicated versions ) are shown below .
The Four Noble Truths
The Buddha taught four truths , as follows :
All beings are subject to suffering
The cause of suffering is ignorance Ignorance , the cause of suffering , can be overcome
The way to overcome ignorance is the Eightfold Path
There are many translations of the word " ignorance " in item two , sometimes people say it is " cravings " or " desire " .
Any of the words seem to fit well .
The Eightfold Path
I 'll leave it to real Buddhists to explain the Eightfold Path , however it is my understanding that " right " is n't quite the proper translation and you may want to substitute the words " harmonious " or " appropriate " in its place in this list :
Right understanding Right thought Right speech Right action Right livelihood Right effort Right mindfulness Right concentration
The Five Precepts
And finally , there are The Five Precepts , which are a sort of code of conduct for Buddhists to follow :
To abstain from killing living beings
To abstain from taking things not freely given
To abstain from sexual misconduct
To abstain from false speech
To abstain from intoxicating drinks and drugs causing heedlessness
Of course this is where I get into trouble , as noted in the title of this node .
I live in a house in the woods which has a neverending supply of spiders .
Big , hairy , nasty , icky ones .
I 've killed 3 or 4 huge brown recluse spiders this week .
Brown recluse spiders have venom which is quite toxic to humans and is sometimes fatal .
It can also remain active in your body for years , causing great pain and illness .
And yes , I wad up paper towels and squish them as quickly as I can .
I do n't like spiders in my house .
My feelings toward spiders outside my house are quite different .
For example , if I come home from work and find a spider has created a new web across my front door , blocking the entrance to my home , I 'll use a stick to clear the web and gently place the spider out in the woods .
Furthermore I drink beer fairly often and , once every ten years or so , indulge in various mind - altering drugs .
All the rest of the rules and truths and pathways I can handle .
So could I be a Buddhist ?
This leads me to my final misconception ...
Conclusion
My final misconception was that any of these rules or precepts or truths were absolute .
Buddhism does n't take itself too seriously .
Buddhism tries , and quite successfully at that , to prevent itself from getting in the way of you discovering your own truth .
None of the aformentioned rules are handed to you by an angry god who will punish you if you do n't get them right .
It seems like the goal of Buddhism is to help you find the path , but let you walk it at your own pace .
Having discovered all these things , I guess I am a Buddhist whether I admit it or not .
All of the above precepts and truths make sense to me .
I 'd like to try and understand them better .
And there are no mysterious hoops to jump through as part of being a Buddhist .
I do n't have to skip eating meat on Fridays , or go to confession , or even visit a temple .
I guess I 'll try and do something else with the spiders all over the place .
Maybe I should buy a cat ?
In history , the most important consequences are often the unintended ones .
We do not yet know the longer - term unintended consequences of Iraq .
Maybe there is a silver lining hidden somewhere in this cloud .
But as far as the human eye can see , the likely consequences of Iraq range from the bad to the catastrophic .
Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo have done terrible damage to the U.S. reputation for being humane ; this defeat will convince more people around the world that it is not even that powerful .
And Bin Laden , still alive , will claim another victory over the death - fearing weaklings of the West .
Even if there are no scenes of helicopters evacuating Americans from the roof of the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad , there will surely be some totemic photographic image of national humiliation as the U.S. struggles to extract its troops .
The U.S. has probably not yet fully woken up to the appalling fact that , after a long period in which the first motto of its military was " no more Vietnams , " it faces another Vietnam .
There are many important differences , but the basic result is similar :
The mightiest military in the world fails to achieve its strategic goals and is , in the end , politically defeated by an economically and technologically inferior adversary .
Osama bin Laden 's plan was to get the U.S. to overreact and overreach itself .
With the invasion of Iraq , Bush fell slap - bang into that trap .
The U.S. government 's own latest National Intelligence Estimate , released this week , suggests that Al Qaeda in Iraq is now among the most significant threats to the security of the American homeland .
For the United States , the world is now , as a result of the Iraq war , a more dangerous place .
At the end of 2002 , what is sometimes tagged " Al Qaeda Central " in Afghanistan had been virtually destroyed , and there was no Al Qaeda in Iraq .
In 2007 , there is an Al Qaeda in Iraq , parts of the old Al Qaeda are creeping back into Afghanistan and there are Al Qaeda emulators spawning elsewhere , notably in Europe .
In an article for the Web magazine Open Democracy , Middle East specialist Fred Halliday spells out some regional consequences .
Besides the effective destruction of the Iraqi state , these include the revitalizing of militant Islamism and enhancement of the international appeal of the Al Qaeda brand ; the eruption , for the first time in modern history , of internecine war between Sunni and Shiite , " a trend that reverberates in other states of mixed confessional composition " ; the alienation of most sectors of Turkish politics from the West and the stimulation of authoritarian nationalism there ; the strengthening of a nuclear - hungry Iran ; and a new regional rivalry pitting the Islamic Republic of Iran and its allies , including Syria , Hezbollah and Hamas , against Saudi Arabia , Egypt and Jordan .
I listened to some of the all - night debate about Iraq .
For some reason , whenever I turned on CSPAN , Republicans were speaking , and they talked about a whole range of horrors that would happen if we withdraw .
Some seem to me less likely : I think there 's a good chance that al Qaeda in Iraq will not gain a permanent base of operations within Iraq , at least not one that will outlast the chaos there .
But others are quite likely .
There will be horrific violence .
Families will be driven into internal or external exile .
Al Qaeda will claim victory .
And there could well be a regional war .
I think about this , and about the absolutely puerile debate that preceded our decision whether to go to war , and I ask myself : how did it happen that everyone who actually predicted these sorts of consequences was successfully portrayed as a defeatist , a person who just did n't care about the children who died at Halabja or their parents who vanished into Abu Ghraib and were never heard from again , a wimp who preferred staying on the good side of the French ( quel horreur ! ) to facing down bin Laden , or a traitor who must have secretly welcomed 9/11 , if indeed s/he had noticed it at all ?
The consequences Timothy Garton Ash describes -- or at least , consequences broadly like them -- were predictable at the time .
Of course a war against Iran 's deadliest enemy in the region would strengthen Iran , especially if it kept American troops pinned down within handy reach of Iranian operatives .
Of course a democracy would be hard to build in Iraq , not because " Arabs are not suited for democracy " , but because the habits of mind that constitute respect for the rule of law and a willingness to work within an established political system do not spring into being overnight after being crushed for decades .
Of course this would play into bin Laden 's hands , both by diverting resources and attention away from Afghanistan and by making the story he had been telling about America and its designs on the Muslim world come true .
So why were the people who warned us about this -- James Webb , Brent Scowcroft , and others -- at best ignored , and at worst mocked by people without a fraction either of their experience or of their judgment ?
Why did so many people choose to listen instead to the likes of Michael Ledeen and Jonah Goldberg ?
I do n't really know , but here are a few lessons I hope we learn .
(1) It seems to me that our country went slightly crazy after 9/11 , and one of the manifestations of that craziness was a tendency to say , about anyone who suggested stopping to think about much of anything , that that person just had n't absorbed the lessons of 9/11 , had n't been there , had n't fully grasped how horrific it was .
Anyone who has even the slightest iota of this tendency should , I think , engrave on his or her forehead :
When something truly awful happens , and you find yourself in the presence of real danger , it is more important than ever to stop and think clearly about what you are about to do .
The temptations to do something stupid are much greater than usual , and the risks are much higher .
Going with the flow and doing what comes naturally might be winning strategies at a party ; they are profoundly dangerous when considering going to war .
Since the people who do stop and think are likely to be rarer than usual , in moments of national crisis they should be cherished , not abused or slandered .
(2) Never substitute impugning someone 's character for impugning his or her argument .
This was , if memory serves , a pretty standard move back in 2002 : the fact of someone 's opposition to the war was taken to be conclusive evidence that that person was not serious about the war on terror , and their supposed lack of seriousness meant that their arguments did not have to be taken seriously .
There were , in addition , less obviously circular versions : I recall in particular the right - wing dismissal of Richard Clarke on the grounds that he was obviously a closet liberal after book royalties .
The closet liberal made me laugh -- the guy seemed to me to have " Republican : subcategory , national security hawk " written all over him .
And the book royalties part was just dumb : it amounts to the idea that no one who ever writes a book can ever be taken seriously again , since whatever they say , it could be that they are saying it to jack up their royalties .
The possibility that people sometimes both write books and speak out publicly because they have something they think it 's important to communicate , apparently , does n't need to be taken seriously .
(3) One of the greatest strengths of our country is the fact that we allow debate and dissent .
This means that if we choose to do so , we can debate policies before we adopt them , rather than first adopting them and only then , when it is too late , discovering the problems that a real debate might have made apparent .
Before we went to war , there were people who were trying to shut debate down by marginalizing or slandering or , in some cases , threatening those who disagreed with them .
( Dixie Chicks , anyone ? )
This is , of course , a hateful thing to do to those people .
But it should now be obvious that it is also a profound disservice to our country .
We would have been a lot better off if we had stayed true to our ideals of open debate and free speech .
(4) When the rest of the world thinks you 're crazy , it 's worth entertaining the possibility that they might be right .
We should not defer to their judgment mindlessly , but we should have what Jefferson called " a decent respect to the opinions of mankind . "
(5) Beware of movements built on contempt .
Many of the people who pushed for war had spent decades expressing their contempt for what you might call standard foreign policy -- the kind in which diplomacy is taken to be a useful instrument , not a snare for the weak - minded , and force is a last resort , not an all - purpose tool .
Their own views had never been seriously tested ( and no , Reagan does n't count ) , and many of their spokesmen lacked any serious experience conducting foreign policy .
Sometimes , groups of people who spend years muttering about how different things would be if they were in charge are right .
Often , however , they are not .
Absent a real track record on which to evaluate them , they should be approached with caution .
(6) Think very hard about the lessons of history .
For every case like Munich , in which failing to confront a dictator more forcefully led to disaster , there is a Cuban Missile Crisis , in which a leader 's unwillingness to make the most hawkish response to a dictator 's provocation averted disaster .
Trotting out Munich at every possible opportunity only ensures that the next time you find yourself in a Cuban Missile Crisis , your country will be turned to radioactive glass .
(7) Be very wary of extrapolating from the last few wars .
The Gulf War , for instance , looked effortless .
But that appearance had to be deceiving , like the way a ballerina seems to fly effortlessly several feet into the air , when in fact she is performing an extraordinarily strenuous feat of athleticism .
Our success in the Gulf War took tremendous amounts of training , discipline , and technology ; but it also took a real appreciation for the limits of military power .
Kicking an invading army out of a country in which it is not wanted is something that a good army can do .
But there are things that no army , however superbly trained and equipped , can possibly do .
One of them is creating a democracy .
As Matt Yglesias once wrote :
" There are actual limits to what our troops can accomplish .
They 're soldiers , not magicians .
They can't conjure up a sense of national identity or widespread social support for liberalism . "
If the people who argued for war have any forehead left after point ( 1 ) above , they should engrave " They 're soldiers , not magicians " on it as well .
(8) Never underestimate the value of an exit strategy .
By an exit strategy I do not mean the military plans for how , exactly , we might extricate our troops from Iraq , but a way of disengaging without seeming to have been beaten .
( In this case , without allowing bin Laden and the Iraqi insurgents to claim victory . )
There are times when it 's worth going to war without any clear idea of how to explain disengagement as anything other than defeat .
( World War II leaps to mind . )
There are also cases in which we can get away with assuming that we will not need one .
( Grenada . )
But in many cases , like Iraq , the possibilities of failure are real enough that we should consider how to deal with them , and the interests at stake are small enough that they are not worth gambling with our reputation for sticking it out until we win .
Anyone who watched the last years of the war in Vietnam unfold -- years during which it seemed plain that we were not going to win , and that our leaders knew that , but in which we lost tens of thousands of our soldiers ' lives , and God alone knows how many Vietnamese lives in an unsuccessful attempt to figure out how to leave without sacrificing our credibility -- will find the present rhetoric about not handing our opponents a victory familiar .
Far better , when vital national interests are not at stake , just not to get into wars that do not have a clear and achievable outcome .
The Gulf War did ; we achieved it , and our credibility was enhanced .
This war does not , and , as Republicans are fond of reminding us , when we withdraw , al Qaeda and any number of other Islamists will take it as a victory , and will conclude that we can be outlasted .
But that outcome is inevitable , unless we are willing to stay in Iraq forever , watching the men and women in our military die , along with more and more Iraqis .
This administration should have avoided it when it was avoidable , either by not invading in the first place or by moving heaven and earth to make our invasion successful .
Bush was not sufficiently worried about this prospect when he could have prevented it .
He did not seem to notice that we had no plan for the occupation , or that we did n't even have enough troops to guard the WMD sites that the war was supposedly all about , let alone to provide basic security for the Iraqis .
He did n't bother to ask whether we were finding the very best people we had to staff the CPA , rather than raiding the Heritage intern pool .
That can only mean that he never bothered to ask the most basic questions a President has to ask when success matters so much , both to us and to the Iraqis .
Not having bothered to take the most elementary steps to secure success when he might have had it , I find his present insistence on the horrific consequences of defeat galling ; and I think that everyone who hears them should think : Mr. President , this is your failure .
(9) In wars , there are very few do - overs , and in occupations there are almost none .
Occupations , in particular , are not like , say , Photoshop , where the handy " Undo " feature covers a multitude of sins .
They are more like relationships .
When I used to work at the battered women 's shelter , I heard a lot of stories about husbands who apparently believed that it was possible to undo the past : that having ( for instance ) cracked a woman 's skull against a concrete wall , it was possible to " just start over . "
( Similarly , many believed that it was possible to cancel out such episodes with a sufficiently large quantity of gifts , romantic dinners , diamonds , and so forth , as though a relationship was like a sum , and breaking your partner 's bones was just a very large negative number that required a lot of positive numbers to make up for it . )
I always found this attitude puzzling : there are some things that just cannot be erased , though they might be built over , the way a new city can be built on the ruined foundations of an old one .
Similarly , the success or failure of an occupation has a lot to do with the attitudes of the people you are occupying , and there are ways of damaging those attitudes that are very hard to undo .
The looting of Baghdad , for instance , probably destroyed for good the idea that America was powerful enough to provide security to the Iraqi people .
That idea might have been true had it not been so visibly falsified : after all , if enough people believe that it's not a good idea to break the law while you 're watching , lawlessness is much easier to contain .
But once it was gone , it was gone .
Likewise , a lot of the tactics that we seem to have used early on probably alienated a lot of Iraqis who might have believed in our good faith , and destroyed it permanently .
And the damage done by Abu Ghraib was incalculable .
So when I read , say , Victor Davis Hanson , who writes : " While few would believe there is any good news from Iraq , in fact , there is .
Finally , we are mastering counter - insurgency " , I think : it 's great that we are mastering counterinsurgency .
It 's wonderful that we will henceforth proceed in a way that will not unnecessarily increase the amount of support for insurgents .
But to suppose that this will turn things around not just here and there , but in the country as a whole , is to make the mistake of thinking that we can have a do - over .
We can't .
In war , I think , you do n't normally have the luxury of doing and redoing things until you get them right , unless your adversary is either willing to sit still while you experiment or somehow devoid of options .
Neither is true here .
We need to get it right the first time .
Eventually is n't good enough .
If we do n't have confidence that a President can do this , we should n't go to war .
( 10 ) Just because we 're going to war does n't mean we do n't need diplomacy .
In the specific case of Iraq , negotiations with Iran and Syria could have been very useful , if only because , had we been smart about it , we could have made clear to those countries that we had no plans to invade them , thereby depriving them of any reason to keep us bogged down in Iraq .
( Obviously , we would first have had to get rid of any such plans .
If we were going to invade Iraq , we should have : giving neighbors a reason to keep us bogged down is not a good thing . )
We could probably have done a lot more , for instance to get their cooperation in securing their borders ; but just removing their obvious interest in our having to stay in Iraq indefinitely would have helped immensely .
There are always reasons to engage other countries when one is thinking of going to war .
There are neighbors with borders , countries who supply the country one is thinking of going to war with , and all sorts of people who can either help or harm us in innumerable ways .
For this reason , we should be doubly skeptical about any war that would be waged by a President whose administration takes the attitude that they just do n't do diplomacy .

Offhand , these are the lessons I can think of -- the ones we might use if , God forbid , we ever find ourselves in a similar situation .
Do you have others ?
Any thoughts ?

A RECENT glance at the Low Countries revealed that , nearly three months after its latest general election , Belgium was still without a new government .
It may have acquired one by now .
But , if so , will anyone notice ?
And , if not , will anyone mind ?
Even the Belgians appear indifferent .
And what they think of the government they may well think of the country .
If Belgium did not already exist , would anyone nowadays take the trouble to invent it ?
Such questions could be asked of many countries .
Belgium 's problem , if such it is , is that they are being asked by the inhabitants themselves .
True , in opinion polls most Belgians say they want to keep the show on the road .
But when they vote , as they did on June 10th , they do so along linguistic lines , the French - speaking Walloons in the south for French - speaking parties , the Dutch - speaking Flemings in the north for Dutch - speaking parties .
The two groups do not get on —hence the inability to form a government .
They lead parallel lives , largely in ignorance of each other .
They do , however , think they know themselves : when a French - language television programme was interrupted last December with a spoof news flash announcing that the Flemish parliament had declared independence , the king had fled and Belgium had dissolved , it was widely believed .
No wonder .
The prime minister designate thinks Belgians have nothing in common except “ the king , the football team , some beers ” , and he describes their country as an “ accident of history ” .
In truth , it is n't .
When it was created in 1831 , it served more than one purpose .
It relieved its people of various discriminatory practices imposed on them by their Dutch rulers .
And it suited Britain and France to have a new , neutral state rather than a source of instability that might , so soon after the Napoleonic wars , set off more turbulence in Europe .
The upshot was neither an unmitigated success nor an unmitigated failure .
Belgium industrialised fast ; grabbed a large part of Africa and ruled it particularly rapaciously ; was itself invaded and occupied by Germany , not once but twice ; and then cleverly secured the headquarters of what is now the European Union .
Along the way it produced Magritte , Simenon , Tintin , the saxophone and a lot of chocolate .
Also frites .
No doubt more good things can come out of the swathe of territory once occupied by a tribe known to the Romans as the Belgae .
For that , though , they do not need Belgium : they can emerge just as readily from two or three new mini-states , or perhaps from an enlarged France and Netherlands .
Brussels can devote itself to becoming the bureaucratic capital of Europe .
It no longer enjoys the heady atmosphere of liberty that swirled outside its opera house in 1830 , intoxicating the demonstrators whose protests set the Belgians on the road to independence .
The air today is more fetid .
With freedom now taken for granted , the old animosities are ill suppressed .
Rancour is ever - present and the country has become a freak of nature , a state in which power is so devolved that government is an abhorred vacuum .
In short , Belgium has served its purpose .
A praline divorce is in order .
Belgians need not feel too sad .
Countries come and go .
And perhaps a way can be found to keep the king , if he is still wanted .
Since he has never had a country — he has always just been king of the Belgians — he will not miss Belgium .
Maybe he can rule a new - old country called Gaul .
But king of the Gauloises does n't sound quite right , does it ?
I ... do n't know what to say .
Adium , the popular third - party chat client for OS X , just got released into version 1.0 tonight .
This has happened after years and years ( and years , and years , and years , and years ) of development — always adding new features , always being way better than any other standard chat clients from AIM or Apple — and never having reached 1.0 status .
I 'm one of those oldschool users , too — the type who remembers chatting with the Adam Iser all the time back in the dizzay .
This is monumental .
Like ... the seas parting .

Stung by the loss of Internet advertising firm DoubleClick to Google last month , Microsoft has intensified its pursuit of a deal with Yahoo ! , asking the company to re-enter formal negotiations , The Post has learned .
While Microsoft and Yahoo ! have held informal deal talks over the years , sources say the latest approach signals an urgency on Microsoft ’s part that has up until now been lacking .
The new approach follows an offer Microsoft made to acquire Yahoo !
a few months ago , sources said .
But Yahoo ! spurned the advances of the Redmond , Wash . - based software giant .
Wall Street sources put a roughly $ 50 billion price tag on Yahoo !.
“ They ’re getting tired of being left at the altar , ” said one banking source who has recently had talks with Microsoft .
“ They now seem more willing to extend themselves via a transaction to get into the game . ”
Part of the reason for that is because Google keeps trumping Microsoft on the deal front , beating out the company on not just DoubleClick , but also for a renewed search advertising pact with AOL in 2005 that Microsoft lusted after .
Moreover , with Google developing Internet - based software that directly competes with Microsoft Office , sources said Microsoft has no choice but to go on the offensive .
“ The minute you hear Microsoft start arguing against something on antitrust grounds , you know they are desperate and need to do something big , ” said one source .
Sources said Microsoft is working with Goldman Sachs .
News of Microsoft ’s latest approach comes as Yahoo ! ’s new search advertising platform Project Panama is just getting off the ground .
The long - awaited platform posted disappointing first - quarter results , but sources said that was more a function of difficult comparisons to the year - earlier period and less a sign that the system was n’t working .
That said , another quarter or two of similar results and investors might begin renewing calls for a sale or for CEO Terry Semel to step down .
As it stands now , a deal between Microsoft and Yahoo ! would up the combined companies ’ share of the all - important search advertising market to 27 percent against Google ’s 65 percent .
It would also narrow the gap in overall online ads with Google to just 13 percent .
More importantly , a deal would create what one source described as “ the dominant force on the Internet ” in terms of eyeballs .
That ’s an important consideration as more and more content flows online – as the equations goes , eyeballs equal advertising .
Microsoft and Yahoo !
also feature complimentary offerings on the content side , with MSN drawing an older audience with its news focus .
By contrast , Yahoo !
attracts a younger demographic with its entertainment coverage .
Aside from cost savings , a deal would also create opportunities to use Yahoo !
content on Microsoft devices , such as making music exclusively provided to Yahoo !
Music available on Microsoft ’s Xbox game console and Zune music player .
A spokeswoman for Yahoo ! declined comment .
Microsoft declined comment .

The amylase enzyme studied by Dr. Perry ’s team exists in the saliva , where it predigests starch and lets glucose get absorbed from the mouth into bloodstream .
The evolutionary advantage of this strange arrangement is not clear , but it could provide the body with energy during episodes of diarrhea , or might protect against diarrhea .
Or it could just make the digestion of starch more efficient .
Whatever the exact mechanism , the extra copies of the amylase gene seem to have arisen through positive selection , the researchers said .
Their conclusion is based on comparing the genomes of the Japanese and the Yakut , a Siberian people who eat mostly reindeer .
Dr. Perry , a geneticist , said he could not tell whether the Japanese , who have a high - starch diet , including rice , had gained the extra copies of the gene or whether the Yakut had lost theirs .
Geneticists realized only in 2004 that having extra copies of genes was a widespread form of variation in the human genome .
Many of the extra copies seem to have arisen through mistakes in the duplication process that doubles the number of chromosomes in dividing cells .
The effect of these extra copies is largely unknown and the story of the amylase gene is one of the first to be understood , at least to some degree .
Dr. Perry and his team started their research by having undergraduates at Arizona State University give samples of saliva , which were analyzed for amylase .
The researchers found the amount of amylase a person produced was correlated with the number of copies they possessed of the amyloid gene , which ranged from 2 to 15 .
The copies are arranged in the genome like a string of beads , with each gene being about 120,000 units of DNA in length .
Wondering whether the copy number varied with diet , the researchers then collected saliva and blood samples from the Yakut and other low - starch eating populations , showing that this was indeed the case .

SWORDS - First Robots To Break Asimov's First Law Of Robotics
Update 13 - Apr-2008
It appears that the SWORDS robots will not see combat operations in Iraq .
Ironically , in view of the criticism of this article , it appears that " autonomous " ( in the sense of unplanned or mistaken ) behavior is exactly what the military fears from this " robot " - see SWORDS Robots Pulled From Iraq For Bad Behavior .
End update .
( Note to readers : as I pointed out in the article ( and the comments ) , these devices are not autonomous .
For some , this would disqualify them from being true robots .
However , the military and the manufacturer both refer to the SWORDS device as a robot , and it certainly fits common usage .
The word " robot " comes from the Czech robota ( from Capek 's play R.U.R. ) meaning " forced labor " or " drudgery . "
This device surely does an unpleasant task usually done by a person .
Also , consider that , strictly speaking , an autonomous cruise missile is a self - guided machine , and is therefore a " robot " although most people would n't think of it that way .
If you think that fully autonomous killing robots are a decade away , take a look at a home - brew device that really does pick out a target and shoot to kill all by itself ; see the Robotic Sentry Gun from USMechatronics .
For me , the bottom line on this article is that SWORDS is a machine that is sent to stand in the place of a man and kill people . )
Next month [ February , 2005 ] , the US Army will be putting robot soldiers in the field in Iraq .
The SWORDS ( Special Weapons Observation Reconnaissance Detection Systems ) robots are fully armed ; when the human operator verifies that a suitable target is within sight , it fires .
They are equipped with either the M249 ( which fires 5.56 - millimeter rounds at 750 rounds per minute ) or the M240 ( which fires 7.62 - millimeter rounds at up to 1,000 per minute ) .
These robots are poised be the first working robots that are actually designed to break Isaac Asimov 's First Law of Robotics : " A robot may not injure a human being , or through inaction , allow a human being to come to harm . "
The three - foot tall bots are not autonomous killing machines ; they are modified Talon robots that have been used by the military for at least four years .
SWORD robots are more accurate than human soldiers ; the gun is mounted on a stable platform and fired electronically , eliminating trigger recoil , anticipation problems and timing the breathing cycle when firing .
At present , the SWORD robot is operated with a thirty - pound control unit with two joysticks , buttons and a video screen .
According to Bob Quinn , general manager of Talon robots for Foster - Miller , Inc. , this control system may be replaced with a " Gameboy " type of controller hooked up to virtual reality goggles .
The SWORDS robot is described as a " bootstrapped " effort , retrofitting weapons onto an existing platform .
The military is still a long way from the Tactical Autonomous Combatant ( TAC ) described in a Project Alpha study " Unmanned Effects : Taking the Human out of the Loop " ; TAC robots are seen as being faster and more lethal than human soldiers , and able to work in more hazardous environments .
This study , which was done in 2003 , saw TACs as a reality by 2025 .

Update Mar-15-2006 : Here 's a copy of a note that I posted to Slashdot about this article :
Thanks for reading the source story .
As someone noted ( and as I made clear in the first few lines of the article ) , this is last year 's story , and the devices in question are not what purists would call true robots .
So , yes , I understood that these devices are essentially sophisticated radio - controlled toys - with real guns .
When I first read about the SWORDS device , the first thing that struck me was " My God , they 've made a robot that stands in a man 's place , and kills people . "
I 'd read Asimov many years earlier , but the " I , Robot " film had just come out , and I was really struck by the difference between Asimov 's desire to make robots that existed to help people versus the military 's desire to make machines that would preserve the lives of our troops while assisting with necessary ( dangerous ) work in Iraq .
The " Three Laws of Robotics " were one smart guy 's attempt to create a set of protocols that would ensure that autonomous robots would not be able to cause harm .
The first " law " says it all : " A robot may not injure a human being , or through inaction , allow a human being to come to harm . "
I think that , in the minds of most people , these are robots , and they are certainly part of the development process that will lead to autonomous killing machines .
I describe this briefly in the article , and then provide links to show what the military is planning for the future .
So , in retrospect , I 'd have to say I jumped the gun in describing this as a case of a robot that " intentionally " harms people .
However , despite the fact that the SWORDS devices are not true , autonomous robots with " positronic brains , " they are still machines that stand in a soldier 's place , and kill .
And remember , these are just early prototypes of what the military really wants .
Science fiction lets us explore in imagination what we might want to do ( or what we might want to avoid ) in reality .
The military 's plan is clear ; if you want to object to autonomous killing machines , now 's the time .

Banks fear willful defaults after anti-recovery activism
Anita Bhoir in Mumbai | October 29 , 2007 10:10 IST
Last Updated : October 29 , 2007 11:10 IST
He is a worried man now .
As the head of recoveries at a bank that 's among the active players in the small personal loans business , he is scared that organised activism against recovery of overdue loans could cripple his recovery function .
The Mumbai - based recovery chief does not want to be identified but says his greater concern is not that non-performing loans would rise from the already elevated levels .
Coordinated opposition to recovery efforts could lead to banks withdrawing altogether from lending to this sub - prime segment in India that otherwise depends on informal money lenders , he feels .
This feeling is shared by many bankers , particularly after an organised platform sprang up in Mumbai , which is urging defaulters to get in touch with them for help if they are being " harassed " by banks for recovery of overdue loans .
At stake is about Rs 45,000 crore ( Rs 450 billion ) of loans , the estimated exposure banks and non-bank finance companies have to India 's own sub - prime borrowers .
The loan amounts per borrower are around Rs 10,000 in most cases but could range up to Rs 50,000 .
The activism against recovery of loans by a group of politicians followed the suicide by a low - income group borrower , who left a note behind blaming the overindulgence of recovery agents for his act .
Bank officials sense that a number of opportunistic borrowers , who would have normally paid their equated monthly instalments regularly , would suddenly find the politicians acting as a shield against any recovery attempts by lenders and would decide not to pay .
This would increase NPLs , which in this sub - prime segment are already above tolerable levels .
Banks have seen defaults in this segment rising to 15 per cent from less than 10 per cent till the last quarter of 2006 - 07 .
The recovery chief of another private sector bank said , " The current situation has acted as a dampener on normal on - filed recovery efforts .
There has been a 10 - 15 per cent fall in collections . "
The uncertainty in the recovery function at banks , particularly private and foreign , could be temporary as the system of recovery agents is here to stay .
The fallout of activism against recovery could be banks stopping fresh lending to this segment and if they do continue , good borrowers would have to bear the brunt in terms of higher interest rates , which have already risen above 40 per cent .
" The rate of interest that banks charge customers inter alia take into account the rate of delinquencies .
If banks are not able to recover their dues and defaults increase , the interest rates would only go up , and this would impact the good customers as well , " said Naina Lal Kidwai , Group General Manager & CEO , HSBC India .
A few days after ICICI Bank [ Get Quote ] took the unprecedented step of paying Rs 15.5 lakh in the form of fixed deposit and insurance covers to the family members of a Mumbai borrower who committed suicide , there was a case of recovery agents being beaten up when they approached a borrower to ask for payment against overdue amounts .
K J Udeshi , chairman of the Banking Codes and Standards Board of India ( BCSBI ) has said that " recovery through agents , as a system , is here to stay and trying to regulate them would in no way attack the problem or provide the solution .
What consumers need is protection from irresponsible , ' predatory ' lending by banks . "
She was speaking at the International Forum on Financial Consumer Protection and Education organised by the Hungarian Financial Supervisory Authority in Budapest recently .
Bankers are looking up to the Reserve Bank of India [ Get Quote ] for help .
The head of credit risk of a bank said , " There is a very high risk of rise in wilful defaults .
You have banners running across the city ( Mumbai ) offering to protect defaulters from recovery processes .
This and the recent cases of ill - treatment of recovery agents spoil the ethic of repayment .
It is high time the banking regulator or the government or the industry as a whole do something about it . "
" Loans to customers from the underbanked sections of the society bring them into the organised lending system , creating a credit profile for them .
This would enable them to avail of future loans more easily .
If banks were to stop lending , these customers would again have to go back to money lenders who would charge their usurious rates of interest , " said HSBC 's Kidwai .
Apart from NBFCs like Citifinancial , the banks which have exposure to this segment are ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank [ Get Quote ] .
Banks increased their lending to low - income borrowers during the last few years of the retail credit boom .
These lenders are in a much better position to bear a higher rate of default as the interest rates were several times the rate at which a prime customer would get a personal loan .
" Ultimately good customers will have to pay for defaulters .
Banks will price in the risk premium on the loans .
We have decided to go slow on our low ticket size loans , '' said another banker .
T S Narayanasami , chairman and managing director of Bank of India , said " There are two ways of looking at it .
If you are convinced that the man is pushed to the wall and he has no means to pay , banks which indulge in massive lending in consumer loans should call it a day and write it off -- this is one way of looking at it .
But if you do it , this can become a strategy amongst some of the bad elements in the borrower lot .
So we will have to see how to counter that .
If there is a genuine problem , then your pricing is there which takes care of even a write - off .
But then you will have to do it selectively so that this does not spread like a disease within all borrowers . "
A strange , out of town , tech repair ...
Even with the wipers on high I could n’t see much more than a thick ripple of rainwater in front of me .
Hopefully I was still in the correct lane , but I really was n’t sure anymore .
Then , an instant soft , but stiff drag on the wheels told me I had hit a deep puddle of water and I pressed the brakes to slow way down .
Too late though .
I felt and heard a drenching rush of water flood the underside and engine compartment and the car stalled .
No wipers now , no radio , and no engine power .
I turned the ignition key with the hope to get going again but there was nothing .
Just the angry pound of the rain on the metal roof and windows – and the flashing , purple sky .
The water had obviously shorted the electrical system – making this my second tech problem to fix on this trip .
The first one was bad enough .
An abnormal series of thunderstorms had knocked a remote server station off - line – probably a lightning strike .
The station had an automatic generator backup , but the fact that it did n’t take over and keep things running probably meant that there was some damage done and not just a power failure .
I was keeping my fingers crossed that the car problem would be solved by just letting the engine dry a little after the rain stopped .
I crossed them tightly because I was n’t in the mood for two major headaches .
One would do fine .
At least the cell phone worked reliably as I punched in the numbers to call my office and share my day so far with them .
Thanks for sending me on this repair trip right away instead of waiting for the storm to pass , I felt like saying .
" Hello ?
Kathy ?
It ’s Rick .
Can you hear me OK ? "
" Sort of , you sound a little distant though .
Where are you now ? "
" My car just stalled .
I think I soaked the engine when I hit a puddle .
This storm ’s insane !
I ’m gonna try to find a spot to spend the night and then get a better start in the morning .
I ’ll give you an update tomorrow sometime .
Alright ?
" " Sure .
Just take it easy though ,
It ’s not worth kil ..n.g…. yr… .
" Kathy ?
You there ?…. "
Then , what had started as conversation , trailed off into useless static and then some weird attenuating tone – like an alien ship flying off in an old sci - fi movie .
" Technology sucks ! " I yelled and threw the phone down on the passenger seat .
I was happy that I left in a hurry earlier and had just thrown my things in the back seat .
Not having to get them out of the trunk would be that much less time in this pouring rain .
I looked around through the downpour as best as I could and tried to put a plan together .
No Days
Inn in sight , however there was something down the road that had a remote chance of being a bed & breakfast judging by its size and style , and the shape of the sign in front .
Already tired from a long drive , and not feeling fussy about accommodations , I was going to make a run for it and see what happened .
I grabbed my night bag , held the door handle for a moment to build courage , and then threw the door open and jumped into the rain .
Kicking it closed with my right foot I started to sprint as fast as I could toward my target , getting soaked head - to - foot within seconds .
The huge beating drops blurred my vision and the lightning flashes and shockwaves from the thunder made me feel horribly vulnerable to mother nature ’s wrath .
Please let there be some nice people in this place !
There was no judgement of time as I ran .
Just drenching rain and a glowing purple sky that illuminated everything in front of me with its anger .
But it was n’t constant .
It shifted and changed and seemed to have some strange relationship with the lightning .
There was no comparable experience to this in my mind ’s memory and it caused me to react involuntarily with a deep panicked breath .
I gasped from the rainwater that was sucked into my mouth and it snapped me out of my fear a bit – like waking from a nightmare but still in the haze of sleep .
Now the white , inn - style building was probably within a quarter mile or less .
I felt a little foolish about my reaction moments before and focused on reaching the front porch that would offer the beginning of some shelter .
When my foot landed on the first step there was a softness , like wood that ’s been rotting for years .
Maybe this was just the last item on their to - do list , as soon as the budget allowed .
As I got to the top and ducked under the roof I wiped my eyes and looked around .
A quick chill went through me , either from the cold wetness or from an uneasiness at the looks of this place .
If this was an active bed & breakfast it probably was n’t listed on too many travel related web sites .
Here I was though , and I intended to make the best of it .
I set my bag down , tried to shake the excess wetness from myself , and straighten my hair as best as I could .
I figured that the more presentable I looked the better of a reception I would receive by whoever was inside .
When I felt I was ready I knocked on the door .
Are you kidding !
the voice in my head said to me .
Yeah , I know , but I ’m low on options , I sarcastically snapped back at it .
Determination was now the only thing I had to work with and I was n’t going to run back to the car without giving this a respectable try .
Something like five minutes passed and nothing was happening as a result of my knocks .
Plan ‘ B ’ time – sleep in the car and wait out the storm .
I grabbed my bag again and started down the stairs and into the rain .
As my shoes splashed through the water there was a snap of lightning and the world in front of me glowed with that purple light – but with a more direct presence now .
My skin tingled and I felt it all around me .
" Hello !
Where are you going ? " came through the rain behind me .
It was n’t right .
None of this was .
I just left a vacant house but the voice I just heard was real , or seemed to be real .
Stopping suddenly , I turned around and saw an older woman standing in the open front door .
A light or a lantern was on in the window .
My desire to get dry and sleep on a bed overcame my disbelief , and I ran back toward the porch .
" Who are you ? " she asked in a confused , shaky voice .
It was n’t very late yet , but I was guessing that I woke her up and that she was still adjusting to consciousness , based upon the look on her face .
When I reached the porch again I halted and introduced myself in the most calming way I was able .
She obviously did n’t need some stranger running at her during this storm .
" Hi , my name is Rick Williams .
My car stalled on me down the road a little ways and I ’m looking to rent a room for the night to get some rest and a fresh start in the morning .
The sign out front and the look of the building made me think this might be a bed & breakfast . "
" I ’ve never heard ‘ bed & breakfast ’ before , but this is the Yankee Inn and you ’re welcome to rent a room for as long as you need .
Ten dollars a night and that ’ll include a breakfast in the morning if you want . "
She invited me in by holding the door open , then followed me and got what was probably a guest book to sign .
Ten dollars is hardly worth her trouble I thought , I ’ll pay her more anyway .
I looked around and started feeling more comfortable already .
The inside had a warm , cozy charm that I did n’t expect judging from the outside .
Some kerosene lanterns burning – probably from the power being out - gave off an almost romantic glow that perfectly matched the décor , which was badly outdated but still pleasing and in good condition .
There was also an ethereal feeling to it .
Like a gust of wind or a clap of thunder could make it vanish in an instant , but that was probably just my current state of mind I figured .
The whole day was abnormal and I was getting used to that as an expectation .
She spread open the ‘ guest ’ book on a desk - like table in the corner of the foyer where I was standing , and pleasantly asked me to fill in some information on a clean page .
We exchanged some conversation while I did this , mostly about the storm , which she said " came out of nowhere , " then another brilliant flash and explosion of thunder startled us both and made me glad I had gotten inside .
Through all of this she seemed disconnected in some way from me and the surrounding situation .
Maybe her husband had died , leaving her to grieve inside herself since then .
This could also explain the deteriorated condition of the outside .
In any case she continued to be pleasant and offered to show me up to the room I would stay in .
The rest of the place was as nice as the foyer had been .
Though all in the same old style , there was a reassuring feel .
Even the creaking floor beneath the rug reminded me of my childhood visits to my grandmother ’s house .
We continued up a stairway and then a short way down a dimly lit hall .
She had brought another kerosene lantern with her , lit it on a table in the hall , and then led me into my room where she set it down on a dresser by the bed .
" Here ’s your room , " she said and handed me a key for the door .
I slid it on my key ring as she continued .
" The bathroom is just down the hall and you ’re welcome to share breakfast in the morning in the dining room that we passed coming up . "
With that I got the first glimpse of a smile on her face since arriving and then she said " good night , " left the room , and I heard her footsteps trail off down the stairs .
I had seen no other people here , but as I took some things out of my bag and got undressed I heard a couple voices fade in and out .
Maybe I would see them in the morning for breakfast .
It would be great to be around a few more people I thought .
It would make this whole experience seem a little more real .
Exhausted now , I finished getting out of my wet clothes , put out the oil lamp , got into the tall wooden bed , and fell asleep within minutes – not even the continuing storm was able to keep me from that .
The morning light penetrated my eyelids and woke me .
They felt like they were glued shut , and opened slowly and with some difficulty .
When they did there was paralysis !
I was frozen in shock .
The old style , but comfortable room I had gone to sleep in did n’t exist now .
There was dust and cobwebs covering everything and old boards lying around .
There was daylight now , and the storm had passed , but I was terrified and afraid to move !
I had to get out of here – out of this insanity !
I forced myself out of bed , threw on my wet clothes , grabbed my bag , and ran downstairs .
It was all the same .
Cobwebs , dust , old sheets covering furniture and tables .
A place that had been abandoned for decades .
There would surely be no breakfast here I thought with a sick laugh , and then ran out to what I hoped would be the real world .
Outside , a car was passing down the road , the driver and passenger looked at me like I was some lunatic escaping from an asylum .
From somewhere else a voice yelled , " Hey !
What are you doing in there ? "
They were real though .
There was no purple sky anymore and these people were real !
I ran back to my car , ignoring the call , and jumped inside .
I stuck the key in the ignition , turned it , and the engine started as though there had never been a problem .
I put it in drive , calmed myself a bit , then drove off with no destination in mind except to get somewhere else .
After a few minutes of driving , my cell phone went off – I could tell it was voice - mail from the ring .
I pulled over to play it back and listened to " Hey Rick , it ’s Kathy , nice job .
The servers are all back online and fully functional .
I guess that ’s why we pay you the big bucks ! "
Then a little chuckle .
If that was the case there ’d be no more stops before going home .
I had momentarily debated driving to the remote station just to verify the servers ’ operation for myself but decided not to fix what was apparently not broken anymore .
I would head straight back and have the next night ’s sleep in my own house .
Now , what to say when I get in the office tomorrow … ?
A smile of relief crept onto my face at knowing the drive back would allow me plenty of time to think of an answer , as well as put this crazy episode far behind me .
Then , from the key ring in my ignition , a glint of purple light caught my eye …
In a move which can only be described as unsurprising , Apple has officially announced plans to lower the price of its iTunes Plus offerings ( AKA iTunes sans - DRM ) to $.99 , instead of the higher - priced premium of $ 1.29 .
Old Jobsy claims that the decision was made due to the popularity of the unlocked , higher quality tracks with customers , saying , " It 's been very popular with our customers , and we 're making it even more affordable . "
Of course , it also seems likely that iTunes and Apple are feeling the burn from the new wave of DRM - free music providers , like Amazon , and the persistent rumors / news of former playmate Universal amassing an " anti-iTunes " which could seriously compete with the Cupertino monolith 's business .
Sure , it 's the third - largest retailer of music in the US , but there 's always someone creeping up from behind -- just ask Irv Gotti . :
Apple press release makes it really , really , super duper official .
MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Russia ’s youths admire Soviet dictator Josef Stalin -- who presided over the deaths of millions of people -- and want to kick immigrants out of Russia , according to a poll released on Wednesday .
The poll , carried out by the Yuri Levada Centre , was presented by two U.S. academics who called it “ The Putin Generation : the political views of Russia ’s youth ” .
When asked if Stalin was a wise leader , half of the 1,802 respondents , aged from 16 to 19 , agreed he was .
“ Fifty - four percent agreed that Stalin did more good than bad , ” said Theodore Gerber , a sociologist from the University of Wisconsin - Madison .
“ Forty - six percent disagreed with the statement that Stalin was a cruel tyrant . ”
Stalin , who took over from Vladimir Lenin , built a system of terror and repression in which tens millions of people died or were killed .
He died in 1953 .
“ What we find troubling is that there is a substantial proportion of young people in Russia today who hold positive or ambivalent views on Stalin and his legacy , ” Gerber said .
“ We think it would probably be more appropriate if there was more condemnation of the Stalin era . ”
The poll showed 17 percent of the young people disagreed that Stalin was responsible for the imprisonment , torture and execution of millions of innocent people , while 40 percent thought his role in the repression had been exaggerated .
The majority of respondents thought the collapse of the Soviet Union was a tragedy and two thirds thought that America was a rival and enemy .
Only a fifth viewed Iran as a potential rival or enemy .
Most young people also wanted immigrants kicked out of Russia : 62 percent said they agreed with the statement that the Russian government should evict most immigrants .
But 64 percent agreed with the idea that immigrants should be allowed to have Russian citizenship if they abided with Russian laws and customs .
The poll showed the biggest concern for the youth was the problem of drugs , followed by unemployment , poverty , corruption , education , crime , HIV / AIDS and ecology .
Harper Lee , the author of To Kill a Mockingbird , has been awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom , by George Bush .
Whether or not one of the world 's most publicity - shy literary stars will relish being given America 's highest - and very public - award remains to be seen .
According to the citation the reclusive author has been honoured for " an outstanding contribution to America 's literary tradition .
At a critical moment in our history , her beautiful book , To Kill a Mockingbird , helped focus the nation on the turbulent struggle for equality . "
Lee 's 1960 classic tells the story of a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman and is an indictment of racial prejudice .
It is told from the perspective of a young white girl , Jean Louise " Scout " Finch , whose father , Atticus Finch , is the lawyer defending the innocent man , Tom Robinson .
Lee set the story in the town of " Maycomb " in Alabama and drew on her own childhood experiences in the South .
While insisting that the novel is not autobiographical , she has acknowledged that Scout is based on herself .
Lee was born in Monroeville in 1926 , in the deep South , at a time of strict racial segregation .
She was a voracious reader who moved to New York determined to become a writer , and succeeded with To Kill A Mockingbird .
The book was an instant bestseller and won a Pulitzer prize .
It was also made into a hit film starring Gregory Peck , which quickly gained similar " classic " status to the book's .
Unnerved by the extent of critical and popular acclaim her book won , Lee then disappeared from public life , stopped giving interviews about 40 years ago and , other than a 1983 review of an Alabama history book , has published nothing of significance in some four decades .
However , she did step out of the shadows last year when it came to light that for five years she had been quietly attending a ceremony at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa for a high school essay - writing contest based on her work .
She granted a single interview to the New York Times , speaking only about the students and the essay - writing contest .
The picture that emerged of the author from the interview was of a lively and quick - witted old woman who was happy to chat to the students , sign autographs and pose for pictures .
While To Kill a Mockingbird is taught in more than 70 % of schools in the US , the book 's popularity is not restricted to the States .
Last year the book topped a World Book Day poll conducted by the UK's Museum , Libraries and Archives Council ( MLA ) , in which librarians around the country were asked , " Which book should every adult read before they die ? "
Should she attend , Lee will be presented with the Presidential Medal at a White House ceremony on November 5 with this year 's other recipients , who include the 1992 Nobel economics prize winner Gary Becker ; Human Genome Project leader Francis Collins ; US civil rights leader Benjamin Hooks ; and former House Foreign Affairs committee chairman Henry Hyde .
The Medal of Freedom was established by President Truman in 1945 to recognise civilians for their efforts during the second world war .
The award was reinstated by President Kennedy in 1963 to honor distinguished service .
It is given to those deemed to have made remarkable contributions to the security or national interests of the United States , world peace , culture , or other private or public endeavors .
WASHINGTON , July 30 
A one - sentence provision buried in the Senate ’s recently passed energy bill , inserted without debate at the urging of the nuclear power industry , could make builders of new nuclear plants eligible for tens of billions of dollars in government loan guarantees .
Lobbyists have told lawmakers and administration officials in recent weeks that the nuclear industry needs as much as $ 50 billion in loan guarantees over the next two years to finance a major expansion .
The biggest champion of the loan guarantees is Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico , the ranking Republican on the Senate Energy Committee and one of the nuclear industry ’s strongest supporters in Congress .
Senator Jeff Bingaman , Democrat of New Mexico and the energy bill ’s author , has long argued that nuclear power plants do not need federal loan guarantees .
Mr. Bingaman said that the industry was over - interpreting the provision and that it would provide loan guarantees for only the most innovative power plants .
Jeffrey Goldberg , Five Years Ago Today
Here 's Jeffrey Goldberg , then a staff writer at the New Yorker , participating in a debate on Iraq in Slate on October 3 , 2002 .
That was five years ago today :
There is not sufficient space ... for me to refute some of the arguments made in Slate over the past week against intervention , arguments made , I have noticed , by people with limited experience in the Middle East ( Their lack of experience causes them to reach the naive conclusion that an invasion of Iraq will cause America to be loathed in the Middle East , rather than respected ) ...
The administration is planning today to launch what many people would undoubtedly call a short - sighted and inexcusable act of aggression .
In five years , however , I believe that the coming invasion of Iraq will be remembered as an act of profound morality .
Wow , did he call that one !
He 's like the Babe Ruth of geopolitical analysis !
Still , as gruesome as this is ( and as gruesome as Goldberg 's pre-war reporting was ) , I do n't recommend that anyone get angry at him personally .
He does n't matter .
What matters is the political economy of our media .
Here , in an article from this past August , is a description of how that political economy functions :
David Bradley had been trying to lure Jeffrey Goldberg to the Atlantic for more than two years .
Bradley , the magazine 's owner , wrote flattering letters .
He courted Goldberg at a McDonald 's on Wisconsin Avenue .
He proffered a hefty signing bonus .
And when the New Yorker 's Washington correspondent finally seemed receptive to making the move , Bradley sent in the ponies .
" He 's incredibly persistent and makes you feel like you 're God 's gift to journalism , " says Goldberg , who had turned Bradley down once before .
But that was before the horses showed up at his home to entertain his children .
" The charm is incredibly disarming , " says Goldberg , who joined the Atlantic last month ...
Part of what Bradley is selling is a commitment to long - form journalism , at a time when there are few quality outlets for those who believe in the power of nonfiction narrative .
But what Goldberg calls " smart - bomb flattery " does n't hurt , and neither do salaries for top journalists ranging as high as $ 350,000 .
" Smart - bomb flattery . "
Oh , tee hee hee .
I find it particularly witty for Goldberg to speak of himself enjoying these metaphorical smart bombs at the same time that , thanks in part to him , Iraqis are enjoying the real kind .
In any case , the lesson is clear : as long you advocate war — any war , anywhere , anytime — and as long as you coat it with a certain brand of intellectual varnish , you literally cannot be wrong in the mainstream US media .
Your views may diverge from reality so completely they are essentially psychotic , but as far the people who own the media are concerned , it 's reality that 's mistaken .
Hey , do your kids like ponies ?
EXTRA CREDIT : In his Slate post , Goldberg cites Richard Spertzel as an authority .
Spertzel is an American former UNSCOM inspector and a truly appalling hack .
Predictably enough , Spertzel was later hired by the CIA as part of its post - war WMD search team — and predictably enough , he came back to the US and wrote an editorial for the Wall Street Journal brazenly lying about what they 'd found and what the final CIA report said .
( Brief description here , though it 's actually even worse than that .
Details on request . )
MEDIA MOGULS , EXPLAINED : Why is David Bradley so anxious to spend his hard - earned money on Jeffrey Goldberg ?
The answer is really quite straightforward .
BONUS : Goldberg 's Slate views were heartily endorsed at the time by Andrew Sullivan : " The invaluable Jeffrey Goldberg presents what is to my mind an unarguable case for removing Saddam from power in Slate .... We can not let ourselves be led by the deluded and the defeatist any more . "
And thus :
When it comes to hiring , Bradley 's most useful trait may be patience .
Says Andrew Sullivan , who had been blogging for Time : " David regularly offered me tea and scones every year or so for the better part of the last seven years , to find out what I was up to , and always suggested ways to go work for him . "
Sullivan recently moved his blog to the Atlantic 's site .
PREVIOUSLY : Jeffrey Goldberg is " said to " source things in an unusual fashion .
An open letter to people who wear those Bluetooth headsets that blink :
In case you have n’t noticed , your eyes are actually located in front of your ears .
So that blue light that blinks incessantly can’t actually be seen by you .
The rest of us , however , do see it .
And it annoys us .
Stop .
“ But how else will I impress the ladies ? ” you ask .
I suggest purchasing some of those rims that keep on spinning after you stop .
Thank you very much Treehugger .

Pills , sponges , IUDs , diaphragms -- women have many options for planning their fertility , none of them quite perfect .
But what if men want to help out ?
They have only two options -- vasectomy , which is usually permanent , and condoms , which are crucial for dating but get old in long - term relationships .
Will men ever have a way to reliably make sure that nobody is every calling them " Daddy " before they are ready ?
For decades , pundits have predicted new contraceptives for men within the next 5 to 10 years .
But judging from work presented today at the second " Future of Male Contraception " conference , we may finally be getting closer .
Some highlights from the second day of the conference :
- Researchers from the University of Washington tried a hormone regimen based on two products already available on the market .
They used testosterone gel , which is marketed for men with low testosterone , plus a progestin shot used as a female contraceptive under the name " DepoProvera . "
The men got a shot once every 3 months and rubbed on a gel every day , and it worked well at knocking out sperm in 90 % of them .
However , men 's opinions of the method varied widely : 6 dropped out , and of the remaining 38 , half of them were satisfied or very satisfied , a third were dissatisfied or very dissatisfied , and the rest were undecided or had mixed feelings . -
Shepherd Medical Company announced the results of their very first U.S. study in men of the " Intra Vas Device " ( a vasectomy alternative ) : after 6 months , 92 % of the men had no sperm or almost no sperm .
The Intra Vas Device blocks sperm in the vas deferens , the tube sperm swim through ( the same tube that is cut in vasectomy ) .
The set of plugs can be removed if a man changes his mind , so it is much easier to get sperm flowing again than after vasectomy .
Animal studies have shown that fertility returns if the IVD is removed after short - term use , but that does n't guarantee successful pregnancy after long - term use .
The next step will be to find funding for long - term studies of effectiveness and fertility return . -
Columbia University researchers took advantage of the importance of vitamin A to design a new contraceptive approach .
Men who are extremely low in vitamin A lose their fertility -- but they also become extremely sick , so avoiding vitamin A does n't work as a contraceptive .
Instead , Professor Debra Wolgemuth discovered a drug that had been abandoned by a pharmaceutical company precisely because it interfered with vitamin A receptors in the testes .
Her team tested it in mice , and it worked with no health effects .
" The receptors are everywhere , but the testis is exquisitely sensitive to the drug .
So we can use a dose that is so low it has no effect on the rest of the body . "
So the drug does n't harm mice -- but will it be fine in men ?
Dr. Wolgemuth thinks the chances are good .
" There 's extensive toxicology data in rats and rabbits -- and at much higher doses -- because industry is developing it for other uses .
So we 're optimistic that there would be no adverse side effects in humans as well . "
So how long must we wait ?
Advocates say it all depends on men speaking up .
" We 've seen today that the pipeline is full -- everything from new targets to actual human trials , " explains Kirsten Thompson , director of the International Male Contraception Coalition .
" And the demand is there -- hundreds of men have voiced their opinion on our website MaleContraceptives.org and in surveys .
So it 's just a question of whether policymakers act on that demand . "
Elaine Lissner , director of the Male Contraception Information Project , concurs .
" We could have something like the IVD on the market in 4 - 5 years , if we make an all - out effort with funding and focus .
But if we continue with just a study here and a study there , it could be an eternity . "

BONUS : Take note of the guy dressed in drag .
A realistic statewide plan , experts say , would tell developers that they could not build if no water was available , and might have restricted some of the enormous growth in the Atlanta area over the last decade .
Already , officials have little notion how to provide for a projected doubling of demand over the next 30 years .
The ideas that have been floated , including piping in water from Tennessee or desalinating ocean water , would require hundreds of billions of dollars and painful decision making the state has been reluctant to undertake .

“ It ’s been develop first and ask questions later , ” said Gil Rogers , a lawyer with the Southern Environmental Law Center .
Instead , Georgia has engaged in interminable squabbles with neighboring states over dam releases and flow rates .
The latest effort at mediation with Alabama fell apart just last month .
And Georgia officials insist that Atlanta would have plenty of water were it not for the Army Corps of Engineers , which they say has released more water from its main source of water , Lake Lanier , than is necessary to protect three endangered species downstream .
Last week , Mr. Perdue filed for an injunction against the corps to stop the release of water .
( Downstream , Alabama officials responded in protest , saying they need the releases . )
“ We are not here because we consumed our way into this drought , as some would suggest , ” said Carol Couch , Mr. Perdue ’s director of environmental protection .
Those making that argument against Georgia include many people in Florida , the only state in the region to have adopted a water plan and home to the downstream end of the basin that includes Lake Lanier .
An editorial Friday in the St. Petersburg Times said that the blame lay not with the corps but with “ a record drought , unrestrained population growth and poor water - conservation habits . ”
Bruce A. Karas , vice president of sustainability for Coca - Cola , said no one from the City of Atlanta or its water planning district had approached company officials to ask them to conserve water .
Mr. Karas said the company had worked to reduce consumption on its own since 2004 .
“ We ’re very concerned , ” Mr. Karas said .
“ Water is our main ingredient .
As a company , we look at areas where we expect water abundance and water scarcity , and we know water is scarce in the Southwest .
It ’s very surprising to us that the Southeast is in a water shortage . ”

In the message , the caller says , referring to a potential subpoena : “ There is not a goddamn thing your phony , psycho , piece - of - shit son can do about it .
Bernie , your phony loans are about to catch up with you .
You will be forced to tell the truth and the fact that your son ’s a pathological liar will be known to all . ”
Mr. Stone , 55 , said the number from which the call was alleged to have been made was indeed his , and that it was also shared by a Florida law firm for which he does public relations work , Rothstein Rosenfeldt Adler .
But he denied that he made the call or that it was his voice on the message .
He said his apartment building on Central Park South is owned by H. Dale Hemmerdinger , a fund - raiser for Mr. Spitzer who is the governor ’s nominee to be chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority , and suggested that allies of the governor might have given access to his apartment to someone who made the threatening call .
An official at Mr. Hemmerdinger ’s company said she was not prepared to comment .
Mr. Stone said : “ They have unfettered access to my apartment .
I am on television constantly .
As Gore Vidal said , never pass up the chance to have sex or be on television .
Putting together a voice tape that sounds like me would n’t be hard to do . ”
Mr. Stone said he could not remember where he was on the date of the call and had no specific evidence that his apartment had been entered without authorization .
But he said he believed that things have been missing from his apartment recently .
Mr. Winner also noted that technology is available that makes it possible to mimic another person ’s phone number on a caller identification machine .
Mr. Stone is known as an aggressive strategist , having once , while still a teenager , recruited a mole to infiltrate the 1972 presidential campaign of George S. McGovern .
He worked for Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984 and went to Florida in 2000 to help George W. Bush win the recount .
On his Web site , Mr. Stone claims to know “ first hand the gritty underside of American politics . ”

Americans to Bush : Exit Iraq Posted by Mark Silva at 6:50 am CDT
If Americans had a direct say in the Oval Office , most would tell President Bush to focus on an exit strategy that removes U.S. forces from Iraq .
Just one in four would suggest staying the course .
These are among the findings of a Gallup Poll that asked , '' If you could talk with President Bush for 15 minutes about the situation in Iraq , what would you , personally , advise him to do ? ''
" Bottom line , '' reports Gallup editor - in- chief Frank Newport : " The majority of Americans , as measured in a number of Gallup Poll surveys this year , believe the initial decision for the United States to become involved in Iraq was a mistake .
Research also shows a majority of Americans favor a timetable for withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq .
It is not surprising , therefore , to find that Americans -- if given the chance to talk with President Bush about Iraq -- would be most likely to tell him to figure out a way to get U.S. troops withdrawn from that country . ''
In open - ended responses to the question , 54 percent said focus on getting troops out of Iraq – with 39 percent saying pull the troops out , come home , end it , and 12 percent saying come up with and execute a well - thought out exit strategy .
Five percent suggested getting the Iraqis trained and let them run their own country .
Twenty - five percent suggested focusing on the continuation of current policies or becoming more aggressive , with 11 percent saying stay the course and 11 percent saying be more aggressive and 3 percent saying build up the military and send more troops .
Newport draws several conclusions from all this : --
The largest category of responses -- offered by a majority of 54 % -- would be to advise President Bush to focus on removing the troops from Iraq and exiting the country , leaving the situation in the control of the Iraqis .
This includes 39 % of Americans who would advise Bush to simply get U.S. troops out of Iraq now . --
A second group -- representing one - fourth of Americans -- would advise the president to essentially " stay the course " or to be even more aggressive in the country 's military actions . --
A smaller category would advise the president to work with others in finding a solution , including an advisory board or the United Nations .
Six percent would advise the president to admit his past mistakes and apologize .
Of course , there is a partisan divide in these answers , with 57 percent of the Democrats surveyed suggesting that Bush pull the troops out , come home , end it , and just 21 percent of the Republicans surveyed saying that .
And 24 percent of the Republicans surveyed said they would tell Bush he is doing a good job , stay the course , while just 2 percent of the Democrats surveyed said that .
" The president maintains the loyalty of a smaller group of Americans -- one in four -- who are supportive of his current actions or would even want him to be more aggressive , '' Newport reports .
" The administration argues that the war in Iraq is a necessary part of the war on terror , and that it is imperative to succeed , '' he reports .
" The president and members of his administration have said repeatedly that any type of discussion of withdrawal or the setting of a timetable is unacceptable at this time and would be tantamount to failure .
These arguments notwithstanding , however , the majority of the American public would instruct their president to focus on withdrawal of troops and the development of an exit strategy .
The Gallup Poll report was based on a series of interviews with 1,000 adults , with a possible margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points .

Very interesting poll results .
The majority opinion is clearly one of an exit strategy .
Yet just yesterday , he advised he thinks Iraq is like Korea where troops will be stationed there forever .
I do n't see MORE people wanting to escalate this as this drags on and on , but rather the opposite .
The real question is what are the Repubs going to do about this ?
We Dems have pretty much made up our mind years ago .
The Independents are joining us in increasing numbers .
Do the Repubs really want to continue their current approach ?

Again , an inaccurate headline .
The reality is that 39 percent say leave Iraq now .
Of the 54 percent that want out , 12 percent want some sort of exit strategy , but do not indicate how much longer the troops should stay there .
Of those 12 percent , do they think it should be two months , four months , six months , one year , two years ?
Heck , while I believe we should n't leave anytime soon I also do n't think we should be there forever , or at least not 150,000 strong forever .
Perhaps some type of long - term presence like in Korea , Germany , Japan , etc .
So , while I am part of the " 25 percent , " I am also part of the 12 percent that believe at some point in time there should be an exit of some sorts .
But the reality , Mark , is that most Americans do not believe in exiting Iraq anytime soon .

You wuz wrong , pal .
Admit it , I wo n't tell nobuddy .

Were you scared of Cheney ?
Were you mad cuz Saddam tried to kill yo daddy , and you wanted revenge ?
Has Saddam 's ghost come back to haunt you and rendered you unable to be rational ?
Aw , c'mon , chum , you can still save a good spot in the history books .
Abdicate , and tell the country you did it for the good of the nation , and the people will admire your courage .
The historians will then herald you as the , the , the Man .

When Mr. Bush believes he is right , he will not change course .
No matter the trials and tribulations , he will not be deterred .
And the lost resources ( lives and dollars ) seem to be well within Mr. Bush 's " stay the course " vision .
And someday
The Bush team will find the tunnel because , once found , there should be light at the end of it .

You have to wonder if those 25 % ers think that they are the only ones who still see this war as the only way ?
Are they smarter ?
Well it seems to me that if they were that smart , we would have foreseen what the consequences could have been knowing that the Iraqis have fought amongst themselves for decades .
If they were smart enough they would have used the correct amount of troops .
Smart enough to know that to disband the army would be a disaster .
Are they just smarter than 75 % of Americans ?
NO .. just misguided .

Johnny , even you must blush trying to spin " execute a well thought out exit strategy " to mean " Do n't believe in exiting Iraq anytime soon . "
You must define " soon " as 3 hours from now .

One thing I 've learned over the years is that when things do n't make sense , it 's because you do n't know the whole story .
It makes no sense that Mr Bush is bound and determined to stay the course of a policy that everyone knows has failed .
Or has it ?
Could it be that the objectives of this little war are not what we were led to believe they are ?
Should n't someone on the Hill be asking the question :
What are Bush and the Dick really up to ?
What are the real objectives here ?
Why have thousands of American men and women died and been maimed ?
Could it be that we do n't know the whole story ?

Funny how Mark Silva publicizes some Gallup Polls while ignoring others .
While looking through the Gallup link above , I found a poll released last week ( 5/24 to be exact ) on the Dem presidential campaign .
It has n't been mentioned in the " Swamp " or the Trib ( I did a search of the archives ) , and after reading Gallup 's headline of the poll , I can see why : " Clinton Leads Obama Among Whites , Blacks , and Most Other Democratic Subgroups " " Obama for President " would n't want this poll publicized .
And the " Swamp " , doubtless by coincidence , spikes any mention of it .

Screamer David , first of all , the U.S. is n't " occupying " anything .
We 're there at the pleasure of the freely - elected Iraqi gov't .
Back to screamer David .
Please see " The Marshall Plan " for a roadmap to creating democracy in a foreign country .
Seems to me like that one worked out pretty darn well .
Just ask Germany and Japan .
Posted by : Jeff | May 30 , 2007 4:03:19 PM
Jeff ...
I had to bring this current because it fell of the board and this " but what about west germany and Japan after wwII " argument seems to be a common thread amongst some righty 's in here .
Anyway : Jeff .... YOU need to look up the Marshall plan .
The Marshall plan had nothing to do with occupation by American troops .
The Marshall plan was entirely a financial aid plan .
We gave Marshall Plan funds to Turkey , Norway , Sweden , Italy , Portugal , Iceland , England , Ireland , Switzerland , Denmark , Greece , France , the Benelux countries , all of which we did n't occupy , AND East Germany .
We also offered the Marshall plan to the USSR .
Yes ... the Soviet Union .
We certainly were n't planning to occupy them as part of the Marshall plan .
We did n't " occuppy " ANY of those countries ( Including West Germany ) .
And I could ask Japan about the Marshall plan and how it worked out for them ( as you recommend I do ) , but all I 'd get back is a quizzical look ...
Japan was n't involved in the Marshall plan .
And you also need to learn the difference between an occupation of a hostile country and maintaining military bases in friendly , sovereign counries for the purpose of DETERRING ANOTHER FOREIGN POWER .
That 's what we were doing in West Germany and Japan .
Our military was morally and politically necessary in those countries because , as part of the WWII terms of surrender , Japan and Germany were not allowed to militarize !
( damn , you do not understand history ) .
We had to maintain a military force in order to keep foreign powers ( mainly the Soviets ) from moving in .
That is not analogous to what we did and are doing in Iraq .
Our current occupation of Iraq is nothing , nothing , nothing like the maintenance of military bases in post WWII Japan and West Germany .
Not militarily , not geopolitically , not morally .
Not by any standard .
And it shows quite simply in the bodycount of American soldiers and the ruinous results in America 's world relations and ability to maintain a moral leadership role in the world .
The Marshall plan was admired by ( non-communist ) world .
The Iraq occupation is admired by virtually noone outside our shores .

There you go again , John D. , twisting things to meet your viewpoint .
The following is a direct quote from the article : " The largest category of responses -- offered by a majority of 54 % -- would be to advise President Bush to focus on removing the troops from Iraq and exiting the country , leaving the situation in the control of the Iraqis . "
So I 'm not sure how you can then come up with this : " But the reality , Mark , is that most Americans do not believe in exiting Iraq anytime soon . "
Sorry , John , the reality is , the majority of Americans DO want troops out of Iraq either immediately or soon ( hence , a timetable ) .
Generally what is meant by " focus on removing the troops and exiting the country " is doing so soon .
That does n't mean in 10 years .
Please use some logic .

And the same pollsters said at the time of the invasion 84 % of the people in this country supported the invasion .
Hindsight is always 20 /20 .
In 5 more years we might look back and say that remaining in Iraq turned out to be the correct course of action .
In any conflict there is so much secrecy to protect our troops that the American public cannot possibly have enough information to make an intelligent decision .
These same people would probably have said we should have pulled out of WW II when we lost thousands of men on D - Day .
Would that have been a wise choice ?
The very nature of having to answer to every minor detail of a war , every casualty , every destroyed building , hampers the effort to finish .
Again , the media puts its nose into any situation in order to sell a few more papers and hobbles the ability of the military to function to its highest level of effectiveness .

Anyone who runs organizational meetings knows that if a meeting has no specified ending time , it is likely to drag on and on while the participants argue about every trivial thing they can think of and avoid the business that needs to be a priority .
The most important business is typically put off until the end of the meeting and then is given short shrift or tabled until the next meeting .
The only way to get the priority business done is to indicate a specific ending time for the meeting and to have a strong chairperson who is willing to prioritize the work so that the critical business gets done first , and whatever time remains after that can be spent on less important matters .
Our Yale grad MBA President George W. Bush , who failed in every business venture in which he participated in the private sphere , still does n't seem to have learned this basic fact of good business or seen its application to the situation in Iraq .
We need to tell the Iraqi government they 've got a limited time - and specify how limited - to count on our support to address the most important issues - such as sharing oil revenues , developing a truly representative government , building and training their armed forces , providing safety and security for their civilian population , developing and protecting their infrastructure - and then act on our plan regardless of whether they make best use of our offer or not .

No surprise here .
It 's amazing , though , that the American people were willing to swallow , hook , line and sinker , Bush & Cheney 's rationale for going into Iraq .
It just shows how ill - informed most Americans are when they believed that 9/11 and Saddam were somehow connected .
Now thousands are dead , billions are spent and Bush has spawned new generations of terrorists .
This Administration could n't have done more encouraging for hatred of America .
Nice going , George and Dick !

I wish someone would define what " winning the war on terror " actually means .
We are talking about extremists who are perfectly happy gathering followers worldwide , living in holes and caves , igniting dirty bombs wherever they think they'd have the greatest impact anywhere in the world , depositing followers at undisclosed locations and who can assimilate into various societies and who are called upon at will to create as much distruction as possible - and who are capable of sitting tight for years at a time until called upon .
How are we going to " win " exactly ?
How do we defend ourselves against extremists who are sooo patient ?
How were we to know they were already positioned in communities the US and Britain ?
I guess we did n't think about that before we took our big guns to Iraq and blew up all those people ?
How dare those extremists , who have been doing this for years , not tell us they had a strategy .

John D -- that 54 % beats the popular vote Bush won in 2004 and he called that a " mandate " .
So which kind of fuzzy math is going on now ?
I think its important to keep in mind that one of the reasons " they hate us " is we are in their face right now .
It goes back to Bin Laden ( you remember him , everyone ?
he 's never been caught btw ) calling for the removal of US troops from Saudia Arabia long ago , way back to an event called 9/11 .
Sorry to channel Ron Paul , but he has a basic point that Bush and Co. never understood in their arrogant ignorance .

" Karen " , if you read history , you 'd know that many nations have defeated extremist , " insurgent " and terrorist groups .
I 'll be happy to give several examples .
One is the US defeat of the Muslim " Moro " extremists .
The British defeat of the Mau - Maus in Kenya is another .
France defeated the " Algerie francaise " terrorists , and Irish government defeated its IRA terrorists in the 1920s .
I might also note that since the US took out after terrorists in 2003 , the terrorists have not made a successful terrorist attack in the U.S. I 'd call that success .
What do you call it -- defeat ?
I realize that real world history wo n't impede your French existentialist " what is victory ? " word - games , but a real world does exist , and in that real world extremist , terrorist groups and " insurgencies " , including Muslim terrorist groups and " insugencies " , have been defeated .
Posted by : bruce | May 31 , 2007 12:00:08 PM
Bruce , you are absolutely correct .
Terrorist factions have been defeated before ...
And it has never been accomplished by a country declaring a global war against " terrorism " .
It 's defeated by undermining the root causes of terrorism . ( note the IRA terrorists of recent decades have been defeated in the UK by political policy and police action , NOT an all out war in Ireland ) .

Bush 's decision to invade Iraq was an insane gamble , especially considering the lack of planning that went into it .
We lost this " war " as soon as the first bomb fell .
Anybody who was the least bit informed and objective could have predicted it .
The slightest familiarity with history , Murphy 's Law , and Dick Cheney 's lack of credibility would have been enough .
Now the majority of Americans want to abandon the people we were supposedly fighting for , after attacking their country and sparking the death and displacements of millions .
Now that we 've destroyed Iraq , we want to leave without rebuilding it .
If we do that , we ought to think long and hard about starting another war without adequate cause .
In fact , we should make sure it NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN .
If we do n't , we 're dead .
The problem now is that we 're stuck in a shameful web of incomprehensible conflicts that 's taking a huge toll on everyone involved .
Do you think that withdrawing American troops will " end " the " war ? "
That 's what the Democrats running for President will tell you .
Is there any reason to believe Hillary Clinton , ever ?
Or George Bush ?
Or Dick Cheney ?
Or John Edwards ?
I say no .
These people are charlatans .
The people who are willing to speak the truth without euphemism are the ones who will keep us out of such stupid and counterprductive wars in the future .
We need to fight the people who hurt us , not the innocent bystanders .
And that calls for smart , timely , focused , creative action , both against our particular enemies and in favor of our basic beliefs .
These beliefs do not include torture , pre-emptive war , or delusional dreams of world domination .
They do include liberty and justice for all .
They do include freedom , but not freedom that is spread through the barrel of a gun .
Bush 's decision to go to war in Iraq serves as the best example yet of what NOT to do .
Meanwhile , he has failed to do most of the things we MUST do for the longterm survival of our nation .
( Tune in some other time for a list of would has to be done . )

When
Discovery’s
The
And
was the sort of circus only Kansas can provide .
Just weeks after social conservatives took back control of the state school board in 2005 and put evolution squarely in the crosshairs again ; nearly 200 people , perhaps nursing a sense of déjà vu , pushed their way into the auditorium at Schlagel High School in Kansas City , Kan . for a public hearing on the drafting of new science standards .
These kinds of meetings almost never draw more than a handful of people .
Rarely is there any news coverage of them at all .
That night , with the state school board under new management , television news trucks lined up in the parking lot , their live broadcast antennae pushing up into the sky like the masts of sailing ships at anchor .
Inside , reporters prowled the room , camera operators in tow , seeking a sound bite that would give them the lead on that night 's news .
A brightly colored array of leaflets pro , con , and some simply bizarre , were pushed into eager hands at the door .
A long line formed quickly at a table near the back for speakers to sign in .
Around the room , longtime political opponents , most battle - scarred veterans of the 1999 attempt to write creationism into the curriculum , eyed each other warily , wondering what strategy the other side was plotting .
Members of the science standards committee were duly introduced , time limits established , and preliminaries out of the way , speakers for and against followed each other in quick succession to the microphone at the front of the auditorium .
A science professor explained the difference between fact , hypothesis , and theory .
A young mother stood up to say the schools , in banning prayer and teaching evolution had turned their backs on God .
She ’d been taught the creation story when she went to school and she wanted her children to learn it too .
A science teacher from a Catholic high school countered that evolution and religion are n't necessarily incompatible ; at least they are n't in her school .
In all truly entertaining spectacles , long stretches of high drama must be punctuated by brief moments of low comedy , and in that respect the Schlagel science standards hearing provided all that could be desired .
" If people come from monkeys , " bellowed one speaker who clutched a Bible in one hand while speaking in the practiced cadences of a street - corner preacher , " then why are there still monkeys ?
" And then there was this : " Auschwitz did not come from the Nazi high command , ” John James confided to the crowd , " it came from the teachings of the scientific and philosophical worlds , which produced nihilism , and I submit to you that much of that , if not vast proportions of it , came due to the teaching of evolution which , in turn , produces nihilism .
So what are we doing ?
Are we producing little Kansas Nazis ?
" Although many in the audience that night had never heard it before , creationists like James have always charged that Charles Darwin and his theory of evolution are responsible for much that is wrong with modern society .
The crimes of socialism , communism , fascism , even capitalism , have all , at one time or another , been laid at evolution 's door .
Likewise , eugenics , euthanasia , abortion , cloning , gay marriage , pornography , race - mixing , one world government , treason , illegal immigration , flag burning , school shootings , terrorism , atheism , secularism , multiculturalism , and post - modern malaise are all said to be the inevitable result of teaching evolution to impressionable school children .is an ancient walled city in the north of England built by the Romans .
It ’s home to one of the Christianity ’s greatest architectural wonders , and one of its darkest crimes .
Inside those Roman walls , the spires of York Minster , one of the great gothic cathedrals of all Europe , rise above a well preserved medieval city .
The Minster is famous for its immense stained glass windows , some of which are among the oldest in the world .
Having survived Cromwell and the iconoclasts , the earliest of these windows date back to the 12 century .
The exquisite beauty of the glass , the stories told there , and the special quality of the light inside the cathedral , are all part of the precious legacy of medieval Christian faith .
Nearby , brooding atop its steep motte , Clifford ’s Tower stands as a stark reminder to another of Christianity ’s great legacies : zealotry and fanaticism .
A few years ago I attended vespers in the serene interior of York Minster before walking the town ’s medieval streets to climb the battlements of Clifford ’s Tower to contemplate the horror that took place inside those walls .
York ’s Jewish community took refuge there on the night of March 16 , 1090 .
They were hotly pursued by a mob incited by “ crusaders preparing to follow their king against the Saracens , burgesses envious of Jewish wealth , barons indebted to the Jews , and fanatical clergy , ” according to English Heritage .
" Before attempting to revenge ourselves upon the Moslem unbelievers , " went up the cry , " let us first revenge ourselves upon the ' killers of Christ ' living in our midst !
"
The tower , in those days a wooden structure , was set afire .
Many took their own lives rather than be baptized or tortured by the mob that waited outside .
In the end , those who could not bring themselves to commit suicide were slaughtered .
In all , some 150 men , women , and children were killed .
Anyone who listened to James blame evolution for the Nazi ’s final solution at the science standards meeting that night , at least anyone who was even dimly aware that the bloody history of Christian anti-Semitism predates Darwin and evolution by centuries , must have wondered if , as James claimed , Darwin and evolution were really to blame for the Nazi ’s crimes .
Certainly , there is plenty of blame to go around .
Governments around the world , including in the United States , that turned away Jewish refugees must accept some of responsibility for what happened at Auschwitz .
Religious leaders such as Pope Pius XII , who stood by silently as the Germans rounded up European Jews and butchered them in concentration camps played a role as well .
Ultimately , those who rallied to the Nazi cause , especially those who ordered and carried out these crimes , including politicians , military men , industrialists , academics , religious leaders , as well scientists and physicians for whom a distorted understanding of evolution served as a justification for their racism and anti-Semitism , must all bear the judgment of history .
Fritz Stern , the noted Holocaust historian , professor emeritus at Columbia University , and refugee from Nazi Germany , does n’t number Darwin and evolution among the chief factors that led up to the Holocaust .
Higher on his list are the Protestant clergy , who he says were filled with anti-Semitic doctrine and shared Hitler 's " hostility to the liberal - secular state and its defenders . "
Hitler , Stern believes , came to power by fusing racial dogma with Germanic Christianity .
He probably saw himself as executing a divine mission .
" Some people recognized the moral perils of mixing religion and politics , " says Stern , " but many more were seduced by it .
It was the pseudo - religious transfiguration of politics that largely ensured [ Hitler 's ] success , notably in Protestant areas .
" Judge John Jones ruled , in December of 2005 , that intelligent design is n't science and the only real effect of the Dover school board 's ID policy was to advance religion , the Discovery Institute , a Seattle - based intelligent design advocacy group , found itself with a problem on its hands .
Discovery 's strategy , its very raison d'etre , had been to promote a renamed and re-branded creationism as science in order to skirt a damaging series of court rulings , most prominently the 1987 Supreme Court Edwards v. Aguillard decision , in order to bring both God and Genesis back into the nation 's public school science classes .
As Discovery 's Phillip Johnson , the UC - Berkeley law professor who plotted legal strategy for the intelligent design movement , told Elizabeth Nickson , a columnist for the National Post in 2004 : " Our strategy has been to change the subject a bit so that we can get the issue of intelligent design , which really means the reality of God , before the academic world and into the schools .
" Jones ' ruling was a humiliating defeat for Discovery because it knocked the legs out from under that carefully crafted strategy .
Jones saw through the sham , and in one stroke , not only laid waste to the intelligent design project to dress up creationism as both scientific and secular , he killed the notion that it might somehow pass muster in the courts , and find its way back into public schools , as well .
The depth of Discovery 's crisis was revealed by a series of embarrassingly lame attempts to label Jones , an observant Lutheran and conservative Republican appointed to the bench by George Bush , an activist judge .
That no one but the ID faithful could be convinced was demonstrated by Jones being named to Time magazine 's list of the " 100 Most Influential People in America .
"
When the activist judge label failed to stick , Discovery attempted to smear his ruling as plagiarized .
Legal experts were unmoved by the charge , which came across to the public at large as nothing more than sour grapes , and to add insult to injury , excerpts from Jones ' landmark ruling were subsequently published in the 2006 edition of Best American Nonrequired Reading .
Jones ' ruling brought another calamity down on Discovery as well .
The ruling effectively brought a close to any serious examination of ID 's merits in the mainstream news media .
The period leading up to the Dover ruling featured widespread news coverage of intelligent design claims , some of it credulous , but the plain , well - crafted language and compelling logic of Jones ' ruling convinced journalists to turn a more skeptical eye to Discovery 's claims .
The transparent unfairness of Discovery 's charges against Jones , combined with the increasingly shrill tone of commentary published on Discovery 's Evolution News and Views blog also played an important role in convincing mainstream journalists that intelligent design is merely a clever repackaging of the same tired old creation science product , rather than a new , somehow overlooked scientific theory .
Discovery also came under increasing fire from their allies in the creationist movement .
There was an embarrassing public split with the Thomas More Law Center , which represented the Dover school board .
In the run up to the trial , a number of Discovery expert witnesses precipitously withdrew from the case at the eleventh hour .
That left Discovery pleading that they never advocated teaching ID in public schools , a claim easily , and publicly , disproved by Thomas More 's lead attorney Richard Thompson .
Young and old earth creationists , who make up the vast majority of the foot soldiers in the intelligent design ranks , began to ask what value there was to the constant denials that " the designer " was in fact the Christian God of the Bible if the ID legal strategy could n't deliver the goods .
Thwarted by the court in their central strategic objectives , increasingly shunted off to the side by the news media , at odds with their creationist allies , and unable to produce any credible science of their own , the Discovery Institute has now adopted a cynical Plan B :
If you can't build your own house , you may as well tear your neighbor 's down .
Plan B has popped up with increasing frequency over a number of months , but got its official launch with speeches in Washington and Philadelphia earlier this week by Discovery fellow John West that quickly cut the Nazi ’s six million victims to “ hundred of thousands .
” According to West , “ Darwinism ” is responsible for “ the eugenics movement that sterilized scores of thousands of Americans deemed unfit in the early decades of the last century , the concurrent rise of the abortion movement , and the extermination of hundreds of thousands of supposed social undesirables by the Nazis in Germany .
” This week ’s events were preceded by the broadcast of “ Darwin ’s Deadly Legacy , ” a production of Coral Ridge Ministries , on Christian television last August .
The program , which explicitly links the crimes of Hitler to Charles Darwin featured Discovery fellows Richard Weikart , Jonathan Wells , Phillip Johnson , and Michael Behe .
They were joined on the program by right - wing columnist Ann Coulter , the author most recently of Godless : The Church of Liberalism .
Weikart , the author of From Darwin to Hitler writes that “ Darwinism played a key role in the rise of eugenics , euthanasia , infanticide , abortion , and racial extermination , all ultimately embraced by the Nazis . ”
As an academic , Weikart is sometimes coy about how much responsibility he places on the shoulders of Charles Darwin for the crimes of the Nazis , but his readers have no problem drawing the intended conclusions : “ I never knew about the link between Darwin and Hitler until after reading Richard Weikart ’s book , ” says Coulter .
“ To put it simply , no Darwin , no Hitler , ” says Dr. Kennedy , the host of the program . ”
“ Hitler tried to speed up evolution , to help it along , and millions suffered and died in unspeakable ways because of it .
” If what Weikart , West , Coulter , and Discovery say is true , one might think that Jewish organizations would welcome their support .
However , just the opposite is true .
“ Hitler did not need Darwin to devise his heinous plan to exterminate the Jewish people , ” according to a statement issued by the Anti-defamation League when “ Darwin ’s Deadly Legacy ” was aired .
“ Trivializing the Holocaust , ” said the ADL , “ comes from either ignorance at best or , at worst , a mendacious attempt to score political points in the culture war on the backs of six million Jewish victims and others who died at the hands of the Nazis .
" It must be remembered , ” the ADL continued , “ that D. James Kennedy is a leader among the distinct group of ' Christian Supremacists ' who seek to ‘ reclaim America for Christ ’ and turn the U.S. into a Christian nation guided by their strange notions of biblical law .
"
Next week , Discovery is participating in the World Congress of Families in Warsaw .
In doing so , they are joining with a motley crew of far - right anti-immigrant zealots who claim Muslims and other immigrants are contributing to the " demographic destruction " of Europe , extreme homophobes , misogynists , and anti-abortion fanatics who , holding life sacred , call openly for the murder of abortion providers .
Members of the European Parliamentary Working Group on Separation of Religion and Politics have protested the conference saying that several people scheduled to speak at the three - day conference have taken positions that clash with the European Charter of Fundamental Rights .
launch phase of Discovery ’s Plan B comes just as Chris Hedges new book ;
The Christian Right and the Rise of American Fascism is getting a lot of well - deserved attention .
“ Hedges draws striking parallels between 20th - century totalitarian movements and the highly organized , well - funded ‘ dominionist movement , ’ an influential theocratic sect within the country 's huge evangelical population , ” says a starred review from Publisher ’s Weekly .
“ Rooted in a radical Calvinism , and wrapping its apocalyptic , vehemently militant , sexist and homophobic vision in patriotic and religious rhetoric , dominionism seeks absolute power in a Christian state .
” A former New York Times foreign correspondent , Hedges was an eyewitness to the slaughter in El Salvador , Guatemala , Chile and Argentina , and Bosnia - Herzegovina .
He knows first hand the danger of religious fanaticism .
In tracing the history of Christian fascism in the United States Hedges explains the seminal role played by Rousas Rushdooney , the founder of the Dominionism , the theology behind Christian Reconstructionism .
Rushdooney “ dismissed the number of 6 million Jews killed in the Holocaust as an inflated figure and his theories on race echoed Nazi Eugenics , ” according to Hedges .
"
The white man has behind him centuries of Christian culture and the discipline and selective breeding this faith requires ... , " Rushdooney wrote .
" The Negro is a product of a radically different past , and his heredity has been governed by radically different considerations .
" Dominionists , writes Hedges , operate , for now , in the contaminated environment of the secular , liberal state .
They have learned to speak in code .
“ The code they use is the key to understanding the dichotomy of the movement , one that has a public and a private face .
In this they are no different from the vanguard , as described by Lenin , or the Islamic terrorists who shave off their beards , adopt western dress and watch pay - for - view pornographic movies in their hotel rooms the night before hijacking a plane for a suicide attack .
” The Reconstructionist strategy , notes Hedges , was outlined by Rushdooney 's son- in - law , Gary North :
“ We must use the doctrine of religious liberty to gain independence for Christian schools until we train up a generation of people who know that there is no religious neutrality , no neutral law , no neutral education , and no neutral civil government , ” says North .
“ Then they will get busy in constructing a Bible - based social , political and religious order which finally denies the religious liberty of the enemies of God . " who finances the Discovery Institute ?
None other than Howard Ahmanson , a wealthy Californian who is heir to the Home Savings bank fortune .
In the ‘ 70s Ahmanson joined Rushdoony ’s Christian Reconstructionist movement and served as a board member of Rushdoony 's Chalcedon Foundation for over ten years .
Ahmanson currently serves on Discovery ’s board of directors and is its largest contributor .
His gift of $ 1.5 million provided the seed money to organize Discovery ’s Center for Science and Culture .
So , as West , Weikart and the other Discovery fellows go about their business , speaking their codespeak , linking Darwin and evolution to Hitler , they draw their pay from modern American fascists , Holocaust deniers , racists , homophobes , and apologists for the Nazi eugenics .
That ’s Discovery ’s disturbing legacy .
Gulf of Tonkin intelligence called ' deliberately skewed ' / Secret papers on Vietnam episode finally released
2005-12-02 04:00:00 PDT
Washington --
The National Security Agency has released hundreds of pages of long - secret documents on the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin incident that played a critical role near the beginning of the Vietnam War .
The material posted on the Internet at midnight Wednesday included one of the largest collections of secret , intercepted communications ever made available for study .
The most provocative document is a 2001 article in which an agency historian argued that the agency 's intelligence officers " deliberately skewed " the evidence passed on to policymakers on the crucial question of whether North Vietnamese ships attacked U.S. destroyers on Aug.
4 , 1964 .
Based on the mistaken belief that such an attack had occurred , President Lyndon Johnson ordered air strikes on North Vietnam , and Congress passed a broad resolution authorizing military action .
The historian , Robert Hanyok , wrote the article in an internal publication , and it was classified top secret despite the fact that it dealt with events in 1964 .
Word of Hanyok 's findings leaked to historians outside the agency , who requested the article under the Freedom of Information Act in 2003 .
Some intelligence officials said they believed the article 's release was delayed because the agency was wary of comparisons between the roles of flawed intelligence in the Vietnam War and in the war in Iraq .
Hanyok declined to comment on Wednesday .
But Don Weber , an agency spokesman , denied that any political consideration was involved .
" There was never a decision not to release the history " written by Hanyok , Weber said .
On the contrary , he said , the release was delayed because the agency wanted to make public the raw material Hanyok used for his research .
" The goal here is to allow people to wade through all that information and draw their own conclusions , " he said .
Thomas Blanton , director of the National Security Archive at George Washington University , called the release of the document " terrific , " noting that the eavesdropping material known as signals intelligence , or sigint , is the most secret information the government has .
" NSA may be the most close - mouthed of all U.S. government agencies , " said Blanton , whose organization has published on the Web many collections of previously secret documents .
" The release of such a large amount of sigint is unprecedented . "
In his 2001 article , an elaborate piece of detective work , Hanyok wrote that 90 percent of the intercepts of North Vietnamese communications relevant to the supposed Aug.
4 , 1964 , attack were omitted from the major agency documents going to policymakers .
" The overwhelming body of reports , if used , would have told the story that no attack had happened , " he wrote .
" So a conscious effort ensued to demonstrate that an attack occurred . "
Edwin Moise , a historian at Clemson University who wrote a book on the Gulf of Tonkin incident , said the agency did the right thing in making public Hanyok 's damning case .
" A lot of people at the agency have n't been happy that communications intelligence was used to support a wrong conclusion , " he said .
Agency employees worked late Wednesday to meet a self - imposed end - of - November deadline , posting the intercepts , oral history interviews with retired agency officials and internal reports on the agency 's Web site at www.nsa.gov/vietnam/index.cfm.
Outed CIA officer was working on Iran , intelligence sources say Larisa Alexandrovna
Published : February 13 , 2006 Print This | Email This
The unmasking of covert CIA officer Valerie Plame Wilson by White House officials in 2003 caused significant damage to U.S. national security and its ability to counter nuclear proliferation abroad , RAW STORY has learned .
According to current and former intelligence officials , Plame Wilson , who worked on the clandestine side of the CIA in the Directorate of Operations as a non-official cover ( NOC ) officer , was part of an operation tracking distribution and acquisition of weapons of mass destruction technology to and from Iran .
Speaking under strict confidentiality , intelligence officials revealed heretofore unreported elements of Plame 's work .
Their accounts suggest that Plame 's outing was more serious than has previously been reported and carries grave implications for U.S. national security and its ability to monitor Iran 's burgeoning nuclear program .

While many have speculated that Plame was involved in monitoring the nuclear proliferation black market , specifically the proliferation activities of Pakistan 's nuclear " father , " A.Q. Khan , intelligence sources say that her team provided only minimal support in that area , focusing almost entirely on Iran .
Plame declined to comment through her husband , Joseph Wilson .
Valerie Plame first became a household name when her identity was disclosed by conservative columnist Robert Novak on July 14 , 2003 .
The column came only a week after her husband , former ambassador Joseph Wilson , had written an op -ed for the New York Times asserting that White House officials twisted pre-war intelligence on Iraq .
Her outing was seen as political retaliation for Wilson 's criticism of the Administration 's claim that Iraq sought uranium from Niger for a nuclear weapons program .
Her case has drawn international attention and resulted in the indictment of I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby , Vice President Dick Cheney 's former chief of staff , on five counts of perjury , obstruction of justice , and making false statements .
Special Prosecutor Patrick J. Fitzgerald , who is leading the probe , is still pursuing Deputy Chief of Staff and Special Advisor to President Bush , Karl Rove .
His investigation remains open .
The damages Intelligence sources would not identify the specifics of Plame 's work .
They did , however , tell RAW STORY that her outing resulted in " severe " damage to her team and significantly hampered the CIA 's ability to monitor nuclear proliferation .
Plame 's team , they added , would have come in contact with A.Q. Khan 's network in the course of her work on Iran .
While Director of Central Intelligence Porter Goss has not submitted a formal damage assessment to Congressional oversight committees , the CIA 's Directorate of Operations did conduct a serious and aggressive investigation , sources say .
Intelligence sources familiar with the damage assessment say that what is called a " counter intelligence assessment to agency operations " was conducted on the orders of the CIA 's then - Deputy Director of the Directorate of Operations , James Pavitt .
Former CIA counterintelligence officer Larry Johnson believes that such an assessment would have had to be done for the CIA to have referred the case to the Justice Department .
" An exposure like that required an immediate operational and counter intelligence damage assessment , " Johnson said .
" That was done .
The results were written up but not in a form for submission to anyone outside of CIA . "
One former counterintelligence official described the CIA 's reasons for not seeking Congressional assistance on the matter as follows : " [ The CIA Leadership ] made a conscious decision not to do a formal inquiry because they knew it might become public , " the source said .
" They referred it [ to the Justice Department ] instead because they believed a criminal investigation was needed . "
The source described the findings of the assessment as showing " significant damage to operational equities . "
Another counterintelligence official , also wishing to remain anonymous due to the nature of the subject matter , described " operational equities " as including both people and agency operations that involve the " cover mechanism , " " front companies , " and other CIA officers and assets .
Three intelligence officers confirmed that other CIA non-official cover officers were compromised , but did not indicate the number of people operating under non-official cover that were affected or the way in which these individuals were impaired .
None of the sources would say whether there were American or foreign casualties as a result of the leak .
Several intelligence officials described the damage in terms of how long it would take for the agency to recover .
According to their own assessment , the CIA would be impaired for up to " ten years " in its capacity to adequately monitor nuclear proliferation on the level of efficiency and accuracy it had prior to the White House leak of Plame Wilson 's identity .
A.Q. Khan While Plame 's work did not specifically focus on the A.Q. Khan ring , named after Pakistani scientist Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan , the network and its impact on nuclear proliferation and the region should not be minimized , primarily because the Khan network was the major supplier of WMD technology for Iran .
Dr. Khan instituted the proliferation market during the 1980s and supplied many countries in the Middle East and elsewhere with uranium enrichment technology , including Libya , Iran and North Korea .
Enriched uranium is used to make weaponized nuclear devices .
The United States forced the Pakistan government to dismiss Khan for his proliferation activities in March of 2001 , but he remains largely free and acts as an adviser to the Pakistani government .
According to intelligence expert John Pike of GlobalSecurity.org , U.S. officials were not aware of the extent of the proliferation until around the time of Khan 's dismissal .
" It slowly dawned on them that the collaboration between Pakistan , North Korea and Iran was an ongoing and serious problem , " Pike said .
" It was starting to sink in on them that it was one program doing business in three locations and that anything one of these countries had they all had . "
After the attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , Pakistan became the United States ' chief regional ally in the war on terror .
The revelation that Iran was the focal point of Plame 's work raises new questions as to possible other motivating factors in the White House 's decision to reveal the identity of a CIA officer working on tracking a WMD supply network to Iran , particularly when the very topic of Iran 's possible WMD capability is of such concern to the Administration .
