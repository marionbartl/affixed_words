Additional characters required in simple statements .
" select column1 from table1
where name = ' # {person_name} ' "
# becomes
Select [ : column1 ] .from [ : table1 ] . where do
name = person_name
end
Another library creates a larger barrier to entry when dealing with a foreign code base .
Objects know how to quote themselves .
1.to_sql #= > " 1 "
" foo " .to_sql #= > " ' foo ' "
:column.to_sql #=> " column "
[ 1 , ' foo ' , :column ] .to_sql #=> " 1 , ' foo ' , column "
Syntax Highlighting
Better than string concatenation to generate SQL statements .
" escaped_values = hash.values .collect { |value| sql_escape value }
insert into # {hash.keys.join ( " , " ) } values # {escaped_values . join ( " , " ) } "
# becomes
Insert.into[hash.keys.to_sql].values[hash.values.to_sql ]
Much better support for conditional statement building .
" select column1 from table1 , table2
where table1.column1 = table2.table1_id
# {" and table1.column2 >= #{quantity} " if quantity > 0 } "
# becomes
Select [ :column1 ].from [ : table1 , :table2 ] . where do
table1.column1 = table2.table1_id
table1.column2 >= quantity if quantity > 0
end
Fail without requiring a database trip for referencing tables in the where statement that do not appear in the table list .
Select [ : column1 ].from [ table1 ] . where do
table1.column1 = table2.column1
end #= >
Raises an error stating that table2 does not exist in the from clause .
Open for extension where necessary .
For example , ActiveRecord : : Base .execute could be changed to take a block .
class ActiveRecord :: Base
alias original_execute execute
def execute ( arg , &block )
original_execute block.call.to_sql(connection )
end
end
If this change were made , the sqldsl library could use the connection to create vendor specific sql .
This allows for things like changing sql to be prepared statement compatible when the oracle adapter supports this in the future .
The point is , as long as your sql is nothing more than a string it is not able to be easily modified .
However , an object representation of your sql could be evaluated in various contexts to produce different results .
I recently wrote about introducing sqldsl into my current project .
This led to a few conversations on what are the pros and cons of using sqldsl .
Cons : Pros :
WASHINGTON --Americans are living longer than ever , but not as long as people in 41 other countries .
For decades , the United States has been slipping in international rankings of life expectancy , as other countries improve health care , nutrition and lifestyles .
Countries that surpass the U.S. include Japan and most of Europe , as well as Jordan , Guam and the Cayman Islands .
" Something 's wrong here when one of the richest countries in the world , the one that spends the most on health care , is not able to keep up with other countries , " said Dr. Christopher Murray , head of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington .
A baby born in the United States in 2004 will live an average of 77.9 years .
That life expectancy ranks 42nd , down from 11th two decades earlier , according to international numbers provided by the Census Bureau and domestic numbers from the National Center for Health Statistics .
Andorra , a tiny country in the Pyrenees mountains between France and Spain , had the longest life expectancy , at 83.5 years , according to the Census Bureau .
It was followed by Japan , Macau , San Marino and Singapore .
The shortest life expectancies were clustered in Sub -Saharan Africa , a region that has been hit hard by an epidemic of HIV and AIDS , as well as famine and civil strife .
Swaziland has the shortest , at 34.1 years , followed by Zambia , Angola , Liberia and Zimbabwe .
Researchers said several factors have contributed to the United States falling behind other industrialized nations .
A major one is that 45 million Americans lack health insurance , while Canada and many European countries have universal health care , they say .
But " it 's not as simple as saying we do n't have national health insurance , " said Sam Harper , an epidemiologist at McGill University in Montreal .
" It 's not that easy . "
Among the other factors :
-- Adults in the United States have one of the highest obesity rates in the world .
Nearly a third of U.S. adults 20 years and older are obese , while about two - thirds are overweight , according to the National Center for Health Statistics .
" The U.S. has the resources that allow people to get fat and lazy , " said Paul Terry , an assistant professor of epidemiology at Emory University in Atlanta .
" We have the luxury of choosing a bad lifestyle as opposed to having one imposed on us by hard times . "
-- Racial disparities .
Black Americans have an average life expectancy of 73.3 years , five years shorter than white Americans .
Black American males have a life expectancy of 69.8 years , slightly longer than the averages for Iran and Syria and slightly shorter than in Nicaragua and Morocco .
-- A relatively high percentage of babies born in the U.S. die before their first birthday , compared with other industrialized nations .
Forty countries , including Cuba , Taiwan and most of Europe had lower infant mortality rates than the U.S. in 2004 .
The U.S. rate was 6.8 deaths for every 1,000 live births .
It was 13.7 for Black Americans , the same as Saudi Arabia .
" It really reflects the social conditions in which African American women grow up and have children , " said Dr. Marie C. McCormick , professor of maternal and child health at the Harvard School of Public Health .
" We have n't done anything to eliminate those disparities . "
Another reason for the U.S. drop in the ranking is that the Census Bureau now tracks life expectancy for a lot more countries -- 222 in 2004 -- than it did in the 1980s .
However , that does not explain why so many countries entered the rankings with longer life expectancies than the United States .
Murray , from the University of Washington , said improved access to health insurance could increase life expectancy .
But , he predicted , the U.S. wo n't move up in the world rankings as long as the health care debate is limited to insurance .
Policymakers also should focus on ways to reduce cancer , heart disease and lung disease , said Murray .
He advocates stepped - up efforts to reduce tobacco use , control blood pressure , reduce cholesterol and regulate blood sugar .
" Even if we focused only on those four things , we would go along way toward improving health care in the United States , " Murray said .
" The starting point is the recognition that the U.S. does not have the best health care system .
There are still an awful lot of people who think it does . "

Images appear courtesy of Kunsthaus and Daniela Edburg , copyright © Daniela Edburg , all rights reserved .
Some images are part of the show ‘ Bittersweet ’ now showing at Kunsthaus Miami .
Born in Houston in 1975 , Daniela Edburg grew up in San Miguel de Allende , Mexico .
She got her bachelor ’s degree in visual arts from the National University in the excellence program at the San Carlos Academy in Mexico City , where she still lives and works .
For anyone who has eaten the whole box , or bag , or carton the photographs in this series make light of our secret binges .
Here , the consequences of indulgence are tabloid or monster movie deaths .
Daniela Edburg ’s Drop Dead Gorgeous both mocks and satisfies our cravings .
How did you come up with the idea for this series ?
I started this series in 2001 for my art school thesis .
I painted back then , and I wanted to do a series of remakes of my favorite paintings .
[ I planned to add ] a spin by adding one element [ that would be ] very much out of context .
The first attempt was Death by Shampoo , after the Death of Marat by Louis - David .
But I lacked the skill to do a neoclassical reproduction .
So , I decided to do [ the reproductions ] with photography instead and modified my thesis subject to be about the relationship between glamour and death .
The medium itself has a glamorizing effect , and through color , composition , and humor you can create the illusion that something is aesthetically pleasing when , in reality , it could be horrible or gross .
The detail in these photographs is so elaborate .
How do you put together these bright narrative scenes ?
First I find my victim .
It is always a friend of mine ; I never work with professional models .
Each of the characters is defined by the little world she inhabits , so I usually take my color palette from the product that consumes her .
I start putting aside everything I have in those colors .
I ’m not selective at first , I just start filling my studio with all the stuff I have , or I find , or my friend has that might work .
I find the clothes the same way and I start this growing pile of orange and brown , or pink , or rainbow colored clothing .
How do you decide where to shoot these characters ?
The location is usually a familiar place ; my grandmother ’s house , a friend ’s kitchen , or my husband ’s studio .
Usually , it ’s a place that I loved when I saw and that I have in my head until I find a scenario where it works .
I ’m always surprised at how everything comes together when doing a photo .
For Death by Cotton Candy , I had no idea what the location would be .
We where just driving until we found the perfect spot .
My friend Paulina was wearing a dress with pink flowers , and suddenly we realized we were surrounded by pink flowers .
So , we stopped and took the picture .
Why do food and beauty products have such a sinister effect on the women in your photographs ?
I guess I am pretty compulsive .
That which gives me pleasure one minute , causes guilt the next .
I am surprised at how much I like the products I consume , but , if you stop for one second to think about it , it ’s absurd .
Yet , you ca n’t stop .
[ The work ] is not a criticism it ’s just an exaggeration of my own reality .
Your Drop Dead Gorgeous series reminds me of some horror films and thrillers featuring women — Carrie , the Stepford Wives , Basic Instinct , Rosemary ’s Baby — have any films or scenes influenced your work ?
Death by Bananas is an almost direct reference to Hitchcock ’s The Birds .
For Death by Cotton Candy I watched the Wizard of Oz , many times .
I love the tornado scene .
The first picture I did that was more referential to film than to painting or television , was Death by Gummi Bears ; a girl having a picnic and from a nearby sugar anthill thousands of gummi bears stream out to devour her .
Then , I did Death by Tupperware where a Japanese high school student in her uniform is being attacked by an enormous slimy tentacle from a creature that has formed in her refrigerator .
In Death by Saran Wrap a girl is trying [ to wrap ] a small container of strawberries when two huge plastic spiders start to wrap her into a cocoon of plastic wrap .
All these [ photographs ] come from the classic monster movies like the creature from the black lagoon , which I love .
Even though these photos are lighthearted , there ’s something really transfixing .
Why are we fascinated by the tragic deaths of glamorous , young , beautiful women ?
I think that death is very seductive .
It makes us appreciate the beauty in all that is ephemeral .
I think Baudrillard said we seduce with our weakness .
When are we frailer than in the moment when we are losing our lives ?
Your photos also look like advertisements where something has gone terribly wrong .
How does your work reference advertising ?
I guess the presence of the brand is what turns [ an image ] into an advertisement .
It is inevitable to [ look at this work and ] think back to images in television or magazines .
I think if you actually slapped a slogan on top of it would even work .
Of course , these photographs are much more subversive than advertising .
Are you critiquing advertising ?
I really do n’t consider my work a critique , although I like that many people do .
Many times how the work is seen is more interesting than how it was conceived .
Is Nutella out to get us ?
Does cake have a dark side ?
How are food and beauty products actually harmful ?
There ’s only your own dark side .
The cake is not really to blame .
It ’s not really about the products , but the relationship of love and then hate that we have with them .
When you look at a beautiful package of Oreos everything is new and shiny and attractive , and there is the promise of the sweetness and the pleasure , and then you go and open it and eat it and all you have are a stomachache , crumbs and garbage .
Why have you chosen these specific culprits —
Oreos , gummi bears , a toaster , etc . ?
Its very autobiographical , in most cases , there is a story behind each photo .
Some , like lifesavers , I do n’t really have an obsession with the actual candy but I think it is one of the best designed packages , a real classic .
Some of your photographs seem retro , or dated .
Is this intentional ?
The ones that have turned out retro are usually because of the location .
Like the oven in Death by Cake .
It was so beautiful I wanted it all to be built around it and around its style .
So I identified the character with Betty Crocker , on a bad day .
And it all turned out very fifties housewife .
[ Death by ] Nutella and [ Death by ] M&M ’s are very ’ 70s again because of the location .
I wanted to use a room in my Grandma ’s house before it was remodeled .
You live in Mexico D.F .
What ’s the difference between the response to your work in the States and in Mexico ?
I think the references are very universal .
In both places I get different reactions ; lots of laughter , lots of questions , and lots of stories .
Many people come to tell me about how they once ate a whole lasagna .
Paul C. Light , a professor of government at New York University who worked closely with Senator Thompson on campaign finance and ethics proposals , said that lobbying by a family member was “ an ugly practice no matter who the senator is , because it creates the appearance that his family is exploiting his stature and position . ”
Mr. Thompson was hardly the only lawmaker with relatives in similar positions .
As money pouring into lobbying firms has soared in recent years , many lawmakers have watched family members get into the business .
But ethics experts say the case is all the more striking when the relatives , like Tony and Daniel Thompson , have scant qualifications other than their family ties .
And the elder Mr. Thompson was one of the Senate ’s most outspoken advocates of tighter ethics and campaign finance rules .
Some groups whose interests and causes the elder Mr. Thompson supported in the Senate also hired his sons .
In 1998 , for example , Lockheed Martin hired Tony Thompson and his partner , Mr. Mathews , to lobby the federal government to maintain contracts to manage federal nuclear facilities in Oak Ridge , Tenn .
Lockheed had been a major source of money for Mr. Thompson ’s Senate campaigns ; around the same time he had hired a former Lockheed lobbyist , Powell A. Moore , as his chief of staff .
In November that year , Mr. Thompson and Tennessee ’s other senator , Bill Frist , invited Bill Richardson , then the energy secretary , for a tour of the facility to make the case for retaining Lockheed .
The next month , Mr. Richardson deferred a decision about the fate of the contracts for 15 months .
“ Secretary Richardson is to be commended for making a thoughtful decision , ” Mr. Thompson said at the time .
Lockheed lost the Oak Ridge contracts in 2000 , two years before Mr. Thompson left the Senate .
The loss of the contracts , Tony Thompson argued , showed that there was “ obviously no connection ” to his father .
There were some causes that the senator supported before his son lobbied for them .
As an actor , for example , Senator Thompson was a natural champion for the Motion Picture Association of America on subjects like copyright protection and obscenity regulation .
As a former trial lawyer , he was sometimes one of the few Republicans to oppose limits on personal injury suits and lawyers fees .
And as a former lobbyist for certain cable television concerns , it may have been natural that Mr. Thompson supported the cable television industry ’s goals in a regulatory overhaul of the telecommunications industry .
The meeting set off a chain of actions by the police .
Investigators obtained a copy of Mr. Arar ’s rental lease .
After finding Mr. Almalki listed as an emergency contact , they stepped up their investigation of Mr. Arar .
At the end of that month , the police asked customs officials to include Mr. Arar and his wife on a “ terrorist lookout ” list , which would subject them to more intensive question when re-entering Canada .
However , the commission found that the designation should have only been applied to people who are members or associates of terrorist networks .
Neither the police nor customs had any such evidence of that concerning Mr. Arar or his wife , an economist .
From there , the Mounted Police asked that the couple be included in a database that alerts United States border officers to suspect individuals .
The police described Mr. Arar and his wife as , the report said , “ Islamic extremists suspected of being linked to the al Qaeda movement . ”
The commission said that all who testified before it accepted that the description was false .
According to the inquiry ’s finding , the Mounted Police gave the F.B.I. and other American authorities material from Project A - O Canada , which included suggestions that Mr. Arar had visited Washington around Sept. 11 and had refused to cooperate with the Canadian police .
The handover of the data violated the force ’s own guidelines , but was justified on the basis that such rules no longer applied after 2001 .
In July 2002 , the Mounted Police learned that Mr. Arar and his family were in Tunisia , and incorrectly concluded that they had left Canada permanently .
On Sept. 26 , 2002 , the F.B.I. called Project A - O and told the Canadian police that Mr. Arar was scheduled to arrive in about one hour from Zurich .
The F.B.I. also said it planned to question Mr. Arar and then send him back to Switzerland .
Responding to a fax from the F.B.I. , the Mounted Police provided the American investigators with a list of questions for Mr. Arar .
Like the other information , it included many false claims about Mr. Arar , the commission found .
The Canadian police “ had no idea of what would eventually transpire , ’’ the commission said .
“ It did not occur to them that the American authorities were contemplating sending Mr. Arar to Syria . ”
TOKYO ( Reuters Life ! ) -
A researcher investigating underwater rock formations off the coast of Japan believes they are the remnants of an Asian equivalent of Atlantis -- an ancient civilization swallowed up by the ocean .
Marine geologist Masaaki Kimura says he has identified the ruins of a city off the coast of Yonaguni Island on the southwestern tip of Japan .
He has worked for decades to prove the rocks found by scuba diving tourists in 1985 are from an ancient city , which he says may have sparked the fable of Mu -- a Pacific equivalent of the tale of the lost city of Atlantis .
“ Judging by the design and the disposition of the ruins , the city must have looked just like an ancient Roman city , ” said Kimura , a professor at Ryukyu University and the chairman of the non-profit Marine Science and Culture Heritage Research Association .
“ I can envisage a triumphal arch - like statue stood on the left side of the Colosseum and a shrine over the hill , ” he told Reuters Television .
Some of the initial divers notices the rocks were unnaturally smooth and formed a sort of staircase near the island ’s shores .
Subsequent dives by Kimura revealed irregular rock outcrops over 1 square km ( 0.4 square mile ) and mounds of rubble .
Kimura says he believes the city had a castle , a shrine , an arch , statues and a colosseum .
“ In my estimation , the castle was situated right in the middle of the city .
And though not as big as the castle , a lot of ruins of shrine - like structures too have been discovered , ” he said at his research room .
Kimura believes the city was sunk in an earthquake 3,000 years ago .
However , many scientists dispute his claim , saying the ruins can be accounted for by natural phenomena such as tidal and volcanic activity .
They also say that very few artifacts such as clay pots or weapons have been found to prove humans lived among the rock formation at all .
Kimura , however , remains convinced .
“ I am getting close to a conviction that this is a mysterious civilization lost in a tectonic deformation in the Pacific ocean , ” he said .
WASHINGTON  President Bush is set to instruct the Treasury Department to block assets associated with Iran 's revolutionary guard corps in a new executive order declaring financial war on foreign saboteurs of the Iraqi government .
The paperwork to designate Iran 's revolutionary guard corps , or IRGC , and Quds Force is now on the president 's desk awaiting his signature , according to three administration officials who requested anonymity .
The designation of the IRGC and Quds Force would mark the first time the finance related executive order process , reserved usually for foreign terrorist organizations , would be used against a branch of a foreign military .
When queried by The New York Sun yesterday State and Treasury departmental spokesmen declined to comment .
A spokeswoman for the National Security Council , Kate Starr , when asked about the pending designation said it would be " inappropriate for me to signal what kind of steps we might take in the future . "
Before that , however , Ms. Starr said , " Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism .
It uses fronts and government entities , sending arms , expertise and money to groups like Hezbollah , Palestinian terrorist groups , and Shia militias in Iraq .
How we address Iran 's support for terrorism is part of an ongoing strategy and entails a range of activities and measures , consistent with our national laws and UNSC resolution requirements . "
The designation under a new executive order created to list organizations and people sabotaging Iraq 's government has been cleared by the National Security Council .
Initially , the proposal was to designate Iran under executive order 13224 that was created after September 11 , 2001 to freeze and block the financial assets of Al Qaeda .
The new order would instruct the Treasury Department to block all assets affiliated with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard , the elite paramilitary and intelligence arm of the Islamic Republic of Iran , whose Quds Force American military generals in Iraq have charged with masterminding the kidnap and murder of five American soldiers in January at Karbala .
The timing of any announcement by Mr. Bush is linked in part to opposition to such a terrorism designation by the four other veto wielding permanent member states of the United Nations Security Council : China , France , Russia , and the United Kingdom .
American diplomats in Turtle Bay are now working over a draft third round of U.N. sanctions against Iran for its insistence on spinning nuclear centrifuges in Iran .
A former senior adviser at the office of terrorism and financial intelligence for the Treasury , Michael Jacobson , yesterday said , " A designation of the IRGC would be an important step forward because the IRGC plays a significant role in the Iranian economy , handling some of the country 's largest construction projects . "
Mr. Jacobson , who left Treasury in February to join the Washington Institute for Near East Policy , said that the Revolutionary Guard earned revenues of about $ 1 billion a year from business interests , a figure he expected to rise .
" A designation could also have symbolic repercussions .
There are people in Iran who do n't really like IRGC because they are given an unfair competitive advantage , there are many no bid contracts for big construction , there is some resentment about the IRGC among the Iranian business class , " he said .
The idea of listing the Revolutionary Guard under the new executive order drew controversy in the lower levels of the interagency process .
State Department lawyers in particular argued that the designation could prompt foreign countries to declare segments of the American armed forces as terrorists as well .
The move will also undoubtedly raise already high tensions between America and Iran .
While protected areas such as national parks have been established to conserve charismatic animal and plant species , very few have been set aside to protect wild plants from which our crops originate , a WWF report reveals .
The report , Food Stores : Using protected areas to secure crop genetic diversity , published with the University of Birmingham in the UK , found that the centres of diversity of principal cultivated plants are poorly protected .
Poor protection
Many of these centres have only five per cent protection , some have only one per cent or less .
They include : the Central Andean wet puna of Peru and Bolivia , well known as reservoirs of grains and root crops including the potato ; the Eastern Anatolian deciduous forests and steppe of Iran , Turkey and Armenia , centres of diversity for many grains and fruit species ; the Southern Korea evergreen forests important for their genetic resources of tea ; and the Malaysian rainforests which are centres of diversity for many tropical fruit species , particularly mangoes .
" Crop wild relatives and varieties are the world 's repositories of crop genetic diversity and vital in ensuring future food security , " said Duncan Pollard , Director of WWF 's Global Forest Programme .
" With world population increasing and at a time of rapid environmental changes due to climate change , it is crucial that we conserve the widest possible natural genetic base of our food crops . "
Seed banks , where genetic resources are conserved under controlled conditions , can help in times of change .
However , they are unable to conserve the full range of crop genetic diversity because of the sheer number of seed samples involved .
advertisement
" Crop wild relatives and traditional varieties , which continue to evolve in their natural environment , are better placed to provide the necessary genetic materials to combat new pests or plant diseases , " Pollard added .
Community knowledge
Traditional farmers , who have contributed to crop diversity for millenniums , often can no longer do so as they abandon traditional farming systems for modern techniques and more genetically uniform crop varieties .
Communities that lose locally - bred varieties and the knowledge of how to grow them , risk losing control of their farming systems and becoming dependent on outside sources of seeds and the inputs needed to grow and protect them .
According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization , about 75 per cent of the genetic diversity of agricultural crops has already been lost in the last century .

Loss of traditional varieties has important implications for social equity .
Also , the loss of varieties bred to cope with local climatic conditions can impact the ability of impoverished communities to survive periods of drought or other atypical conditions .
In addition to more protection of our crop genetic diversity is the need for more protected area funding .
" A tiny fraction of profits from the companies dominating the agribusiness market would considerably boost the budgets , and thus increase protection , of many of the world 's under - resourced protected areas which conserve important crop genetic resources , " Pollard said .
" Governments should also be encouraged to expand and strengthen their existing protected areas network to include crop diversity conservation . "
WWF calls on all those who rely on crop genetic resources and diversity to formulate strategies that promote conservation of crop wild relatives and traditional varieties .
They should work together to conserve this vital element of biodiversity , and help secure global food security , especially for the world 's poorest .
The bridge had reportedly been scheduled to open later this month at what is a popular Chinese tourist spot .
There were 123 workers on the bridge removing scaffolding at the time of the accident , according to the Chinese news agency Xinhua .
China has identified more than 6,000 bridges that are damaged or dangerous .
The government in Beijing has pledged to fix or rebuild all the damaged bridges in an ambitious plan to make the country 's road network safer by 2010 , the China Daily newspaper reported on Tuesday .
Investigation under way
Rescuers reportedly managed to save 86 people from the wreckage of the bridge , including 22 people who were injured in the accident .
Dramatic pictures from the scene showed bulldozers and rescue workers , including about 400 soldiers , searching through a huge pile of rubble .
Initially the death toll was given as 29 , but more bodies were found as the search continued .
" I saw a lot of bodies lying on the road , some of them were construction workers and some were passers - by ... blood was everywhere , " one witness told Reuters news agency .

" A car was crushed flat under the bridge , it was so ruined that I could not even tell the size of the car , " he added .
" The whole thing collapsed , " said Nong Xiaozhong , one of two survivors in a 12 - man construction team on the bridge .
" There was no time to warn the other workers and I just managed to run a few steps before I was covered under the stones , " he told the Associated Press from hospital , where he is being treated for injuries to his abdomen .
The 320 m ( 1,049 ft ) bridge was being built to span the Jiantuo River , connecting the hilly Fenghuang County with neighbouring Guizhou Airport .
Xinhua said the workers had been busy " dismantling steel scaffolding erected during the construction process " when the collapse occurred .
According to local media sources , most of those working on the 12 m yuan ( $ 1.58 m ) bridge were local farmers who had been recruited for the project .
The cause of the accident is under investigation .
The bridge 's construction manager and project supervisor have been detained for questioning , Xinhua reported .
The accident comes amid growing concern about the state of China 's infrastructure in the country 's rush for development .
In its annual report last year , the ministry of communications identified 6,300 bridges across the country that were dangerous because of serious damage to " important structural components " , the China Daily reported .
Xiao Rucheng , of the Institute of Bridge and Structural Engineering , was quoted by the paper as saying that many of the newer bridges had been built in haste , and older ones were unable to cope with today 's traffic flows .
" China should learn a lesson from the collapse of the Mississippi bridge , and accelerate the inspection of unsafe bridges , " he said , referring to the 1 August collapse of a bridge in the US that killed at least nine people .

NOTES
These are approximate times for the Lower 48 states ; actual shower times can vary .
Bright moonlight makes it difficult to see all but the brightest meteors .
What is a meteor shower ?
A meteor shower is a spike in the number of meteors or " shooting stars " that streak through the night sky .
Most meteor showers are spawned by comets .
As a comet orbits the Sun it sheds an icy , dusty debris stream along its orbit .
If Earth travels through this stream , we will see a meteor shower .
Although the meteors can appear anywhere in the sky , if you trace their paths , the meteors in each shower appear to " rain " into the sky from the same region .
Meteor showers are named for the constellation that coincides with this region in the sky , a spot known as the radiant .
For instance , the radiant for the Leonid meteor shower is in the constellation Leo .
The Perseid meteor shower is so named because meteors appear to fall from a point in the constellation Perseus .
What are shooting stars ?
" Shooting stars " and " falling stars " are both names that describe meteors -- streaks of light across the night sky caused by small bits of interplanetary rock and debris called meteoroids vaporizing high in Earth 's upper atmosphere .
Traveling at tens of thousands of miles an hour , meteoroids quickly ignite from the searing friction with the atmosphere , 30 to 80 miles above the ground .
Almost all are destroyed in this process ; the rare few that survive and hit the ground are known as meteorites .
When a meteor appears , it seems to " shoot " quickly across the sky , and its small size and intense brightness might make you think it is a star .
If you 're lucky enough to spot a meteorite ( a meteor that makes it all the way to the ground ) , and see where it hits , it 's easy to think you just saw a star " fall . "
How can I best view a meteor shower ?
Get away from the glow of city lights and toward the constellation from which the meteors will appear to radiate .
For example , drive north to view the Leonids .
Driving south may lead you to darker skies , but the glow will dominate the northern horizon , where Leo rises .
Perseid meteors will appear to " rain " into the atmosphere from the constellation Perseus , which rises in the northeast around 11 p.m. in mid-August .
After you 've escaped the city glow , find a dark , secluded spot where oncoming car headlights will not periodically ruin your sensitive night vision .
Look for state or city parks or other safe , dark sites .
Once you have settled at your observing spot , lie back or position yourself so the horizon appears at the edge of your peripheral vision , with the stars and sky filling your field of view .
Meteors will instantly grab your attention as they streak by .
How do I know the sky is dark enough to see meteors ?
If you can see each star of the Little Dipper , your eyes have " dark adapted , " and your chosen site is probably dark enough .
Under these conditions , you will see plenty of meteors .
What should I pack for meteor watching ?
Treat meteor watching like you would the 4th of July fireworks .
Pack comfortable chairs , bug spray , food and drinks , blankets , plus a red - filtered flashlight for reading maps and charts without ruining your night vision .
Binoculars are not necessary .
Your eyes will do just fine .
The far more difficult question is the implication of Taylor 's ruling .
If this court is upheld or other courts follow suit , it will leave us with a most unpleasant issue that Democrats and Republicans alike have sought to avoid .
Here it is :
If this program is unlawful , federal law expressly makes the ordering of surveillance under the program a federal felony .
That would mean that the president could be guilty of no fewer than 30 felonies in office .
Moreover , it is not only illegal for a president to order such surveillance , it is illegal for other government officials to carry out such an order .
For people working in government , this opinion may lead to some collar tugging .
If Taylor 's decision is upheld or other courts reject the program , will the president promise to pardon those he ordered to carry out unlawful surveillance ?
The question of the president 's possible criminal acts has long been the pig in the parlor that polite people in Congress refused to acknowledge .
While Atty . Gen. Alberto Gonzales insists that the legal authority for the program is clear and filed a notice of appeal with the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals , few experts outside of the Bush administration support the program .
To the contrary , federal law seems perfectly clear in prohibiting warrantless surveillance .
UPDATE
Ken baby , it ’s your civil war as much as anyone ’s .
Pollack did more than anyone to encourage the famous “ liberal hawks ” to provide the bipartisan patina so useful in getting the Iraq invasion started .
In the Army , someone would have long since left him alone in the study with a pistol and the discreet interval required to make the only appropriate gesture of regret , genuine atonement being impossible under the circumstances .
In Japan he ’d be a picture of the different ways light reflects off entrails and cutlery .
In Washington , he gets to write new articles , as if he were an epidemiologist and not Typhoid Mary .
UPDATE II
Jonathan Turley ( who , for those with the new law professor fetish , is one at George Washington University ) puts his finger on why there is so much desire to focus on the " quality " of Judge Taylor 's written opinion while all but ignoring the fact that a federal court just declared that the President of the United States has been repeatedly violating federal criminal laws , and still is : Legal battles which involve the government typically are waged over abstract questions as to whether a particular government action ( a new law or a President 's order ) is invalid as being unconstitutional .
While such battles can generate substantial emotion , they do not typically implicate government officials personally .
But the FISA ruling from Judge Taylor is of a much different nature .
The question being decided by NSA cases is , effectively , whether George Bush and his top officials , along with those at the NSA following his orders by eavesdropping without judicial approval , are guilty of felonies .
As Professor Turley notes , very few people actually believe the answer to that question is difficult to discern :
This has been the most bizarre part of the NSA scandal all along : the President got caught red - handed violating an extremely clear law -- he admitted to engaging in the very behavior which that law says is a felony punishable by up to 5 years in prison and a $ 10,000 fine -- and yet official Washington ( the political and pundit classes ) simply decided to pretend that was n't the case .
They agreed to acquiesce to the administration 's fiction that there are some sort of complex and difficult legal questions with which one must grapple , and that only shrill partisans say that the President is violating the criminal law .
And thus , a Washington ruling class which reveled in subpoenas and criminal investigations over such towering matters as Whitewater , Vince Foster and Monica Lewkinsky has collectively decided that talk of criminality on the part of the President for how he is spying on Americans is imprudent and unserious .
The Justice Department lawyers who approved this illegal program , the political officials who ordered it , and the journalists who defended it ( and have enabled this presidency ) are all part of the same circle , and the very suggestion that any of this is actually criminal -- even though it is all being done in violation of the crystal clear criminal law -- is just too unpleasant , too unruly , too disruptive to admit .
As Turley puts it : " The question of the president 's possible criminal acts has long been the pig in the parlor that polite people in Congress refused to acknowledge .
" But Judge Taylor 's ruling -- with its very un-Beltway irreverence towards the President , and free of the fear of describing the President 's lawbreaking as what it is -- is forcing that question out into the open , which is what explains so much of the hostility towards Judge Taylor .
This judge , unknown to the Important People in academia and the political power centers , sitting in her little Detroit courtroom , has broken the rules .
She used language which is uncouth ( she pointed out the obvious -- that this President has pretenses to being a King ) and refused to pay homage to the false orthodoxy that there are really difficult questions triggered by the President 's refusal to abide by the criminal law .
How irresponsible , unscholarly and unserious she is .
This is the same mindset that has placed off limits any real accounting for the abject disaster that our country has been lead into in Iraq .
Official Washington wo n't accept any emphatic declarations of guilt over what happened because virtually the entire Washington establishment endorsed the invasion of Iraq , continued to defend the occupation , and is thus responsible for it .
Thus , it 's acceptable to offer polite and muted criticisms of those responsible , but they are not to be castigated or stigmatized in any way for their horrendous misjudgments and ongoing deceit .
Those who advocated the invasion of Iraq and made one false statement after the next about this war over several years are still respected wise experts whose wisdom still should be listened to , despite their little mistake which is perfectly understandable and not , in any way , a sign of any real flaws in character , intellect , integrity or judgment .
That is what responsible , serious people have decided , and only shrill partisan hysterics speak in more direct or accusatory tones about what happened in Iraq .
Demanding accountability for those responsible for it , or believing that those who most aggressively advocated this war ought at least to suffer a loss of credibility and status , is the just partisan , angry bile that is really unwarranted and unhelpful .
That is exactly what is driving the reaction to this court ruling as well .
Notwithstanding all of the professorial angst - ridden deliberations , the NSA scandal is and always has been extremely simple .
Congress , by an overwhelming bipartisan majority , passed a law 30 years ago making it a felony to eavesdrop on Americans without warrants and George Bush got caught violating that law -- a law nobody ever suggested was invalid until he got caught violating it .
People who violate criminal laws are criminals , even if -- at least in the United States -- they hold high government positions .
In decisive and unapologetic tones , Judge Taylor ruled -- consistent with the consensus of most legal experts -- that the President has been continuously breaking the law without any excuse , and that is something which our pundit and political classes simply want to ignore . :
In rather stark terms , Jim Henley reacts to the calm , casual acknowledgment this weekend by leading Iraq war advocate Ken Pollack that Iraq is consumed by a civil war , a recognition Pollack is able to make on the Op - Ed page of the Washington Post , because he is still deemed an Important Foreign Policy Expert : Bill Kristol , Charles Krauthammer , Newt Gingrich , Dick Cheney and on and on -- all of them treated by the national media as Important , Wise , Serious foreign policy figures despite their being fundamentally and recklessly wrong about virtually everything with regard to our Iraq disaster .
The one thing which the permanent Washington class does not want is accountability -- not for tragic errors , not for lawbreaking -- because being held accountable is the one real threat to their fiefdoms . : Via Atrios , Tom Tomorrow has a cartoon which illustrates this sad dynamic perfectly .
In our recent publications we told about the amazing Russian photographer Prokudin - Gorsky ( the official photographer of Russian empire ) who had a special technology of making three different shots and then combining them into one colour image .
So at that time that was the first coloured photo art about Russia .
But not the only one .
At the beginning of the XX century another Russian photographer , Sergey Ivanovich Borisov , during his expedition across mountain areas of Altai ( 1907 - 1914 ) made more than 1000 photos later on used as material for coloured post cards of various European publishing offices .
Here is the part of them .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Iraq has emerged as the world ’s second most unstable country , behind Sudan , more than four years after President George W. Bush ordered the U.S. invasion to topple Saddam Hussein , according to a survey released on Monday .
The 2007 Failed States Index , produced by Foreign Policy magazine and the Fund for Peace , said Iraq suffered a third straight year of deterioration in 2006 with diminished results across a range of social , economic , political and military indicators .
Iraq ranked fourth last year .
Afghanistan , another war - torn country where U.S. and NATO forces are battling a Taliban insurgency nearly six years after a U.S. - led invasion , was in eighth place .
“ Iraq and Afghanistan , the two main fronts in the global war on terror , both suffered over the past year , ” a report that accompanied the figures said .
“ Their experiences show that billions of dollars in development and security aid may be futile unless accompanied by a functioning government , trustworthy leaders , and realistic plans to keep the peace and develop the economy . ”
The index said Sudan , the world ’s worst failed state , appears to be dragging down its neighbors Central African Republic and Chad , with violence in the Darfur region responsible for at least 200,000 deaths and the displacement of 2 million to 3 million .
The authors of the index said one of the leading benchmarks for failed state status is the loss of physical control of territory or a monopoly on the legitimate use of force .
Other attributes include the erosion of legitimate authority , an inability to provide reasonable public services and the inability to interact with other states as a full member of the international community .

CIA Black Op to Destabilize Iranian Regime
James Joyner · · 16 comments
CIA sources have leaked to ABC News an alleged covert plan to destabilize the Iranian regime through non-lethal means .
The CIA has received secret presidential approval to mount a covert “ black ” operation to destabilize the Iranian government , current and former officials in the intelligence community tell the Blotter on ABCNews.com .
The sources , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the subject , say President Bush has signed a “ nonlethal presidential finding ” that puts into motion a CIA plan that reportedly includes a coordinated campaign of propaganda , disinformation and manipulation of Iran ’s currency and international financial transactions .
The sources say the CIA developed the covert plan over the last year and received approval from White House officials and other officials in the intelligence community .
Officials say the covert plan is designed to pressure Iran to stop its nuclear enrichment program and end aid to insurgents in Iraq .
“ There are some channels where the United States government may want to do things without its hand showing , and legally , therefore , the administration would , if it ’s doing that , need an intelligence finding and would need to tell the Congress , ” said ABC News consultant Richard Clarke , a former White House counterterrorism official .
Current and former intelligence officials say the approval of the covert action means the Bush administration , for the time being , has decided not to pursue a military option against Iran .
“ Vice President Cheney helped to lead the side favoring a military strike , ” said former CIA official Riedel , “ but I think they have come to the conclusion that a military strike has more downsides than upsides . ”
There ’s not much meat to the alleged plan laid out in the piece , so I ’m less concerned than Ed Morrissey or AllahPundit that these revelations necessarily derail it .
After all , the working assumption has long been that we ’ve got covert ops going on in Iran for both intelligence collection and counter - regime purposes .
Indeed , it ’s quite possible that these “ leaks ” are part of an authorized psychological warfare campaign aimed at bolstering diplomatic efforts and / or strengthening the resolve of anti-regime players in Iran .
If that ’s not the case , however , and these are rogue agents going to the press over internal policy disputes , they should be rooted out and put in jail for a very long time .
We simply can not have people entrusted with classified mission going to the press when they do n’t like their orders .
That ’s true regardless of the merits of the plan .
The details outlined in ABC ’s report are sketchy at best and I do n’t have the expertise in ops planning or the Iranian situation to effectively assess it , anyway .
Offhand , I ’m skeptical at plans to “ destabilize ” regimes unless there ’s a pretty good answer to “ And then what ? ” at the ready .
Still , that ’s a call that the president gets to make , not the hired help .
UPDATE : In the comments below , Dave Schuler draws attention to Dan Drezner ‘s remarks on this , with which I largely concur .
Money quote : “ If I have to choose between a 20 % chance at regime change ( I ’m being generous ) or an 80 % chance of Iran ’s current regime agreeing to suspend its nuclear weapons program ( equally generous ) , I ’ll take the latter option . ”
I would put the odds at something closer than 2 % and 30 % , but yes .
Steven Taylor ‘s comparison is also apt : “ [ T ] his news is about as shocking as a headline that states : ‘ Jerry Sloan Authorizes New Plan to Slow Tim Duncan for Game 3 ’— of course the administration has covert processes in place to try and destabilize Iran . ”

( A game - changing moment from the New York Times - promoted by MissLaura )
In an unusually long editorial , the nation 's paper of record demands an immediate and orderly withdrawal from Iraq concluding :
This country faces a choice .
We can go on allowing Mr. Bush to drag out this war without end or purpose .
Or we can insist that American troops are withdrawn as quickly and safely as we can manage — with as much effort as possible to stop the chaos from spreading .
The editors finally come to the opinion that most members of this community already hold , and have for some time , saying :
It is frighteningly clear that Mr. Bush ’s plan is to stay the course as long as he is president and dump the mess on his successor .
Whatever his cause was , it is lost .
It is an editorial worth reading .
This is a necessarily short diary , and I will go back to beating the drum of not funding later , but I am happy to use this space to congratulate the Times for being so direct on an issue so important .
Craig read a statement and took no questions during the short news conference concerning his June 2007 arrest .
Craig denies being gay , regrets guilty plea
Sen. Larry Craig ( R - Idaho ) denied that he is gay at a Boise press conference on Tuesday , and said he regretted that he pled guilty to “ disorderly conduct ” at a Minneapolis airport in June .
“ I am not gay .
I never have been gay , ” Craig said .
“ I was not involved in any inappropriate conduct .
I chose to plead guilty to a lesser charge in hopes of making it go away , ” Craig said .

Craig was arrested on June 11 in a men ’s bathroom at Minneapolis - St. Paul International Airport after he attempted to solicit sexual favors with an undercover police officer , according to a police report .
Two months later , he pled guilty to disorderly conduct , was fined and was placed on unsupervised probation for more than a year .
Craig , who was first elected to the Senate in 1990 , gave no hint whether he will be seeking a fourth term , only saying he will be making that decision next month .
Craig apologized to his family , friends , staff and fellow Idahoans for “ the cloud placed over Idaho . ”
He said he overreacted by pleading guilty to disorderly conduct , and reiterated that he did “ nothing wrong ” in Minneapolis .
He also lashed out at his hometown paper , the Idaho Statesman , for playing a role in his guilty plea in June .
“ Without a shred of truth or evidence to the contrary , the Statesman has engaged in this witchhunt , ” Craig said .
“ In pleading guilty , I overreacted in Minneapolis because of the stress the Idaho Statesman investigation and the rumors it has fueled all around Idaho . ”
The newspaper published an in - depth report Tuesday , alleging previous incidents of homosexual conduct between Craig and three unnamed men over the last several decades .
“ The Statesman also explored dozens of allegations that proved untrue , unclear or unverifiable , ” it reported .
The newspaper had withheld publishing the story until Roll Call 's report of Craig 's guilty plea Monday .
Meanwhile , the Senate GOP leadership called for an ethics committee investigation into what it called a “ serious matter . ”
“ Due to the reported and disputed circumstances , and the legal resolution of this serious case , we will recommend that Sen .
Craig ’s incident be reported to the Senate Ethics Committee for its review , " it said in a statement signed by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( Ky. ) , Minority Whip Trent Lott ( Miss . ) , GOP Conference Chair Jon Kyl ( R - Ariz . ) , Public Policy Committee Chairwoman Kay Bailey Hutchison ( Texas ) , and NRSC Chairman John Ensign ( Nev. )
Some conservative groups and commentators are already calling for his resignation .
The Idaho Values Alliance said in a statement that it “ strains credulity to think that the senator can provide an explanation for his guilty plea . ”
Conservative talk show host Hugh Hewitt wrote on his website yesterday that “ Craig 's behavior is so reckless and repulsive that an immediate exit is required . ”
Idaho Republican Party Chairman J. Kirk Sullivan issued a statement after Craig ’s speech urging Idahoans to “ avoid rushing to judgment and making brash statements about a man who has dedicated his life to public service . ”

ROME ( Reuters ) - Scientists have discovered particles of cocaine and marijuana , as well as caffeine and tobacco , in the air of Italy ’s capital , they said on Thursday .
The concentration of drugs was heaviest in the air around Rome ’s Sapienza university , though the National Research Council ’s Dr. Angelo Cecinato warned against drawing conclusions about students ’ recreational habits .
Calling their study “ the first in the world to show the presence of particles of cocaine suspended in the atmosphere of the city ” , the researchers said they took samples in Rome , the southern city of Taranto and in Algiers in North Africa .
Nicotine and caffeine were detected in all three , “ showing how widespread consumption of these substances is and how they remain in the atmosphere ” , state - funded CNR said in a statement .
The concentration of cocaine in Rome ’s atmosphere was only 0.1 nanogrammes ( 1 nanogramme is one billionth of a gramme ) per cubic metre at its height during winter months , the researchers said .
But the conclusions were worrying for public health .
“ It is well documented that even small concentrations in the air of these pollutants can seriously damage health , ” said Dr. Ivo Allegrini of the CNR ’s Institute for Atmospheric Pollution .

Electricity from beer ?
It may sound like a farfetched idea cooked up after a few pints at the pub , but a partnership between Foster ’s Brewery and scientists at the University of Queensland in Australia and the University of Ghent in Belgium has produced such a marvel .
The " beer battery , " as it ’s being affectionately called , is actually a microbial fuel cell ( MFC ) .
The fuel cell uses sugar - consuming bacteria to generate power from waste water produced in the brewing process .
The bacteria consume the organic matter in the brewery ’s waste water , breaking down alcohol , starch and sugar .
The byproducts from the process are electricity , clean water and carbon dioxide , all very Earth - friendly .
Brewery waste water is particularly desirable for such an experiment because it ’s biodegradable , says Professor Jürg Keller of the of the University of Queensland [ ref ] .

The study was funded by a Queensland Government Sustainable Energy Innovation Fund Grant ( about $ 115,000 U.S. dollars ) and a grant from the Australian Research Council ( for a little more than 1 million U.S. dollars ) .
The university ’s prototype MFC was 10 liters , or 2.6425 gallons , but the final cell , to be installed at Foster ’s brewery , will hold 660 gallons .
The MFC will likely produce 2 kilowatts of power , or enough to power an average home , and will be operating at the brewery by September .
" It ’s not going to make an enormous amount of power -- it 's primarily a waste water treatment that has the added benefit of creating electricity , " Professor Keller told the Associated Press [ ref ] .
For a country like Australia , which is experiencing its worst drought in 100 years , the ability to salvage and purify waste water could be especially valuable [ ref ] .
Foster ’s microbial fuel cell could spawn similar devices to be used across the food and beverage industry , which generates a lot of organic waste .
Because microbial fuel cells are well suited to disposing of this waste , they have generated a lot of interest lately among researchers .
Like Foster ’s beer battery , MFCs convert chemical energy trapped in a " bio-convertible substrate " ( meaning some sort of organic matter ) to electricity [ ref ] .
The bacteria act as a catalyst , facilitating the reaction .
Perhaps a sign of the excitement developing around MFCs , there is the first Web site " completely devoted to the beauty of microbial fuel cells " and several blogs covering MFCs and related topics .
In September 2007 , a four - day conference called " Anaerobic Digestion : Bio-energy for Our Future " is meeting in Brisbane , Australia , where particular attention will be paid to methods of gleaning energy from waste matter .
So will the beer battery start a green revolution ?
Probably not , but it ’s certainly an intriguing method to clean up waste , harvest energy and produce clean water .
It also speaks to a growing trend in which many companies are going green by investing in a wide range of projects , large and small , rather than seeking out one panacea .
While ethanol - or hydrogen - powered cars and cheap , ubiquitous solar power may eventually revolutionize the automobile and power industries , instituting many small , eco-friendly projects can have an equal , if not , greater impact .
One brewery is actually a step ahead of Foster ’s .
In fact , when Foster ’s installs its MFC this summer , it wo n’t be the first brewery using microbial - munching bacteria to clean waste water .
The New Belgium Brewery in Fort Collins , Colorado , uses bacteria to clean its waste water , producing methane gas as a byproduct .
While the brewery uses wind power for most of its power needs ( about 85 percent ) , the methane gas from the waste - water clean - up kicks in the remaining 15 percent .
New Belgium also recaptures and reuses water , uses " green building " techniques in constructing its facilities , has a sustainability specialist on staff and follows the mantra of reduce / reuse / recycle as much as possible .
Not only are these practices good for the environment , they ’re good for the bottom line , too : the New Belgium Brewery claims to save $ 3,000 every month on its electricity bill .

I try not to lead a comfortable life .
Hiding inside your comfort zone is a good way to prevent yourself from ever experiencing anything unique , fun or challenging .
Pushing past your fears can be tricky , but ultimately , I think it ’s what life is about .
Getting Uncomfortable
Instead of just cheery , self - help advice I ’d like to briefly explain what I mean by stepping outside your comfort zone .
To me , becoming uncomfortable means :
Challenges outside your skills .
Activities outside your personality .
Experiments that question your beliefs .
Although becoming uncomfortable can be used for personal challenges as equally as it applies to public ones , most people think of social ventures when they view their comfort zones .
Public speaking , talking to strangers or taking up bizarre new hobbies are just a few different examples .
Getting uncomfortable happens when the benefits can be high , failure is limited but fears hold you back .
Do n’t Worry About Extroversion , Confidence or Having an Intense Drive
Before I start spewing advice , I ’d like to point out some thing I do n’t believe are the most important factors in breaking through your comfort zone :
Extroversion – I ’ve already mentioned how I do n’t like labels of extrovert and introvert .
In my life I ’ve been labeled as bordering on the extreme of both .
Even tests like Myers - Briggs can only give you a representation of where you currently are , not your immutable personality .
Before I started public speaking , people told me I was heavily introverted .
Now people from Toastmasters say I ’m extremely extroverted .
Confidence – Breaking outside your comfort zone requires venturing into the unknown .
You ca n’t possibly have a reasonable basis for confidence when you have no idea what will happen .
General confidence in your ability to handle new situations is useful , but this can also be trained .
Intense Motivation – I end up venturing out of my comfort zone mostly on a whim .
I like to stress curiosity over motivation .
Intense motivation is good for big goals .
But for stepping into the unknown , being guided by your curiosity seems to work better .
Benefits of Stepping Out of Your Domain
What are the benefits of putting yourself through what can be a stressful situation ?
Growth – Above all , you ’ll improve as a person .
Stepping into the unknown teaches you , gives you new life experiences and tests you .
Pride – Even if your experience is a complete failure , it feels good to overcome your fears .
Adventure – I ’ve found that my success rate with new ideas is unusually high .
Sure , I occasionally get a new activity or adventure that turns out to be a dud , but once you push through the initial fears you might find something you love .
I went to Toastmasters on a whim , now it is one of my favorite parts of my week .
Escape Boredom –
At least it can never be boring .
If you use boredom as your mark of failure rather than embarrassment or results , you can inject a lot more enthusiasm into your life .
Tips for Getting Started
Discipline –
It can take practice to force yourself to do things that your emotions and body want to avoid .
Discipline yourself by slowly taking on more daring challenges .
This also means you should n’t expect to have perfect mastery over fear .
I certainly do n’t .
Curiosity –
The more I learn , the more I realize I do n’t know .
At this rate I expect to be ignorant of almost everything in a few years .
Throw away your assumptions about what will happen and get curious instead .
Find a Safety Net – Kids sometimes carry around blankets or stuffed toys to comfort them in unfamiliar environments .
Use the same principle with your friends .
Bring along a person who will be supportive of you to help reduce the stress .
Do n’t be afraid to fly solo , but make it easier on yourself if you can .
Open Your Mind – Do n’t label certain activities as adventures and others as work .
What you are doing right now is an adventure .
You will find a lot more opportunities for exploration if you get rid of expectations about the types of adventures you ’ll find .
Find Your Strengths , Now Do the Opposite – I ’ve never been a fan of so - called “ strength - based ” approaches to personal - development .
Sure people have different talents and attributes , but do n’t let that limit you in the types of experiences you can have .
Computer geek ?
Try martial arts .
New Age ?
Try a course in computers .
Take Classes – Courses and organizations are the fastest way to find new experiences .
For a low price you can usually learn something completely different .
All while meeting new people in an environment that respects change .
Use Your Social Network – People are gateways to new adventures , expand your social network and you can get unusual opportunities you probably would n’t have considered before .
Becoming friends with a music buff exposed me to new artists and even a concert I would n’t have otherwise seen .
Break it Down – Do n’t try to tackle your biggest fears all at once .
My approach is to pick a decision and try it out .
If it was too difficult , break it into something more manageable and try again .
If it was too easy , ramp up the difficulty and go at it .
If you ca n’t get up to speak at a conference , try Toastmasters .
If speaking at meetings is n’t stimulating enough , try to get engagements at larger events .
Accept the Nervousness – Do n’t try to control how you feel .
You can feel nervous or uncertain and still move forward .
Just repeat to yourself that no matter what happens , you can deal with it .
Make Time – Carve out a section of your day for exploring new ideas and adventures .
This website is all about how to become more productive .
Use the energy and time you can save and invest it .

Interview with Terror Expert Ron Suskind " The President Knows more than He Lets on "
One hundred suspected terrorists from all over the world are still being held in secret American prisons .
In an interview with SPIEGEL ONLINE , CIA expert Ron Suskind accuses Washington of " running like a headless chicken " in its war against al - Qaida .
He reserves special criticism for the CIA 's torture methods , which he argues are unproductive .
2007-08-02 04:00:00 PDT Sacramento -- -
The state 's monthlong budget stalemate intensified Wednesday when Senate Republicans refused to support a $ 145 billion plan that they said spent too much money .
The vote came after a day of furious negotiations between party leaders and Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger .
But in the end , the Senate 's 25 Democrats and one Republican stood in favor of the budget - still one vote shy of the two - thirds majority needed for passage .
The deadlock means the state remains unable to fund some social service programs , including those that compensate hospitals and clinics that provide health care to millions of poor Californians .
But the breakdown also led Senate President Pro Tem Don Perata , D - Oakland , to suspend further negotiations and to lift travel restrictions on senators so they could return to their home districts - a move that could signal talks might not resume for two weeks when the state Assembly returns from a summer recess .
A frustrated Perata said he has done all he can .
" I think this is a Republican problem that is going to have to be solved by Republicans , " Perata said .
He added that the state is being held captive by people who do not believe in compromise .
" So , I 'm done . "
Democrats and Schwarzenegger said the $ 145 billion budget approved by the Assembly 10 days ago is a fair compromise .
But Republican senators say that plan needs to be cut because it includes optimistic revenue projections and carryover from past borrowing .
" Republicans want a balanced budget , " said Sen .
Tom McClintock , R - Thousand Oaks ( Ventura County ) .
" We feel , we all feel , that the fiscal situation is dire and getting worse and needs to be addressed . "
Schwarzenegger said he was disappointed in the vote , but offered little direction to lawmakers .
" The budget approved by the Assembly is a responsible budget that fully funds education and public safety , puts aside the biggest reserve fund in memory and pays down our debt , " he said .
" I was prepared to eliminate the operating deficit as requested ; therefore , the Senate should have approved the budget .
My job now is to make sure this does not shut down state government . "
The one GOP senator who chose to side with Democrats and Schwarzenegger - Sen. Abel Maldonado , R - Santa Maria ( Santa Barbara County ) , said he would risk losing re-election to support the plan because it was time the deadlock was broken .
" I think a vote for this budget is a vote for a fiscally responsible plan and No. 2 , it does not raise taxes , " he said .
" If I lose my election because of this , that 's a price I 'm willing to pay . "
The state has been without a budget since the fiscal year began July 1 , and while most agencies have continued without interruption , several services are not getting funded , including some schools and universities , state vendors and legislative staffers and elected officials .
Beginning Wednesday , the state was unable to pay $ 227 million to hospitals , clinics and other social service programs that serve about 7 million poor and disabled residents in the state 's Medi-Cal program .
The skipped payment will hit an estimated 500 hospitals and 11,000 nursing homes , hospices and adult day care centers throughout California .
While some of the larger institutions have reserve funds that can carry them a few weeks , many smaller providers have to borrow money , and some are making plans to close if the impasse continues .
The state controller 's office reports it has withheld $ 1.1 billion in payments that should have been paid in July .
There was $ 326 million due to community colleges that could not be paid ; $ 170 million to school districts for special - education programs and $ 140 million to state vendors .
In addition , $ 300 million in child development money that supports day care programs could not be paid .
McClintock said that Republicans who are holding out on the budget are not unsympathetic to the plight of those being hurt by the budget stalemate .
" We care deeply about that , " he said .
" That 's precisely why we 've taken the position we have , because if we do not make the difficult decisions this year , next year will be all the more difficult . "
Washington Mutual Commercials : Funny or Racist ?
Mary Kelley , 206-377-6878 mary.kelley@wamu.net
Have you seen the new set of Washington Mutual ( Wamu ) Banking commercials launched on 3/13/2006 ?
The commercials portray a young black man ( the good banker ) and about 20 mature white men ( the old school bad bankers ) .
The white men are kept herded in a corral .
The black banker asks the white banker 's questions about incentives for customers and the white bankers scoff at his suggestions .
In one commercial an oversized guinea pig water feeder is lowered down to the white men .
In another commercial caviar is fed to the white men with a giant spoon .
The commercial is funny on different levels , but what is disturbing is the fact that the commercials single out white men as pets , animals , and slaves .
Also , the commercial seems to say that all bankers of importance in the past are white men .
Why did Wamu choose to divide strictly by race color ?
My message to Wamu :
Not a good PR move to promote yourself with racism .

There are two kinds of people in the world — those who believe in the power of the PDA and those who do n't — and the first group is shrinking faster than a cotton shirt in an industrial dryer .
If you 're the sort of person who wo n't part from a beloved Tungsten E until it is pried from your cold , dead fingers , now may be a good time to start stocking up on replacements .
According a variety of new reports , the PDA market is drying up .
In the year between the second quarter of 2006 and the second quarter of 2007 , for instance , PDAs saw an astonishing 43.5 percent decrease in worldwide shipments , and no more than a million devices were sold in the quarter .
This bit of bad news comes courtesy of IDC , which has released some new numbers on the PDA market .
They make for grim reading .
In addition to the year - over - year drop , sales of PDAs dropped off about 20 percent from the first quarter of the year .
Given these sorts of numbers , it can't be long before some manufacturers start to pull a Google Video and stop selling products .
In fact , that 's already happening .
Dell is spinning down its
Axim line of PDAs , though its 23,975 units shipped still placed it in fourth place worldwide for the quarter .
Fujitsu - Siemens , which is ranked fifth in the world with 21,482 units moved this last quarter , just announced that it too is exiting the PDA business .
But the moves are n't necessarily a sign that other companies can snap up market share ; the whole market appears to be dying .
As IDC 's Ramon Llamas noted when the new numbers were issued , " The market as a whole is still contracting , and other vendors , with fewer resources and less distribution , may be forced to withdraw from the market altogether .
With double - digit negative growth continuing to characterize the market , IDC expects the handheld device market to contract further before it reaches a stable point . "
Palm , the number one PDA vendor , is reaching for relevancy with its new Foleo ( see our first impressions ) .
But Palm faces a bleak future if PDA sales trends continue .
The PDA might not disappear completely , but it looks likely to live on as a niche product .
The decline has been evident for some time .
In 2005 , we noted that PDA sales had been dropping for years .
In 2006 , we pointed out that smartphones had eclipsed PDAs and that the PDA market appeared to be shrinking .
The new numbers from IDC indicate that , if anything , the shrinkage is expanding ( which sounds downright physically impossible , no ? ) .
All hail the the mighty " smartphone " and a strong laptop market .

Judith Miller defends New York police repression of antiwar “ terrorists ”
By Bill Van Auken
5 May 2007
Judith Miller , the former senior correspondent of the New York Times who played a key role as a conduit for the fabricated intelligence about Iraqi “ weapons of mass destruction ” used to drag the American public into the Iraq war , has found her way back into print — this time as a mouthpiece for selective and self - serving intelligence released by the New York City Police Department .
Miller left the Times with a hefty severance package a year and a half ago , posing as a martyr for the First Amendment and — as she wrote in her parting statement — a hapless victim of “ public fury over the intelligence failures that helped lead our country to war . ”
Her dubious claim to First Amendment credentials stems from her spending 85 days in jail for defying a court order to divulge a confidential source .
While the principle of press freedom from judicial coercion is no doubt important , in Miller ’s case the source she was protecting was the since - convicted chief of staff for Vice President Cheney , I. Lewis Libby .
By all appearances Libby was collaborating with the New York Times reporter in the scheme to punish Joseph Wilson — who blew the whistle on the Bush administration ’s false claims about Iraq seeking to buy uranium in Niger — by exposing his wife , Valerie Plame , as a CIA operative .
The episode was marked by the same ideologically based intimate ties that Miller established with her sources in the Bush administration , US and Israeli intelligence and the Iraqi exile groups .
This same kind of relationship with the top echelons of the NYPD is revealed in her piece published Thursday on the notoriously right - wing editorial page of the Wall Street Journal , which was provocatively titled , “ When Activists are Terrorists . ”
The article amounts to a defense brief for the NYPD brass as it faces multiple lawsuits in relation to the police - state crackdown unleashed against peaceful demonstrators during the 2004 Republican National Convention .
Nearly 2,000 people were rounded up during the convention , including people who were not even demonstrating but merely happened to be on city blocks where cops carried out mass arrests using plastic nets to corral everyone in the area .
Many of those arrested were taken to a makeshift detention facility set up in a filthy and contaminated depot on the Hudson River where they were held under inhuman conditions for days before being released .
The aim was to keep them off the streets for the duration of the convention based on charges that were — in all but handful of cases — subsequently dismissed .
In March , the New York Times obtained secret documents revealing that in advance of the August 2004 convention , the NYPD intelligence division had carried out a massive and international spying operation targeting a host of nonviolent protest groups , including church groups , opponents of capital punishment and street theater ensembles , based strictly on their opposition to the policies of the Bush administration and the war in Iraq in particular .
Political dossiers were established on an unknown number of individuals who were suspected of no crimes .
Last February , a federal judge recognized the blatantly illegal and unconstitutional character of the NYPD ’s spying and barred the department from investigating political activity unless there is some evidence of unlawful activity .
The judge also issued an order barring the New York City police from routinely videotaping people engaged in legal political protests .
The court decisions marked the first reversals for the NYPD in its bid to wrest back powers of political repression , spying and infiltration that existed during the period of the infamous Red Squad and that were somewhat curtailed by a 1985 court decision known as the Handschu agreement .
The city and its police department have insisted that in the wake of the September 11 , 2001 attacks , restrictions on illegal police spying must be rescinded .
As the RNC protests demonstrated , the expanded police powers claimed by the NYPD as a tool needed to combat terrorism have been utilized to suppress and intimidate political opponents of the government .
Miller writes , “ Stung by the criticism , Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly , David Cohen , the deputy police commissioner for intelligence , and Paul J. Browne , the NYPD press spokesman , outlined in interviews last week the nature of the police ’s concerns . ”
Playing the same role as state - sponsored stenographer that she filled while reporting on the manufactured Iraqi WMD threat , Miller dutifully sets out in her Wall Street Journal piece to argue the NYPD ’s case .
To facilitate the former Times reporter in her mission of rebutting the exposure of police spying by the New York Times , the department apparently gave her access to “ 600 - plus pages of still - secret intelligence documents . ”
This was the same material that had been leaked to the Times and formed a principal basis of the article written by Jim Dwyer last March .
What is significant about this special access granted to Miller is that city attorneys representing the NYPD have gone into federal court to insist that these same files be kept secret , citing concerns that the media would “ fixate upon them and sensationalize them . ”
They have also demanded that lawyers representing those arrested during the RNC swear under oath that they did not leak the classified documents to the Times .
As Sean Gardiner of the Village Voice reported this week , New York Civil Liberties Union Associate Legal Director Christopher Dunn cited Miller ’s article in a letter to Manhattan Federal District Court Judge James C. Francis asking him to dismiss the city ’s motion to keep secret the documents on police spying in advance of the RNC .
“ This reporting plainly suggests that the NYPD provided Ms. Miller with the very documents the City is insisting to this Court must be kept secret , ” Dunn wrote .
No doubt the distinction between Miller and the run-of - the - mill media is a clear one for the NYPD , whose intelligence deputy commissioner Cohen is a former director of operations at the CIA .
After all , while working at the Times , Miller was granted a classified security clearance by the Pentagon , the terms of which required her to withhold any secret information from both the newspaper ’s editors and its readers .
She had moreover proven she could be trusted with classified material , such as that fed her by the administration about “ aluminum tubes ” that supposedly exposed a nonexistent Iraqi nuclear weapons program , which became a key pretext for launching the US war .
Based on her reading of the secret documents — “ coupled with interviews of senior police officials ” — Miller concludes that they do “ not show that the police monitored such peaceful groups and individuals because they opposed their political views , ” but merely because they wanted to determine the “ motivations of people who were planning to attend the convention . ”
That spying on political groups , with no evidence of criminal activity , to determine their “ motivations ” violates constitutional rights to freedom of speech and assembly is not a problem for Miller .
This , she makes clear , is because such violations must be “ framed in the context of the threat New York was facing . ”
She notes that since 9/11 , the city had seen “ 11 separate terrorist plots ... beginning with the still - unsolved anthrax letter attacks of October , 2001 ... to the thwarting of a plot in July 2006 to destroy the PATH subway linking New Jersey to Lower Manhattan ... ”
How do these events justify surveillance and infiltration of nonviolent groups opposed to the Iraq war ?
Evidence surrounding the anthrax attacks , which indeed remain unsolved , point to a source connected to the US military ’s germ warfare program and right - wing elements .
As for the so - called PATH plot , it involved an individual arrested in Lebanon who had no weapons , explosives or money , had neither been to New York City nor apparently had any means of getting there .
He was charged on the basis of an Internet “ chat ” with people he had never even met .
Miller attempts to spice up her account with various facts culled from the intelligence files .
They reveal , she says , a scheme to “ switch subway signs to disorient [ Republican ] delegates , ” plans to “ harass delegates , ” and a call to “ disrupt Broadway performances attended by delegates ... designated as ‘ Chaos on Broadway . ’ ”
She says that NYPD spies also learned that “ The Syracuse Peace Council ... which planned to block traffic in New York , held weekend training aimed at ‘ building our own radical activist infrastructure . ’ ”
Presumably , this lumps the Syracuse pacifists together with the other “ terrorist activists ” who are the subject of Miller ’s article .
Then there are facts thrown in that read like random citations from the police blotter .
“ A man arrested on Aug. 20 for criminal trespass and possession of burglary tools in the Mandarin Oriental Hotel , had been arrested more than 25 times in California for various offenses . ”
Aside from the fact that the move to the East Coast apparently failed to improve the burglar ’s luck , how this justifies political spying is a mystery .
Miller also quotes Cohen , the ex-CIA official at the helm of the NYPD ’s intelligence operations , asserting that the arrest of more than 1,800 people — a virtually unprecedented number — actually showed restraint , given the size of the demonstration .
She regurgitated his dubious claim that it actually represented “ the lowest arrest - to - crowd ratio of any major political gathering . ”
Miller concludes her piece by declaring that “ it would be a pity ” if the court challenge to the NYPD ’s political spying served to “ dissuade other law enforcement agencies from adopting a similar approach . ”
She continues : “ For although I am devoted to the First Amendment and privacy rights ... I also want the NYPD to have the tools and programs to protect the city from terrorist attacks .
If that means scanning the Internet and sending plainclothes officers to public meetings to learn about planned actions that might turn violent , or be infiltrated and taken over by violent dissidents , so be it . ”
The NYPD ’s choice of Judith Miller to make its case in defense of political spying sends an unmistakable message .
The same methods of political deception and outright criminality used to launch the war of aggression against Iraq continue to be employed in the drive to destroy basic democratic rights within the US itself .
This seals the deal , as it seems pretty unlikely that the rest of the field would want to show up , or that the CBC would want to do a debate without the front - runners .
Well , Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama have decided not to participate in the Democratic debate that the Congressional Black Caucus institute and Fox News channel had planned for September in Detroit .
Their decision follows that of John Edwards from last week .
Mr. Edwards was the first to decline both this one and one that was canceled by Nevada Democrats after liberal activists and several of the most influential lib- blogs had mounted pressure against Fox for its conservative - leaning programming .
We mounted a great deal of pressure on the first debate , but the real pressure on this one came from the African - American community .
But there was very little direct pressure on the campaigns themselves , so this is particularly encouraging .
Thanks to Edwards for leading , and to Obama and Clinton for joining him .
Good show , all .
This is an updated version of an earlier article about the death of Pamela Kincaid .
She died earlier this month under suspicious circumstances .
Pam was the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit against the City of Fresno to stop them from taking and immediately destroying homeless peoples property .
Justice for Pamela KincaidBy Mike RhodesA friend of mine died under disturbing and suspicious circumstances last month .
I ’m determined to find out the truth and discover what led to her death .
Here is what I know : Pamela Kincaid was the lead named plaintiff in the lawsuit filed by the homeless against the City of Fresno , because the city was taking and immediately destroying their property .
This sometimes included their IDs , clothing , tools , kittens , and in one case the urn containing the ashes of a grandchild .
Pam stood up against this injustice and was willing to put herself on the line to protect the rights of all homeless people in this community .
A federal court issued a preliminary injunction to stop the city from conducting these raids on the homeless and on July 30 ruled to certify the suit as a class action lawsuit .
That means that all homeless people affected by the city ’s policy will be compensated if the lawsuit prevails in court .
On the day the class action lawsuit was certified in Federal Court , the attorneys visited Pam in UMC , the long - term care facility she was in .
A day and a half later at 1:30 AM on Wednesday , August 1 , Pam fell from the fourth floor , under suspicious circumstances .
Pam was in this facility because she had been beaten , nearly to death , in mid July .
Pam had been telling me for months that she felt she was being targeted by the police and others because of the lawsuit .
She was very upset about being arrested and put in jail for several days without charges ever being filed .
Pam described what happened : “ You know why they arrested me , do n’t you ?
It was retaliation for the lawsuit . ”
The arrest occurred when Pam was driving around with friends in downtown Fresno .
“ All of a sudden there was this swarm of cop cars , ” Pam said .
“ They got us all out of the car but they seemed mostly interested in me .
One of the guys I was with had an open can of beer , which they just totally ignored .
They arrested me on a probation hold .
I ’m not on probation and they knew that !
” Pam spent the next several days in jail .
No charges were ever filed .
As she was being released , Pam asked one of the sheriff deputies why she had been in jail .
Pam told me the officer rolled her eyes and said , “ There ought to be an investigation . ”
Pam thought she knew exactly why she was arrested and put in jail : she believed it was because she was the high visibility plaintiff in a very controversial lawsuit that put the City of Fresno and the Fresno Police Department ( FPD ) in a bad light .
Al Williams , another named plaintiff in the lawsuit against the city , was also arrested and released with no charges ever being filed .
The day after Al was put in jail , the encampment he lived in was raided and his disabled wife was forced to move .
Later , Sherri ( Al ’s wife ) was arrested for trying to use the restroom at McDonald ’s restaurant ( see page one story in the August 2007 Community Alliance ) .
Life on the streets is hard on homeless people .
If you are a woman and homeless , you can double or triple the difficulty factor .
There are very few beds for homeless women in Fresno and Pam had given up trying to find a safe place where she could stay at a shelter .
She was streetwise , but living in a tent in downtown Fresno can still be dangerous .
She told me that there were people on the street that were upset with her because of the lawsuit .
Specifically , she said the drug dealers , who are a small part of the downtown homeless community , were angry with her .
They were angry because the lawsuit had increased law enforcement ’s presence around some homeless encampments and the drug dealers blamed her .
On one occasion , Pam and I talked about the drug situation downtown .
She said it was just unexplainable how the police will come in and arrest one person who is dealing drugs and leave everyone else alone .
She said , “ All they would have to do is to come in here with a drug sniffing dog and it would be all over . ”
She believed there had to be some kind of payoff going on so the police protected some dealers and arrested others .
A couple of months ago Rev. Floyd Harris was at the corner of G and Santa Clara streets talking to homeless people .
He was surprised at how openly drugs were being bought and sold .
He too questioned the motivation of the police to selectively enforce drug laws .
The drug wars , as they play out in downtown Fresno , are making some people rich , other people vulnerable , and some people end up dead .
Pam Kincaid usually lived in very remote locations in the old industrial section of downtown Fresno ( south of Ventura ) .
She often lived with other people because that provides a homeless woman with some protection .
Pam , like many homeless women , also had a dog .
It is notable how often Pam , and the encampments she lived in , were forced to move .
Even after the preliminary injunction and victory in court , homeless people are endlessly harassed and told to “ move on . ”
The City of Fresno conducted one of their raids on homeless encampments on Santa Fe ( just south of Ventura ) in early July .
Pam was living there at the time .
This was the fourth or fifth time she had been forced to move in the last six months .
Pam ended up in an encampment on Mono , just east of R Street .
On or about July 13 , 2007 , Pam and a friend ( we will call him Mario -- not his real name ) started walking toward a store on Ventura .
According to Mario , they saw a FPD patrol car cruise by , turn around and pull up beside them .
This is not unusual if you are living on the street .
The police are always stopping homeless people and asking them for their ID , running their names through the database , and seeing what comes up .
It is like fishing .
Every so often the police catch someone who is in violation of parole , has an outstanding warrant , or for some other reason is being looked for by law enforcement .
Cynthia Greene , who is homeless and another named plaintiff in the lawsuit against the City of Fresno , told me she was stopped four times on one day in mid July .
Cynthia said , “ I was out trying to collect cans for recycling and the police came up and asked me for my ID .
I would get done with one stop and a few minutes later I ’d get stopped again .
This is unusual even for Fresno . ”
Cynthia said she felt uncomfortable with all of the stops and was concerned that she was being targeted .
According to Mario , the police officer checked Pam and his ID and let them go .
As they were leaving , a group of about six or seven people ( at least one them has been identified to me as a drug dealer ) walked by and went to the police car .
Mario said that he looked back and saw the officer pointing at him and Pam while he talked to the group .
Pam decided to stay at her encampment and Mario continued on to the store .
Feeling something might be wrong , Mario returned ( without going to the store ) to see four of five women from the group savagely beating Pam .
Mario said , “ Pam is on the ground and one of them has these boot heels , you know like these dress boots , you know what I ’m talking about ?
With the big heels ?
And they are just .
. . . "
( Mario jumps up and down as if stomping something on the ground . )
According to Mario , they were saying , “ Drop the suit , drop the suit , you ’re hurting us , you ’re hurting them , now we ’re hurting you . ” Mario says that after he stopped the assault on Pam he tried to flag down a police patrol car .
The first police vehicle that went by on R Street did not stop .
Within 15 minutes another patrol car came by .
This time the officer stopped and Mario explained what had happened .
The officer left , saying he was going to find the perpetrators of the crime , but he never came back to follow up on the victim or write a report of the assault .
I talked to Jeff Cardinale , the Fresno Police Department Public Information Officer , about police involvement in this incident .
Cardinale insisted that there is no record of any contact with Pam or Mario on R or Mono street .
Pam was admitted to Community Medical Center on July 13 .
The nurse who attended to Pam said she was black and blue from the waist up .
“ It was clear that Pam had been beaten , ” the nurse told me .
The police report issued at the time she was admitted to CMC was more vague .
The police report suggests that Pam had a bad sunburn , might have a mental illness , and did not want to press charges .
A man with extensive contacts in the homeless community confirmed , at least in part , Mario ’s version of what happened to Pam .
He said three young women were bragging about how they had beaten Pam up .
Fearing retaliation himself , he did not want to identify those involved .
I did n’t find out that Pam was in the hospital until about a week after she was admitted .
She was still black and blue and it did not look like she had a sunburn to me .
She was clearly disoriented .
Her attending physician , Dr. Ossia , told me that Pam did not know what city she was in or what year it was .
He explained that she had sub dermal hematoma , which causes swelling inside the skull , and the pressure can cause the disorientation and delusions she was experiencing .
He was cautiously optimistic that she would regain her memory .
After Pam was at CMC for over a week it was agreed that she needed to move to more long - term care .
But without insurance or any resources the options were very limited .
UMC was one of the only long - term care facilities that would take Pam .
On the day before she transferred to UMC , I talked to her nurse again .
She told me that Pam was starting to remember what had happened and said that the attack had to do with the lawsuit against the City of Fresno .
She was put on the fourth floor of the long - term care facility at UMC .
At about 1:30 AM on Wednesday , August 1 , she went through the doors to a balcony and fell four floors to her death .
The doors were supposed to have an alarm that would alert staff if they were opened and the staff knew that Pam was disoriented due to the attack .
Something , we do n’t yet know what , went horribly wrong .
Several of Pam ’s friends saw her just before she died .
Those that I talked to said she was doing better , she was not suicidal , and her nurse said her memory was starting to clear up .
We are left with a lot of unanswered questions like : *
If what Mario is saying is true , what did the police officer say to the group that attacked Pam ? *
Why did the police officer who Mario stopped not return to help Pam or write an incident report ?
Why does the police have no record of this contact ?*
Why did the police who talked to Pam at CMC not conclude that a crime had been committed and try to find out who attacked her ? *
What went wrong at UMC ?
How could a patient who is known to be disoriented walk onto a balcony , and fall from the fourth floor ?*
Why was a repairman working on the alarm system leading to the fourth floor balcony the morning after Pam fell ?*
Why does Fresno not have more shelters for homeless women ?
Jeff Cardinale , with the FPD , told me they are not investigating either the beating incident or the suspicious circumstances of Pam ’s death .
He suggested I talk with the sheriff ’s department .
After being initially told by the sheriff ’s department that they did not have an active investigation either , I called back again .
This time I was told that they are investigating Pam ’s death .
I called the detective investigating the case but have not heard back from him yet .
Fresno mayor Alan Autry often talks about this town as being “ A Tale of Two Cities . ”
I ca n’t help but wondering if the mayor had shown up at Community Medical Center , beaten nearly to death , would they have concluded that he was sunburned , delusional , and that no investigation was necessary ?
Maybe this is a tale of two cities - one where there is justice and fairness if you are well to do , but if you are poor ( especially if you are a homeless woman ) you ca n’t even get the police to open an investigation after you have been beaten .
At least the Coroner ’s office and the sheriff ’s department are looking into the suspicious nature of her death .
I demand justice for Pamela Kincaid .
I want the Fresno Police Department to open an investigation and find out who savagely beat Pam leaving her disoriented and brain damaged .
I applaud the Coroner who ordered an autopsy ( we are still waiting for the results ) and encourage the sheriff ’s department to conduct a vigorous investigation into the suspicious circumstances of her death .
Pam was a hero .
She stood up for her rights and the rights of all homeless people .
As the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit against the City of Fresno , she sometimes became a lightening rod and vilified by those who would continue the system of bigotry and hatred against the homeless .
Pam took pride in being a recognizable leader of an effort that will result in better conditions for Fresno ’s homeless .
Being a part of the lawsuit was something Pam did , not for herself , but for all homeless people .
It was , in part , that spirit of selflessness that made Pam such a wonderful person and a friend I will miss .

I ’ve bought all kinds of stuff from Amazon.com : books , DVDs , electronics , kitchen gadgets , and so on .
It ’s great for those quick , easy purchases , but what if you ’ve got money to burn ?
You ’ll be delighted to know that you can put your American Express Centurion Card to good use with any number of extravagant purchases from everyone ’s favorite online store .
Even ignoring obvious typos , of which I found quite a few , there are an awful lot of things that are so expensive that I can’t imagine buying them online , no matter how wealthy I were .
I found hundreds of items costing $ 20,000 or more ; here is a small sampling .
( By the way , each year Amazon.com posts a list of the most expensive items people actually purchased .
In 2006 , the most expensive item they sold was a $ 24,795.00 Cartier watch .
Cheapskates . )
Honorable Mention
I ’d also like to give a special nod to the Ace Hardware Outlet , whose Amazon.com store lists so many commonplace items with astronomical prices that I can only assume their computer system likes to put the decimal point in the wrong place .
Since these are obviously not real prices , I did n’t want to include them in the main list .
However , if you hurry , you might be able to buy , among other things :
PARIS ( Reuters ) - A senior French politician , now a minister in President Nicolas Sarkozy ’s government , suggested last year that U.S. President George W. Bush might have been behind the September 11 , 2001 attacks , according to a website .
France 's Housing Minister Christine Boutin leaves the Elysee Palace after the weekly cabinet meeting in Paris , May 30 , 2007 .
Boutin suggested last year that President George W. Bush might have been behind the September 11 , 2001 attacks , according to a website .
REUTERS / Philippe Wojazer
The www.ReOpen911.info website , which promotes September 11 conspiracy theories , has posted a video clip of French Housing Minister Christine Boutin appearing to question that Osama bin Laden ’s al Qaeda group orchestrated the attacks .
Boutin ’s office sought to play down the remarks .
Asked in an interview last November , before she became minister , whether she thought Bush might be behind the attacks , Boutin says : “ I think it is possible .
I think it is possible . ”
Boutin backs her assertion by pointing to the large number of people who visit websites that challenge the official line over the September 11 strikes against U.S. cities .
“ I know that the websites that speak of this problem are websites that have the highest number of visits ...
And I tell myself that this expression of the masses and of the people cannot be without any truth . ”
Boutin ’s office sought to play down the remarks , saying that later in the same interview she says : “ I ’m not telling you that I adhere to that position . ”
This comment does not appear on the video clip on ReOpen911 .
Numerous other websites have also posted the clip in recent days and the story has started to seep into the mainstream media .
“ Christine Boutin snared by her controversial suggestions about September 11 , ” Le Monde newspaper said in a headline .
Liberation newspaper on Saturday quoted Boutin ’s spokesman Christian Dupont as saying that she had not wanted to appear pro or anti-Bush at a time when Sarkozy was being branded a “ U.S. poodle ” after meeting the president in Washington .
“ And then she is not the foreign minister , ” Dupont added .
France appears to be particularly fertile ground for conspiracy theories .
In 2002 , a book that claimed that no airliner hit the U.S. Pentagon in the September 11 attacks topped the French bestseller lists .
However , the French are not alone in their skepticism .
According to a Scripps Howard / Ohio University poll carried out last July , more than one - third of Americans suspect U.S. officials helped in the September 11 attacks or took no action to stop them so the United States could later go to war .
The U.S. State Department has rejected these accusations .
Almost 3,000 people died when hijackers crashed planes into New York , Washington and Pennsylvania .

And I think he sat there just twiddling his hand without anything to say because he was worried that we had crossed over into homeland security … you know , a crime reported on television !
RU : He definitely looked confounded .
And you say you were goofing on him in the green room as well ?
SW : Oh my gosh !
I was sort of trying to let him know my personality .
So you know how at the Presidential Press Corps Dinner , Stephen Colbert was the host and he came on and said , " Oh my god , I got to sit right next to the man !
President Bush ! "
So I walked up to him and I said , " Oh my god !
I get to meet and touch the man himself !
How nice to meet you , Mr. Stewart . "
And then I pulled out some two dollar bills that I always carry around ...
I have pads of sheets of these bills .
They 're perforated like green stamps .
You can tear 'em off in ones , or twos , or threes or fours .
And he grabbed it out of my hand and ran out to the hallway where there was more light .
He held it up to the light .
He was so concerned !
I 'm thinking , " Why is he so concerned about something that I just use as a prank here and there ? "
And he 's looking at it for the longest time , feeling the paper and analyzing the different pages .
So he tells me that his brother works for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing , where they print the money on 14th street in Washington , D.C. , which is where I buy these .
Woz Punks the Secret Service
RU : Now this is legitimate money that people assume is ...
SW : It meets the specs of the U.S. government , so by law , it is legal tender .
The Secret Service has approved it three times .
Why would they approve it if it 's not legal ?
I do n't even know if it has the right President 's face on it .
And the serial numbers — there 's something very suspicious about them .
The bills — you can smell the ink is still fresh so do n't get it on your finger .
And I 'll sell a sheet of four of them — that 's $ 8 — for $ 5 .
But not very many people buy them from me .
I start saying , " Since they cost me three , you 're really buying $ 12 worth for $ 5 .
( ed : we do n't understand it either . )
Only an idiot would turn that down . "
And that 's about the time they start thinking , maybe I wo n't buy them .
And they wo n't buy 'em .
I give myself a point if they do n't buy 'em , because they are legal tender .
The Secret Service read me my Miranda rights once .
And when they asked for an ID , I pulled out this ID that I 'd used for every airplane flight for five years of my life .
It says " Laser Safety Officer , Secretary of Defiance " ( instead of Secretary of Defense ) on the card , and in the photo I 'm wearing an eye patch .
( laughter )
And the Secret Service did n't catch that it was a phony card !
They figured out that the bills were good and legal tender , too .
Gina ( Smith ) did n't put this one in the book !
A lot of my good prank stories did n't get in the book .
That 's the third book that I have planned .
RU : Good lord .
The things you can get away with when you 're Steve Wozniak .
SW : You know , I think any actor and comedian that can just act like they 're in the right can do it — that 's mainly what it takes .
RU : Bluffing is the main thing .
Bluffing is social engineering , basically .
SW : Yeah .
The attitude is , " What I 'm doing is right , " you know ?
And then it 's real easy .
People get real nervous and try to hide stuff when they think what they 're doing is wrong .
RU : Gina said some people buy the two dollar bills and do n't think that they can use them .
SW : Sometimes they buy them and think they should cash them in a real dark place , so they do n't get caught .
RU : Why do you think you wound up being such a prankster ?
SW : It 's because I was so shy in middle school and high school .
I had to kind of have a way to have a presence .
Everyone 's born with an energy to socialize — to mix with other people .
And when you 're shy and can't talk to them ; and they start to talk weird language that you do n't want to be part of ; and they 're snooty about the people who are " in " and " out " ; and you are n't part of that " in " group — it 's very intimidating .
So one of the ways I communicate is with pranks .
RU : So , if you 're at a party , do you do a prank to get attention ?
Or ...
SW : Oh no no ...
RU : Or just to get ( laughs ) vengeance on the snobby people ?
SW : No , its not that .
But in my school days , I was n't in the group that would ever get invited to a party .
But I was kind of friendly with a lot of druggies back in the late 60s at our school .
And they were " out " - ies and techies and all that .
But I did n't go to their parties either .
The way I thought about it — I looked at church , and I said , " You know what ?
Everybody goes to church and they 're saying those same words together , and they 're singing the same songs together .
And they 're just following the exact same ligature .
Everybody 's doing the same thing .
I do n't want to be a follower like that .
I 've got a brain !
I 'm going to think out what is right and what 's wrong , to do in the world .
I do n't need to be like everybody else and just follow their lines .
Well , I extended that to parties and to that druggy peer group .
We always talked about , " Do n't conform ! "
Do n't conform to the values of your parents .
RU : Right .
But on the other hand , everybody must get stoned .
SW : All the peers in our high school – everybody was going to the parties and doing the same things .
And they were drinking because other people were .
That 's conforming .
So I thought , if I 'm going to drink , I 'm going to drink all alone because I think it 's something I want to do .
And it kept me kind of clean , because I would n't just go out and do something because my group 's doing it .
RU : So there 's an iconoclasm there .
SW : Yeah !
RU : Back to pranks …
SW : I have these professionally printed stickers that I 've had made .
They 're done with this sort of foil - type stuff in the exact OSHA style and the OSHA colors .
And it says , " Danger : Do Not Flush Over Cities . "
And I put 'em in the bathrooms on airplanes ...
RU : ( Laughs ) I think I 've seen that , actually .
Do you fly Jet Blue ?
SW : Yes , I have done it on Jet Blue .
RU : I remember thinking about it and wondering what that was !
SW : They 're red with a black - shadowed airplane picture .
The bathroom has a little seat fold - down .
I fold that up and there 's a sign in the middle of it saying , " Do n't throw trash here . "
And I put my two little stickers behind it , so the stewardesses wo n't notice it right away .
If they notice it right away they might realize that somebody put that there .
But after a while , if they slowly get used to it , they 'll stay on for years .
I have another sticker that I made in OSHA style and colors .
It 's a yellow one .
I put it in the backstage bathroom at the " Colbert Show . "
It has a little graphic of a butt with a poof coming out and it says , " Keep our air fresh . "
RU : In Robert Anton Wilson 's book , The Illuminatus !
Trilogy , there 's this character , Markoff Cheney , who leaves weird bureaucratic commands in offices and places like that just to sort of boggle people 's minds .
SW : That 's almost like what I read about in the The Pentagon Papers — the psychological warfare .
You kind of put out a message saying one thing , but it implies that something horrible is going to happen just because you 're saying that it is n't going to happen .
It triggers bad thought in people 's mind .
RU : Cognitive dissonance ...
SW : Yeah !
RU : ... is a great weapon of war , and also of ...
SW : … comedy !
RU : … guerilla pranksterism , and all those things .
I guess you 're indicating that pranks challenge conventional behavior .
SW : Absolutely .
I 've always very much wanted to be a rebel , and against authority .
Because if we just sort of accept authority , and never question it — we just go through a life without knowing what truth really is — thinking we know it all .
Everybody reads the same headlines and sees the same seven - second soundbites on TV .
And because they all know the same thing as everyone else , they 're all in the right .
" We are all intelligent . "
They 're not intelligent .
They just saw the same things and repeated it .
You know ?
They 're the ones who are n't intelligent .
I mean , the definition of intelligence in schools is pretty much being able to know what every other kid in the school that has studied the book would say ... and not to have original thought of your own .
When Woz Convinced the Waitress He was " a Pavarotti "
RU : Speaking of getting an education and then getting a shitty job , Gina told me a story about a prank on a waitress .
SW : Yeah ...
I did a prank on a waitress recently .
And I put a lot more energy , time , and even money into my pranks than most people .
I do n't want all my pranks to be just the normal duds you play every day .
You know , every comedian will have one gem of a joke for every ten duds .
So I play little dinky pranks all day long .
But in this case , it was based on the fact that I have season tickets to Warriors ' games and I had special passes for a special parking lot .
So one time , I took a friend in the back seat of my car who did n't know I had the pass .
And as I got to the window , I tell the guy there that we have the guy with us who 's going to sing the national anthem .
And then to embarrass him ( the guy in the back seat ) , I 'd say , " Sing a line for him ! " and the guy can't sing but they let us in anyway , and ...
So I had done this sort of prank a few times .
And then I was at a restaurant in San Francisco , and I knew that I had four tickets for Saturday 's game but I would n't be there .
So I asked the waitress , " Hey , you going to the game on Saturday ?
I 'm singing the national anthem ! "
And she looked at me like I was the most important person she 'd ever waited on .
I did n't expect that , but now I had to play with it .
When someone 's mind is thinking something weird , or in a… I call that a creative state .
You do n't want to inhibit creativity .
You want to keep it going .
So you always say yes .
So I said , " Oh !
I could probably get you some tickets from the Warriors staff — you know , if you want ... "
And then I said , " You want to hear me sing ? "
And she says , " Yes ! "
And I go ( half - speaking ) " Oh say can you see . "
And that 's the best I can sing .
Everyone at the table started laughing .
So I figured the jig was up .
But then I heard from Gina later on that this waitress had come over to Gina , and asked privately , " Does he really sing the national anthem ? "
And Gina said , " Oh , he 's a famous opera singer !
He 's got the voice of an angel ! " ( laughter )
So now I had to follow through .
I had to take this one further .
So I came back to the restaurant one day and left two tickets for the waitress .
And I set up a story that my friend Jim would have my other two tickets .
And he was supposed to tell her I got food poisoning at the restaurant .
I was a Pavarotti , and in the hospital they had mixed me up with somebody else and taken my kidney out .
They 'd discovered the mistake , switched operating teams and gloves and they 'd put my kidney back in .
( I always love to throw in the glove line .
Like they 'd really switch gloves . )
And I 'm the first person to ever get a kidney transplant [ from myself ] .
Great story .
The Zaltair Prank : Two Pranks in one
RU : You make really elaborate schemes and stories .
Talk about some of the pranks that were left out of your book .
Maybe go back to the early hacker days , or Apple times ?
SW : Early hacker days ?
There 's the prank that I did when we introduced the Apple II .
At this time , all these people were using Z words based on the new Z80 Microprocessor from Zylog .
So I had these fake brochures for " the Zaltair " made .
It was this two - sided brochure that had all the fakest hype I could think of using , like – " Imagine a car with five wheels ! "
You know , stupid little things that were inspired by the worst ads I 'd ever read .
It had comparison charts to things like the Apple and it looked so phony — but it was against the Apple and this and that .
It said you could send your own computer in and get a $ 120 discount .
It was really jamming MITS Corporation , but that 's another story .
I took thousands of 'em in a box and put it out in front of The Civic Auditorium ( in San Francisco ) .
After a while , my friend called me .
He said , " Somebody took the box .
It was gone ! "
But MITS — the company that I was making fun of — was n't there .
So who did it ?
It turns out , they had a rep there .
So we went to the hotel and brought another box and set it down .
After a while a guy goes up , he spots it and takes the box away .
So then , we took tons of them underneath our coats and went around and started shuffling them into packets .
Our green ones would go into packets of green handout fliers , and our blue ones would go into packets of blue fliers .
We were careful about it but we got thousands of 'em distributed .
I mean , all the members of the Homebrew Computer Club were waving copies in the air .
And I 'd put a stupid made up quote from Ed Roberts — the President of MITS — at the top .
And if you took the first letter in each word in the quote , it spelled P.R.O.C.E.S.S.O.R T.E.C.H.N.O.L.O.G.Y .
You always get two pranks for one if you frame someone else .
And sure enough , Gordon French , who was one of the Homebrew club members , came by Apple in the early days , and I asked him , " Did you hear about that Zaltair prank ? "
And he said , " Oh yeah , it was a hoax .
I know who did it !
Gerry Egram of Processor Technology !... because he 's got a weird sense of humor . "
I 'm laughing my head off at this point .
And I pull one out and said , " There was supposed to be a cipher in here . "
And they started reading the cipher , and everybody read the letters " Processor Technology . "
Steve Jobs did the final ' Y ' .
For 12 years , everybody " knew " that this guy at Processor Technology had done the prank .
RU : When did you 'fess up ?
SW : Twelve years later .
I actually framed a copy and gave it to Steve Jobs as a birthday present .
He opened it up in a restaurant and he just started laughing out loud .
And that 's unusual .
Ethical Pranking
RU : Your most famous prank , which is in the book , was when you called the Pope at 5 am pretending to be Henry Kissinger .
What was going through your mind as you were doing that ?
SW : I used one of the blue boxes ... the blue boxes were an exciting time in my life — around 1971 .
RU : Was John Draper with you when you did the call ?
SW : No , he was n't .
I read articles about him .
He had stimulated my interest .
I had quickly tried to whack together a blue box but it did n't work .
I finally designed a great little digital box .
It worked every single time .
And Steve Jobs said , " Let 's sell 'em . "
So we built some and sold them .
We gave door - to - door demonstrations in the dorms .
Can you imagine doing that and not getting caught ?
RU : Right .
That was the perfect time for phone phreaking .
Everyone was interested .
SW : By the end of that year , I was worried that they had methods to catch 'em , so I never did 'em after that year .
And during that year , I was careful that I did n't use the blue box for personal calls .
I paid for them .
It was partly out of fear , but also I wanted to be honest , as I thought Draper and others were .
We only want to explore the system , and fix it , and find its little flaws , and tell other people .
That 's a great thing to a technical person — to know a few little flaws .
It 's like finding a few little Easter eggs in a program — little secret surprises .
Since I was very shy , it gave me one area of life that I was n't shy about .
I was the demonstrator .
I was the emcee .
I would demonstrate the blue box for an hour or two .
We sold one every time we did a demonstration !
RU : I 'm sure lots of other people just used them to get free phone calls .
SW : Yeah , and ethically , when I look back ...
RU : I think that was part of the spirit of the early ' 70s .
SW : Yeah , but when I look back I have a problem with that .
RU : Well , phone phreaking was associated with The Yippies and a kind of anti-corporate radicalism .
You did n't quite get into that ...
SW : I was n't in there .
Sure , I admired all those thinkers …
RU : Right .
I mean , Abbie Hoffman had that kind of stuff in Steal This Book .
SW : He had a black box schematic in Steal This Book .
I bought Steal This Book .
I had his black box schematic !
Same year !
But Ramparts magazine — which was like the Mother Jones of its day — came out with a nice clear , easier - to - follow one that year as well and they kind of got put out of business for a while .
I made copies of that and spread 'em around to everyone .
So I was helping everyone else do this even when I was n't selling it .
And that was probably wrong .
I just sort of wanted to show off that I knew things that most people did n't know .
That was my real motivation .
JAMAIS CASCIO :
So what do you think are the rules for being an ethical prankster ?
SW : Ethical prankster ?
It 's tough .
I do n't think there 's 100 % ethical .
In theory , you have agreements with society not to do things that are going to be disruptive — to not do things that are gonna be different .
And yet , practically , all of us have to do things that are a little bit different .
And there 's always some weird little laws that are written to catch you just for being different .
Ethical hacking today is largely finding flaws in major computer systems , or possibly the phone systems .
And to be ethical , you do n't use it to harm anyone .
And generally , that means you do n't want to keep it secret forever .
You want to boast that you 're the one who found it .
There 's a young kid , I forget his name right now – and he would find these flaws and then tell the companies : " Here 's the flaw .
You have two weeks to fix it , and then I 'll make it public . "
And he wound up in jail .
I met him , and he was just so pure that he was going to keep searching no matter what they did to him .
He was going to keep on this track of finding the flaws and notifying the people what the flaws were and giving them a certain time to fix it before he made it public .
RU : You did n't mind tweaking the Pope !
How far might that have gone ?
SW : Yeah .
I said we were at the summit in Moscow .
Someone said , " Here 's the Bishop , who 's going to be the translator . "
And I said , " Yes , I 'm calling from a United States number .
But you can call me back . "
He said , " I just spoke to Henry Kissinger . "
I said , " I am Henry Kissinger .
You can phone me back now . "
And I gave them a United States number to call .
And I figured they would think , " Oh , we 've got his number ! " I figured they knew it was a hacker .
But I had given them a loop number , so they dial one number and I dial another and we get connected .
There are really no records .
RU : Right .
A great phone phreak trick .
SW : Calling the Pope was just a weird idea that was kind of fun .
RU : Did you have a plan , if you actually wound up talking to the pope ?
Did you have a narrative for the exchange ?
SW : No . I should 've !
RU : Did you grow up watching " Candid Camera " ?
SW : Yeah !
I did .
Guess what ?
My son was pranked on by " Candid Camera . "
He got into an elevator in a hotel and headed down to his car early in the morning .
And when the elevator door opens to let him out , instead of finding himself in the garage with cars , he 's in a room .
And he looks back and the elevator had no button .
He played with it for a while , and somebody popped out and said , " You 're on Candid Camera . "
But they did n't put him in the show .
He probably was n't animated enough for them .
RU : He was probably not too easy to surprise , after growing up with you .
I hope you go ahead and write this book about pranks .
SW : I have forty years of pranks .
That 's going to be the third book .
I 'm thinking that for my second book , I 'm going to publish my " manuscript . "
You 've heard about Einstein 's manuscript — it sounds really impressive .
Well , I 'm the only one who ever wrote this much code — I made the Apple II by hand .
I could n't afford what 's called a rental system , where you can type it into a computer , and you type in your program , and it will give you back the 1's and 0's .
So I figured out the 1's and 0's in my own head , and wrote them down on the piece of paper .
Everything for the Apple II was done by hand .
Apple II was Coded by Hand
RU : So you 'd publish the code in book format ?
SW : I plan to publish the code and the schematics with some explanations of what I was thinking .
It would be one of those things that you do n't sell very many of .
JC : With a visual machine language editor , you could basically drag and drop 1's and 0's into a window .
SW : ( Thinks ) Visual machine ... oh !
Now , that 's a good idea .
That 's a clever idea .
Yeah !
That would be the modern version of what I did .
The best things I did were because I did n't have money .
I could n't afford the computer system to type my programs into .
They were written in machine language — real geeky computer stuff for the microprocessor I used , and I could n't afford it .
But because of that , I got very intimate with the programs that I wrote by hand .
Every step of the way , it was easy for me to be a very careful and thorough checker .
And I would dream the programs !
I would wake up with ideas about how to save one little step by doing something different , or I 'd think of something I could get for free .
Always believe in that — getting things for free .
The next house I 'm going to build is going to be built with that in mind .
Building an Energy Efficient House
I was out judging a History Channel invention contest .
And David Pogue , who is the technology writer for the New York Times , and the guy who owns the National Inventors Hall of Fame , were also judges .
And we all decided we wanted to build this project that was the winner .
The designer is a Civics Engineering Professor at Brigham Young — a very credible guy .
And basically , he uses Southern Yellow Pine , the most energy - efficient wood that there is .
It has a resin inside .
And the resins — wood with resins – melts and freezes at 71 degrees .
So if there 's any impetus in the house for the temperature to get hotter than 71 degrees , it melts a little of the resin , which actually absorbs the heat and cools the house .
It serves as your air conditioner .
At nighttime , if it starts to freeze , it emits heat , and warms the house up to 71 degrees .
And the houses can be built with another structure .
They actually take dirt out of the ground ... where they 're going to build the house .
They take the dirt out , they put it in machines , compress it into these tight bricks and then they heat it for about a week .
Then they leave it out in the sun for about a week and they have these grooved parts that they slide together .
And it 's the cheapest , lowest energy , most green way to build a house that 's going to last 500 years .
RU : Jamais , that sounds like something you might have heard about at WorldChanging .
JC : Yeah .
BASF makes a thermal wax wallboard that does exactly what you described .
They found that they could make houses in Germany 90 % energy efficient .
On DRM , Open Source , & the iPhone
RU : Before I let you go , I should ask a few contemporary geek questions — to satisfy those in the audience who are going to say , " You had Steve Wozniak on , and all you talked about was pranks ! "
That was pretty much my intention , but I should ask a few .
What do you think about Steve Jobs ' decision to embrace DRM - free music in iTunes ?
SW : I think it 's a step towards the future .
I mean , it does n't make much sense if these things are going to have DRM forever .
There 's this whole problem that you can't trust everyone , but you can do a good enough job .
Look at newspapers .
Nothing stops me from buying a newspaper and passing it around to 20 other people .
But , you know , you just kind of get used to what 's easy to do .
Only six of my purchased music songs so far , though , are from ( DRM - free ) EMI .
RU : The whole idea of Open Source has been a long running dialogue in computer culture .
Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation see it as a crusade .
Is it necessary ?
Or can you have Open Source and proprietary stuff going on at the same time ?
SW : A lot of people think that Open Source means " free . "
It was never intended to mean free and it should n't mean free .
People should be able to develop software and market it and have control over what they build .
But when you sell a product that has a lot of software in it , being Open Source means you publish your source .
And if somebody else wants to take your product and make a specialized version of it that does their few special things for their application ; or does something a little different ; or leaves pieces of it out ; they can do that and they do n't owe you a license fee .
It just means they were able to improve either your mistakes , or the things that you left out that they want .
RU : Sure .
But do you consider that a moral necessity , or ...
SW : I consider it a moral right - ness .
I do n't know how to speak for everybody in society about necessities .
But I think it 's very honorable and it's very good for the customers .
RU : Speaking of Open Source issues , have you ever hung out with Bill Gates ?
SW : I have n't .
I 've only spoken with him briefly a couple of times .
I admire him , he admires me .
Good lord , I 'd never written a computer language when he had written a BASIC in the early days of hobby computers .
And I thought , " Oh my gosh — a computer with BASIC finally makes a computer that people can use for things . "
And so I said , I 've got to write a BASIC .
My goal was to be the first in the world to have a BASIC for the 6502 .
And I did it , but it was horrible because , in doing it , I left out one thing that could save a month — floating point ...
RU : That 's in your book , actually .
SW : And before we wrote our floating point BASIC , Bill Gates popped in the door and he 'd done Microsoft .
And my attitude was , " Oh , good , it 'll save us the time . "
Of course , when our five - year license on it ran out , the Apple II was pouring gadzooks of money into his company .
So they had us under the barrel .
I like being the first at things .
I had written my first syntax chart with floating point .
In the Apple II ROMs , I even stuck in my own floating point routine .
It was n't incorporated into the BASIC , but I just did n't want the world thinking I could n't write floating point routines .
JC : Jobs actually related that story when he appeared onstage with Bill Gates .
SW : And Jobs got it pretty right .
He said it was because I hand - wrote everything .
And handwriting it , I could n't just type an extra part into a program .
I had to move addresses around .
All my addresses were fixed by hand .
And I could n't expand my syntax table easily to add the floating point back in before we shipped the Apple II .
Otherwise I would 've .
RU : Do you have a current technology project , outside of building your home ?
SW : Yes I do !
I have a bunch .
My favorite idea right now … they 're making flexible display materials now and showing them off .
I would love to build a globe that 's all a display .
Maybe it would use Google Earth .
And you could be zooming in on portions of this globe -- you can just look for Africa , for instance .
And as you zoom in , the little dots are lit up like those programs that show you where all the volcanoes and all the webcams of the world are .
You 'd zoom in on blue dots , and zoom and zoom and zoom , and on a blue dot , you 'll see a webcam right there in Africa ; or right there in Amsterdam , or near the hotel you 're gonna stay at in Greece .
I would love that .
RU : People would want that .
JC : Yeah .
And if you do it with Google Earth , you have all those KML layers so you can throw into it webcams and weather and traffic flows .
There 's all sorts of things you can do with that .
RU : Last question .
What do you think of the iPhone and do you think it will be a success ?
SW : I do n't know .
It will be a big hit off the bat , but after people have the iPhone it will truly be judged and compared .
Will word of mouth kill it or make it a hit ?
Who knows ?
I can't even give my emotional feelings until I have a production unit for a while .

How the iPod Changes Culture
Counterculture and the Tech Revolution
at our San Francisco studio riding in fine style … on a Segway .
He had told me via email that he would just park anywhere in the city , and I imagined this multimillionaire going to some exclusive garage where he has a permanent spot and then flagging down a taxi .
But since he was the Segway 's first customer , I imagine that his riding skills – by now – would allow him to easily beat a Yellow Cab across town , particularly on a day that featured a gay pride parade and a Giants game .
The legendary Apple inventor was much in circulation this winter and spring , promoting his hit autobiography , written with Gina Smith , iWoz : From Computer Geek to Cult Icon : How I Invented the Personal Computer , Co-Founded Apple , and Had Fun Doing It .
When we had Smith on our NeoFiles podcast a few months back to talk about the book , she told us that all Wozniak ever wanted to talk about was the pranks he 'd pulled .
So we figured we'd give him his big break and invited him to come on the show to talk pranksterism .
We did get to talk a bit about technology as well .
But , sorry to say , that other Steve apparently never gave him a free iPhone to play with , and this was prior to his heroic crowd management stint during the iPhone release at the Apple store in Santa Clara , so Wozniak had little to say about the greatest thing since … the Segway ?

That was uncalled for .
Sorry . ) Futurist Jamais Cascio joined me in conversing with Woz. Cascio helped to start WorldChanging , a site dedicated to Open Source problem - solving that often focuses on solutions to global warming .
After the show , they started talking about that situation and it transpired that Wozniak is , in Cascio 's words , " a bit of a climate - change denialist . "
Cascio and Wozniak have agreed , in theory , to a brief email discourse on the topic for 10 Zen ( although it seems that we have more enthusiasm for this than they do . )

So now I 'm heading out to Stephen Colbert 's show with a blog on the internet saying I 'm going to take him down .

I figured , I 'm going to be a punching bag .
This guy is good .
But I knew they were going to treat me with kid gloves by the pre-interview they did over the phone .
He asked one wrong question .
He asked , " Have you pulled any pranks lately ? " I said , " Well , I take my steak knife onto airplanes . "
And that was the line that caught him wavering —
" Do I go my way , or do you I go your way ? "
And he sort of went my way a bit .
He said , " I 'll get you on a list . "
I said , " I want to be on the list !
Anyone who knows me knows I 'd love to be on all the lists there are . "

Just what the heck 's going on at 700 N. Pearl St. , Suite 510 ?
That 's the question many folks are asking , as help - wanted ads like this one , this one and many others found in the Detroit Free Press , of all places , list an address but no employer 's name .
This has been going on for several months , turns out -- and despite the best efforts of all involved , the best anyone can come up with is that it belongs to something called Team Exceed .
Of course , that address is one of the towers at the Plaza of the Americas , and when reached by Unfair Park this afternoon , the building 's management confirmed it 's indeed the home of " DTI Exceed . "
Only the woman in the management office told us she did not have a number for DTI Exceed .
And there 's no phone listing for the company , only a fax line .
Nine days ago , the company actually did post a help - wanted ad with a name attached : Halliburton .
Today , Carrie 's Nation posted an enormous piece about the mysterious address and came up with the following conclusion :
I 'm begging someone to correct me if I 'm wrong , but I 'm forming my own opinion on what 's happening based on all of these links that I 've read .
It appears that the Department of Labor , through its Team Exceed contractor , is working hand - in - hand with employers to post phony job ads in order to fulfill the job advertisement requirements for purposes of helping foreign workers obtain their Green Cards for permanent resident status .
As Kim Berry describes in his Programmers Guild website , these positions have already been filled by H - 1B employees .
The jobs are posted , apparently with the help of American taxpayers , simply to collect resumes so they can been be nitpicked to death in order to disqualify every American worker who applies .
Mystery solved .
Or not .
If I was n't on deadline right now , I swear I 'd go over there to see for myself .
Any takers ?

Subject : Bravo !
Two ingredients are so well married in the video : the absurdity of the situation and the clichés aboud America .
It 's pure fun .
Well done !
It 's also interesting to note how the reviews vary over time .
The ' politically correct view ' - sorry folks - is so shallow here ; for instance , jews made jokes about the war : it is a profound means to overcome pain and deal with life ( and a complex theme in Psychology ) .
So , if you 're Canadian , have a beer with an American and laugh on the irony of the video together - that 's the point , not to start a war because of a comic video on zombies , for God 's sake !

Most people if attacked by zombies would merely be overcome and let themselves be chewed to itsy bitsy pieces because A .
They 're lazy B. Stupid C. Greedy and would n't bother helping another living soul .
Most people would simply close the door and go back to watching Jerry Springer or Opra or Football or whatever while the zombies would sneak up behind them and chew their heads off thus perpetuating the zombie menace .

Well , we shot this thing in one day , nobody was paid , most of the zombies supplied their own costumes AND makeup , and the most expensive thing I had to pay for was lunch , which consisted of around 100 hot dogs , couple of big cans of chili , a tub - o - mustard , buns , sodas and bottled water .

Subject : Eh. Mimicking old 50's educational movies pretty much never works , just because you 'd need to also mimic the sound quality and , of course , the type of voice , which takes skilled acting .
Homemade introductions and other footage you 're going to put in the movie and give a " vintage " effect , that 's another thing , because these effects that are in film editing software are usually very unrealistic , just because the software is n't changing the FPS .
I 'm going to stop ranting now , but for the reasons I 've stated above , I 'm quite despondent to give this vintage parody , or almost all parodies of old educational movies more than 2 stars .

Subject : Re : schizoid man 's offhand comment Hmm have to comment on this one , quickly .
I do n't think that the global warming scare is " ridiculous . "
Neither do the vast majority of our scientists who study global warming .
The fact is that Carbon Dioxide absorbs more heat than other atmospheric gasses so the more in the atmosphere the hotter the atmosphere will get .
I find it odd that people will still believe a rogue source without doing any independent research on it themselves , over the in depth research of thousands of people .
It may be true that global warming will not be as devastating as we think it will be , however , as far as I know , in my limited understanding of global warming , there is ample evidence that our planet is getting hotter .

AFP -A US federal appeals court on Friday upheld a refusal to hear the case of a Lebanese - born German man who says he was tortured by the CIA , citing national security reasons .
…
[ The Director of the ACLU said ]
‘ Regrettably , today ’s decision allows CIA officials to disregard the law with impunity by making it virtually impossible to challenge their actions in court . ’ …
Masri has also taken his case to the German courts and a court in southern Munich in January ordered the arrest of 13 people , thought to be CIA agents , in connection with his alleged kidnapping .
…
Reports have indicated that US agents confused Masri with a terror suspect with a similar name who was linked to the attacks of September 11 , 2001 .

IT is a truism of American life that we ’re too darn messy , or we think we are , and we feel really bad about it .
Our desks and dining room tables are awash with paper ; our closets are bursting with clothes and sports equipment and old files ; our laundry areas boil ; our basements and garages seethe .
And so do our partners — or our parents , if we happen to be teenagers .
This is why sales of home - organizing products , like accordion files and labelmakers and plastic tubs , keep going up and up , from $ 5.9 billion last year to a projected $ 7.6 billion by 2009 , as do the revenues of companies that make closet organizing systems , an industry that is pulling in $ 3 billion a year , according to Closets magazine .
This is why January is now Get Organized Month , thanks also to the efforts of the National Association of Professional Organizers , whose 4,000 clutter - busting members will be poised , clipboards and trash bags at the ready , to minister to the 10,000 clutter victims the association estimates will be calling for its members ’ services just after the new year .
But contrarian voices can be heard in the wilderness .
An anti-anticlutter movement is afoot , one that says yes to mess and urges you to embrace your disorder .
Studies are piling up that show that messy desks are the vivid signatures of people with creative , limber minds ( who reap higher salaries than those with neat “ office landscapes ” ) and that messy closet owners are probably better parents and nicer and cooler than their tidier counterparts .
It ’s a movement that confirms what you have known , deep down , all along : really neat people are not avatars of the good life ; they are humorless and inflexible prigs , and have way too much time on their hands .
In the letter , Dinneen took a shot at me , writing " As is to be expected , Mr. Goodell relied on the figures of an energy blogger for his facts . "
Goodell defended me in his response to Dinneen :
For a thorough clarification , check out oil industry engineer Robert Rapier 's analysis .
I know that Dinneen finds bloggers unsavory , but Rapier is among the most fair - minded and insightful critics of the energy industry I 've come across .
And he pointed Dinneen to me for some answers .
So , Bob Dinneen , this one 's for you .
Let 's deconstruct the letter .
Jumping past the all too predictable ad hominems :
Wow , I am having to jump pretty far .
Farther than I thought , as the letter is laced with ad hominems .
Four paragraphs into the letter , Dinneen is waving the flag and talking about " Mr. Goodell 's Hugo Chavez . "
Was this really the RFA ’s best effort ?
Actually , I want to jump down and address the claim that I was most certain would be made by ethanol proponents :
Yet another common misconception offered by ethanol novices is that ethanol is at best energy neutral , meaning it takes as much energy to produce as it yields .
As is to be expected , Mr. Goodell relied on the figures of an energy blogger for his facts .
Inconveniently for his arguments , the federal government has different figures .
According to the Argonne National Laboratories , ethanol yields nearly 70 % more energy that it took to produce .
Conversely , refined gasoline contains 20 % LESS energy that it took to produce .
Can you count the errors and misleading statements ?
First , " ethanol yields nearly 70 % more energy that it took to produce " .
Then " gasoline contains 20 % LESS energy that it took to produce . "
Are you comparing like to like , Mr. Dinneen ?
Of course you are n't .
By your gasoline metric , ethanol also contains less energy than it took to produce .
Why ?
Because you are counting the BTUs contained in the feed as an " input " to the gasoline process , but you are not counting the crude ethanol BTUs as an input to the ethanol process .
You are not comparing like to like ; you are comparing an efficiency to an energy return .
If I have some quantity of energy to invest ( " invest " means to consume ; not to take a ride through the process as the gasoline BTUs do ) in energy production , will I end up with more energy if I invest that into gasoline production , or into ethanol production ?
The answer is gasoline production , by a wide margin .
And I have demonstrated that numerous times , using the pro-ethanol USDA 's own numbers .
I repeat : I am use pro-ethanol sources for my analyses .
So accuse me of bias if you wish , but do n’t accuse me of using “ different figures . ”
I am using the same data source you are .
I just did n't accept the edited version of the numbers .
I wonder if Mr. Dinneen understands how the USDA paper ( Wang at Argonne is a coauthor , hence Dinneen ’s Argonne reference ) arrived at this number ?
I am going to show you how they did , and cite the reports so you can check for yourself .
I analyzed the reports in detail here , using USDA numbers to show that they engaged in a bit of creative accounting .
You can read the analysis for yourself , but here 's the executive summary .
In 2002 , the USDA reported on the energy balance of corn ethanol , stating that the energy balance was 1.34 units of energy out for every unit in .
As I showed , they performed a little accounting trick to get that , as the real number - when full BTU credit was taken for the animal feed co-products - was 1.27 .
Minor quibble , but it made me alert for more accounting tricks .
And they came in a report released 2 years later .
In their 2004 report , the USDA acknowledged that they had grossly underestimated a number of energy inputs in the 2002 report .
So , they corrected those numbers .
But some energy inputs had gone down , and at the end of the day , the energy inputs / outputs in the 2004 report were about the same as in the 2002 report .
Yet in the 2004 report , they reported that the energy ratio for ethanol in two short years had ballooned to an amazing 1.67 , which is where Mr. Dinneen got his number .
In light of this , it is not surprising that ethanol proponents cite amazing progress in improving ethanol 's energy efficiency .
After all , the government said it , so it must be true .
But let ’s look at the raw numbers , shall we ?
Look at Tables 3 and 4 in the 2004 USDA report .
I will just produce it for you so you can see for yourself :
2004 USDA Report Showing the Energy Return for Corn Ethanol at 1.06 .
I know that 's hard to read , but here 's what it says .
( You can always check out the original if you think I am pulling any funny business ) .
The energy produced in a wet mill process is only 2 % greater than the energy it took to produce the ethanol .
And I would point out that things like topsoil and aquifer depletion , energy to build the ethanol plant , etc. were not part of the analysis .
They said they did n't have good information on these things , so they just omitted any attempt to account for them ( i.e. , the actual energy return is lower than they reported ) .
For a dry mill process , they reported that the energy return is 1.10 - 10 % ethanol energy produced - and the weighted average of the two is 1.06 .
Those are the raw , unedited numbers .
In other words , input 1 BTU of fossil fuels , output 1.06 BTUs of ethanol .
Even Mr. Dinneen can’t dispute that almost all of ethanol ’s BTUs ( even with accounting tricks ) are derived from fossil fuels - hence my argument that ethanol is recycled natural gas .
If you apply the ethanol subsidy only to the “ produced ” energy , you will be quite shocked at how expensive that created energy was .
I leave that exercise to the reader .
In Table 4 , to the right , you can see the " adjusted " numbers , and the energy return of 1.67 .
So , how did they do that ?
What they have done , is they have lowered the energy inputs into the ethanol process by a great deal .
And the way they did that was to change their methodology from the 2002 report .
Instead of taking an energy credit for co-products , what they did was allocate energy inputs to the co-product .
By doing this , they subtracted the energy inputs allocated to ethanol , and therefore inflated the energy return for ethanol .
In other words , they are saying “ we did n’t really use that much energy to make ethanol , we used a lot of it to make co-products .
Therefore , we are only counting part of the energy inputs against ethanol production . ”
But utilizing this type of accounting , I could manipulate the ethanol energy return to anything I wanted , just by allocating the energy inputs differently .
You want an ethanol energy return of 3/1 ?
Just allocate 65 % of the energy inputs to the co-products .
How about an energy return of infinity for ethanol ?
Just allocate all of the energy inputs to the co-product .
It makes the co-product energy return look horrible , but it artificially boosts the ethanol energy return .
And they are n't reporting the co-product energy return ( who cares about that , right ? ) , so you get an exaggerated energy return for ethanol production .
Dried distillers grains ( DDGS ) have become a very useful tool for the ethanol industry .
When you point out that the ethanol energy balance is poor , they take a BTU credit for DDGS , just as if you could fuel your car with it .
But they have now figured out that they place more of the " blame " of energy of production into the DDGS and exaggerate the energy return for ethanol .
But you can't have it both ways .
If the energy of production gets dumped into DDGS , it suddenly becomes a lousy co-product with an incredibly high energy cost to produce .
Using the ethanol proponents ’ arguments about fuel quality , DDGS is an extremely low quality fuel with an extremely high energy cost .
Bottom line : Playing with the numbers does n't change the fact that ethanol production is marginally above energy neutral .
Despite Mr. Dinneen 's claim that this is a " misconception offered by ethanol novices " , it is in fact true , based on the government ’s own numbers .
Mr. Dinneen and those who repeat the 1.67 number are misleading the public , since you can't actually achieve that without also getting a co-product with a terrible energy return .
Mr. Dinneen concludes with :
It is entirely appropriate to have a debate about our energy policy in this country .
I agree .
Here 's my proposal .
Three rounds , 2,000 word limit per round , with the debate hosted at the RFA site , at The Oil Drum , and at my blog .
We would each have one week between entries .
While I think it is appropriate to debate Mr. Dinneen , as he is making the claims , I do n't really care who you line up ( maybe Professer Bruce Dale is available ? ) .
On my side will be just me .
I suggest the debate resolution : " Corn Ethanol is Responsible Energy Policy . "
I will take the negative .
If you have an alternate proposal , I would be glad to entertain it .
But I insist that the debate is fact - based , and not ad hominem - based .
All claims at RFA ’s site will be fair game , as will all the ethanol claims I have made .
So , how about it ?
If readers are interested in seeing the RFA defend their claims , or if you just relish the possibility of seeing me get trounced , let them know at info@ethanolrfa.org .

We 've known for some time that Google has research and development resources dedicated to mobile phone technology , but the question has always been : will Google strike out on its own , or will it embrace partners in its quest to tackle the mobile world ?
Will it make its own phone , or just a set of applications and recommendations ?
Citing " people familiar with the plans , " the Wall Street Journal has a write - up today exploring the rumors of Google 's mobile ambitions .
Google is believed to have spent " hundreds of millions of dollars " on its mobile phone project and has courted Verizon Wireless , T - Mobile , and others as possible partners for carrying a Google - designed phone .
According to anonymous sources , Google has multiple phone prototypes and envisions a day in which mobile phones will be ad- supported thanks to services such as those Google provides .
As you would expect , Google is not ready to become a cellular provider just yet .
Even if the company succeeds at the 700MHz spectrum auction , it will be a long time before it can compete with the likes of Verizon or AT&T as a carrier .
Infrastructure can't be built overnight .
Instead , Google 's approach is two - pronged , in that the company is working on its own devices , but is also working on a set of technical specifications and applications to be shared by multiple mobile devices .
Google will allow manufacturers to use their prototype designs or make their own .
Google 's chief interest , clearly , is getting its applications on phones .
Mobile device versions of Google Maps , Google Talk , and even Gmail are already popular , and the company is working on a web browser as well .
Of course , as we have reported previously , mobile ad platforms make the wireless carriers nervous , especially when they are built around search services that are ultimately poised to eat the carriers ' lunch .
If you 're a Verizon or a T - Mobile , you have the option of running your own search engines , which would allow you to keep a bigger chunk of the revenues generated from advertisers .
Of course , if users sidestep your services for something offered by Google , then you 'll ultimately lose out .
However , ad revenue sharing is not the only issue .
Third - party search results can't be manipulated by wireless carriers to promote their own offerings by privileging them in searches and other search - based services .
The wireless industry thrives on monetizing what many would consider typical behavior on any IP network , and handing over the keys to Google makes them understandably nervous about their own futures .
They might also be a bit bitter when Google turns around and uses its own services to cross - promote its other offerings , which it can do for free .
For now , interest among carriers appears to be mild , but of course , no one is talking on the record , and Google is still deep in R&D .
Stay tuned .
Column Imagine a world in which parents read to their children in the evening , not because it was a pleasurable and meaningful activity , but as an investment in the child 's future earning potential .
Or consider a close - knit neighbourhood in which people clubbed together on social events not so as to enjoy a sense of community , but so as to reduce the risk of their property being damaged .
This " rational choice " view of society is most closely associated with the work of Gary Becker , one of the world 's most celebrated and also most controversial living economists .
Since the 1950s , his work has pushed the boundaries of economics ever further into foreign territories , using economic methods to analyse such seemingly non-economic phenomena as drug addiction , families and crime .
He was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1992 , and he is in many ways the godfather of the recent fad of pop economics , exemplified in the best - selling Freakonomics .
Strange as it might sound , not least to Becker himself , he may also be considered the closest thing Web 2.0 has to an ideologue .
The same spirit of adventure that characterises Web 2.0 is present in Becker 's work .
But the two also share the same delusions about human beings , and it's these that may be more consequential .
Humans as selfish equations
Along with many colleagues at the legendary Chicago School of Economics , Becker 's achievement was to see that economics need n't confine itself to studying markets .
Economics , for Becker , was simply a particular way of understanding any social behaviour .
What distinguished it from other social sciences was not its domain of study , but its guiding assumption that individuals will always act rationally to maximise their own satisfaction .
The implications of this are stark .
All altruistic , moral , cultural or emotional behaviour becomes reconceived as the outcome of individual calculation .
It is no longer just businessmen and traders whose behaviour can be understood in terms of rational self - interest , but that of politicians , parents and neighbours .
This is a novel and unsettling way of viewing society .
But what has it got to do with Web 2.0 ?
The first dotcom boom was principally about putting the internet to work in increasing the efficiency of existing services .
There was already a market for books , but Amazon found a way of cutting out the inefficiency of the high street .
The government already obliged car owners to pay tax on their vehicles , but the web offered a way of avoiding the tedium of post office queues when doing so .
This became known as disintermediation .
While these sorts of efficiencies are n't necessarily limited to markets situations ( as the car tax example demonstrates ) , they are all one - to - many services .
They feature an organisation that resembles a ' producer ' offering something to individuals who resemble ' consumers ' , who usually have some choice about whether or not to accept it .
To apply efficiency criteria in such situations can be controversial , as arguments about reform of the NHS demonstrate , but even traditionalists have to accept there are financial constraints which have to be taken into account .
The significance of the new Web 2.0 services is that it abandons this conventional one - to - many model of service provision , and sets about exploiting the many - to - many potential of the internet .
Rather than using the web to connect producers to consumers , it is used to connect individuals to each other .
The examples are familiar .
Last.fm aggregates and organises the musical tastes of its users to provide personalised music recommendations to them .
Facebook offers endless new ways to connect individuals around existing friendships , shared interests or events .
In the civic sphere , Pledgebank provides a mechanism to get new voluntary movements or group activities off the ground without central organisation .
Of course many - to - many communication precedes even the internet we know today .
Email mailing lists and message boards were features of the first Bulletin Board Systems ( BBS ) , and migrated to the internet .
They are both examples of individuals grouping together in a self - organising fashion .
What has changed is that these otherwise secluded and organic realms of social interaction are now the focus of obsessive technological innovation and commercial interest .
The same technological zeal and business acumen that once was applied to improving the way we buy a book or pay our car tax is now being applied to the way we engage in social and cultural activities with others .
In short , efficiency gains are no longer being sought only in economic realms such as retail or public services , but are now being pursued in parts of our everyday lives where previously they had n't even been imagined .
Web 2.0 promises to offer us ways of improving the processes by which we find new music , new friends , or new civic causes .
The hassle of undesirable content or people is easier to cut out .
We have become consumers of our own social and cultural lives .
It 's here that the connection with Gary Becker becomes plain .
Where Becker took the utilitarian assumptions of economics and pushed them into areas of society seemingly untouched by rational self - interest , Web 2.0 takes the efficiency - enhancing capabilities of digital technology and pushes them into areas of society previously untouched by efficiency criteria .
Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi himself stepped in to admonish the editors of Makkal Osai , a Tamil - language paper .
The country 's publishing laws allow politicians to close any publication without judicial approval .
Christians who complained about the picture say they are bemused as they had accepted the paper 's apology .
Sensing perhaps that it has to be even - handed between all of Malaysia 's many faiths , the government moved quickly to punish Makkal Osai , the BBC's Jonathan Kent reports from Kuala Lumpur .
Makkal Osai had already said sorry , explaining that a graphics editor had inadvertently downloaded the picture from the internet .
It apparently shows Jesus smoking and drinking and appeared with the paper 's daily spiritual message on its front page with the caption " if someone repents for his mistakes , then heaven awaits him " .
The Roman Catholic Archbishop of Kuala Lumpur , Murphy Pakiam , expressed surprise at the paper 's closure , saying that Christians believe in reconciliation and that the paper had indeed appeared to have sincerely repented of its mistake .
However , others , notably the Malaysian Indian Congress ( MIC ) , a predominantly ethnic Tamil Hindu political party , were not appeased .
Perhaps coincidentally , Makkal Osai has been critical of the MIC , which owns a rival paper , our correspondent notes .

Iran ’s president rebuked his American counterpart Saturday as the two countries fell back into a familiar pattern of back - and - forth barbs that may imperil the Obama administration ’s plans to open a direct dialogue with Tehran over its nuclear program .
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad responded to President Obama ’s criticism of the Islamic Republic ’s crackdown on dissenters during the civil unrest sparked by dispute over his reelection .
On Friday , answering Ahmadinejad ’s demand that the United States stay out of Iran ’s affairs , Obama urged the Iranian president “ to consider looking at the families of those who ’ve been beaten or shot or detained . ”
Emerging from a period of relative quiet , Ahmadinejad criticized Obama for making “ unconventional , abnormal and discourteous comments ” in condemning the violence and political repression .

Though Tehran ’s streets have quieted down , the aftershocks of the disputed election continue .
At 10 p.m. Saturday , some residents of the capital climbed to their rooftops and chanted “ God is Great ! ” in a recurring symbolic act of defiance in support of Mir-Hossein Mousavi , who was defeated in an election many Iranians and independent experts consider fraudulent .
New York - based Human Rights
Watch alleged in a report issued Saturday that pro-government Basiji militiamen have been storming neighborhoods , damaging private properties and assaulting civilians in an attempt to stop the nightly chants , which are reminiscent of protests that erupted in the months that led to the 1979 Islamic Revolution .
Late Friday , the Guardian Council announced that some ballots from the June 12 vote would be examined by a special committee of six distinguished officials and representatives from the campaigns of Mousavi and another presidential candidate , Mehdi Karroubi .
But both candidates announced Saturday that they rejected the partial recount , demanding that the entire result be nullified , according to statements on their websites .
Mohsen Rezai , a conservative candidate who had withdrawn his complaints about the election , asked to be allowed to place a representative on the committee .

The Mehr news agency Saturday quoted a lawmaker who said that Ayatollah Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , the powerful cleric who is Mousavi ’s patron , has voiced support for supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who has publicly backed Ahmadinejad .
Another report by Mehr , which is close to Khamenei , said a council controlled by Rafsanjani is urging all candidates to adhere to the law over the disputed election .
But the report could not be confirmed , and analysts said both reports might be disinformation or an attempt to anger Rafsanjani and coax him back into the fold .
After days of caution , Obama on Friday spoke out forcefully against the Iranian government ’s conduct after dozens of journalists , activists and associates of Mousavi had been swept up by security forces .
The Obama administration hoped to broach talks with Tehran this year to resolve a long - standing dispute over Iran ’s nuclear research program .
The postelection violence makes it politically difficult for U.S. officials to have contact with Iranian officials .
After welcoming Iranian diplomats to join in Fourth of July celebrations at U.S. embassies , the Obama administration rescinded the invitations .

Analysts say Ahmadinejad draws domestic political strength when he is under attack internationally .
“ If you continue your meddlesome stance , the Iranian nation ’s response will be crushing and regret - inducing , ” Ahmadinejad warned Obama .
“ They constantly say that they want to talk with Iran , ” Ahmadinejad said in an address to judiciary officials .
“ We have announced our readiness .
But do they expect us to talk with such comments ?
He made a mistake . ”
Ahmadinejad repeated his urging that Obama avoid following in the footsteps of former President George W. Bush .

“ He also used to speak to the world from a position of arrogance and egotism , but you saw how God brought him down to abjectness and buried him in the dustbin of history , ” he said in comments broadcast on state radio .
“ We do not expect much from those few European countries because they do not enjoy any particular status in the world , ” he said .
“ However , we are surprised at Mr. Obama . ”

Got this question a while ago .
Need help !
Our fuel bill is $ 700 per month .
Married empty nesters on modest income from Wisconsin U.S.A .
Cannot afford gas to run our in - floor heating for house and new dog kennel .
how can we build cheap solar heat for us and new kennel . ?
j
Well J , you are in luck my friend .
You have two things going for you right now , you have radiant floor heating , and you have a very high fuel bill .
Lets take these one at a time .
Radiant floor heating :
You may not know this but radiant floor heating is probably the most efficient way to deliver solar thermal energy .
For those of you not in the know radiant floor or under floor heating is when you heat your home with heat that radiates up through the floor .
There are several different types of radiant flooring .
Thick slab :
This is where you pour a thick slab of concrete over a series of flexible plastic tubes .
These tube are later filled with hot water to heat the home .
The tubes are made of a type of plastic that lasts forever , is very flexible , and also transmit heat well .
Radiant floors used to be made from metal pipes , this did n’t work out so well , the new plastic system work much better and last a lot longer .
The reason why you use a thick slab of concrete is because the heat from the pipes gets trapped in the concrete and is released slowly and evenly into the room .
This eliminates hot spots , as well as making that first step out of bed on cold mornings much more enjoyable .
It also heats the room from the bottom up , which feels better .
it also reduces the dry air feeling of forced hot air and the cold spots of radiators .
Thin slab :
Thin slab is the same as thick slab but it uses a much smaller slab of concrete .
Better for upstairs floors or for retrofits where you cant fit a thick slab system .
They work very well but with a smaller thermal mass ( the concrete ) they are not as efficient .
Below floor :
If you have an existing home and want to install radiant floor heating and also happen to have exposed joists in the basement you can retrofit your home with below floor radiant heat .
You basically take the flexible plastic hose and staple it under the floor .
You then place special metal reflecting plates over the pipes to “ bounce ” as much heat upwards towards the room above as you can .
So you know all this about your own system , what you might not know is how well you can tie solar thermal into this system .
It does n’t matter where the hot water comes from , it just needs to get into the pipes that run under your floor .
Right now you must have a hot water tank that holds the hot water ( the hot water you are burning fuel to create right now ) , so you would call up your local solar thermal installer and get them to build you a solar thermal system that ties into that tank , the hot water would be coming from the sun , and you would not need to burn fuel to create it .
You already have the pumps , you already have the storage , you just need the panels and a pipe run to the tank .
Pretty easy right !
Typical solar thermal panels mounted on a flat roof , if your roof is tilted you will not need the racking .
This is a technical diagram of how the system would work .
Your Giant Bill :
You probably think that I am crazy listing your huge fuel bill as a positive point .
But here is why it is good , your large bill gives you a very strong motivation to do something about your problem .
It would be easy to install a solar thermal system that will replace 50 - 80 % of your heating costs .
That means that if you pay 10,000 dollars on a solar thermal system ( you can and will find them cheaper , make sure you do your research to make sure you are getting a good product ) and it saves you 500 dollars a month , well you can see it will pay for itself in just a couple of years .
You may opt to buy a very modest system ( one or two panels with a small solar driven pump for $ 1,000 – $ 2,000 ) just to heat your kennel .
Either way you can offset a significant portion of your bill with a relatively minor investment in solar thermal heating .
Good luck !
Lisp is one of the oldest and best - loved programming languages around , but it gets relatively little attention from programmers despite its flexibility and power .
Now the organisers of the 2007 International Lisp Conference hope to raise the language ’s profile by inviting entries for their latest programming contest .
It ’s an idea they ’ve tried before : a competition was run in the lead - up to the New York lisp conference in 2003 .
Then the entrants had to solve the " Last Piece Puzzle " , a type of jigsaw with a few billion billion frustrating possibilities but only five correct solutions .
This time around the problem is also topological , and involves writing a program to play the game of ‘ Continuo ’ , a card game where players place coloured cards on the table and score points .
Each card has a 4 by 4 grid of coloured squares , and you score points by building connected regions .
It ’s the sort of game mathematicians love to inflict on their children and programmers love to write elegant algorithms for just so they can make the kids cry by beating them every time .
Prizes are on offer for the program that scores the highest , the one using the most elegant algorithm and the fastest running program .
There ’s even a prize for the first entry submitted that can play the game ‘ half decently ’ in the judges ’ opinion , and one for the best use of really obscure lisp features .
Lisp programmers have until March 3 to enter , although if you ’re really keen you could emulate one of the 2003 winners who learned the language from scratch just in order to take part .

One more detail about the Ashcroft and Gonzales guidelines on contacts between DOJ and the White House .
While the latter explicitly gives
Cheney the authority to communicate with DOJ about ongoing cases , I do n't believe it gives Karl Rove -- or any of the people who work in Office of Political Affairs save its head -- that authority .
When the more expansive Gonzales memo lays out whom the AG and his staff may communicate with , it says :
Notwithstanding any procedures or limitations set forth above , the Attorney General may communicate directly with the President , Vice President , their Chiefs of Staff , Counsel to the President or Vice President , Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs , Assistant to the President and Homeland Security Advisor , or the head of any office within EOP regarding any matter within the jurisdiction of the Department of Justice .
Staff members of the Office of the Attorney General , if so designated by the Attorney General , may communicate directly with officials and staff of the White House Office , the Office of the Vice President , the National Security Council , the Homeland Security Council , and the Office of Management and Budget .
Now , Karl Rove is Senior Advisor to the President and I think he retains the title Deputy Chief of Staff , but he lost his Policy portfolio in April 2006 , when Josh Bolten was named Chief of Staff .
He has headed Political Affairs , Office of Public Liaison , and Office of Strategic Initiatives .
As the head of these offices ( " head of any office , " he presumably could interact with the Attorney General if the AG initiated the communication .
But he does n't serve in that role anymore , and the Deputy Chief of Staff ( unlike the Chief of Staff ) is not named among those the AG can choose to communicate with .
Nor does Karl fall under the subordinate offices ( NSC , HSC , OMB ) with which AG staff members can communicate .
And Karl certainly does n't fall under the list of people who can communicate about an ongoing criminal investigation .
... all initial communications that concern or may concern such an investigation or case pending at the trial level should take place only between the Office of the Counsel to the President and the Office of the Deputy Attorney General ( ODAG ) ...
Now , before I move on to the ways that Karl can communicate with DOJ , let me point out that what holds true here for Karl also holds true for Scott Jennings and other other lower ranking members of the Office of Political Affars .
If I 'm reading Gonzales ' memo correctly , the only people who get to communicate with the AG are heads of offices .
So Sara Taylor would have counted , back when she headed the Office of Political Affairs , but her subordinates like Jennings would not .
The ASUS Eee PC : First Look at Linux
Due to the fact the ASUS Eee PC 701 is aimed at booth computer novices and experts alike , there are two basic GUI designs included with its built - in Linux operating system .
The first of which is called “ Easy ” , which as you might guess , is targeted at first time , or novice computer users .
In Easy mode , there are six tabs : Internet , Work , Learn , Play , Settings , and Favorites .
Each of these tabs has icons that can link to a website , file , or application on the Eee .
The internet tab has a few interesting links , one to web storage , one to Wikipedia , and even one to Skype .
The Eee PC 701 will likely have Skype pre-installed , and coupled with the notebook ’s onboard webcam and microphone , will open up VOIP communications to an entire new set of users .
The Work tab opens up 15 different applications , ranging from standard Office - type software to a dictionary .
The documents , spreadsheets , and presentations icons all lead to their respective applications in the free , open source office software suite Open Office .
The Eee PC even comes with its own Anti-Virus software and in the learn section , has a typing and a painting program .
Asus plans to include more open source education - related software when the Eee PC hits the market later this year , but did n’t give any more information on specific titles .
According to ASUS representatives , Standard mode was made to be “ Windows - like ” and looks and feels just like a typical Windows OS .
The Windows Start button is replaced by a Launch icon , and navigating through files and applications is just like Windows .
Even the minimize , maximize , and close buttons in the top right of each application window on the Eee PC 701 look identical to that of the Windows XP Silver style theme we run on our own standard notebooks .
It seems as though ASUS is trying to bring as much “ Windows - like ” functionality to the Eee PC as they possibly can .
With Windows in mind , ASUS has said that the Eee PC has already been tested to work on Microsoft ’s Windows XP , but to keep costs down it will not come pre-installed on the Eee PC .
The ASUS Eee PC is expected to be available , worldwide , in full production quantities by this fall .
It is rumored to have a street date of mid-August , and will likely be one of the hottest selling computers in recent history , come the holiday shopping season .
Lessee here , we 've got lasers , creative input devices , a " stick it to The Man " aesthetic and a Mooninite -- sounds like a successful night of hacking to us .
Graffiti Research Lab and friends hacked together a high powered projector with some computer components and a camera to track the writings of a 60 mW Green Laser on the side of a building in Rotterdam and project it as blue graffiti .
The resulting art looks surprisingly good , and the perpetrators were kind enough to document the event , along with providing instructions for doing up your own version .
It 's hard to describe , so we recommend peeping the video after the break , or the better quality vids and pics over at the read link .

While running for president of Iran in 2005 , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad went out of his way to counter charges from opponents that his victory would bring to power " Islamic fascism " and the " Iranian Taliban . "
The archconservative said Iran had bigger issues to deal with – economic , nuclear , and growing threats from the US and the West – than the status of women's head scarves , and the extent of personal freedoms that had grown under his predecessor , Mohammad Khatami .
But today Iran is in the grip of the most widespread crackdown since the 1979 Islamic revolution , with targets that range from women and student activists , to the media , to four Iranian - Americans accused of using US funds to undermine the regime .
Analysts say the message of the repressive steps is clearly that hard - liners remain in charge , despite US efforts against the Islamic Republic and severe economic woes that led to the torching of 19 gas stations last month , when rationing was abruptly imposed .
" Their argument is that no matter what happens in Iran , no matter how many social disturbances exist , we are in control , and our position will not change , " says Farideh Farhi , an Iran expert at the University of Hawaii in Honolulu .
This tougher " security outlook , " as it is called in Iran , has been enabled by a top - down transformation of the ministries of intelligence , interior , and culture and Islamic guidance since Mr. Ahmadinejad and his hard - line allies took over , says Ms. Farhi .
But it 's also been facilitated by US actions , including $ 75 million for " pro-democracy " activities the regime sees as intended to foment a revolution .
" Ultimately , the policy that is pursued by the Bush administration is causing paranoia , and it is counterproductive [ because ] it benefits the hard - liners in Iran " by giving them a pretext to crack down , says Farhi .
This week , officials launched new investigations into two of the Iranian - Americans now held in Tehran 's Evin prison : Haleh Esfandiari , a grandmother and Middle East expert with the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington ; and Kian Tajbakhsh , an urban planner who has worked with the Soros Foundation and the Iranian government .
' They 're trying to instill fear '
But the US - Iran tug of war is just one factor in a growing number of hard - line moves that some argue have been aimed at preemptively quelling wider unrest , when the regime is under intense pressure both at home and abroad .
" They are trying to instill fear in the population , to let people know that while Iran may be getting a bit beaten up internationally , they are still very much in control domestically , " says Karim Sadjadpour , an Iran analyst at the Carnegie Endowment in Washington .
" And people should not think for one second that it is safe to agitate politically , to indulge themselves by engaging in criticism . "
Iranian news organizations have been instructed not to report negative news regarding social unrest , gas rationing in the world 's fourth - largest oil exporter , the nuclear program , or the impact of UN sanctions on Iran .
Last week , the head of the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance warned darkly that he saw " signs of a creeping coup " in the Iranian media .
On Wednesday , a ban was reinstated on a moderate Iranian news agency , just as , last week , a ban of seven years on Ham - Mihan newspaper was extended after a brief interlude of publishing .
In a one - month period this spring , security forces stopped or detained 150,000 people – women for insufficiently covered hair and tight - fitting clothes , and men for Western haircuts and attitudes .
Most were released quickly , but many " hoodlums and thugs " were arrested , police said .
" This is a comprehensive security plan of the whole [ Islamic ] system , not just Mr. Ahmadinejad , " says Saeed Laylaz , an economic and security analyst in Tehran .
The crackdown is being pursued on three levels , says Mr. Laylaz : First , by " attacking ordinary people " to increase the police 's street presence .
Second , going after student activists – including eight who were arrested after chanting to Ahmadinejad " Death to the dictator " last winter – and intellectuals like the Iranian - Americans , and purging universities of liberal professors .
And third , arresting a top insider on spying charges – former nuclear negotiator Hossein Mousavian – " as a warning notice to people who are thinking that they could do something against the system , " says Laylaz .
Economic woes on the rise
Ahmadinejad was elected on the promise of bringing Iran 's vast oil wealth to the " dinner table " of poor Iranians .
But instead unemployment has risen , along with inflation , and Iran 's small refining capacity – Iran imports 40 percent of its gasoline , at $ 4 billion each year – has forced an easing of long - standing subsidies at the pump .
Now cars are limited to just less than a gallon a day , and motorists are fuming .
The violent reaction , when authorities gave only three hours notice that rationing would start at midnight , " could have been worse , " but for the pre-emptive crackdown , says Mr. Sadjadpour .
" People sensed that the regime and the basiji [ volunteer ideological forces ] were really on a head - cracking spree the previous few weeks , " says the analyst .
" It made people think twice before going out onto the streets to vent their criticism . "
Still , images of burning gas stations did little to calm nervous Iranians .
" Unfortunately , Mr. Ahmadinejad did not [ fulfill ] his promises to poor people , " says Laylaz .
" This social unrest is an immediate and direct consequence of those policies ....
And at the moment , the social structure of this country is absolutely fragile and sensitive about economic issues . "
But those economic concerns have become tangled with myriad other social and strategic issues in Iran , which blend into a single " security " response from the regime .
And the crackdown has had an impact , as Iranians – especially those with ties to Westerners – refuse invitations for cultural exchanges , conferences abroad , or lunch in Tehran where Western diplomats might be present .
Iranians with such ties who have been arrested and even imprisoned , report that their interrogators accused them of " serving the enemy " whether they knew it or not .
A final report of BBC correspondent Frances Harrison last week , leaving after three years in Tehran , shows the scale of change .
While numerous officials had attended the going - away lunch of her predecessor , not one – not even those from the Islamic Guidance ministry , who are often helpful on a personal level – came to her BBC farewell lunch .
" I did not take it personally , " wrote Ms. Harrison .
" The atmosphere is now one where Iranians are afraid to mix with foreigners for fear of being accused of spying . "
Farhi says that what the regime wants to do is " break the kind of linkages that were created during the [ former President Hashemi ] Rafsanjani and Khatami period , because all these activities that people are being accused of were legitimate , and in fact promoted under previous administrations . "
[ Editor 's note :
The original version misspelled Farhi 's name here . ]
That is the result of a new Machiavellian calculation , says Sadjadpour : " Whereas Khatami and the reformists said our best security is people 's happiness , [ this hard - line ] worldview is that it is much better to be feared than to be loved .
" Their behavior is much more out of desperation than of strength , " he adds .
" It does n't show that you are very confident about your place as a regime , when 67 - year - old women are being suspected of undermining Iran 's national security . "
The CanSecWest “ PWN to Own ” Mac break in contest that IDG ’s InfoWorld failed to accurately cover was picked up and regurgitated by many sites that reveled in repeating the same myths , but failed to actually point out what really happened .
Even CanSecWest was quiet on the subject .
What was really compromised , and what was the result of the exploit ?
Readers of InfoWorld , Computerworld , and other IDG properties that republished Nancy Gohring ’s uninformed and incomplete article do n’t know .
Speaking From The Ars .
Charles Jade at Ars Technica cited IDG ’s reports without adding any new facts .
Jade even suggested that $ 10,000 prize contests like this one might turn the tide for Mac security , somehow creating the incentive to develop Windows style security problems for Mac OS X .
How would a contest that pays for an exploit , then takes the exploit off the market by delivering the details to Apple for patching , create a less secure platform ?
It would n’t ; it does the opposite .
Imagine a developer paying freelance workers to find bugs in its software , paying an award for each bug that is discovered and described in detail to allow for a fix .
Would the software become more buggy as it is refined ?
Whose Exploit Was It Anyway ?
CanSecWest kept the details mostly a secret .
Engadget ’s report , written by Conrad Quilty - Harper , succinctly covered the facts without introducing any uninformed speculation .
Still , while the Engadget article pointed out that it took nine hours to discover the crack , it did n’t point out a full 24 hours of attempts the day before had gotten nowhere , and that because of that , CanSecWest dropped the security threshold of the contest .
Rather than trying to hack into Mac OS X remotely , contestants were able to feed it a URL in attempts to exploit a local user on its web browser instead .
Imagine a contest to break into a panic room ; after everyone participating in the challenge fails to break in , they ’re given telephone access to the person inside the room so they can talk them in to opening the door from the inside to let them in .
Is that a security compromise of the panic room , or a social exploit ?
What Did They Crack ?
According to “ YankInOz , ” a reader who responded to the Engadget article , “ the ‘ hack ’ was of a Java routine that is outdated and no longer used . ”
He added , “ This ‘ exploit is easily found to work in Firefox , Camino and Safari . ”
An anonymous user on Slashdot described the exploit as involving a JavaScript routine .
Sun ’s Java and Netscape ’s JavaScript share little in common apart from their names , but both are third party browser plugins that are not specific to Safari .
Exploiting either one and calling it a “ Mac exploit ” is disingenuous .
Third Party Issues .
That also highlights a fact many ‘ security experts ’ do n’t seem to grasp : installing software changes your level of security .
While Macs are quite secure when kept up to date , installing software and turning on new services can open one up to attack vectors that Apple ca n’t control for you .
This is also certainly part of the problem Microsoft faces with Windows .
While the company is guilty of maintaining very poor security controls until just the last couple years -- when it has been forced out of panic and shame to clean up its most flagrantly bad practices -- Microsoft also faces problems it ca n’t solve itself .
All third party Windows software that does anything foolish can override Microsoft ’s best efforts .
Of course , that same principle applies to the Mac .
Turn on Microsoft ’s SMB protocol for Windows file sharing and you ’ll expose the Mac to some of the same insecure exploits that Windows PCs face on insecure networks .
And of course , if you install Windows under Parallels or Boot Camp on a Mac , there is no magic force field of Apple security that will prevent you from getting virus infections .
Even using Microsoft Office files on a Mac will enable it to distribute the mostly annoying macroviruses that latch onto Office files for a free ride .
Updating Third Party Problems .
Since Apple distributes various outside code as part of Mac OS X -- including Java and lots of open source software -- it maintains the responsibility for patching exploits for all that software .
That explains why Apple is picky about what it bundles in Mac OS X : it bears accountability for everything it ships .
Many of the security patches Apple regularly releases relate to software from outside projects .
The most recent 2007 - 004 patch included fixes for GNU tar , BSD ’s lukemftpd FTP server , and MIT ’s Kerberos , for example .
The fact that Apple manages the security updates for all of the software bundled with Macs makes Mac OS X more attractive to many users than a roll - your - own version of Linux , which might include code from hundreds of different projects , all of which are constantly being updated , patched , and overhauled .
Install your own version of some software package , and the onus of managing the very complex art and science of security will fall directly in your lap .
It ’s like installing homemade tires on your pickup : you ca n’t demand a recall from Ford if your tires explode and send you careening into a ditch , because you exposed yourself to that particular engineering flaw .
Lying about Security With “ Vulnerability Counts . ”
At the same time , the vast majority of media outlets reporting on security are being both disingenuous and dishonest in their reporting of security issues by conflating security with the number of exploits or vulnerabilities reported for a platform .
While many writers are just ignorant , plenty of pundits do realize they are lying .
Microsoft has recently jumped on this bandwagon in an effort to cover up the obvious security disaster it created on Windows with the dishonest insinuation that Linux and Macs have greater security problems because there are so many potential holes being reported and patched in the open source Unix world .
That ’s what active security is !
It ’s like complaining that a country is n’t safe because it has an visible military presence , or that a patient has a bad immune system because he are actively fighting off multiple infections .
What Did CanSecWest Prove ?
The Microsoft sponsored CanSecWest was pointedly trying to besmirch the reputation of Mac security .
While it successfully resulted in creating false headlines like the one published by IDG , what did it really prove ?
Using a browser flaw in conjunction with an automated ‘ user ’ programmed to visit a site at regular intervals is quite a desperate reach , particularly given the limited access this convoluted and artificial attack achieved .
Nearly every report on the subject failed to mention the extent of the access the attacker was actually granted .
IDG ’s article clearly suggested that the break in was not only a “ remote exploit , ” which is was not , but also that it granted the attacker access to do pretty much anything .
This was not true either .
Were n’t There Two Macs ?
According to the CanSecWest website , the contest involved two Macs , but the rules were different for each .
To win the first Mac , a cracker had to break in and “ follow the instructions in the home of the default user . ”
In other words , gain access to a file with limited local user rights , and prove they had by acting on what it said .
To win the second Mac , contestants needed to “ follow the instructions in the filesystem root ( this one will need admin compromise ) . ”
Had both Macs been given away , this would have been a real exploit .
After not being able to directly break into even the user realm in a day of trying , the contest dropped the bar to allow users to send URLs to the contest manager , who put them on a server and set the two Mac Book Pros to automatically visit a website site and ‘ click on ’ the submitted URLs .
Reenacted by Jody Foster , it might have gone like this :
“ Hello inside the panic room !
It ’s safe to come out now ! ”
Door opens .
“ Ah hah !
We broke in ! ”
Getting To The Root of Things .
After Dino Dai Zovi ’s attack exploited what was apparently a Java routine via the automated browser actions , he was still only able to gain access to a user level file .
While this is a significant flaw that needs to be patched , it is unlikely that anyone who wanted access to a system would be able to set up such a Rube Goldberg event chain to gain access to a specific users ’ files .
A real attacker would better use their time simply mugging the user of their laptop , breaking into their office or home , or kidnapping them and demanding their information at gunpoint .
The premise is fairly absurd already .
The real exploits used in the Windows virus , worm , and spyware business involve installing malware as an admin , and commonly hiding commands in the system ’s Windows Registry to automatically reinstall the malicious code behind the back of the system , the user , and any security software that is running .
To make this worth the time of attackers hoping to control PCs for use as email spam drones , it has to be easy to roll out exploits remotely in mass installations ; they need to get to the root of things quickly .
That happens many thousands of times a day in the Windows PC world , but that ’s not what happened to the Mac at CanSecWest after 33 hours of security experts ’ trying .
To recap , the contest officially restated :
“ Just to review the rules , the first box required a flaw that allows the attacker to get a shell with user level privilages [ sic ] .
The second box , still up for grabs , requires the same , plus the attacker needs to get root . ”
Nancy Gohring , You Are Coming to a Sad Realization .
Cancel or Allow ?
Step two did n’t ever happen .
Nobody could gain root privileges on the Mac despite the $ 10,000 prize ( and the laptop ) , even though there are many hundreds of known vectors for doing just that on Windows PCs .
Were an attacker to use a Windows - like exploit to try installing software via a browser link , or through a malware graphic attempting to run arbitrary code simply as a user simply visited a booby - trapped website , Mac OS X would throw up an authentication dialog telling the user to sign in for the software that was being installed .
Windows does not do this .
Even the “ new and improved ” Vista does not ask for authentication .
It asks the user to click Allow , after previously having asked the user to click Allow repeatedly .
Guess what most users will do when prompted to Allow some executable to do some technical sounding thing in the Registry ?
Oops , You Forgot to Include the Critical , Pertinent Facts .
Gohring did n’t mention this , IDG did n’t correct its headlines , and sites across the web ran the same story insisting that proof had been delivered that Macs are no more secure than Windows .
It was n’t true though .
They nearly all failed to mention that there was no root exploit , no remote access , no installation of malware , and no viruses to install anyway , because Apple has taken reasonable and responsible efforts to secure its platform .
Open vs Proprietary .
Part of those efforts involve working together with various teams of open source developers .
A significant amount of the effort required to secure software in Mac OS X is shared by GNU / Linux developers , the various flavors of BSD , and other open source projects .
Think of components such as Apache , OpenSSH , and GCC .
Microsoft has worked hard to patch around the discovered flaws in its broken Windows software , code that nobody outside of the company really understands on an intimate level .
XP and Vista ’s NT kernel is an entirely proprietary , known to be full of undiscovered holes , and has not been exhaustingly reviewed by multiple eyes in multiple teams the way Unix has been for decades .
Additionally , Windows users do n’t benefit from the shared work done on projects such as Apache , OpenSSH and GCC , because Microsoft chooses to write its own closed versions .
Everything from Microsoft ’s IIS web server , to its RPC and its compilers are done against the tide of shared , open development .
Microsoft ’s Massive Security Problem .
Microsoft ’s security problems extend from a past decade of incompetent sloppiness , but it still bears responsibility for securing those flaws today , because it made tens of billions of dollars every year selling its insecure software before anyone realized the damage the company was creating for users .
I wonder what might happen when the asbestos lawyers run out of business ?
While the security experts Microsoft pays are quick to point out that the company has made progress , and indeed it has , they are awfully quick to absolve the company of its prior sins , despite the fact that we ’re all suffering from that negligence every time we check mail and receive tons of spam from the rooted Windows PC spambots .
Even more problematic is that Microsoft still does n’t seem to understand how to effectively determine when to trade off security for user convenience , even in Vista , the new version of Windows that supposedly solves all security problems going forward .
Super Users and the Vistapocalypse .
Glenn Marshall of Object Development Labs wrote to explain how Vista still offers a poor security policy :
“ Macs do n't , by default , run as the super user .
This means software can't be installed without entering the root password .
“ Windows , by default , does run as the super user .
This means if you break in , the bank vault is wide open , in distinct contrast to OS X and any other operating system designed for internet use .
“ This , more than anything else , in my view , is the reason Mac are as resistant as they are .
I find it odd that this is n't more widely known .
And even odder that the class action lawyers are n't all over this , but that is another story .
“ In fairness , a malware could delete user files , which is bad , of course .
The point here is that it could n't , generally , install itself , and , most particularly start tinkering with the operating system itself .
“ With Vista , Microsoft has begun to think about this , but all Vista folks I 've talked to are running as the administrator ( the super user ) because ‘ it came that way . ’
“ All that has resulted from Microsoft 's ‘ thinking ’ on this issue so far is the ‘ improvement ’
Vista gives with its now infamous warnings ( as hysterically spoofed in the [ Cancel or Allow ] Apple commercial ) as opposed to asking for a password like OS X . ”
“ I 'm not absolutely positive if retail Vista ( the one Grandma will buy ) is running as the administrator , but I have n't heard of people being forced to enter their password , so its seems like it is .
Still .
“ This is like leaving the bank vault wide open but having someone stop you before you go in and say ‘ you are about to enter the bank vault - do you wish to continue ’ and if you say ‘ yes , ’ let you in , regardless of the fact that you 're wearing a ski-mask and are carrying large empty bags .
“ David Pogue from the New York Times goes into more detail . ”
Recruiting Windows PCs for Botnets .
Reader Tristan writes :
“ While I completely agree that the Mac is significantly more secure for all the reasons you 've outlined here , I think it 's a little naive to suggest that the Macs ’ small market share has nothing to do with the lack of malware targeting it .
In the context of how much malware is ‘ targeted ’ at the Mac you ’ve quoted Gohring as saying , ‘ That 's in part because there are fewer Macs in use . ’
“ The key is that she said ‘ in part ’ which I do n't think can be denied .
I 've been a ‘ power user ’ on Macs for close to twenty years and primarily use Windows , Solaris and Linux in my day to day work environment ( although I 'm now running windows in Parallels on my MacBook Pro at work :-) .
“ I have only ever seen malware , worms and viruses on my Windows machines at work .
None of them were ever targeted at the affluence of the user .
At least in my experience the majority of these things are either out to add a machine to a botnet or just cause havoc by either deleting data or making machines reboot every 60 seconds .
“ I 've been subject to an attack on my Mac just recently due to inadvertently leaving myself wide open via an unprotected VNC server .
While this is clearly not a sign of an insecure operating system , ( the fact that I was so open to attack , was attacked and still suffered nothing as a result says a lot for the Mac ) , the nature of the attack speaks volumes .
There are thousands of script kiddies out there building their own botnet armies by downloading and tweaking scripts to own PCs .
“ They are n't out to compromise the machines owned by well - off people to get their credit card details , they 're running scripts that scan a huge range of IP addresses looking for open ports .
I was hit by one that was looking for VNC servers , which it would then use to run a DOS command to download a worm from an ftp server and execute .
Obviously they were n't being executed because it does n't respond to windows commands .
“ Before I realized what was going on , the same attempt would retry every couple of days over a couple of weeks .
Just to reiterate .
Someone had discovered that my machine had a VNC Server running on it that they had gained access to and at no point had any human ever bothered to look at it .
“ These guys are not attacking individuals .
They are n't looking for specific types of machines , operating systems or users .
They 're just playing a numbers game .
With somewhere around 95 % of the machines on the internet running windows , your botnet script is far more likely to find a target if your looking for Windows .
“ If you 're building a botnet army , numbers matter .
If you 're just scanning for a target for your script , numbers matter .
To sum up , I agree that the Mac is vastly more secure than Windows for the reasons you 've outlined in this article , but suggesting that the market share of the Mac is not at least ‘ part ’ of the reason it experiences fewer attacks is unrealistic . ”

So I feel I 've been using my LJ .
Well , I have been , to make lists .
And I make lists because I need a place to shove them so I can refer to them later .
And I 've done a good job of making lists .
But now , the plans is not to make more lists , its to post an actual entry .
I 'm relaxing .
There are more leisure activities that I feel I 'll be getting in touch with this semester .
In fact , I feel I need to get more leisurely this semester or I 'm going to have a heart attack .
I think that college is really stressful , but my personality does not help .
I 'm a " giver , " but it can only continue with the support system .
Really , my life is split like this right now : future ( business / grad school / programs ) , and present ( school / work ) , somewhere in all of this mess I need to fit in the social .
At the same time , I find that the closer I get to this social environment and being leisurely that I 'm withdrawing slowly .
I felt shy today .
Me. Shy .
WTF ?
So we 'll see what my concious is doing as it works .
Also , this a bit more ad - hoc to this semester .
Stop planning and just do .
The plans and framework necessary for efficiency are already in place .
Stop killing yourself over the details .
They do n't matter anyway , right ?
I have an urge to do a few things : graphic arts , music , and poetry .
Oddly enough , this is going to be another album .
I know it already .
I am officially a music artist , I do have an eleven track of experimental music completed - eight original tracks and three remixes .
I think the next one would be experimental - postrock / ambient .
I 'd also like to try my hand at trip hop .
Perhaps that 's a bit further down the line .
For now , let 's work on this artsy crap .
I guess the next step would be to get it on last .fm or something :P
For now , I 'll just probably zip it up and if you want to hear it ... I 'm rapidsharing it now .
LINK : RAPIDSHARE
Anyways .
Music , art and poetry will come together on an album .
I will do some more reading aside from textbooks .
I will accomplish this semester 's work and academic goals .
I will do more after college , including spanish , french and portuguese , and then head to grad school .
I also will not give a shit if I do n't get to do all of these things .
For now , however , it 's the plan .
Tattoos
Once the symbol of nonconformity in a hopelessly conservative political landscape , the tattoo has now become the exact opposite – total conformity posing as nonconformity .
Like when emo kids pretend they ’re all total individuals that nobody understands , but they all somehow manage to look , sound , and act the same .
Tattoos have taken on many different meanings in modern society : men with any sort of oriental symbol tattooed on their arms or torso are generally pretentious , pseudo - political douchebags .
Guys with barbed wire circling their arms tend to be insecure assholes who probably work out a lot , refer to themselves as “ badasses , ” and secretly hate everything about who they are .
Granted , there are still those older men who got tattoos back when they actually meant something , but they are a dying breed in the face of this new wave of tattooed douchebaggery – the men who were getting inked back in the day are forced to watch , horrified , as an entire generation of neo - yuppies singlehandedly steals one of their generational symbols and perverts it beyond all recognition .
Piercings
There was a time when a man could get a bull ring pierced into his septum and get a little respect .
Those days are over .
Piercings of any sort have become the method of self - expression to use for emos , Goths , and faux - punk kids all over the planet ; it appears that the more boring and self - involved one is , the more piercings must result .
Jesus , even women are getting piercings en masse : you find me a chick who does n’t at least have her belly button pierced yet , and I ’ll show you a chick who has n’t yet reached her eighth birthday .
Stabbing people
In the good old days , one guy would get into an argument with another guy , the words would turn into fists , and the fists would turn into a few inches of cold steel getting mercilessly plunged into the eye socket of the weaker guy .
Men would stop , and stare , and as the killer was dragged away by the cops , muttering something about unpaid debts , people would look on in awe – that dude stabbed someone .
What a badass .
But in a time of so - called intellectualism , fraught with political liberalism and progressive ideals , stabbing people is n’t “ cool ” anymore .
Not only is violent crime now frowned upon , but stabbing people generally appears to be the gayest way to shuffle someone off their mortal coil : years of horror movies and bearded historians have established the blade as the number one phallic symbol of violence on earth ( the gun is number two , if only because you ca n’t kill someone simply by forcing a gun up one of their orifices ) , and so it now appears that stabbing people no longer has the manly connotation it once had – and pretty soon , shooting people wo n’t be all that neat either .
The only other option left for the violence - loving man is to either not kill people ( an unacceptable decision , in every way ) or to beat people to death with his bare hands .
Motorcycles
Like the tattoo , the motorcycle used to be a counterculture icon – thanks to Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda ( two actors who have also lost a significant amount of manliness ) , the motorcycle was a symbol of freedom , independence , and rebellion .
Nowadays , it represents one of two things :
- The fact that your mom bought you a Yamaha , which you will almost immediately crash
Or
- You ’re a middle - aged marketing guy who joined a motorcycle club , rides your bike on the weekends , and secretly puts “ Born to be Wild ” or “ Bad to the Bone ” on repeat on your iPod Nano whilst cruising down 6th street at 41 miles an hour next to other similarly repressed middle - aged marketing guys .
Today , the motorcycle has lost literally all of its meaning .
While the Hells Angels still run around raping men and women all over the countryside ( and God bless ‘ em for it ) , the motorcycle has completely lost its status as an icon of masculinity , given that those most likely to own them today are either vapid , mid-40 ’s men trying to channel the spirit of Easy Rider without getting more than a few miles away from home , or spoiled preppy kids who stupidly race their crotch - rockets and end up totaling them once they actually have to turn .
Leather
Enough said .
Chivalry
Whether you like it or not , gone are the days of roses , hastily scrawled love poems , and sweet serenades crooned lovingly outside a fair maiden ’s window .
Today , women may pretend like they want to be courted by a chivalrous gentleman , but in reality the chivalrous man has about as much chance of netting the girl of his dreams as Helen Keller has of winning a darts competition .
Women want a good - looking , arrogant asshole to treat them like crap .
You may think that ’s overly - misogynistic , but it ’s a scientifically proven fact * that once a woman finds out you are attracted to her , her level of attraction towards you drops by at least 50 % .
Chivalry , in all its forms , focuses on the man professing his endless love for the woman whilst doing quasi-romantic deeds – deeds that , today , immediately drive women away .
It ’s an unfortunate trend , to be sure , but an unavoidable one : the chivalrous romantic can write all the love songs and give all the gifts he wants , but outside circumstances aside ( in this case , “ outside circumstances ” means “ money ” ) , the chivalrous man will end up with nothing more than his dick in his hands by the end of the day , while the cocky asshole who lifts weights and / or plays guitar chokes the girl of your dreams to death with his penis .
Special Note
This article is not meant to suggest that any man who might have tattoos or piercings or leather or a motorcycle are immediately unmanly : we simply wish to suggest that the things , the objects themselves , have lost their intrinsic worth as objects of manliness .
If we were to see a 300 pound guy with tattoos and piercings , wearing a leather jacket and holding a knife , we ’d still be very , very scared of him , and would certainly be in no position to doubt his manliness .
One can possess all these pseudo - manly traits and still be the baddest motherfucker around – it ’s just that the actual objects themselves no longer mean what they used to .

正直、最初はあまり便利だと思わなかったのですが、ちょっといいかもと思うようになってきました。例えば
Firefox の拡張機能で、多数の URL からデータをダウンロードする場合を考えてみます。同期的な処理を行うと、ダウンロードが完了するまで
UI をブロックしてしまうため、非同期処理で実装する必要があります。なので、普通はこんな感じで書くことになります。
一般的な書き方 function get_all ( urls ) { if ( urls.length !=
0 ) { // build request var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest ( ) ; xhr.open ( " get " , urls. shift ( ) , true ) ; xhr.onreadystatechange = function ( ) { if ( xhr.readyState == 4 ) { // handle response if ( xhr.status == 200 ) { ... } // initiate next request get_all ( urls ) ; } } ; // send request xhr.send ( null ) ; } }
慣れればどうってことはないのですが、再帰的な処理を行う必要があります。
それに対し、yield を使うと以下のように書くことができます。
yield を使った書き方 function get_all ( urls ) { runnable ( function ( next ) { for ( var i = 0 ; i < urls.length ; i++) { // build request var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest ( ) ; xhr.open ( " get " , urls [ i ] , true ) ; xhr.onreadystatechange = function ( ) { if ( xhr.ready State == 4 ) next ( ) ; } ; xhr.send ( null ) ; // wait for response yield ; // handle response if ( xhr.status == 200 ) { ... } } } ) ; }
再帰呼び出しの必要がなくなりました。すべてのダウンロードが完了するまでスコープの移動がないので、変数の取り回しが楽になります。それにしても協調型の並列処理なんて、もうとっくに墓場送りになっているものだと思っていましたが、まだまだ使う機会があるんですね ( 笑)
なお、復帰条件の設定と yield の呼び出しが分かれていて気持ち悪いという向きには、yield の引数として条件を渡すという手もあります。yield をwait代わりに使っちゃっていいのかなー - outsider reflex は、復帰条件を時間経過に限定するかわりに、そうしているようです。

Thanks to Greg Ewing for inventing and developing Cython 's predecessor Pyrex and for his valuable input in language design decisions .
Financial Contributions : Google and Enthought funded Dag Seljebotn to greatly improve Cython integration with NumPy .
Kurt Smith and Danilo Freitas were funded through the Google Summer of Code program to work on improved Fortran and C++ support respectively , and in 2010 Haoyu Bai was funded to work on Python 3 compatibility .
The latest release of Cython is 3.0 alpha 6 ( released 2020 -08-01 ) .
Cython is available from the PyPI package index repository .
If you still have questions , feel free to send an email to the cython users mailing list .
Aspects of the core development are discussed on the cython core developer mailing list .
If you are unsure which list to use , the cython users list is probably the right one to use , which has the larger audience .
There is also a #cython channel on the freenode IRC servers for Cython related chats .

Making Cython a great programming language for you , and keeping it up to speed with the Python ecosystem and the changing requirements of its diverse user bases , takes a lot of time and dedication .
To support the maintenance and future development of the Cython language and compiler , YOU can sponsor the work of Stefan Behnel via :
All of this makes Cython the ideal language for wrapping external C libraries , embedding CPython into existing applications , and for fast C modules that speed up the execution of Python code .
The Cython language is a superset of the Python language that additionally supports calling C functions and declaring C types on variables and class attributes .
This allows the compiler to generate very efficient C code from Cython code .
The C code is generated once and then compiles with all major C/C++ compilers in CPython 2.6 , 2.7 ( 2.4 + with Cython 0.20.x ) as well as 3.3 and all later versions .
We regularly run integration tests against all supported CPython versions and their latest in - development branches to make sure that the generated code stays widely compatible and well adapted to each version .
PyPy support is work in progress ( on both sides ) and is considered mostly usable since Cython 0.17 .
The latest PyPy version is always recommended here .
Cython gives you the combined power of Python and C to let you
Cython is an optimising static compiler for both the Python programming language and the extended Cython programming language ( based on Pyrex ) .
It makes writing C extensions for Python as easy as Python itself .
What users have to say about Cython :
» You would expect a whole lot of organizations and people to fancy a language that 's about as high - level as Python , yet almost as fast and down - to - the - metal as C .
Add to that the ability to seamlessly integrate with both your existing C/++ codebase and your Python codebase , easily mix very high level abstractions with very low - level machine access ... clear winner . « → Dun Peal on c.l.py
» You guys rock !
In scikit - learn , we have decided early on to do Cython , rather than C or C ++.
That decision has been a clear win because the code is way more maintainable .
We have had to convince new contributors that Cython was better for them , but the readability of the code , and the capacity to support multiple Python versions , was worth it . « → Gaël Varoquaux
» The biggest surprise ( and of course this is Cython 's selling point ) is how simple the interfacing between high level and low level code becomes , and the fact that it is all very robust .
It 's exiciting to see that there are several active projects around that attempt to speed up Python .
The nice thing about Cython is that it does n't give you " half the speed of C " or " maybe nearly the speed of C , 3 years from now " -- it gives the real deal , - O3 C , and it works right now . « → Fredrik Johansson
» SciPy is approximately 50 % Python , 25 % Fortran , 20 % C , 3 % Cython and 2 % C++ …
The distribution of secondary programming languages in SciPy is a compromise between a powerful , performance - enhancing language that interacts well with Python ( that is , Cython ) and the usage of languages ( and their libraries ) that have proven reliable and performant over many decades .
For implementing new functionality , Python is still the language of choice .
If Python performance is an issue , then we prefer the use of Cython followed by C , C++ or Fortran ( in that order ) .
The main motivation for this is maintainability : Cython has the highest abstraction level , and most Python developers will understand it .
C is also widely known , and easier for the current core development team to manage than C++ and especially Fortran . « → Pauli Virtanen et al. , SciPy
» Not to mention that the generated C often makes use of performance tricks that are too tedious or arcane to write by hand , partially motivated by scientific computing ’s constant push .
And through all that , Cython code maintains a high level of integration with Python itself , right down to the stack trace and line numbers .
PayPal has certainly benefitted from their efforts through high - performance Cython users like gevent , lxml , and NumPy .
While our first go with Cython did n’t stick in 2011 , since 2015 , all native extensions have been written and rewritten to use Cython . « → Mahmoud Hashemi
» I'm honestly never going back to writing C again .
Cython gives me all the expressiveness of Python combined with all the performance and close - to - the - metal - godlike - powers of C . I 've been using it to implement high - performance graph traversal and routing algorithms and to interface with C/C++ libraries , and it 's been an absolute amazing productivity boost . « → Andrew Tipton
» A general rule of thumb is that your program spends 80 % of its time running 20 % of the code .
Thus a good strategy for efficient coding is to write everything , profile your code , and optimize the parts that need it .
Python ’s profilers are great , and Cython allows you to do the latter step with minimal effort . « → Hoyt Koepke
» The question was , in auto - generated code , to what extent there were bugs there , to what extent there were bugs in the generators .
The first time I did this , I got lots and lots of warnings from the tool for code generated by both SWIG and Cython [...]
Basically , everything I found Cython emitting was a false positive and a bug in my checker tool [ CPyChecker ] . « → David Malcolm
» Basically , Cython is about 7 x times faster than Boost .
Python , which astonished me . « → Chris Chou
» Using Cython allows you to just put effort into speeding up the parts of code you need to work on , and to do so without having to change very much .
This is vastly different from ditching all the code and reimplementing it another language .
It also requires you to learn a pretty minimal amount of stuff .
You also get to keep the niceness of the Python syntax which may Python coders have come to appreciate . « → Craig Macomber
» If you have a piece of Python that you need to run fast , then I would recommend you used Cython immediately .
This means that I can exploit the beauty of Python and the speed of C together , and that ’s a match made in heaven . « → Stavros
» From 85 seconds ( at the beginning of this post ) down to 0.8 seconds : a reduction by a factor of 100 ... thank you cython ! :-) « → André Roberge
» Writing a full - on CPython module from scratch would probably offer better performance than Cython if you know the quirks and are disciplined .
But to someone who does n't already drip CPython C modules , Cython is a godsend .
Ultimately , there 's 5 commonly used ways ( CPython [ C - API ] , Boost : : Python , SWIG , Cython , ctypes ) to integrate C into Python , and right now you'd be crazy not to give Cython a shot , if that 's your need .
It 's very easy to learn for anyone familiar with both C and Python . « → ashika
» What I loved about the Cython code is that I use a Python list to manage the Vortex objects .
This shows that we can use the normal Python containers to manage objects .
This is extremely convenient . [...]
Clearly , if you are building code from scratch and need speed , Cython is an excellent option .
For this I really must congratulate the Cython and Pyrex developers . « → Prabhu Ramachandran
» I wrote a script that compute a distance matrix ( O^2 ) in Python with Numpy arrays and the same script in Cython .
It took me 10 minutes to figure it out how Cython works and I gained a speed up of 550 times !!!
Amazing « → kfrancoi
» I would like to report on a successful Cython project .
Successful in the sense that it was much faster than all code written by my predecessors mainly because the speed scales almost linearly with the number of cores .
Also , the code is shorter and much easier to read and maintain . [...]
Making it this fast & short & readable & maintainable would have been pretty hard without Cython . « → Alex van Houten
» At work , we ’ve started using Cython with excellent success .
We rewrote one particular Perl script as Cython and achieved a 600 % speed improvement .
As a Perl lover , this was impressive .
We still get all the benefits of Python such as rapid development and clean object - oriented design patterns but with the speed of C. « → Wim Kerkhoff
» The reason that I was interested in Cython was the long calculation times I encountered while doing a multi-variable optimization with a function evaluation that involved solving a differential equation with scipy.integrate.odeint .
By simply replacing the class that contained the differential equation with a Cython version the calculation time dropped by a factor 5 .
Not bad for half a Sunday afternoons work . « → Korbinin
» I was surprised how simple it was to get it working both under Windows and Linux .
I did not have to mess with make files or configure the compiles .
Cython integrated well with NumPy and SciPy .
This expands the programming tasks you can do with Python substantially . « → Sami Badawi
» This is why the Scipy folks keep harping about Cython – it ’s rapidly becoming ( or has already become ) the lingua franca of exposing legacy libraries to Python .
Their user base has tons of legacy code or external libraries that they need to interface , and most of the reason Python has had such a great adoption curve in that space is because Numpy has made the data portion of that interface easy .
Cython makes the code portion quite painless , as well . « → Peter Z. Wang
» Added an optional step of compiling fastavro with Cython .
Just doing that , with no Cython specific code reduced the time of processing 10 K records from 2.9sec to 1.7sec .
Not bad for that little work . « → Miki Tebeka
» fastavro compiles the Python code without any specific Cython code .
This way on machines that do not have a compiler users can still use fastavro .
The end result is a package that reads Avro faster than Java and supports both Python 2 and Python 3 .
Using Cython and a little bit of work th[is ] was achieved without too much effort . « → Miki Tebeka
»... the binding needed to be rewritten , mainly because the current binding is directly written in C++ and is a maintenance nightmare .
This new binding is written in Cython « → Bastien Léonard
» Code generation via Cython allows the production of smaller and more maintainable bindings , including increased compatibility with all supported Python releases without additional burden for NEST developers .
« This approach resulted in a reduction of the code footprint of around 50 % and a significant increase in the cohesiveness of the code related to the Python bindings : whereas previously seven core files and 22 additional files were involved , the new approach requires merely two core files .
The new implementation also removes the compile - time dependency on NumPy and provides numerous additional maintainability benefits by reducing complexity and increasing comprehensibility of the code .
The re-write of the build system also resulted in a 50 % reduction of code , and resolved multiple issues with its usability and robustness .

In conclusion , we hope that through a more widespread use of Cython , neuroscientific software developers will be able to focus their creative energy on refining their algorithms and implementing new features , instead of working to pay off the interest on the accumulating technical debt .

» The Cython version took about 30 minutes to write , and it runs just as fast as the C code — because , why would n’t it ?
It * is * C code , really , with just some syntactic sugar .
And you do n’t even have to learn or think about a foreign , complicated C API … You just , write C. Or C++ — although that ’s a little more awkward .
Both the Cython version and the C version are about 70 x faster than the pure Python version , which uses Numpy arrays .

» I love this project .
Fantastic way to write Python bindings for native libs or speed up computationally intensive code without having to write C yourself .
« → schmichael
» I use a lot of pyrex / cython to bind to libraries - it 's so much faster to code in python .

» Cython saves you from a great many of the gotchas [ that C has ] .
The worst you 'll usually get is a lack of performance gain ( at which point cython - a is your friend ) .

It is hardly news that top officials in the current Justice Department flout the law and make false statements to Congress , but the latest instance may be the most egregious .
When Attorney General Alberto Gonzales wanted the USA Patriot Act renewed in the spring of 2005 , he told the Senate , “ There has not been one verified case of civil liberties abuse . ”
But The Washington Post reported yesterday that just six days earlier , the F.B.I. had sent Mr. Gonzales a report saying that it had obtained personal information it should not have .
This is hardly the first time Mr. Gonzales has played so free and loose with the facts in his public statements and Congressional testimony .
In the United States attorneys scandal — the controversy over the political purge of nine top prosecutors — Mr. Gonzales and his aides have twisted and mutilated the truth beyond recognition .
Congress and the American public need to know all that has gone on at the Justice Department .
But instead of aiding that search for the truth , President Bush is blocking it , invoking executive privilege this week to prevent Harriet Miers , the former White House counsel , and Sara Taylor , a former top aide to Karl Rove , from telling Congress what they know about the purge of federal prosecutors .
Mr. Bush ’s claim is baseless .
Executive privilege , which is not mentioned in the Constitution , is a judge - made right of limited scope , intended to create a sphere of privacy around the president so that he can have honest discussions with his advisers .
The White House has insisted throughout the scandal that Mr. Bush — and even Mr. Gonzales — was not in the loop about the firings .
If that is the case , the privilege should not apply .
In a recent sweep , Saudi authorities arrested the members of seven terrorist cells that were operating within the country .
The cells were receiving assistance from elements outside the country to establish training bases abroad , with the aim of carrying out attacks in Saudi Arabia . [ i ]
After the arrests , senior Saudi officials and columnists expressed criticism of the lapses and failures in the authorities ' handling of the problem of domestic terrorism and extremism , and made recommendations for improvement .
The following are excerpts of the reactions from Saudi officials and the Saudi Press .
Saudi Interior Minister Prince Naif bin Abd Al - ' Aziz : Dealing With Terrorism is Weak on the Ideological Level
Saudi Interior Minister Prince Naif bin Abd Al - ' Aziz criticized the authorities ' lax handling of extremism in Saudi Arabia on the ideological level .
In an interview , he told the London daily Al - Hayat that he was " dissatisfied with the level of activity in the ideological , social , scientific , educational , and media [ areas ] , in dealing with the intentions of the misguided group , and in exposing its plans , which are aimed at causing civil war and destroying the country and its national resources . "
He said that the ideology behind the country 's handling of the problem of terrorism was still " weak , " and " not comparable to the efforts on the security level . " [ ii ]
Similar criticism was voiced by columnist Mamdouh Al - Muhaini , in a column posted on the Al - Arabiyya TV website : " The Saudi Interior Ministry 's recent announcement of the exposure of seven cells that planned to carry out extensive violent operations exposed another aspect of the lax handling of extremism and terrorism on the ideological level .
From the outset , it was clear that the perception underlying the program for fighting terrorism and extremism was flawed , that [ the program 's ] steps were confused , and that it was operating without goals .
" One of the biggest mistakes that reflects the [ program 's ] wrongheaded approach was the distancing of children and the adolescents from the circle of this ideological war [ on terror ] .
From the outset , the assumption was that [ fighting ] terrorism and extremism was [ only ] a matter of distancing the adults , and that adolescents and little ones would not [ have to ] be involved ...
[ It was assumed that ] the important thing was to distance the adults [ from extremism ] ... so that their views would not be passed on to the adolescents .
However , unfortunately , any serious attempt to protect the children and adolescents from adopting ideas that would urge them towards extremism and terrorism has not [ only ] failed , but is [ completely ] nonexistent ... " [ iii ]
The Utter Failure of the Counseling Committees
Other columnists criticized the counseling committees that work in the prisons under the aegis of the Saudi Interior Ministry , with the aim of reeducating security detainees and having them renounce their extremist views . [ iv ]
Columnist Khaled Al - Ghannami wrote in the Saudi daily Al - Watan : " ... Since the appearance of the counseling committees , they have [ tried ] to market to us their paper victories one after another .
[ The committees ] reported that the terrorism problem has been 80 % eliminated , and I do n't know where they get this statistic from .
[ They have also ] reported that the misguided young people [ whom they counsel in the prisons ] have recanted and abandoned their [ the extremist views ] .
However , we are seeing some of them return to and rejoin the path of death , shortly after their release [ from prison ] .
" The counseling committees ... have indeed failed utterly at the task with which they were charged .
They have not fulfilled their duty to extricate the young people from the claws of terrorism , and have not succeeded in refuting the terrorists ' claims and eliminating these [ claims ] completely .
If they had , we would not be seeing new volunteers from among the young people running after the ba'ya [ oath of allegiance ] preachers [ v ] , and [ following ] those who pretend to be the Mahdi [ i.e. Messiah ] , and all those demented people wandering the length and breadth of our Islamic world , from Morocco to Yemen .
Some of them have [ even ] infiltrated the Ka'ba ' compound in order to entice reckless and fervent young people ... with talk about the approaching end of the world , the necessity of jihad ... [ and ] takfir ...
" The discourse on suicide and on abandoning the cares of day - to - day life for Paradise and beautiful girls is very tempting for young people – in contrast to what is presented to them by members of the counseling committees , who give them nothing meaningful . " [ vi ]
In a similar vein , columnist Muhammad Al - ' Athim wrote , also in Al - Watan : " ... The counseling [ committees ] and the call to examine the Al - Sakinah [ campaign ] are not helping the problem of the spreading breeding grounds [ of extremism ] .[ vii ]
Their openings must be blocked and their caves must be exposed .
" It is strange that , although some of these breeding grounds can be clearly seen , we are forbidden to speak of them openly , because they are connected with good preaching for belief in Islam and with the righteous believers who are in charge of that preaching , such as charity associations ... the associations for memorization of the Koran ... meeting places for the pupils of the clerics , and the supreme preachers who are known in society ... who have no connection to this [ misguided ] group [ i.e. extremists ] .
All these are places for [ doing ] good in the Saudi Islamic tradition .
However , there are those who use them to hide , [ to obtain ] funding [ for terrorism ] , and to work in abhorrent secrecy against the residents and the homeland . " [ viii ]
" The Biggest Lie that Has Spread [ in Saudi Arabia ] is that the Ideology of Takfir and Terrorism Come From Outside [ the Country ] "
Shura Council member and Justice Ministry legal advisor Sheikh Abd Al - Muhsin Al - ' Obikan stated that the sources of terrorism must be eliminated .
He said , " Those who think that terrorism is only attacks are wrong , as terrorism has sources , [ and those sources ] are takfir and extremism .
Extremists are abundant ... and among us there are quite a few extremists who practice takfir [ as well ] .
Likewise , books calling for terrorism and takfir are [ openly ] for sale in Saudi Arabia .
Even if they do not explicitly instruct [ the reader ] to carry out terrorist acts , they call to it by takfir and by extremism . " [ ix ]
Columnist Abdallah Al - Mutairi wrote in Al - Watan that the reasons for domestic Saudi terrorism emanated from problems within the country : " The biggest lie that has spread [ in Saudi Arabia ] is that the ideology of takfir and terrorism come from outside [ the country ] .
As long as we reiterate such statements , we will remain [ like ] someone who carries a scorpion in his pocket and does not acknowledge that it is there ...
The first step in handling this war [ against extremism ] is acknowledging that the scorpion is among us , both the [ scorpion itself ] and its venom ...
We must acknowledge that we are also part of the mistake .
The terrorism is from within – both the individuals [ who carry it out ] and the [ extremist ] ideology [ that feeds it ] ... "
Al - Mutairi continued , " In the context of the events at the Al - Yamama college , I saw many young people who were clearly ready to become the next cadre of terrorism and to do anything to please their leaders . [ x ]
These young people were not the product of mujahideen camps in Afghanistan or Chechnya , but a home - grown product – [ a product ] of the era in which terrorism has struck Saudi Arabia in several places . " [ xi ]
There is Urgent Need for Reform in the Saudi Education System and Religious Institutions
Some columnists called for reform in the education system and religious institutions , which , they said , are fostering extremism .
Columnist Abdallah bin Bajad Al - ' Utaibi wrote in the Saudi daily Al - Riyadh : " In our society there is [ a type of ] discourse that generates hatred wherever it is found ...
There are schoolteachers , imams in the mosques , preachers , and jurisprudents who do nothing but spread hatred and takfir in our society .
They should be prosecuted for their actions , which lay down the foundations for terrorism .
" The hate industry in our society operates in the open , directed by people whose names are known and who carry out their actions in public .
[ These people ] issue fatwas of takfir in [ complete ] disregard of [ the views of ] the leading national thinkers and policy [ makers ] , and sign [ these fatwas ] with their [ real ] names .
They fill the hearts of the youth , who follow them blindly , with hostility and hatred towards many of the civil society institutions ...
" The most urgent need is to launch a religious reform in the mosques , in the curricula , in the selection of teachers and in the religious and social institutions .
This process must be implemented with the speed of an emergency plan , without delays , disagreements and postponements , if we truly want to protect our country , our society and ourselves against the evil of these new devils . " [ xii ]
Tareq Al - Humaid , editor of the London daily Al - Sharq Al - Awsat , likewise criticized the education and religious institutions in Saudi Arabia : " Parents must protect their children not only from drugs and [ delinquency ] , but from ideological aberrations ...
It is not enough to send them to school .
How many parents have ever filed a complaint against a teacher ?
How many of us have ever filed a complaint when we felt that the Friday sermon [ in the mosque ] sounded like [ a program on ] Al - Jazeera ?...
" When I returned from Washington [ to Saudi Arabia ] ...
I enrolled my children in a multinational school in Jeddah , so that they would not face the difficulty of shifting from one curriculum to another .
[ One day ] my daughter asked me : ' Is it true that the Jews are descended from apes ? '
I asked her : ' Who told [ you ] that ? '
She replied : ' The teacher ' ...
And this is not even a state school .
It is a private school with an international curriculum and non-Saudi teachers who teach in English ....
" In another case [ I heard about ] , a man asked an imam to help him persuade his son not to go [ fight in ]
Iraq , and found out , to his surprise , that it was the imam who had convinced his son to go [ there ] in the first place , instead of reporting [ the son ] to the authorities ...
What has happened to [ parents ' ] responsibility towards their children ?...
Why do we follow those who spread hatred for other peoples ?...
Why is progress in education regarded as [ negative emulation of ] the West ?...
Why are [ people ] who interpret things rationally accused of being enemies of religion ?...
Who gave [ the Islamists ] the right to [ proclaim ] some people apostates and others saints ?
How long will we continue to deny [ these things ] and to blame the other [ for our problems ] ?...
We see terrorism raging in the world , and we know who is responsible for it ... " [ xiii ]
In an article in the Saudi daily Al - Yawm , titled " The Classroom Should Not Be the Teacher 's Playground , " columnist Fahd bin Suleiman Al - Shkairan wrote of a child whose teacher told him that he must become a jihad fighter and fight the infidels at every opportunity .
In connection with this story , Al - Shkairan criticized teachers who use the classroom to spread extremist ideas , saying : " Many teachers need to be re-educated in all areas and [ must ] adopt an entirely new image ...
To this end , we must establish a large center to train a new kind of teacher , [ considering that ] the teachers spend [ so ] many hours with our children [ every day ] ... " [ xiv ]
There is a Need for a National Center for Fighting Terrorism
Dr. Nasser Al - Hujailan , columnist and lecturer at King Saud University , suggested launching an anti-terrorism program to fight extremism in Saudi Arabia .
In an article in Al - Riyadh , he wrote : " We must give some practical thought to formulating long - term and short - term national plans for confronting terrorism , fighting it , and eliminating it as far as possible .
One of the most important and useful projects is the establishment of a national center for fighting terrorism that will have the supreme authority [ in this area ] and will be in responsible for education , research , formulation of [ anti- terrorism ] programs and for monitoring and evaluating [ anti- terrorism ] efforts .
" One of the major tasks that this center might undertake is to investigate the situation [ on the ground ] and expose the elements that foster terrorism ...
Then , [ it can ] formulate a work - plan based on objective data rather than on conjecture .
For example , [ the center can investigate the assumption ] ... that the curriculum [ in Saudi schools ] fosters monolithic thinking and implicitly encourages extremism while discouraging critical thought ...
" The National Center for Fighting Terrorism will be able to form study groups that will investigate the education [ system ] : the curricula , the teachers , the teaching methods , the [ educational ] activities and their effect on the pupils ...
With the objective findings [ of these studies ] ... a new curriculum can be formulated in order to raise the level of [ Saudi ] education ... " [ xv ]

SAIC said Riza 's subcontract lasted from April 25 to May 31 , 2003 .
She was paid expenses but no salary during her trip to Iraq , at her request , according to the contractor .
[ NOTE :
The article does n't make it clear whether she was paid a salary for the portion of time under the contract in which she was n't actually in Iraq , but was presumably drafting whatever report she prepared -- if she actually prepared one . ]
Melissa Koskovich , a spokeswoman for SAIC , said the contractor " had no role in the selection of the personnel who comprised the Iraq Governance Group under this contract . "
Defense sources said the Pentagon was reviewing the matter .
I 'd be fascinated to know who , other than Ms. Riza , constituted the " Iraq Governance Group , " and what work product Ms. Riza actually delivered .
It 's not enough that Wolfowitz had a major role in leading this country into an unnecessary war that I think may well turn out to be the most serious foreign policy blunder in this country 's history .
No , he could n't leave bad enough alone , but had to get his girlfriend a job planning the most screwed - up occupation and transfer to a new government in perhaps the entire history of military occupations .
I 've got a suggestion for Mr. Wolfowitz : After you get fired by the World Bank , why do n't you and your honey move to Baghdad and form your little love nest somewhere outside the Green Zone , where you can have lots of togetherness while living in the middle of the great success that you 've created ?
Maybe the Iraqis will be so impressed by this great love affair between a Jewish man and an Arab Muslim woman that they 'll realize the foolishness of their silly sectarian quarrels , and Iraq will become the shining beacon of tolerance and democracy that you told us it would be .
Of course , things might not turn out that way , but since you 're willing to take big risks with other people 's lives , I 'm sure you wo n't hesitate to take some risks with your own .
Two weeks ago , my friend Jay Weintraub and I give a presentation at the AD : TECH Chicago Conference entitled A Crash Course on the Digital Marketing Vendor Landscape .
During the course of that presentation , I talked about MySpace along with Intermix , a public company which owned 53 % of the stock of MySpace .
I mentioned that I thought MySpace was one of the most interesting companies to look at , because the business model had the potential to be every bit as significant in terms of social impact as Yahoo , Amazon , eBay , and Google have been .
I felt that MySpace allowed people to connect in fundamentally new ways , and had the ability to change the infrastructure of our society in a truly significant manner .
Last week , it was announced that Intermix and MySpace would be acquired by Fox Interactive Media ( a subsidiary of Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp ) for $ 580 million , adding more than $ 70 million to Intermix 's market capitalization .
By 2002 , Internet usage extended deeply into socio-economic circles outside of the professional business world .
That year , a new social network site called Friendster was launched by Jonathan Abrams , with some elements similar to the sixdegrees.com model .
While the participants on sixdegrees.com seemed to be primarily white - collar business professionals , Friendster had a broad appeal to many other segments of our society .
Friendster was COOL , and quickly reached many millions of registered users , each with an individual profile in the system that they could use to meet and network with others .
Young adults loved it , and started spending the majority of their free time networking on Friendster .
Friendster seemed to have an unbeatable competitive advantage in owning a potentially highly lucrative new market .
I immediately recognized the tremendous potential of sixdegrees .
com 's business model and that what they were doing offered revolutionary prospects for creating new ways in which people could connect and interact in our society .
Nonetheless , sixdegrees.com failed to gain sufficient traction as a business , and shut down in 2001 .
Sixdegrees.com failed for a number of reasons : 1 ) web technology was not yet sufficiently mature to support the kind of rich features that were ultimately necessary to make this type of application succeed ; 2 ) they failed to reach a critical mass of users before their money ran out ; 3 ) they failed to recognize what features would be successful in keeping members engaged with the sixdegrees.com brand ; 4 ) they were impacted by a post - April 2000 recession , later further exacerbated by 9/11 , and those events struck at the core of their ability to find advertising revenue ; and 5 ) the online advertising industry was not mature enough to provide sufficient advertisers supporting their business model .
Of all of these factors , it is most likely the last two that in the end were the largest factors in sixdegrees .
com 's demise .
In late 1998 my friends Joe Andrieu and Christine Harmel introduced me to a web site called sixdegrees.com .
You 've surely heard of the six degrees of separation concept - where everyone on the planet is supposedly connected to each other through no more than six people .
Well , they had n't quite connected the whole world yet , but there were over a million people participating in sixdegrees.com , and over 900,000 of them were connected in one giant chain by the time I joined .
Sixdegrees.com attempted to develop new types of connections among its members to build a rich online community .

Something truly extraordinary has been happening in the online world over the past two years , but unless you are between the ages of sixteen and twenty - five , you probably do n't even know about it .
But that wo n't last much longer .
In late 1998 my friends Joe Andrieu and Christine Harmel introduced me to a web site called sixdegrees.com .
You 've surely heard of the six degrees of separation concept - where everyone on the planet is supposedly connected to each other through no more than six people .
Well , they had n't quite connected the whole world yet , but there were over a million people participating in sixdegrees.com , and over 900,000 of them were connected in one giant chain by the time I joined .

Of all of these factors , it is most likely the last two that in the end were the largest factors in sixdegrees .
com 's demise .
After sixdegrees.com , there were many other online social networks launched , both for personal networking and business networking .
Ryze and LinkedIn are two of the better known business networking sites .
In neither case do I find the business model to be terribly exciting , nor have I found them to actually be useful for productive networking purposes .
By 2002 , Internet usage extended deeply into socio-economic circles outside of the professional business world .
That year , a new social network site called Friendster was launched by Jonathan Abrams , with some elements similar to the sixdegrees.com model .
While the participants on sixdegrees.com seemed to be primarily white - collar business professionals , Friendster had a broad appeal to many other segments of our society .
Friendster was COOL , and quickly reached many millions of registered users , each with an individual profile in the system that they could use to meet and network with others .
Young adults loved it , and started spending the majority of their free time networking on Friendster .
Friendster seemed to have an unbeatable competitive advantage in owning a potentially highly lucrative new market .
But then during the last half of 2003 , the unbelievable happened .
Friendster completely dropped the ball .
While the folks running Friendster were busy negotiating deals with venture capitalists , they stopped listening to their users .
The site slowed down under a heavy user load to the point where it became virtually impossible to use and navigate .
The management of the company completely failed to understand how to evolve the site to improve it and serve the needs of its user base .
As Friendster withered and ground to a halt , along came MySpace , a social networking company that did virtually everything right .
I discovered MySpace almost immediately upon its launch in late 2003 , and it was clear that they were attempting to do extraordinary things .
While they started out looking pretty much like a Friendster clone , in short time the differences were apparent .
Here are some examples of the things that MySpace has done right :
While the " Space " in MySpace refers to cyberspace rather than outer space , the principals of the company clearly exercised " rocket scientist " type creativity in building their business .
They designed their service to maximize the degree of creativity that their users would be able to enjoy in customizing " their space " on the Internet frontier .
MySpace embraced a love of music and music fandom that its core audience ( primarily Generation Y individuals in the 16 - 25 age range ) is strongly passionate about .
MySpace 's tie in to the world of music has enabled it create a degree of passion amongst its users that is usually reserved for rock bands .
MySpace designed their business to continually talk to , listen to and solicit feedback from their users .
MySpace understood that creating a community means more than just getting lots of people to sign up and create profiles .
They had to provide the tools to allow them to interact in rich ways while online .
They have continually improved their service and added new features and new ways to interact .
MySpace made a decision not to try to be everything to everyone ...
MySpace is very coarse , and much of the content on the site would be offensive to many in our society .
But from its inception , MySpace decided not to censor any content except for explicit nudity and hate speech .
And the " wild wild west " edginess of MySpace is a large part of its appeal to those that love it and spend much of their lives interacting with others through it .
While the appeal of MySpace extends to many well beyond its core audience in terms of age , it is also worth noting that there are many for whom MySpace will hold no appeal whatsoever , and it is most certainly not an appropriate place for those under the age of sixteen .
If MySpace had tried to be something for everyone , it would most likely have failed to be anything to anyone !
By May of this year , MySpace had reached around 20 million registered profiles , it was adding an average of more than 75,000 new profiles to its system each day , and it had reportedly surpassed Google and Hotmail to become the fifth most active site on the Web in terms of page views per month ( according to comScore Media Metrix ) .
Two weeks ago , my friend Jay Weintraub and I give a presentation at the AD : TECH Chicago Conference entitled A Crash Course on the Digital Marketing Vendor Landscape .
During the course of that presentation , I talked about MySpace along with Intermix , a public company which owned 53 % of the stock of MySpace .

Jay wrote an article last week for the publication DM Confidential that discusses the rise of MySpace in more detail .
I am pleased to have permission to include Jay 's article here for our Apogee readers .
Ian Edmonds has come up with a plan to use the powerful current to float massive sacks of fresh water 1600 kilometres south along the Queensland coast , from the Tully River south of Cairns to Tugun at the Gold Coast .
The journey would take about 20 days and each membrane would need towing into shore before being emptied into the Southern Regional Water Pipeline for pumping around South - East Queensland .
The 60 million litre reinforced plastic membranes would be roughly the size of the infamous Pasha Bulker bulk carrier .
However , instead of sitting above the water , the sacks would be almost completely submerged .
" What you 're doing with the bags is you 're simply enclosing the water , not supporting the water and because the density of fresh water is slightly less than the density of sea water , the entire bulk of the thing is 97 per cent submerged with only three per cent sitting above the water , " Dr Edmonds says .
He believes this would leave the membrane unaffected by wind and safe to stay with the current .
Each vessel would cost $ 600,000 and the total cost of the proposal would come close to $ 30 million .
Dr Edmonds said that made more financial sense than the multi-billion dollar cost of a plan to build a pipeline from the Burdekin River in North Queensland to Brisbane , or expensive desalination plants .
" The running cost of this scheme is low as the water used is pristine river water .
( It ) is transported the 1600 km by the East Australian Current for essentially no cost with only 90 km towing distance for transport between the current and the coast , " he says .
CSIRO research scientist David Griffin says the idea has merit , but needs tweaking .
" This is just a more sophisticated use of ocean currents , " Dr Griffin says .
" You 're using ( the current ) as a motive power but you can't just go in the direction of slavishly going with it , which just means a little bit of application of some sort of power at critical points . "
The EAC is the largest ocean current close to any coast of Australia .
From its source in the Coral Sea , it moves masses of tropical water south down the Australian coastline to the temperate regions , with ocean eddies peeling off into the Tasman Sea along the way .
However , winds within 10 nautical miles of the shore can slow down and even reverse the current and Dr Griffin believes that makes some sort of small propulsion power necessary .
" You need the little bit of intelligent intervention at strategic times to make sure the bag gets from A to B , " he says .
University of Queensland civil engineering expert Tom Baldock also agreed Dr Edmonds ' idea was feasible .
" The variability of the current might need to be taken into account but it certainly runs down this far and it makes sense to use the current , " Dr Baldock says .
" The key thing is keeping track of them and making sure if something happens they can be recovered . "
Dr Edmonds concedes there is some potential for a stream of submerged membranes to become a shipping hazard , but believes fitting them with light and radio beacons would make them traceable to within a few metres .
Dr Griffin also raises environmental concerns about " masses of plastics sloshing around " on the Great Barrier Reef should a membrane float off course and shag on the coral .
" The bags would have to be fairly strong and that would break reefs and no one would allow that to happen . "
Dr Edmonds acknowledges the potential hazard but says a large sheet of plastic is much easier to retrieve from a reef than an oil tanker .
" In the case of the Pasha Bulker , for example , you 've got a real problem there because you end up with a very big steel vessel sitting on the reef and there 's nothing you can do about it .
" But if you 've got a membrane that weighs 20 tonnes then that 's easy to retrieve . "
Dr Edmonds says he sent the proposal to a number of state government departments over the last couple of days and was eagerly awaiting their feedback .
" You 've got to weigh up the situation ; if you really want to use river water you 've got to use it somehow . "
He also believes his Northern Rivers plan is a wise alternative over the long term .
" Given the fact that the drying trend in South - East Australia is related to climate change , the use of high - emission desalination plants would seem to be very counterproductive .
" The technology of this proposal could be readily exported to anywhere in the world where there is a need for fresh water and there is a favourable ocean current connecting to a river supply , however distant that supply may be . "
It took weeks , for instance , to choose among a multitude of paint toxicity standards that local governments have set around the country .
( Home Depot said it chose the strictest standard , set in Southern California . )
For now , most Eco Options products rely on independent certifications like Energy Star , which measure energy efficiency and is run by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy .
Even though Energy Star is a widely accepted barometer for how much electricity a refrigerator or washing machine uses , it does not measure other factors , like how much energy was used to make the appliance in the first place or whether the manufacturer used recycled materials and encouraged its product to be recycled at the end of its life .
Home Depot is working with Scientific Certification Systems , a private company based in Emeryville , Calif. , that audits and certifies company claims , to develop new broad - based standards .
They will grade a product based on its environmental record over its entire life cycle — including the sustainability of its production process , its efficiency and longevity and how it can be recycled when it is no longer useful .
But until some kind of standard can be worked out , Mr. Jarvis and his team are forced to work their way through the thicket of claims .
They are currently considering a rug that is made out of corn fiber instead of nylon , one that the manufacturer is heralding as a natural , earth - friendly product .
Corn is natural , Mr. Jarvis acknowledged , but he said he was concerned about the buildup of phosphates in the Gulf of Mexico coming off the Mississippi River from corn farming , as well as the fuel it takes to run the tractors in corn fields and to transport the corn .

Last Sunday , the Walnut Creek resident marched near the front of the antiwar demonstration through San Francisco .
Slowly , the peace movement is starting to see a few active duty or inactive reservists like Ergo come forward and publicly oppose the war .
This month , an career Air Force chief master sgt .
wrote an op -ed in Stars and Stripes opposing the war .
But they 're a different breed from the fraggers and " F -- the Army " forebearers who opposed the Vietnam War .
In the past month , more than 1,700 have signed an " Appeal for Redress " - - a legally politic way of opposing the war .
The Iraq Veterans Against the War is getting 10 new members a week , still tiny .
But in January , they decided to increase their outreach efforts to active duty vets .
Much of this reticence is because this war is being fought by volunteers , men like Ergo take pains to say that they love the military , are proud of their service and do n't mean to disrespect their comrades by opposing the war .
But Ergo has been out since July 2005 ; what 's taken him so long to come forward ?
He suffers from PTSD , the signature wound of this war .
He had to put his life together before he could sort out his feelings about the war .

THE DISILLUSIONED . / Conflict in Iraq : Some active duty troops , while proud to serve , are speaking out and signing a petition against the war 1 / 3 Back to Gallery
Mike Ergo is a 23 - year - old honorably discharged Marine who fought in Fallujah .
A tattoo on the inside of his left forearm depicts the first insurgent he killed in Iraq .
A tattoo on his right arm reads : " Born to Fight . "
He loves the Marines , is proud of what he and his colleagues did overseas and is on inactive ready reserve through July 2009 .
Yet a few weeks ago , the Walnut Creek native marched near the front of the anti-war demonstration that rolled through San Francisco .
Yeah , he said , it felt odd to march among the 9/11 conspiracy theorists and socialists .
Still , Ergo said he'd march again to underscore his opposition to U.S. foreign policy in Iraq and would try to bring more than the handful of Iraq War veterans who demonstrated with him last month .
But Ergo knows that the number of soldiers who publicly oppose the war is likely to remain small for now .
A chief reason :
Unlike the men drafted into military service during the Vietnam War , those fighting in Iraq are volunteers and feel obligated to be patriotic defenders of post - 9/11 soil .
Yet a few signs of dissent are appearing in the military aside from conscientious objectors and newly realized pacificists .
Last month , a career chief master sergeant in the Air Force wrote an opinion piece in the military newspaper Stars and Stripes opposing the war , and a busload of retired veterans and civilian activists toured military bases in the South , hoping to coax more support from active duty soldiers .
Over the past month , more than 1,700 soldiers have signed an online Appeal for Redress -- www.appealforredress.org -- a legally sanctioned way for members of the military to oppose the war .
A couple of underground publications like GI Special at www.militaryproject.org, have sprung up online , and supportive troops have clandestinely dropped hard copies inside military barracks .
Last week , retired Marine Corps Lt. Col.
Andrew Horne , who served in the Persian Gulf two years ago , rebutted President Bush 's weekly radio address .
Said Horne : " The commander - in - chief has failed to properly lead the troops , and previous Congresses did n't ask the tough questions or demand accountability .
The result is the mess we are in today . "
These inside - the - fortress expressions of opposition are almost always prefaced with words of respect for the military , of their comrades ' patriotic service to their country .
This rhetorical approach is far different from the widespread protests and defiant sloganeering of the '60s and ' 70s .
By the Vietnam War 's end , more than 100 underground newspapers were published by anti-war soldiers , and thousands of soldiers had participated in peace demonstrations .
Peaceniks established a network of off - base coffeehouses in military towns , giving GIs and peace activists a place to interact casually and foment more opposition to the war .
While opinion polls today show that a majority of Americans oppose the war , " 95 percent of Americans have n't been touched by the war .
It 's not that they do n't care , " said Air Force Chief Master Sgt. Jeff Slocum , who wrote the Stars and Stripes opinion column supporting the online petition against the war .
But few uniformed opponents have surfaced .
Iraq Veterans Against the War , an organization for uniformed opposition , gets only 10 new members a week .
The 1,700 - plus vets who signed the online petition are a fraction of the 1.5 million who have been deployed in the war on terrorism .
" It would be a tremendous boost to have more active duty demonstrating , " said Cherie Eichholz , a veteran and an organizer with Veterans for Peace , " because they have firsthand knowledge of what 's going on over there on the ground , and they have a credibility with the public because of their service . "
Eichholz , who volunteered for the Army after the Sept. 11 attacks and was discharged after being injured in training , said some vets ' peace groups are changing their strategy .
Last month , she was part of a convoy of 25 activists and retired vets who toured military bases in the South as part of a trial effort to aggressively court uniformed opponents .
They handed out 5,000 copies of the Appeal for Redress and got a few dozen returned in days .
The document states : " As a patriotic American proud to serve the nation in uniform , I respectfully urge my political leaders in Congress to support the prompt withdrawal of all American military forces and bases from Iraq .
Staying in Iraq will not work and is not worth the price . "
The numbers might seem minuscule , Eichholz said , but she is encouraged by the hundreds of off - duty conversations she has had with young soldiers -- so much so that her organization is planning four similar caravans to tour towns near U.S. militaryinstallations this summer .
But the limited expression of anti-war support among the military " just shows that the overwhelming majority of guys are in favor of the mission in Iraq , " said Navy Lt. Jason Nichols .
An information technology specialist stationed in Iraq , Nichols is asking soldiers to sign an online petition called Appeal for Courage , www .
appealforcourage.org , that supports the mission and opposes the Redress appeal .
" Most of them ( who oppose the war ) ca n't answer the question : So what do we do now ? "
Speaking out can be costly , especially for career soldiers .
Two weeks after he wrote the Stars and Stripes column , Slocum decided to retire in October , long before he had planned .
" I got to thinking that I do n't know if I can continue to wear two hats , " said Slocum , 41 , a veteran of 21 years in the service who is stationed near Fayetteville , N.C.
He began opposing the war after disclosures that the United States went to war based on faulty intelligence .
His peers told him to find a way to support the war .
" That would be OK , " he said , " if I did n't know what I already know . "
Ergo , the Marine , believes another factor is behind this reticence :
Many returning soldiers are still too overwhelmed with the effects of post - traumatic stress syndrome , one of the war 's signature wounds -- including him .
Ergo was diagnosed with the condition shortly after leaving the service in 2005 .
For months after he returned home , a never - ending clip of the men he saw die and of those he killed reeled through his mind .
He enrolled in Diablo Valley College , but within months he was missing class .
He 'd start driving to school , then turn around , afraid of the people he'd have to deal with there .
" It was this impending sense of something big was about to happen , " he said .
" The feeling I 'd got when we were about to go into combat .
I was afraid of dealing with people who would say something against the war , or make me angry .
I was afraid of flipping out and maybe hurting someone . "
He began regularly seeing a counselor last fall and began feeling better .
At the same time , he began to read more about the government 's reasons for invading Iraq .
He started communicating with vets he found on a MySpace page for the Iraq Veterans Against the War .
" It 's hard enough to deal with the experiences that went on in Iraq , let alone to have opinions on it , " Ergo said .
" When people come back , they 'd rather just move on and not remember all that stuff .
And not try to live in the past .
" And if you do n't live by a vet center , you might just sit around , listen to music and drink .
It can definitely be a downward spiral , " he said .
His opinion of the war changed shortly after November 2004 , when he was involved in fierce house - to - house searches for insurgents in Fallujah .
He would kick in doors and often see an insurgent shooting at him from close range .
Iraqi women and children would walk down the street , and insurgents would maneuver among the citizens , using them as shields .
The tension was emotionally exhausting .
" You 're spending your days driving around the highways looking for people who are hiding , and they blow you up from a mile away with a remote detonator , " he said .
" Or they shoot at you from a building and put their weapon down and walk through the streets .
And if you kill someone , you could potentially turn that town against you whether it 's justified or not . "
He came out publicly against the war after returning home .
" I was turned off by the apathy of all the people in this area , Walnut Creek , and other upper - middle - class communities who thought things were going fine or are so removed from the war , " he said .
" Like the people I was going to school with ( Diablo Valley College ) were just worried about what 's on " TRL , " MTV's " Total Request Live " program .
Ergo plans to talk about his experience in schools and to speak before other organizations .
He is not a counter - recruiter ; he urges people to " do their research " before they enlist .
And he understands that many active duty soldiers wo n't speak out .
" They do n't want to be associated with a movement they see as entirely leftist or irrational or hippies from Berkeley or San Francisco , " he said .
" But once people see us on the news , maybe they 'll say , ' Hey , that guy has a short haircut , he looks like he could still be in .
He wears tucked - in shirts .
He does n't have long hair . ' "
Ergo does n't have to look far to see his own wounds from the war .
The man whose face flashes in his mind is tattooed on his left forearm .
It reminds him how much he and other soldiers -- and Iraqis -- have sacrificed in this war .
" I have to see it , " Ergo said .
" So I want everyone else to see it , too . "
Shameless Mammals Horny Hedgehogs Spark Police Callout
Two hedgehogs triggered a nocturnal police operation in Germany this week after the spiky little mammals awoke neighbors with their loud , shameless mating .
They went on fornicating even as a crowd gathered to watch them .
In fact the attention made them even more vigorous .

Princess Diana was " almost certainly " nine to ten weeks pregnant when she died , it has been claimed .
French investigative journalist Chris Laffaille says he uncovered evidence of the pregnancy from official archives of the Paris hospital where the princess was taken after the crash on the night of August 31 , 1997 .
If genuine , says Laffaille , it would mean Diana 's unborn child would not have been fathered by Dodi Fayed because she had not met him nine weeks before her death .

Instead , he said , the baby may have been conceived while she was seeing London doctor Hasnat Khan .
Laffaille makes the claim despite a categoric statement by John Burton , former royal coroner present at the post - mortem examination on Diana , who said : " She was n't pregnant .
I have seen into her womb . "
Laffaille , a former reporter with the magazine Paris Match , says he has conducted a detailed re-examination of all the evidence surrounding the crash .
The resulting book , Diana : The Inquiry They Never Published , is being released on August 27 .
It is being described as one of many attempts to cash in ten years after Diana 's death but it also revives conspiracy theories that have plagued the investigation into how she died .

Laffaille agrees with the verdict of the official French inquiry in the crash , that Diana and Dodi were the victims of a high speed drink - driving accident .
But he also says there are still " many unanswered questions " surrounding the death , especially the issue of whether Diana was pregnant .
He said : " It is a near certainty that Diana was nine to ten weeks pregnant at the time she died , according to papers from the Paris Public Hospitals archives .
" The letter dated August 31 , 1997 , was sent to the then minister of the interior Jean - Pierre Chevenement , and copies sent to health minister Bernard Kouchner , foreign affairs minister Hubert Vedrine and the Paris police chief Martine Monteil . "

Laffaille added : " This document has never been claimed or proved to be a fake . "
However , a spokesman for the Paris Public Hospitals last night dismissed the letter as a forgery , which had first been circulated shortly after Diana 's death .
" Examination of this document has established with absolute certainty that it is a fake , " he said .
" It is ridiculous .
Many of the medics who treated Diana remain at the hospital , and all deny the claims contained in this forged letter . "
Accident caused by out of control sewer
This week , the faculty council at the university approved a no-confidence resolution against President John Fallon III by a vote of 22 - to - 4 and called for his firing .
The university ’s Board of Regents may soon decide Mr. Fallon ’s fate .
On Feb. 23 , a 20 - year - old student at Eastern Michigan , Orange Taylor III , was arrested by the campus police and charged with murder and criminal sexual conduct .
Mr. Taylor , who is awaiting trial , had become a suspect in January after a security camera showed him entering the dorm early on the morning Ms. Dickinson was believed to have been killed .
DNA analysis showed it was his semen in the room , the police said .
“ They kept telling us there was no cause for alarm , ” said Asia David , 20 , who lived a few floors above Ms. Dickinson .
“ We were sleeping through this girl being murdered in her room .
It just seems like they were really holding stuff back from us . ”
The Board of Regents ordered an independent investigation in March by a law firm .
A 568 - page report , released June 8 , revealed that the vice president of student affairs , the public safety chief and the university ’s communications office had known that Ms. Dickinson ’s death was probably a homicide but had kept the information secret .
The law firm also said that a police document containing lurid details about the crime scene was ordered shredded by James Vick , the vice president for student affairs .
Ms. Dickinson had been found spread - eagled on the floor , naked from the waist down , a pillow covering her face and semen on her leg .
Mr. Vick has been on paid administrative leave since early March .
He said he had become the “ designated scapegoat . ”
His lawyer said Mr. Vick had the document shredded because he believed police did not want certain facts about the crime to become public .
Firefighters undercut Giuliani's ' urban legend '
Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday July 11 , 2007 Print This Email
This Nearly everyone has seen the footage of Rudy Giuliani on 9/11 and in the days immediately afterwards , acting decisive , examining the wreckage , calming a city and a nation .
Giuliani has done everything in his power to brandish his reputation as " America 's Mayor , " and he 's cashed in on the persona , politically and financially .
New York firefighters who were at the World Trade Center when it collapsed and family members of those who did n't make it out released a video aimed at shattering what they 're calling Giuliani's " urban legend . "
" He 's running on his 9/11 leadership , and it was lacking and there was none , " FDNY Deputy Chief Jim Riches says in the video , which was released Wednesday by the International Association of Firefighters ' political action committee .
The firefighters blame Giuliani for buying the department radios that were known to malfunction .
When department commanders gave an order to evacuate the north tower of the World Trade Center , but firefighters were unable to hear the order because of the faulty radios and died in the building , the video alleges .
Firefighters had nearly an hour to get out of the building after the first call came through at 9:32 a.m. , at the same time New York police officers were evacuating the building .
" Not a single cop was lost in that building .
Why was that ? " asked retired Chief of Safety Alexander Santora .
" Because they had gotten the word to get out .
Our radios were n't working . "
The firefighters say Giuliani was disgraceful in telling the 9/11 Commission that firefighters died in the building because they ignored the evacuation order .
The video also attacks the former mayor for putting his emergency command center at Building 7 of the World Trade Center , which was known to be a terrorist target since it was first attacked in 1993 .
In the aftermath of the terror attacks , firefighters set to recovering those who had been lost , but the video implies that Giuliani was concerned only with recovering $ 200 million worth of gold .
He ordered recovery efforts to stop as soon as the gold was recovered , while 242 firefighters and countless other civilians remained buried in the rubble , according to the video .
Giuliani's campaign issued a response to the firefighters ' video before it even was posted online , releasing a statement from retired New York firefighter Lee Ielpi , who said the firefighters " have once again taken the low road in a move clearly out of step with their membership . "
The campaign accuses the firefighters ' union of engaging in purely partisan attacks .
But one of the unions whose members appear in the video , Local 94 , endorsed President Bush in 2004 .
Since rocketing to international prominence after 9/11 , Giuliani has raked in more than $ 11 million through book and speaking fees related to the terror attacks .
The firefighters say his portrait of leadership is ill founded .
" We did need radios that worked ; we did n't have them .
We did need proper respiratory protection ; he did n't give it to us , " said Steve Cassidy , president of a New York firefighters union Local 94 .
" The things that we needed to do our job even better , we did n't have , because of his administration . "

Study examines vets who received VA care beween 2001 - 2005
• Study says youngest Iraq , Afghanistan veterans have most issues
• Data from 103,788 veterans analyzed in study
• Post - traumatic stress disorder diagnosed in 13 percent of those studied
Adjust font size :
SAN FRANCISCO , California ( CNN ) --
Nearly a third of veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan who received care from Veterans Affairs between 2001 and 2005 were diagnosed with mental health or psychosocial ills , a study published Monday has concluded .
The study was published in the March 12 issue of Archives of Internal Medicine and carried out by researchers at the University of California , San Francisco and the San Francisco VA Medical Center .
They looked at data from 103,788 veterans ; about 13 percent of them women , 54 percent under age 30 , nearly a third minorities and nearly half veterans of the National Guard or Reserves .
Of the total , 32,010 ( 31 percent ) were diagnosed with mental health and / or psychosocial problems , including 25,658 who received mental health diagnoses .
More than half ( 56 percent ) were diagnosed with two or more disorders .
( Watch how the wars are blamed for an " epidemic " of mental disorders )
Post - traumatic stress disorder was the most common disorder , with the 13,205 veterans who got the diagnosis accounting for more than half ( 52 percent ) of mental health diagnoses .
Post - traumatic stress disorder , an anxiety disorder that can occur after the experience or witnessing of a traumatic event , can lead to depression , substance abuse , problems of memory and cognition , and other problems of physical and mental health .
Others included anxiety disorder ( 24 percent ) , adjustment disorder ( 24 percent ) , depression ( 20 percent ) and substance abuse disorder ( 20 percent ) .
Of all veterans of Iraq or Afghanistan who sought VA services , post - traumatic stress disorder affected 13 percent , the study said .
That 's slightly less than the 15.2 percent tallied for veterans of the Vietnam War , but far above the 3.5 percent reported in the general population .
Differences between genders and races were " minimal , " the study said .
But the youngest group studied -- veterans 18 - 24 years of age -- appeared to be at greatest risk .
" Our results signal a need for improvements in the primary prevention of military service - related mental health disorders , particularly among our youngest service members , " the authors wrote .
Still , youth may have had nothing to do with it , the authors acknowledged , noting that active - duty military are typically among the youngest military .
And , " because they are young , they are more likely to be of lower rank and more likely to have greater combat exposure than their older active - duty counterparts , " the authors wrote .
In addition , the study 's conclusions may not apply generally to all veterans of the wars , since the study included only those veterans who got VA care .
The authors warned , " Our results may overestimate the burden of mental health disorders because veterans with mental health disorders may be more likely to seek treatment at a VA facility than those without . "
The findings did not surprise former Sen. Max Cleland , a veteran who was grievously wounded during the Vietnam War and suffered depression .
" This is the price of war , " the Democrat from Georgia said .
" You ca n't send young Americans to Iraq and Afghanistan ... and expect them to come home and just fit right in .
They bring that trauma with them . "
He added , " If you do n't intervene with the emotional aftermath of the war up - front and early , it can slide down a precipitous path to hell . "

Google Video seems to have the full length documentary on Prof Temple Grandin , a world expert on animal science who was diagnosed with autism as a child .
As well as her academic work which has been hugely influential around the world , she has also written several books on the psychology of autism that have become widely read by professionals and the public alike .
Her story first became known as she was included as a case study in neurologist Oliver Sacks ’ book An Anthropologist on Mars .
Interestingly , Grandin suggests that her autism helps her understand animals , as she suggests they have similar styles of thinking in some instances .
In the programme , Grandin explains her work and views on autism .
Furthermore , the documentary highlights her as a bright and engaging person , far from the usual stereotypes of autistic people .

Fireworks over Sydney Harbour will mark the closure of APEC but the public have been told not to attend .
Tall ships also will grace the harbour for the display named " River of Fire " but organisers moved today to ensure that it was staged for VIP eyes only , citing the security crackdown .
" This short five - minute firework display , accompanied by some tall ships and yachts on the harbour , will feature a colourful display fired from barges only , not from the Sydney Harbour Bridge , " APEC spokeswoman Anne Fulwood said .
Boeing 's future could depend on the Dreamliner 's success
Key features US plane manufacturer Boeing has unveiled its 787 Dreamliner - the firm 's first all - new jet since 1995 .
It is the only big commercial aircraft made mostly of carbon fibre rather than aluminium and is billed as the most environmentally friendly ever built .
Boeing says the 787 is much more fuel efficient than its competitors and produces 20 % less CO2 .
The firm says it already has more than 600 orders .
The first test flight is expected in August or September .
Sunday was chosen for Dreamliner 's premiere as it is 8 July , or , in the American date style , 07/08/07 .
Compare Boeing and Airbus planes
An audience of thousands were in attendance in Everett , Washington state near Seattle as the aircraft was presented to the media .
" Our journey began some six years ago when we knew we were on the cusp of delivering valuable new technologies , " Mike Bair , who heads the 787 programme , told the crowd .
Competition Hours earlier , Boeing said it had received 35 new orders for the plane .
The orders , from Air Berlin and a Kuwaiti leasing firm , mean Boeing now has 677 orders from 47 customers for the midsize , long - haul jet .
MATERIALS IN THE 787 DREAMLINER

In pictures : Dreamliner unveiled
It is due to go into service next year , with Japan 's All Nippon Airways set to be the first recipient as a reward for placing orders for 50 of the aircraft .
Carbon fibre , which is lighter and more durable than aluminium , makes up about 50 % of the plane 's structure , including the fuselage and wings .
This is intended to make the 787 fuel efficient .
Boeing says the composite materials also mean air in the cabin can be more humid , leaving long - haul passengers less jetlagged .
Envrionment Phil Clapp , president of the National Environmental Trust , a non-partisan US group , told the BBC that the 787 was a " major step forward " but not the sole solution to aviation emissions .
Some environmentalists say the lower operating costs will make air travel cheaper and simply encourage more people to fly .
DIFFERENT MODELS OF 787
The first will carry between 210 and 250 passengers up to about 9,400 miles ( 15,125 km ) .
The second will carry between 250 and 290 passengers up to about 9,800 miles ( 15,770 km )
The third will fly between 290 and 330 passengers on shorter routes , up to about 3,500 miles ( 5,600 km ) Source : Boeing
In Pictures : Plane assembly The Dreamliner is Boeing 's first all - new plane since the 777 , which began flying in 1995 .
It is crucial to Boeing 's success , just as Airbus is pinning its hopes for the future on its forthcoming A380 .
However , the two are very different planes with different aims .
The European firm sees its superjumbo plane as a response to airline calls for a bigger plane to meet increasing passenger numbers flying between major hubs .
Smaller planes
Boeing is taking a different tack , predicting that the future growth sector will be for additional medium - sized planes that can service smaller airports .
Airbus is currently developing the A350 , which is more of a direct rival to the 787 , but it is not expected to roll out the plane until about 2011 .
Boeing received a boost at the Paris air show with an order for 50 of the aircraft from ILFC .
Orders from plane - leasing companies - among the biggest global buyers of aircraft - are often seen as an indication of how a model will succeed in the long term .
Assembly of the first Dreamliner began in May , although Boeing says that when full operation is under way , it will take just three days to put together each aircraft in final assembly .

What are these ?
1. Involve all contributors .
2. Document the postmortem in writing .
3. Begin with a project overview .
4. Include project details .
5. Document what went right .
6. Document what went wrong .
7. Assess your risk management .
8. Assess mid-project changes .
9 . Draw meaningful conclusions .
10 . Take action .
Given all the responsibilities that game developers face , it is n't surprising that they seldom take the time to conduct project postmortems .
A postmortem is a procedure whereby you summarize a project 's history and analyzes its positive and negative aspects .
The goal of a postmortem is to draw meaningful conclusions to help you learn from your past successes and failures .
Despite its grim - sounding name , a postmortem can be an extremely productive method of improving your development practices .
The best time to conduct a postmortem is about two weeks after a product is released ( or for certain products , after the project is cancelled ) .
This allows you to regain your objectivity without forgetting the details .
Your memories will still be fresh , and you 'll have a good perspective to see the project as a whole rather than focusing too strongly on the most recent work .
Here are ten suggestions for conducting a good project postmortem :
If others were involved in your project , arrange a project review meeting .
If you were the sole contributor , set aside time to reflect on your experience .
Document the good , the bad , and the ugly aspects of the project .
Note all grievances , and solicit ideas for future improvement .
I recommend using a project review questionnaire with three parts .
First , use a one to ten rating system to quantify subjective feedback .
Secondly , include targeted questions for specific areas that might need improvement .
And finally , use a free form comments section for open - ended feedback .
Document the postmortem details in writing .
While it is perfectly acceptable to create a simple text document for small projects , I recommend using HTML for large projects .
The document can then be published on an intranet , so everyone in the company has easy access to it .
This way you can provide links to additional resources such as design documents , schedules , and archived files .
It also makes it easy to create a collection of postmortems over time , with links between related sections of different documents .
For a multi- release product , include additional data on each upgrade .
A series of postmortems can ultimately evolve into a valuable record of your hard - earned wisdom .
Begin the postmortem document with a brief overview of your project , including a design overview , estimated budget , and project start and finish dates .
Describe the product 's purpose , intended customer , and other general information .
Document the quantifiable details of your project .
Include your schedule and budget estimates as well as the true outcomes .
List the number of lines of source code in the release as well as the lines of reused code .
Document the size of the media and system requirements for the end user .
List any known bugs or compatibility problems .
Note which development tools were used and their version numbers , including any mid-project upgrades .
List everyone who worked on the project , and document their contributions .
Document what went right with your project .
Did the final product turn out better than expected ?
Did you experience an occasional stroke of luck ?
List at least ten things that turned out well for your project .
For my last project , I had the most luck with quality assurance .
I paid tremendous attention to code quality , and I was able to keep the program virtually bug - free throughout its entire development .
Consequently , I was able to spend very little time on debugging , allowing me extra time to improve the quality of the product .
What difficulties did you encounter ?
What assumptions proved incorrect ?
Compile a detailed list of your project 's shortcomings .
List at least ten things that turned out worse than expected .
Document unpleasant mid-project surprises as well .
My last project 's greatest challenge was flushing out the design .
I was developing a unique new type of game , and I experienced extreme difficulty trying to get all of the gameplay elements to coalesce into a unified whole that would be fun to play .
I spent about two - thirds of the entire project on very painstaking level design , far more than expected .
Document all the risks you took during the project , and note how effectively you managed them .
Did you explore experimental ideas , use new technology or development tools , or develop for a new platform ?
Did your schedule slip from poor estimation practices ?
Did you take big risks , or did you play it relatively safe ?
Assess your risk management experience , paying particular attention to how you would change your approach for the next project .
What unanticipated changes occurred throughout the project ?
How did you respond to them ?
Did you incorporate some great mid-project additions , or was excessive feature creep a problem ?
I was able to manage change effectively on my last project by designing flexibility into the game engine .
But once the level design reached a certain point , most new changes had to be locked out in order to prevent corrupting previous work .
What conclusions can you draw from your project history that will help you improve in the future ?
What should you start doing , keep doing , or stop doing ?
Describe new practices you should try for your next project .
This is perhaps the most important part of the postmortem , so be prepared to spend more time here than in any other section .
It would be a great waste of time to create a beautiful project postmortem , archive it , and forget about it .
The final step is to develop an action plan that can be applied to your next project .
Review your project history , reflect on the lessons you 've learned , and specify new guidelines to follow in the future .
I recommend creating a checklist for your next project .
If you already have a checklist , then update it with new refinements .
Whether you are a lone - wolf programmer or part of a larger team , postmortems will help you maximize the benefits gained from your hard - earned experience .
On large projects you can even conduct a mini-postmortem after each milestone , allowing you to profit from what you 've learned as soon as possible .
One final benefit of conducting a postmortem is that you gain a very gratifying sense of closure because you actually document all the personal growth you 've experienced as a result of completing the project .
If you wish to view a sample postmortem from my company 's last project , visit www.dexterity.com/postmortem .
I included the complete text of the postmortem and well as a sample project questionnaire you can use in conducting your own postmortems .

The ability to recover from exercise is one of the determining factors in the long term success of any training program .
The faster and more efficiently you can recover , the better your results will be .
To speed up your progress you can use tips from below .
1 ) Take a post workout shake
Immediately after training , consume a mix of simple carbohydrates and rapidly absorbed protein .
This drink should contain a two to one ratio of carbs to protein .
A 200 pound man would consume roughly eighty grams of carbs and forty grams of protein .
Doing this will help to reduce cortisol , which is a stress hormone that literally eats away muscle tissue , as well as start to shuttle nutrients to the muscles and begin the recovery process .
2 ) Take a contrast bath after training
This is an old technique that originated in Eastern Bloc countries many years ago to speed up the recovery of their elite athletes .
After consuming your post workout shake ; use this method of bathing in order to stimulate recovery .
Begin by submerging yourself in hot water for one minute .
Immediately jump into a tub of ice cold water for a minute .
Repeat this process for up to ten minutes .
This can also be done in the shower , which is more practical for most people .
3 ) Do not drop carbohydrate intake too low
Although low carb diets are in vogue these days , this is not an optimal approach for a hard training athlete .
Even if you need to lose a good amount of body fat you should still be consuming at least 150 - 200 grams of carbs per day .
Dropping carbs drastically will slow down your thyroid and testosterone production and cause losses in size and strength .
To maximize your recovery , you must keep a decent amount of carbs in your diet .
4 ) Take naps
Naps are a great way to speed up your progress .
During sleep , your body releases growth hormone and repairs the damage that has been done to your muscles during intense workouts .
Taking a twenty to sixty minute nap once a day is a great way to see faster results .
5 ) Sleep eight to ten hours a night
As mentioned above , when you are sleeping you are growing bigger and stronger .
Without sufficient sleep your results will be less than optimal .
6 ) Stretch on your off days
This is a great way to increase blood flow to the muscles which helps shuttle in the nutrients necessary for optimal recovery .
7 ) Avoid stress
This is obviously easier said than done , but it should be noted that excessive amounts of psychological or emotional stress can wreak havoc on your results .
8 ) Get a massage at least once a week
This is a great way to relax and speed up the healing process of sore muscles .
9 ) Do recovery workouts
By performing a very light , high rep workout the day after an intense training session and getting some blood into the muscles , you can actually accelerate your ability to recover .
For example , the day after a heavy squat workout your legs are likely to be very sore .
Instead of doing nothing , try doing 100 bodyweight only squats .
10 ) Take a week off
Every ten to twelve weeks , your body will start to break down and demand a rest .
Taking a week off will actually allow you to get stronger and come back fresh and ready to train hard again .
Remember , training is only half of the equation .
Without proper recovery techniques your progress will never be optimal .
Start using these methods today and watch your results skyrocket .

BBC News , Nachu , central Kenya
Monkeys destroyed this scarecrow , according to villagers
A troop of monkeys is giving Kenyan villagers long days and sleepless nights , destroying crops and causing a food crisis .
Earlier this month , local MP Paul Muite urged the Kenya Wildlife Service to help contain their aggressive behaviour .
But Mr Muite caused laughter when he told parliament that the monkeys had taken to harassing and mocking women in a village .
But this is exactly what the women in the village of Nachu , just south - west of Kikuyu , are complaining about .
Sexual harassment
They estimate there are close to 300 monkeys invading the farms at dawn .
They eat the village 's maize , potatoes , beans and other crops .
And because women are primarily responsible for the farms , they have borne the brunt of the problem , as they try to guard their crops .
The monkeys grab their breasts , and gesture at us while pointing at their private parts
Villager Lucy Njeri
They say the monkeys are more afraid of young men than women and children , and the bolder ones throw stones and chase the women from their farms .
Nachu's women have tried wearing their husbands ' clothes in an attempt to trick the monkeys into thinking they are men - but this has failed , they say .
" When we come to chase the monkeys away , we are dressed in trousers and hats , so that we look like men , " resident Lucy Njeri told the BBC News website
" But the monkeys can tell the difference and they do n't run away from us and point at our breasts .
They just ignore us and continue to steal the crops . "
In addition to stealing their crops , the monkeys also make sexually explicit gestures at the women , they claim .
This monkey scarer is armed with stones
" The monkeys grab their breasts , and gesture at us while pointing at their private parts .
We are afraid that they will sexually harass us , " said Mrs Njeri .
The Kenya Wildlife Service head of other species , Mr Charles Musyoki , told the BBC News website that the behaviour the villagers were complaining about has not been documented before , but they had launched investigations .
" I have not observed that , but we are actually sending a team there .
We have constituted a team to go and verify the villagers claims .
I hope when they come back and submit their report , we will be able to respond to this claims from an informed position , " he said .
He also raised doubts as to whether the primates were vervet monkeys as originally identified .
" If they were chimpanzees I would probably say yes , they could be behaving in this way , but this kind of aggression has not been documented in monkeys . "
But whatever the truth of the villagers claims , the predominantly farming community is now having to receive famine relief food .
The residents say the monkeys have killed livestock and guard dogs , which has also left the villagers living in fear , especially for the safety of their babies and children .
All the villagers ' attempts to control the monkeys have failed - the monkeys evade traps , have lookouts to warn the others of impending attacks and snub poisoned food put out by the residents .
" The troop has scouts which keep a lookout from a vantage point , and when they see us coming , they give warning signals to the ones in the farms to get away , " said another area resident , Jacinta Wandaga .
' Monkey squad '
The town has been warned by the Kenya Wildlife Service not to harm or kill any of the monkeys , as it is a criminal offence .
The monkey squad are not very good at scaring away the monkeys
Running out of options , residents are harvesting their crops early in an attempt to salvage what they can of this year 's crop .
Unfortunately , this only invites the monkeys to break into their homes and steal the harvested crops out of their granaries .
Even the formation of a " monkey squad " to keep track of the monkeys ' movements and keep them out has failed .
The area is simply too large for the few volunteers to cover , they say .
Some residents have lost hope and abandoned their homes and farms , but those who have stayed behind , like 80 - year - old James Ndungu , are making a desperate plea for assistance .
" For God 's sake , the government should take pity on us and move these monkeys away because we do not want to abandon our farms , " he said .
" I beg you , please come and take these animals away from here so that we can farm in peace . "
The KWS team say they will observe the monkeys for a week and investigate the villagers ' claims .
" We will be able to tell whether indeed they are exhibiting the kind of behaviour that the farmers are saying .
If we find the claims to be true , then we will need to take the research a notch higher to find out why those animals are behaving in such a strange way , " Mr Musyoki said .
ゴールデンウィークで友達が日本から遊びに来ていたので、あちこち近くを観光した。そこで出会った動物の皆さんです。
鯨： 遭遇確率 – 低（私は今回初めて見ました。 ）
モントレーとカーメルの間に、17-mile Driveという有料道路がある。高級住宅地なんだが、いくばくかのお金を払うと普通の人も入れる。有名なPebble Beachのゴルフ場もここにあります。
で、いくつかの 「見所ポイント」があるのだが、その一つがLone Cypress。岩に一本の糸杉が立っているので有名なのだが、今回は鯨がいた。といっても鯨が吹いている汐が見えただけですが。下の写真をクリックして拡大すると見えると思います。
リス： 遭遇確率 － １００ ％
この辺ではリスは害獣なのだが、ま、ここまで行くとかわいいかなぁ・・・というのがCarmelあたりの海岸にいるリス。これは、Carmel Beachにて。
鯨を見たのと同じ17 - mile Drive のBird Rockというポイントでは、観光客に餌付けされてしまった豊満なリスが山ほどいる。こんな感じ。
本当は、餌をやってはいけません。ごめんなさい。下の写真のように健康的なリンゴをあげるのは、まだ罪が軽い・・と思うのですがどうでしょうね。
鳥： 遭遇確率 － １００ ％
鳥がどうした、といわれそうだが、ここまでいると壮観では。上のリスがいるポイントと同じところ。砂浜から程近くにある黒地に白がかぶった島状の岩が見えると思うが、これがBird Rock。その白の上の黒い点々が全て鳥。白いのは鳥の糞で、削り取って肥料に使ってたこともあるらしい。巨大なペリカンもばっさばっさと飛んでいる。
ラッコ： 遭遇確率 － ４０ ％
写真には撮れなかったのだが、上の写真のBird Rockの右下の方の水辺にラッコが６－７匹平行に並んでぷかぷか浮かんでいた。ラッコは水が静かな海で、海草に体を巻きつけて浮かんでいるので、Monterey-Carmel付近で海草が静かにゆらゆらしているところでは結構簡単に見つかる。
今回は、一匹はヒレ状の手足を水面に出して体の前でパタパタしてたり、クルクル回転してたりして、まさにラッコ。このBird Rockポイントは見所満点で、私の親戚の子供たちを連れて行ったときは「もう一回行きたい」とのリクエストで、二日連続行きました。
ちなみに、ベイエリア付近で週末チラッと行くところとしては、私はCarmelが一番好きです。もともとアーティストのコミューンだったこともある（西海岸にしては）整った町並み。隣のMontereyの水族館も楽しいし、17-mile Driveも自然が一杯で、かつ立ち並ぶ豪邸を見るのもよろし。
Carmelには、Coachのアウトレットもある。日本人がそんなに行く町じゃないのに、このCoachに行くと必ず日本語ができる人がいるのが、買い倒れ日本の底力を物語る。

Up to eight police officers and civilian staff are suspected of links to extremist groups including Al Qaeda .
Some are even believed to have attended terror training camps in Pakistan or Afghanistan .
Their names feature on a secret list of alleged radicals said to be working in the Metropolitan and other forces .
Scroll down for more
The dossier was drawn up with the help of MI5 amid fears that individuals linked to Islamic extremism are taking advantage of police attempts to increase the proportion of ethnic staff .
Astonishingly , many of the alleged jihadists have not been sacked because - it is claimed - police do not have the " legal power " to dismiss them .
We can also reveal that one suspected jihadist officer working in the South East has been allowed to keep his job despite being caught circulating Internet images of beheadings and roadside bombings in Iraq .
He is said to have argued that he was trying to " enhance " debate about the war .
Classified intelligence reports raising concerns about police staff 's background cannot be used to justify their dismissal , sources said .

Instead , the staff who are under suspicion are unofficially barred from working in sensitive posts and are closely monitored .
Political correctness is blamed for the decision not to sack them .
It is widely feared that " long - term " Al Qaeda sleepers are trying to infiltrate other public sector organisations in the UK .
In November last year , it was revealed that a leading member of an extremist Islamic group was working as a senior official at the Home Office .
MI5 has warned in the past that suspects with " strong links " to Osama Bin Laden 's killers have tried to join the British security services and , in January , exiled radical Omar Bakri claimed that Islamic extremists were infiltrating the police and other public sector organisations .
Suspicions are growing that the gang behind the failed London bomb attacks could have received inside information about rescue procedures in the aftermath of an atrocity in the capital .
The Daily Mail can reveal that the second device parked near Haymarket was left at a designated " evacuation assembly point " where civilians and the emergency services would have gathered had the first bomb gone off .
Investigators are trying to establish whether the bombers knew the significance of the location .
Sources said it is unlikely that the Met is the only force which may have been infiltrated by Al Qaeda sympathisers .
Omar Altimimi , a failed asylum seeker jailed for nine years yesterday for hoarding manuals on how to carry out car bombings , had applied to work as a cleaner for the Greater Manchester force .
In a separate development , it is understood that a policeman was removed from his post after concerns about his conduct in the aftermath of a major anti-terrorist operation in the past two years .
For legal reasons , the Mail cannot reveal any more about the case .
The MI5 list of suspected Islamists working in the police is said to have been drawn up in the aftermath of the 7/7 terror attacks in London .
MI5 checked staff details at the Met and other forces with intelligence databases on individuals said to have attended radical Islamic schools - or Madrassas - and terror training camps in Pakistan and Afghanistan .
It is thought that intelligence files on those who frequently visit pro-Jihad websites and who have associated with so - called preachers of hate were also compared to details of officers and civilian staff in the Met .
As a result of the review , eight officers and civilian staff were identified as Al Qaeda sympathisers or people of concern because of their links to Islamic extremists .
The disclosure will raise concerns about the system for vetting new recruits , each of whom is the subject of counter - terrorism checks to ensure they are suitable to join the police .
Scotland Yard 's vetting unit is regarded as one of the best in the country .
But sources said it is often impossible to carry out satisfactory checks on recruits who were raised overseas or who have spent considerable periods out of Britain before applying to join the Met .
In such cases , the Met has to rely on overseas agencies to carry out intelligence checks on their behalf .
Privately , officials doubt whether certain countries in Africa , Middle East or the Indian sub - continent are able to carry out meaningful vetting .
As a result of the Stephen Lawrence public inquiry report , which accused the Met of being " institutionally racist " , Scotland Yard has in recent years employed thousands of officers and civilian staff from the ethnic minorities in an attempt to reach recruitment targets .
A Scotland Yard spokesman said : " All employees upon joining the Met and during their careers undergo a range of security checks .
These are robust and vary according to the type and sensitivity of individual postings .
" We take matters of security very seriously and if an issue arises , people may be subjected to further assessment .
" This may lead to restrictions in relation to where an individual works in the organisation or whether they are suitable to remain in the service . "

Several analysts argued that a three - way race with Mr. Bloomberg running as a third - party candidate could ultimately prove more of a threat to Democrats than to Republicans .
Until he ran for mayor in 2001 , Mr. Bloomberg was a lifelong Democrat , and his success in New York reflected his ability to draw Democratic votes : he is for abortion rights , gay rights and gun control .
Mr. Bloomberg ’s aides said he has plans to travel to Missouri and to Florida , crucial swing states , in the near future .
On Friday , he filed papers with the city Board of Elections to change his affiliation , as the public focus on his future intensified .
In the space of a few days , he appeared on the cover of Time and in a BusinessWeek special report , and he told an audience of Google employees that the country is “ really in trouble . ”
He stood with Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California as the governor told a crowd of reporters on Tuesday that Mr. Bloomberg “ would be a great candidate , ” in an appearance at Ceasefire , a conference on bridging the partisan divide , organized by the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Southern California .
“ It ’s all about fixing problems and creating a great vision for the future , ” he said .
While Mr. Schwarzenegger has not been as critical as Mr. Bloomberg about the Republican party , he has differed with many in the G.O.P. , and the two men have become increasingly linked .
The governor supports stem - cell research and wants to extend health care to illegal immigrants in California .
He supports a timetable for troop withdrawal in Iraq and has frequently derided Washington for failures on border control and other issues .
Adam Mendelsohn , the governor ’s communications director , described their relationship as “ symbiotic . "
At their joint appearance , the mayor was the big draw , as a throng of reporters and cameramen crowded around , peppering him with questions about whether he would seek the presidency .
Mr. Bloomberg , who has called it flattering to be viewed as presidential material , clearly enjoyed the attention .
He joked and parried with the press , and when asked whether he and the governor might team up on a campaign ticket , suggested that the governor would challenge him to an arm wrestling contest to see which of them should run at the top , while he would consult the Constitution .
( The Constitution says that the president must be “ a natural - born citizen , ” which is generally regarded as barring naturalized citizens . )
Story Highlights • Reid says
Republicans do not support their own president 's bill
• McConnell says many Republicans remain opposed to bill
• Lott says Bush wo n't sign just any bill and problems remain with it
• Bush visits Capitol to push immigration bill that was defeated last week
Adjust font size :
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Bush broke bread with resistant Senate Republicans on Tuesday , but the fate of a White House - supported immigration bill remained uncertain .
After emerging from the private luncheon , Bush provided no specifics on whether any minds were changed .
" Some members in there believe we need to move a comprehensive bill , some don't , " Bush told reporters in a Capitol hallway .
" I understand that .
It 's a highly emotional issue .
( Watch Bush press for passage )
" But those of us standing here believe now is the time to move to a comprehensive bill that enforces our borders and has good workplace enforcement , that does n't grant automatic citizenship , that addresses this problem in a comprehensive way . "
" I believe without the bill , it 'll be harder to enforce our borders , " Bush said .
( Watch one Republican senator who remains unconvinced )
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nevada , said it 's up to Republicans to collect more votes in favor of the measure to convince him that reviving debate could lead to passage .
" I repeat , 80 percent of the Democrats support this immigration bill , " Reid said .
" We 've done our job .
I do n't have to twist an arm .
I do n't have to pull anybody into a room to get them to try to agree to something .
" It 's not a question of Democrats doing anything .
It 's a question of Republicans supporting their own president . "
( Watch Reid challenge Republicans to come up with the votes )
If an agreement can be reached on amendments , Reid suggested , the Senate could return to the bill before the July 4 recess .
A motion to stop debate on the immigration measure failed Thursday night , preventing the proposal from coming up for a vote .
Several Republicans wanted to add amendments , but Reid said the debate had gone on too long , and other bills were waiting to be considered .
( Read more about last week 's crushing blow to immigration legislation )
Seven Republicans voted with 37 Democrats and one independent in favor of the procedural motion that fell well shy of the 60 votes needed for passage .
Fifty senators voted against it .
' Good give and take ' at lunch
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R- Kentucky , said there was " good give and take " at Tuesday 's lunch , and sounded optimistic about the bill 's chances .
" We did n't expect anybody to stand up and holler that they had an epiphany , " McConnell said .
" I do believe this bill is about 85 percent through to the finish line . "
( Watch why Bush 's role is vital to immigration bill )
White House spokesman Tony Snow , appearing on CNN's " American Morning , " said he expected Republicans to band together to add amendments to the bill , and predicted it could be voted on by the end of Tuesday -- after senators take up the energy bill .
He predicted the measure would pass .
" What they did n't like last week is that the Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid wanted to cut off the debate , so a number of Republicans who had amendments they wanted to propose did n't get to have their hearing , " Snow said .
Sen .
Trent Lott , R- Mississippi , the minority whip , was less enthusiastic after the lunch meeting .
" The president made it clear to us that he wo n't sign just any bill .
...
There are still problems remaining with it , and he wants to work with us to get this job done , " Lott said .
Sen . Jeff Sessions , R - Alabama , also appearing on CNN's " American Morning " on Tuesday , said , " I think the president is wrong to push this piece of legislation so hard after we 've demonstrated the flaws that are in it .
He needs to back off .
He needs to help us write a better bill and not push a bill that so many of us can't support . "
( Watch Sessions explain what he thinks is wrong with the ' fatally flawed ' bill )
After lunch with Bush , Sessions told CNN he believes the bill has " serious flaws . "
" I said we ought to back off and look at this thing carefully and analytically , because just passing a bill is not the solution to our problem , " he said .
" If the president is not committed to actual aggressive enforcement and if we do n't have a bill that will work , then we have n't done anything . "
As examples , Sessions said , the Congressional Budget Office predicted only a 13 percent reduction in the number of illegal immigrants entering the United States if the bill passes , and the office would expect an increase in legal immigration .
Kennedy : ' The center is holding '
Before the luncheon , Sen. Edward Kennedy , D - Massachusetts , who worked with the White House and Republicans on writing the bill , issued a statement saying , " Like the president , many of us are very determined to get the job done and get it done now .
" The center is holding together : Last night we met to discuss the options for moving it forward , and today we 'll continue that work .
We share the sense of urgency that this important issue deserves . "
Sen .
Jon Kyl , R - Arizona , chief Republican architect of the immigration measure , said on " American Morning " that this is the last chance to pass legislation addressing the nation 's 12 million illegal immigrants , about half of whom he said crossed into Arizona from Mexico .
" We have one good opportunity to pass immigration reform , and it's within the next few weeks in the U.S. Congress .
I think all of the experts agree that thereafter we get into the presidential / political season .
Next year it 's not going to be possible , " Kyl said .
( Watch the signs that Bush is looking more like a ' lame duck ' )
Sens. Johnny Isakson and Saxby Chambliss , Republicans from Georgia , sent a letter to Bush on Tuesday urging him to send an emergency supplemental spending bill to Congress to fund border security to restore " the confidence of the American people in the federal government 's commitment to border security . "
The immigration legislation would allow most of the illegal immigrants in the United States to qualify for a " Z " visa , to be renewed every two years ; strengthen border security and enforcement ; establish a temporary worker program for at least 200,000 people ; fine employers who hire illegal immigrants ; and create a new system for legal - resident ( " green card " ) applications .

Dear Validators , I 've been happily using your service for many years --- even before w3 c took it over .
I 've had a collection of web pages at Stanford since 1995 or so ; it now amounts to hundreds of pages , dozens of which have tens of thousands of hits , several of which have hits in the millions .
Every time I make a nontrivial change , I 've been asking the validator to approve it .
And every time , I 've won the right to display the " HaL HTML Netscape checked " logo .
Until today .
Alluva sudden you guys have jerked the rug out from under my feet .
I protest !
I feel like screaming !
Unfair !
I 'm not accustomed to flaming , but I have to warn you that I am just now more than a little hot under the collar and trying not to explode .
For years and years , I have started each webpage with the formula I found in the book from which I learned HTML many years ago , namely <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-// Netscape Comm .
Corp.//DTD HTML//EN " >
Today when I tried to validate a simple edit of one page , I found that your system no longer is happy --- indeed , it hates every one of my webpages .
( If you need a URL , Google for " don " and take the topmost page , unless you are in France . )
For example , it now finds 19 errors on my home page , which was 100 % valid earlier this month .
The first error is " unknown parse mode ! " .
Apparently Stanford 's Apache server is sending the page out as text / html .
You are saying text / html is ambiguous , but that you are going to continue as if it were SGML mode .
Fine ; but if I get the Stanford folks to change the MIME type to SGML mode , I 'll still have 18 more errors .
The next error is " no DOCTYPE found " .
But guys , it is there as plain as day .
Henceforth you default to HTML 4.01 Transitional .
Then you complain that I do n't give " alt " specifications with any of the images .
But the Netscape DTD I have used for more than 3000 days does not require it .
Then you do n't allow align = " absmiddle " in an image .
I went to your help page trying to find another DTD that might suit .
Version 2.0 seemed promising ; but no , it failed in other ways --- like it does n't know the bgcolor and text color attributes in the < body > of my page .
Look folks , I know that software rot ( sometimes called " progress " ) keeps growing , and backwards compatibility is not always possible .
At one point I changed my TeX78 system to TeX82 and refused to support the older conventions .
But in this case I see absolutely no reason why system people who are supposedly committed to helping the world 's users from all the various cultures are suddenly blasting me in the face and telling me that you no longer support things that every decent browser understands perfectly well .
To change all these pages will cost me a week 's time .
I do n't want to delay The Art of Computer Programming by an unnecessary week ; I 've been working on it for 43 years and I have 20 more years of work to do , and who knows what illnesses and other tragedies are in store .
Every week is precious , especially when it seems to me that there is no valid validation reason for a competent computer system person to be so fascistic .
For all I know , you 'll be making me spend another week on this next year , and another the year after that .
So , my former friends , please tell me either ( i ) when you are going to fix the problem , or ( ii ) who is your boss so that I can complain at a higher level .
Excuse me , that was a bit flamey was n't it , and certainly egocentric .
But I think you understand why I might be upset .
Sincerely , Don Knuth
Bernstein : Bush administration 's disinformation , misinformation ' something I have never witnessed before on this scale '
Mike Sheehan
Published : Wednesday February 14 , 2007 Print This Email This Sponsored by : The Agenda with Joe Solmonese Veteran reporter Carl Bernstein says the lack of truth and candor from the Bush administration is unprecedented in his experience .
Comparing the Nixon administration 's press relations to those of Bush , Bernstein says , " Nixon 's relationship to the press was consistent with his relationship to many institutions and people .
He saw himself as a victim .
We now understand the psyche of Richard Nixon , that his was a self - destructive act and presidency .
" The Bush administration , " Bernstein continues , " is a far different matter in which disinformation , misinformation and unwillingness to tell the truth -- a willingness to lie both in the Oval Office , in the Office of the Secretary of Defense , in the office of the vice president , the vice president himself -- is something that I have never witnessed before on this scale . "
Bernstein contrasted Nixon 's covering up of illegal activities tied to his re-election campaign with the Bush White House 's " unwillingness to be truthful , both contextually and in terms of basic facts that ought to be of great concern to people of all ideologies .
" This president has a record of dishonesty and obfuscation that is Nixonian in character in its willingness to manipulate the press , to manipulate the truth , " he adds .
" We have gone to war on the basis of misinformation , disinformation and knowing lies from top to bottom . "
Bernstein blasts what he describes as " the willingness of the president and the vice president and the people around them to try to undermine people who have effectively opposed them by telling the truth . "
He cites attacks on Sen. John Kerry ( D - MA ) , former Sen. Max Cleland ( D - GA ) and even Sen. John McCain ( R - AZ ) .
" That 's the real story , and that 's the story that [ the press ] should have been writing , " he says .
Bernstein , who gained fame with Bob Woodward for their breakthrough reporting on the Watergate scandal , was interviewed for a PBS Frontline series on the media .
In an earlier interview reported on at RAW STORY , the famed journalist said the Bush administration had done " far greater damage " than Nixon .
Excerpts from an Editor and Publisher article with portions of the PBS interview follow ... #
It 's very difficult , as a reporter , to get across that when you say , " This is a presidency of great dishonesty , " that this is not a matter of opinion .
This is demonstrable fact .
If you go back and look at the president 's statements , you look at the statements of the vice president , you look at the statements of Condoleezza Rice , you go through the record , you look at what [ counterterrorism expert ]
Richard Clarke has written , you look at what we know -- it 's demonstrable .
It 's fact .
Now , how do you quantify it ?
That 's a different question .
But to me , if there is a great failure by the so - called mainstream press in this presidency , it 's the unwillingness to look at the lies and disinformation and misinformation and add them up and say clearly , " Here 's what they said ; here 's what the known facts were , " because when that is done , you then see this is n't a partisan matter .
This is a matter of the truth , particularly about this war .
This is a presidency that is not willing to tell the truth very often if it is contrary to its interests .
It 's not about ideology from whence I say this .
It 's about being a reporter and saying : " That 's what the story is .
Let 's see what they said ; let 's see what the facts are . " ... #
Kucinich : ' Imperial ' vice president needs to be impeached David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Monday July 9 , 2007 Print This Email This Rep. Dennis Kucinich , D - Ohio , continued to stress his case for impeaching Vice President Dick Cheney , saying his role in pushing the false case for war is akin to a high crime against the constitution .
" To me it 's about the constitution , it 's not about the personality , " Kucinich said Monday morning on Joe Scarborough 's MSNBC show .
" And the constitution requires the highest office holders to have the highest standards and obedience to the law , and I think serious questions have been raised , which is why I introduced the resolution . "
Kucinich predicted more members of Congress would join his impeachment push after a poll showed last week that a majority of Americans support the vice president 's impeachment , as RAW STORY previously reported .
The long - shot presidential candidate reminded Scarborough that he was among 31 Democrats who supported inquiries that led to former President Bill Clinton 's impeachment in pointing out that partisan motives were not behind his current push .
Because Cheney had " enormous influence " in pushing the US into war with Iraq and made " unequivocal statements " about Saddam Hussein 's stockpiles of weapons mass destruction , he has abused the trust of the American people and no longer deserves to be in office , Kucinich said .
" There 's kind of an imperial vice presidency that 's moved in , " he said .
" And I think that congress has to move forward to use the remedies that our founders set forth in the early debates about making those that hold the highest offices accountable . "

VoteVets president : ' President Bush has destroyed the armed forces ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday July 18 , 2007 Print This Email This Fox News on Wednesday presented a debate between two Iraq War veterans with opposite positions .
Pete Hegseth of vetsforfreedom.org said the announcement of the capture of an al Qaeda leader in Iraq was " great news " that " continues to reinforce the fact that we 're fighting more than just a nationalistic insurgency there .
... Iraq will be the front line in their global war against America . "
John Soltz of VoteVets.org replied that " obviously the surge is like spitting in the ocean .
...
We need 160,000 combat troops just for Baghdad .
Unfortunately , President Bush has destroyed the armed forces of the United States , and the military 's completely overextended .
...
We can't maintain these force levels . "
When asked to speculate about the state of Iraq if the US pulls out , Solz replied , " That depends on how we leave .
...
If we come up with a responsible plan like we have in the Reid - Levin bill ... it can be very different . "
He said further that if we stay in Iraq , " leaving American forces in this level not only destroys our ability to project force , but it strengthens Iran and al Qaeda . "
Hegseth argued that if the US left , Iraq would become " safe haven part 2 " from which al Qaeda could attack " our allies in Europe . "
Soltz responded that " if we continue to stay in Iraq , we leave this country vulnerable to terrorist threats from the people that attacked this country on 9/11 . "
The following video is from Fox 's Fox & Friends , broadcast on July 18 .
As a junior - level programmer in a non-major metropolitan area , Jim knew he would n't land the most glamorous programming job .
Needless to say , he did n't quite expect having to work with The Tool ...
I work for a mid-sized software company that developers web sites and web applications for different clients .
Nothing too fancy , just the standard " UI layer to business layer to database layer " applications .
Before getting hired , I never thought to ask what type of technology they use to develop their web applications .
I 've used several different platforms and was open to using whatever they used .
At least , I thought I would be .
Did they use ASP.
NET to deveop web sites ?
No .
JSP ?
No .
Servlets ?
No .
PHP ?
No .
... Perl ?
No .
They invented their own platform called The Tool .
It is a web - based web - development system that stores content , business logic , and other application information in a database .
At least , that 's what I 've heard .
We 've only had one client that needed " web application " stuff , so all that I 've ever seen The Tool used for is simple , content - only web sites .
And that 's my job -- to build and maintain simple , content - only web sites with The Tool .
I suppose one thing that 's nice about The Tool is that no knowledge of HTML is required .
In fact , The Tool does n't even let you use HTML when designing a web page .
Instead , text content must be displayed using a Label .
Labels must be placed in Containers , which can contain other Containers , Labels , Images , and Hyperlinks .
Seems pretty logical , I suppose .
However , the problem with Labels is that they do not support line breaks or , from the general restriction , HTML BR tags .
Couple that with the fact that Labels support only 128 characters and you 're left with blocks of text that must must be broken out , line by line , into a pair of separate Labels with each pair contained in a Container , and each Container contained in another Container .
All this using a slow , quirky , unstable , custom - built web interface .
Note that this shot of The Tool represents only the controls needed for four lines of text .
In case it is n't clear from the shot about , The Tool is not a WYSIWYG editor .
Nor does it have a preview function .
In order to view the page in progress , the CachedPages table must be truncated and the web server worker process must be restarted .
And since The Tool can be run only on a server , the cache flushes need to done at scheduled times throughout the day .
In an effort to make life easier , I asked if I could tweak The Tool 's interface .
I offered to do it in my spare time and , since it was used only internally by us web developers , I did n't think it'd be a problem .
To my surprise , I was hastily turned down .
As it turns out , The Tool is proprietary and a highly - guarded trade secret .
Because of such a high turnaround , they can't let just anyone see the source code .
Only developers with tenure of at least two years get that pleasure .
Thankfully , I start a new job next Monday .
And this time , I found out what technology they used first .

The other day I wanted to connect my iPod to a pair of speakers I have that have a normal stereo mini jack .
I was in Union Sq , so I thought I ’d head on up to Circuit City – I managed to find what I was looking for – A Belkin 3.5 mm audio cable .
I then looked at the price tag – $ 21.99 !
Let me emphasize – this is a piece of wire with two little simple ubiquitous plugs on it !
That ’s almost an order of magnitude more than Belkin ’s own price ( $ 3.99 ) – or , as it turns out , Virgin Megastore ’s price ( $ 3.99 ) on the same block !
And yes , it ’s the same item # – F8V203-06 - APL .
By the time I had finished reading the Observer this week , I was shaking .
There was a review of Lauren Slater 's new book about my father , BF Skinner .
According to Opening Skinner 's Box : Great Psychological Experiments of the Twentieth Century , my father , who was a psychologist based at Harvard from the 1950s to the 90s , " used his infant daughter , Deborah , to prove his theories by putting her for a few hours a day in a laboratory box . . . in which all her needs were controlled and shaped " .
But it 's not true .
My father did nothing of the sort .
I have heard the lies before , but seeing them in black and white in a respected Sunday newspaper felt as if somebody had punched me hard in the stomach .
Admittedly , the facts of my unusual upbringing sound dodgy : esteemed psychologist BF Skinner , who puts rats and pigeons in experimental boxes to study their behaviour , also puts his baby daughter in a box .
This is good fodder for any newspaper .
There was a prominent Harvard psychologist whose daughter was psychotic and had to be institutionalised ; but it was n't my father .
The early rumours were simple , unembellished : I had gone crazy , sued my father , committed suicide .
My father would come home from lecture tours to report that three people had asked him how his poor daughter was getting on .
I remember family friends returning from Europe to relate that somebody they had met there had told them I had died the year before .
The tale , I later learned , did the rounds of psychology classes across America .
One shy schoolmate told me years later that she had shocked her college psychology professor , who was retelling the rumour about me , by banging her fist on her desk , standing up and shouting , " She 's not crazy ! "
Slater 's sensationalist book rehashes some of the old stuff , but offers some rumours that are entirely new to me .
For my first two years , she reports , my father kept me in a cramped square cage that was equipped with bells and food trays , and arranged for experiments that delivered rewards and punishments .
Then there 's the story that after my father " let me out " , I became psychotic .
Well , I did n't .
That I sued him in a court of law is also untrue .
And , contrary to hearsay , I did n't shoot myself in a bowling alley in Billings , Montana .
I have never even been to Billings , Montana .
My early childhood , it 's true , was certainly unusual - but I was far from unloved .
I was a much cuddled baby .
Call it what you will , the " aircrib " , " baby box " , " heir conditioner " ( not my father 's term ) was a wonderful alternative to the cage - like cot .
My father 's intentions were simple , and based on removing what he and my mother saw as the worst aspects of a baby 's typical sleeping arrangements : clothes , sheets and blankets .
These not only have to be washed , but they restrict arm and leg movement and are a highly imperfect method of keeping a baby comfortable .
My mother was happy .
She had to give me fewer baths and of course had fewer clothes and blankets to wash , so allowing her more time to enjoy her baby .
I was very happy , too , though I must report at this stage that I remember nothing of those first two and a half years .
I am told that I never once objected to being put back inside .
I had a clear view through the glass front and , instead of being semi-swaddled and covered with blankets , I luxuriated semi-naked in warm , humidified air .
The air was filtered but not germ - free , and when the glass front was lowered into place , the noise from me and from my parents and sister was dampened , not silenced .
I loved my father dearly .
He was fantastically devoted and affectionate .
But perhaps the stories about me would never have started if he had done a better job with his public image .
He believed that , although our genes determine who we are , it is mostly our environment that shapes our personality .
A Time Magazine cover story ran the headline " BF Skinner says we can't afford freedom " .
All he had said was that controls are an everyday reality - traffic lights and a police force , for instance - and that we need to organise our social structures in ways that create more positive controls and fewer aversive ones .
As is clear from his utopian novel , Walden Two , the furthest thing from his mind was a totalitarian or fascist state .
His careless descriptions of the aircrib might have contributed to the public 's common misconception as well .
He was too much the scientist and too little the self - publicist - especially hazardous when you are already a controversial figure .
He used the word " apparatus " to describe the aircrib , the same word he used to refer to his experimental " Skinner " boxes for rats and pigeons .
The effect on me ?
Who knows ?
I was a remarkably healthy child , and after the first few months of life only cried when injured or inoculated .
I did n't have a cold until I was six .
I 've enjoyed good health since then , too , though that may be my genes .
Frankly , I 'm surprised the contraption never took off .
A few aircribs were built during the late 50s and 60s , and somebody also produced plans for DIY versions , but the traditional cot was always going to be a smaller and cheaper option .
My sister used one for her two daughters , as did hundreds of other couples , mostly with some connection to psychology .
My father 's opponents must have been gratified to hear - and maybe keen to pass on - the tales about his child - rearing contraption and crazy daughter .
Friends who heard an abridged chapter of Slater 's book on Radio 4 , or read the reviews , have been phoning to ask if I had really sued my father or had a psychotic episode .
I wonder how many friends or colleagues have been afraid to ask , and how many now think about me in a different light .
Why should n't the reviews give the rumours as facts , since that 's what the book did itself ?
The plain reality is that Lauren Slater never bothered to check the truth of them ( although she claims to have tried to track me down ) .
Instead , she chose to do me and my family a disservice and , at the same time , to debase the intellectual history of psychology .
In his Observer review , Tim Adams at least suspected something was amiss with Slater 's research .
He realised she could have contacted me to confirm or verify what she suspected , but plainly had n't .
His conclusion ?
I had gone into hiding .
Well , here I am , telling it like it is .
I 'm not crazy or dead , but I 'm very angry .
· Opening Skinner 's Box ; Great Psychological Experiments of the Twentieth Century , by Lauren Slater , Bloomsbury , £ 16.99 .
Ian Bicking wrote a post recently titled “ Python ’s Makefile ” .
He advocates using / re-using distutils … er… setuptools .
( I ca n’t keep them straight - they ’ve both become absolute nightmares in my opinion ) .
He then goes off about entry points , separate setup.cfg files , and other things that still go way over my head .
The example he shows is convoluted , and I ’m ultimately not entirely sure what he ’s really advocating ( besides the idea - which is n’t bad - of using the near - standard setup.py file / system instead of re-inventing ) .
But he mentions , earlier :
Because really people are talking about something more like rake — something where you can put together a bunch of code management tools .
These are n’t commands provided by the code , these are commands used on the code .
We do have the infrastructure for this in Python , but no one is really using it .
So I ’m writing this to suggest people use it more : the setup .py file .
So where in another environment someone does rake COMMAND , we can do python setup .py COMMAND .
For me , having an easy way to say bla bla COMMAND is n’t as important as having a good system for automating common tasks that I and / or my colleagues do frequently .
As we started to depend on more and more code from internal and external repositories , due to our increased re-use when building on Zope 3 , I really needed to automate checkouts and exports .
Not everything was neatly packaged as an egg , or the released egg did n’t have a bugfix applied , and I still do n’t understand how to make eggs work well with Zope 3 in a manner that I ’m comfortable with .
I was initially excited about zc.buildout as a way to automate the monotonous but important tasks that revolve around setting up both deployment and development environments .
But I did n’t like how zc. buildout specified its tasks / commands in INI format .
It was relatively easy to write new ‘ recipes ’ , so I wrote some recipes to do Subversion and CVS checkouts / exports .
But the INI format just pissed me off .
It did n’t fit my needs , basically , wherein I needed more conditional control .
More code control .
And managing complex sets of parameters required making new top - level sections instead of nesting .
Before long I was staring at a very long and very narrow file .
And in the end , it was building Zope in a way that would n’t work for us .
So I abandoned it .
I briefly looked at some tools that let you write these task files in “ pure ” Python .
In this way , Scons appeared to be the closest thing in Python to Rake , which uses Ruby .
But Scons seemed far more focused on general compilation issues ( compiling C , Java , etc ) , but that ’s never a problem that crosses my path .
I just wanted something like rake .
What I liked about every Rakefile that I ’ve seen is that it ’s been quite readable .
Rake makes common file / path commands readily available as Ruby methods , classes , and objects .
Rake takes advantage of Ruby ’s syntax , particularly blocks ( and optional parenthesis ) in a way that makes it not seem like , well , Ruby .
It looks like something makefile - ish , something shell - scripting - ish , etc .
That ’s what I wanted ; but , of course , in Python .
So I came up with a system .
It ’s not yet released to the world - far from finished , and there are many competing ideas out there that I do n’t feel like competing with - but it ’s already proven to be very useful internally .
Generally , it ’s been used to automate what I mentioned above : retrieving software from multiple repositories , both Subversion and CVS , and placing them in the proper directories .
In particular , we try to stick with certain revisions for third party dependencies , and I got tired of trying to capture this information in READMEs and other files that we could refer to when installing certain configurations .
It ’s even been useful for downloading such software and applying internal patches : :
patch = Command ( ' patch ' ) @task ( ' mysqldbda ' ) def mysqldbda ( ) : " " " Installs mysqldbda from subversion and applies patch " " " svn = Subversion ( ' svn://svn.zope.org/repos/main') svn.co('mysqldbda/tags/mysqldbda-1.0.0 ' , target=' mysqldbda ' ) # patch mysqldbda log.info( " patching mysqldbda " ) patchfile = path ( ' fixes / mysqlda.1-5-07.patch ' ) if patchfile.exists ( ) : print patch.read ( ' - p1 ' , ' - i ' , patchfile ) @task ( ' formencode ' ) def formencode ( ) : svn = Subversion ( ' http://svn.colorstudy.com/FormEncode') svn.co( 'tags/0.6/formencode ' ) task ( ' install ' , [ ' mysqldbda ' , ' formencode ' ] )
It ’s also been useful for tasks like getting MochiKit and generating all sorts of packed versions .
A lot of what makes this possible is the path .
py module , which provides a more object - oriented interface over os , os. path , and other Python file utilities .
ROCKFILEPATH = globals ( ) .
get ( ' ROCKFILEPATH ' , path ( '. ' ) )
MOCHIKIT_LIB = ROCKFILEPATH /'libs '/' mochikit' MOCHIKIT_DL = ROCKFILEPATH/'mochikit_dl'
MOCHIKIT_SRC = MOCHIKIT_DL /' MochiKit ' SCRATCH = MOCHIKIT_LIB /'_scratch.js ' mochikit = namespace ( ' mochikit ' ) @mochikit.task ( ' get ' ) def getmochikit( ) : if MOCHIKIT_DL.exists ( ) and bool ( MOCHIKIT_DL.listdir( ) ) : return svn = Subversion ( ' http://svn.mochikit.com/mochikit') svn.co( ' trunk ' , target=MOCHIKIT_DL ) @mochikit.task( ' clearmochilib ') def clearmochilib ( ) : for jscript in MOCHIKIT_LIB.files ( '*.js ' ) : jscript.remove( ) @mochikit.task ( ' make - noexport ') def makenoexport ( ) : info = Subversion ( ) .info( MOCHIKIT_DL ) src = NOEXPORT.safe_substitute (** info ) file ( MOCHIKIT_LIB/' NoExport.js ' , 'w' ) .write( src ) @mochikit.task ( ' build ' , [ ' get ' , ' clearmochilib ' , ' make - noexport ' ] ) def mochi_install( ) : for source in MOCHIKIT_SRC.files ( '*.js ' ) : log.info( ' copy %s -> %s ' % ( source , MOCHIKIT_LIB ) ) source.copy ( MOCHIKIT_LIB ) # Javascript Packing tools ( JSPack not shown - essentially it's a wrapper # around combining and piping Javascript through Dojo's custom_rhino . jar # to use its compression system ) def packmodules ( sourcedir , modules , target ) : mods = [ ( sourcedir / mod ) for mod in modules ] log.info( ' Packing %s modules ' , path ( target ) .
name ) JSPack ( mods , target ) .run ( ) if SCRATCH.exists ( ) : SCRATCH.remove ( ) def jsmin( sources , target ) : packmodules ( MOCHIKIT_LIB , sources , MOCHIKIT_LIB /' min ' / target ) @mochikit.task ( ' minimize ') def mochiMinimize ( ) : " " " Generates packed versions of most individual MochiKit files , while combining a few core ones together . " " " mindir = MOCHIKIT_LIB /' min ' for jscript in mindir. files ('*.js ' ) : jscript.remove( ) jsmin( [ ' NoExport.js ' , ' Base.js ' , ' Iter.js ' , ' DOM.js ' ] , ' base-iter - dom.js ' ) jsmin ( [ ' Style.js ' , ' Signal.js ' ] , ' style - signal.js ' ) jsmin ( [ ' Async.js ' ] , ' async.js ' ) jsmin( [ ' Color.js ' ] , ' color.js ' ) # ... mochikit.task ( ' install ' , [ ' build ' , ' minimize ' ] ) .comment ( ' INSTALL !')
I do n’t think this falls under the jurisdiction of setup.py ( distutils /setuptools ) .
Nor would I want to specify these as zc.buildout recipes and have a separate configuration file to then name all of the files and directories .
And , being Python , I do n’t really have to deal with compilation steps so I do n’t need wrappers around gcc and friends .
I ’m not ( yet ) specifying how to build large deployment scenarios .
I just need to automate some development tasks , and I need to be able to write them easily .
I want to write them in Python , but I want to ensure that they do n’t accidentally get imported into normal projects ( hence , the files above do n’t have a .py extension ) .
And as this is a specialized task , I ’ll allow myself to get away with Python shortcuts that I would never touch in normal development , such as import * .
In fact , it ’s the import * that gives me a lot of the common commands / tools , such as the classes for interacting with Subversion and CVS , managing working directories , etc .
This really stemmed from reading this article by Martin Fowler about people wanting to replace ant with Rake with the advent of JRuby .
In the post , Martin states :
The thing with build scripts is that you need both declarative and procedural qualities .
The heart of a build file is defining tasks and the dependencies between them .
This is the declarative part , and is where tools like ant and make excel .
The trouble is that as builds get more complex these structures are n’t enough .
You begin to need conditional logic ; in particular you need the ability to define your own abstractions .
( See my rake article for examples . )
Rake ’s strength is that it gives you both of these .
It provides a simple declarative syntax to define tasks and dependencies , but because this syntax is an internal DomainSpecificLanguage , you can seamlessly weave in the full power of Ruby .
At that point , I decided that this was the way to go : use Python decorators to wrap ‘ task ’ functions .
The wrapper maintains dependency links , comments , and other things of interest to the internal system ; and the wrapper allows the task name to be independent of the function name , allowing easier - to - type tasks for use from the file system .
But the ‘ task ’ function is plain Python .
Or , like some of the examples above show , task can be called without the @ symbol that makes it a decorator .
Multiple callable actions can be added to a task , potentially allowing for more ‘ declarative ’ style :
mochikit.task (' minimize').using_action ( JSMinMap ( {' style-signal.js ' : [ ' Style.js ' , ' Signal.js ']} , {'async.js ' : [' Async.js ']} , ) )
Useful , I imagine , for very common patterns .
Er. “ Recipes ” .
In any case , it ’s a very useful kind of tool .
Beats setup.py , INI , or XML based automation language any day .

When Samson the dog decides he fancies a lie - down on the settee , everyone else scatters .
And it 's no wonder visitors think again about walking up the garden path when he jumps on the gate to greet them .
Three - year - old Samson is a cross between two of the biggest breeds , the Great Dane and Newfoundland .
He is 37in at the shoulder , stands 6ft 5in on his hind legs and weighs an astonishing 19st 10lb .
Scroll down for more
If there 's a bigger dog in Britain , then Samson 's owners Ray and Julie Woods would n't want to meet it on a dark night .
But despite his huge bulk , they are happy for him to play with their eight - year - old , 4ft 3in grandson Josh , pictured right .
" Samson is so gentle and would n't harm a fly , " said Mrs Woods , 54 , from Boston , Lincolnshire .
The couple spend £ 60 a month on dried dog food and Samson gets through two large bowls a day , with the odd turkey leg for a treat .
Scroll down for more
Mr Woods , 65 , said other dogs keep a safe distance when they spot Samson straining on the leash during their daily eight - mile walks .
The couple found Samson at an RSPCA centre when he was six months old .
His parents belonged to the same owner and were not meant to mate but managed to produce a litter of 11 , of which Samson was by far the biggest .
Guinness World Records has scrapped its entry for heaviest dog because owners were overfeeding pets .
Ants use manners to cut through crowds ABC Science Online
Associate Professor Martin Burd from ( Linepithema humile ) to model the behaviour of panicking crowds .
And he is working with traffic engineering experts to develop better crowd - flow control systems .
Burd , an evolutionary ecologist , says preliminary research into this introduced species of ant backs the ' slower is faster ' paradox of crowd behaviour .
" If the average speed of each individual moving is slower , the whole crowd is evacuated faster , and ants are actually doing this , " he says .
" Ants in a panic do n't behave the same way as humans .
They stay calm and are polite to each other .
They are not trying to save their own lives , but are behaving for the good of the group . "
Although humans are unlikely to follow the sacrificial example lead of the Argentine ant , Burd says panicking crowds can be made to move more orderly through clever building design .
" Perversely if you simply put a pillar in front of the doorway you increase the evacuation speed , " he says .
" Having that obstruction stops people jamming against other people in the doorway . "
Evacuations
Another suggestion is to insert a divider rail down a corridor to create lanes that slow down movement and make traffic flow more orderly .
While the study may potentially help evacuations during a terrorist act , Burd says the real benefit of the research would be in more ordinary disasters such as a fire .
He says it can also be used in major outdoor events to better manage crowd movements .
The idea for Burd 's study came while trying to navigate the crowd at Melbourne 's Flinders Street Station on New Year 's Eve .
Dense crowds
" I just thought there 's got to be a better way to handle these dense crowds , " he says .
Burd says ants are used to model traffic behaviour because they naturally form lines and follow physical pathways .
" The point of ants is that they have natural traffic behaviour and that closely relates to crowd movement . "
Monash University 's Graham Currie , a professor of public transport , is working with Burd on modelling the ant movements .
He says he was originally sceptical about the research .
But after two years studying ant traffic behaviour he says his mind has been " opened up " .
" The fact is we have been dealing with traffic congestion and individual people flow for about 2000 years , while ants have been dealing with it for millions of years , " he says .
" Ants work together with a communal instinct .
These behaviours can be learned and we can learn from them . "

Suppose you are a programmer and you have to build a large , complicated application .
You have to break up the code into pieces so you can keep everything straight and not get lost .
For years , programmers have divided code into interconnected hierarchies of objects , a practice called object - oriented programming .
Service Oriented Architecture is an alternative code organization , based on services .
For example , you might have a weather service that returns weather conditions , given a city .
A service is a chunk of code that has several properties :
A service can take requests
Given a well - formed request , a service will send a response
A service can use other services
Service Oriented Architecture has become a major buzzword in the software design community , and everyone and his code monkey is claiming to use it .
So if it does n’t do what ’s promised , a lot of people are going to lose a lot of money .
A procedure can take requests called “ Procedure Calls ”
Given a well - formed request , a procedure will provide a response
A procedure can use other procedures
Plus ça change , plus c’est la même chose .
Many people have noted my interest in software architecture and steered me in the direction of the big new thing , Service Oriented Architecture .
I am always bemused by SOA , not least of which is that I ca n’t help but think that the acronym is unfinished and really needs a “ B ” on the end .
I am pleased to tell you that SOA really does work , and has been proven to work in the field , under rigourous conditions , by real programmers and not just consultants touting books or neophyte programmers trying to inflate their resumés .
Those of you born after 1980 will be surprised to hear that SOA was first invented in the 1960s .
They called in Procedural Programming in those days , and it featured this nifty abstraction where :
It worked remarkably well , so well that in 1976 or thereabouts , somebody got the bright idea that you should be able to call procedures on other systems , so that a program talking to the user on a system in their office might invoke a procedure on a different computer running a database .
This was called a remote procedure call , a remarkably simple name : you take the name of the thing you already understand and merely explain how it is slightly different .
The industry sliced and diced this idea , reinventing it many times .
For example , one company was not satisfied with calling things procedures and remote procedure calls , so it invented the new acronyms COM and DCOM .
I am told that academics have proven that a computer program which prints all of the variations of this idea cannot be proven to halt , possibly because we invent new ones faster than we can list the old ones .
But I am quite sure that SOA is nothing more or less than that old idea , wearing new clothes worthy of an emperor .
And when I see criticism of SOA , I am quite sure that it is fully congruent to valid criticism of Procedural Programming .
For example , when told that SOA can cause Strange Loops , I think of John Lakos ’excellent book Large - Scale C++ Software Design , where he spends 896 pages explaining how to eliminate the loops from large C++ programs for speed of compilation and testability .
Or when told that SOA hides the implementation of services , so that clients cannot be sure when the behaviour of services change , I am reminded of a very old debate about Leaky Abstractions .
I do not expect this debate to go away any time soon , even if we discard SOA in favour of the next shiny consulting toy .
Of course , Procedural Programming was supplanted in the mainstream “ Blub ” community by Object - Oriented Programming .
I am not surprised to see that the main opponents of SOA advocate something called “ REST . ” REST ’s chief feature seems to be that it favours decomposing large architectures into a taxonomy of entities with well - defined interfaces ( PUT , GET , DELETE , and so forth ) .
Alphonse Karr said it best :
Republican and Democratic congressional leaders rarely agree on a major issue .
Yet both House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - San Francisco ) and Minority Leader John A. Boehner ( R - Ohio ) have gone on the record as opposing the current $ 25 - billion farm subsidy system , which Congress is rewriting this month .
Changing the system wo n’t be easy .
They will have to battle the powerful agriculture lobby and its allies on the House Agriculture Committee , who are once again employing Norman Rockwell imagery to assert that farm subsidies are an all - American necessity that ensures an adequate food supply and alleviates farmer poverty .
But two seemingly arcane aspects of farm policy undermine both claims .
First , farm subsidy eligibility is restricted to growers of only a few crops .
Second , once a farmer ’s eligibility is established , subsidies increase with the size of the farm .
These make farm subsidies just another narrowly targeted corporate welfare program .
On the first point , producers of just five crops -- wheat , cotton , corn , soybeans and rice -- receive nearly all farm subsidies .
In fact , only one - third of the $ 240 billion in annual farm production is targeted for subsidies .
All other farmers -- including growers of fruits , vegetables , livestock and poultry -- receive nearly nothing .

This raises the question :
If farm subsidies are necessary to produce an adequate food supply with stable prices and thriving farmers , why have n’t the growers of nonsubsidized crops experienced these problems ?
Walk into any supermarket and you will quickly find yourself surrounded by farm products , from apples to oranges , beef to chicken , that are produced and distributed without farm subsidies .
Yet their prices and supplies are relatively stable , and the farmers ’ incomes are just as high as those of subsidized farmers .
The free market works for all other farm production , and it can surely work for producers of wheat , cotton , corn , soybeans and rice .
These crop eligibility restrictions also undermine the second justification for subsidies : alleviating farmer poverty .
If that were the purpose , there would be no reason to favor one crop over another .
After all , lawmakers would never create a welfare program that was restricted to workers in certain industries .
Creating a farmer poverty program that serves only growers of certain crops ( regardless of income ) makes no more sense .
Today , a rice agribusiness can collect millions of dollars in aid while a low - income apple grower receives nothing .
Furthermore , most farmers are not poor .
According to the Department of Agriculture , the average farm household earns $ 81,420 annually and enjoys a net worth of $ 838,875 -- both well above the national average .
Farm incomes are setting records , and the industry ’s business failure rate is among the lowest .

Of course , some family farmers continue to struggle .
But if subsidies were really designed to alleviate farmer poverty , then lawmakers could guarantee every full - time farmer an income of 185 % of the federal poverty level ( $ 38,203 for a family of four ) for under $ 5 billion annually -- one - fifth the current cost of farm subsidies .
Instead , federal farm policies specifically bypass family farmers .
Subsidies are paid per acre , so the largest ( and most profitable ) agribusinesses automatically receive the biggest checks .
Consequently , commercial farmers -- who report an average annual income of $ 200,000 and a net worth of nearly $ 2 million -- collect the majority of farm subsidies .
Fortune 500 companies , celebrity “ hobby farmers ” and even some members of Congress collect millions of dollars under this program .
These farm policies are more than merely ineffective -- they impose substantial harm .
They cost Americans $ 25 billion in taxes and an additional $ 12 billion in higher food prices annually .
Environmental damage results from farmers over - planting crops in order to maximize subsidies .
By undermining the nation ’s trade negotiations , subsidies raise consumer prices and restrict U.S. exports .
Cotton subsidies undercut African farmers , keeping them in desperate poverty .
And as Michael Pollan , author of “ The Omnivore ’s Dilemma , ” has written , farm subsidies contribute to obesity , rising healthcare costs and early death by subsidizing corn and soy ( from which sugars and fats are derived ) rather than healthier fruits and vegetables .

Even small farmers are harmed .
Excluded from most subsidies , they must endure the lower crop prices , higher farmland costs and industry consolidation that result from subsidies to agribusiness .
Lawmakers would be hard - pressed to enact a set of policies more destructive to farmers , taxpayers , consumers , the environment , trade , global anti-poverty efforts and even our health than the current farm policies .

What Is Persuasion ?
Persuasion is the act of getting a sentient being other than yourself to adopt a particular belief or pursue a particular action .
This tutorial will teach you how to excel at doing just that .
Our examples will assume a variety of different specific circumstances , but the principles we present will be applicable in a myriad of situations .
Whether you 're trying to persuade a pseudo - intellectual that his political beliefs are , in fact , as savory as unwashed socks , or whether you 're trying to persuade a vicious dog to please kindly release your coccyx , the techniques of persuasion you must employ are fundamentally the same .
To be persuasive , you must make use of a number of different tactics .
The more you can utilize in conjunction with each other , the more persuasive your argument will be .
We will start by isolating and identifying each of the different techniques , and then we 'll show how they can be used together in a single compelling argument .
Verbal Techniques
As debating is primarily a verbal undertaking , most of the techniques you will need are verbal in nature .
We 'll start with those , then look at how you can polish off your style with other types of techniques .
Stubbornness
The cornerstone of good persuasive arguing is stubbornness .
You must never , under any circumstances , concede that your opponent might ever possibly be right .
Openmindedness has led to the downfall of many great debaters .
If you find yourself doubting the correctness of your position , do n't let it show .
Repeat to yourself , " I am right .
I am right . "
If you can't convince yourself that you 're right , you 'll never convince others that they 're wrong .
Here is an example of the use of stubbornness in a debate :
You : " The moon is made of cheese . "
" The moon is made of cheese . "
Opponent : " Umm .
It 's a proven fact that the moon is NOT made of cheese . "
" Umm .
It 's a proven fact that the moon is NOT made of cheese . "
You : " The moon is made of cheese . "
" The moon is made of cheese . "
Opponent : " Ok , look , I have a piece of moon ROCK at my house .
It is not made of cheese .
It is made of ROCK . "
" Ok , look , I have a piece of moon ROCK at my house .
It is not made of cheese .
It is made of ROCK . "
You : " The moon is made of cheese . "
" The moon is made of cheese . "
Opponent : " No , it is n't .
We 've sent ships to the moon .
People landed on it .
They looked at it .
They said it was made of ROCK .
They brought back ROCK .
It is made out of ROCK . "
" No , it is n't .
We 've sent ships to the moon .
People landed on it .
They looked at it .
They said it was made of ROCK .
They brought back ROCK .
It is made out of ROCK . "
You : " The moon is made of cheese . "
Strategic Compromise
Compromise would seem to be prohibited by the previous tip about stubbornness ,
but it 's not , because you should only use compromise as a diversionary tactic .
Do n't ever compromise your main point .
But if you introduce points you do n't even care about , then compromise on them later , you can often trick your opponent into conceding .
For example :
You : " We should go out to eat tonight . "
" We should go out to eat tonight . "
Opponent : " But we ate out last night , and we need to save our money . "
" But we ate out last night , and we need to save our money . "
You : " I do n't care .
We should go out to eat tonight , and then we 'll treat ourselves and all of our neighbors to a Broadway play . "
" I do n't care .
We should go out to eat tonight , and then we 'll treat ourselves and all of our neighbors to a Broadway play . "
Opponent : " But that would cost a fortune ! "
" But that would cost a fortune ! "
You : " Yeah , I suppose you 're right .
Gosh , that would run hundreds of dollars , would n't it ? "
" Yeah , I suppose you 're right .
Gosh , that would run hundreds of dollars , would n't it ? "
Opponent : " Yes , it would . "
" Yes , it would . "
You : " Ok , just dinner it is , then . "
Big Words
Use of big words is persuasive several times over .
They make you look all smart and other people look all stupid ; hence , your argument becomes the more compelling .
Furthermore , use of big words means you 'll talk longer , and usually whoever talks the most is the most convincing .
" Wow , look at all he has to say about this , " people will say to themselves as they observe you making a protracted argument .
" He must know a lot about this subject . "
By way of example , compare the persuasiveness of the following two statements :
" Hockey is better than football . "
" You are the manifest profusion of delusional ideology incarnate if you do not fulminate against the institution of football with great superciliousness and promulgate the preeminence of hockey . "
Forgetfulness
Forgetfulness is a powerful debating tool .
You must use this tool wisely , because it can be a devastating weapon in your fight against ignorance .
Here is what you should do : in the middle of your argument , forget what you 're talking about .
This may sound counterproductive , but by forgetting your point you show the person you 're debating with that he is so utterly wrong , it 's not worth the trouble to follow the course of the conversation .
For example :
You : " Virginia has never produced any good presidents . "
" Virginia has never produced any good presidents . "
Opponent : " Yes it has .
Actually , most of our better presidents came from Virginia . "
" Yes it has .
Actually , most of our better presidents came from Virginia . "
You : " But that 's exactly what I 'm saying ... I think ... I dunno ... I forgot . "
" But that 's exactly what I 'm saying ... I think ... I dunno ... I forgot . "
Opponent : " So we agree ? "
" So we agree ? " You : " Yup . I 'm right . "
Interruption
Talk relentlessly , especially when your opponent is also trying to talk .
Interrupt constantly .
If you never give your opposition a chance to give the other side , you win by default .
Opponent : " Australia seems like a cool place to visit . "
" Australia seems like a cool place to visit . "
You : " What ?
How can you say that ?
Australia is too hot !
You 'll die of thirst !
And there are diseases and wild dogs --"
" What ?
How can you say that ?
Australia is too hot !
You 'll die of thirst !
And there are diseases and wild dogs --" Opponent : " But - - "
" But - -" You : " -- and you can't see the ground because there are so many snakes and spiders , and they are ALL DEADLY .
But that 's ok , because the jet lag will be so extreme that you 'll spend your entire vacation sleeping in the hotel room , which will probably smell and have deadly spiders crawling --"
" -- and you can't see the ground because there are so many snakes and spiders , and they are ALL DEADLY .
But that 's ok , because the jet lag will be so extreme that you 'll spend your entire vacation sleeping in the hotel room , which will probably smell and have deadly spiders crawling --" Opponent : " No - - "
" No - - " You : " -- around it , and plus everybody talks funny , and they 're all CRAZY .
Have you SEEN ' The Crocodile Hunter ' ?
The hole in the ozone down there gives them all brain cancer --"
" -- around it , and plus everybody talks funny , and they 're all CRAZY .
Have you SEEN ' The Crocodile Hunter ' ?
The hole in the ozone down there gives them all brain cancer --" Opponent : " B--"
" B--" You : " -- and they all get tumors which drive them insane ! "
" -- and they all get tumors which drive them insane ! "
Opponent : " ... "
" ... " You : " ... "
" ... " Opponent : " ... "
" ... " You : " ... "
" ... " Opponent : " Well - - "
" Well - - " You : " And furthermore , they 're all criminals !
Australia is just one big country - sized maximum security prison for thieves and murderers !
I can't believe ... "
Lies
Facts might be the best way to substantiate an argument , but lies are the next best thing .
If the facts do n't prove your point , make some up .
There are varying degrees of lies .
A " fib " is a small exaggeration of the truth .
A " hyperbole " is a larger exaggeration of the truth .
A " lie " is a statement that has nothing whatsoever to do with the truth .
A " big lie " is not only blatantly untrue but will cause your great grandmother to roll over in her grave with shame .
The big lie is normally the way to go .
You : " Dogs are better than cats . "
" Dogs are better than cats . "
Opponent : " I prefer cats . "
" I prefer cats . "
You : " But cats eat babies !
They dig their rabid muzzles into infants ' chests and rip their kidneys out ! "
" But cats eat babies !
They dig their rabid muzzles into infants ' chests and rip their kidneys out ! "
Opponent : " No they do n't ! "
" No they do n't ! "
You : " They do !
And they killed my great grandmother !
Twice ! "
Rhymes
No persuasive argument would be complete without a little rhyming .
Not only does it make you sound clever , but , when used correctly , it can make your opponent sound ignorant .
To employ this amazing persuasive tool , you take one of your opponent 's points and make up a nonsensical rhyming word to go with it .
This tactic has no known refutation .
You : " There are no people on this planet that do not believe in democracy . "
" There are no people on this planet that do not believe in democracy . "
Opponent : " Yes there are .
They 're called communists . "
" Yes there are .
They 're called communists . "
You : " Communists schmommunists ! "
" Communists schmommunists ! " Opponent : " ... "
Taunting
Taunting is a crucial element of a persuasive argument .
The purpose of taunting your opponent is to intimidate him into submission .
You : " Modern art is stupid , and Picasso was a loser . "
" Modern art is stupid , and Picasso was a loser . "
Opponent : " I disagree strongly .
Picasso was a visionary genius . "
" I disagree strongly .
Picasso was a visionary genius . "
You : " Nyah nyah nyah . "
" Nyah nyah nyah . "
Opponent : " Er , well , I am entitled to my opinion . "
" Er , well , I am entitled to my opinion . "
You : " Bring it on ! ! "
Random Comments
The interjection of random comments is a useful diversionary tactic .
Although the best way to win an argument is for your opponents to concede the debate to you , this last ditch effort can be used in an emergency to secure a secondary victory by disorienting your opponents so much they do n't know how to proceed .
This tactic has the side benefit of presenting yourself as knowledgeable on a wide range of subjects , so observers are bound to be impressed by your breadth of expertise .
You : " School lunches suck . "
" School lunches suck . "
Opponent : " Despite the taste , school lunches are , in actuality , very nutritional . "
" Despite the taste , school lunches are , in actuality , very nutritional . "
You : " On the contrary !
Mahogany is one of Honduras ' primary lumber exports . "
" On the contrary !
Mahogany is one of Honduras ' primary lumber exports . "
Opponent : " Mahogany ?
Honduras ?
This has nothing to do with school lunches ! "
" Mahogany ?
Honduras ?
This has nothing to do with school lunches ! "
You : " Yeah , well , I could beat you at arm wrestling ! "
" Yeah , well , I could beat you at arm wrestling ! "
Opponent : " What does -- But -- You --"
" Clearly "
When in doubt , say " clearly . "
It may not be clear , but your opposition does n't know that .
By offhandedly suggesting that a particular train of thought is obvious to you , you will come across as a daunting force of intelligence difficult to reckon with .
Opponent : " I do n't see how you can say clothing is immoral . "
" I do n't see how you can say clothing is immoral . "
You : " Clothing was invented as a means of concealing immorality .
Anyone wearing clothing is clearly doing so for the same reason . "
" Clothing was invented as a means of concealing immorality .
Anyone wearing clothing is clearly doing so for the same reason . "
Opponent : " No , people wear clothing for a number of reasons .
To stay warm , for example . "
" No , people wear clothing for a number of reasons .
To stay warm , for example . "
You : " Clearly , these reasons are rationalizations made up after the fact . "
Subliminal Messages
Subliminal messages are important components of a persuasive argument .
Why ?
Because subliminal messages cannot be argued .
If your opponent does n't know you are suggesting things to his subconscious mind , what possible rebuttal can he have ?
Convey subliminal messages by whispering under your breath quietly enough so that your opponent does not consciously hear .
Opponent : " I 'm afraid you 'll have to come with me . "
" I'm afraid you 'll have to come with me . "
You : " These are n't the droids you 're looking for . "
The Last Word
Above all , you must get the last word .
Getting the last word in an argument is terribly important , because it means everyone listening to the argument -- both those involved and those observing -- will leave with the last word as the dominant memory of the debate .
If you have the last word , that means your side will be the most remembered .
For example :
You : " Paper does not come from trees . "
" Paper does not come from trees . "
Opponent : " Yes it does .
My father works in a paper mill .
I have personally observed the process by which lumber is processed and turned into paper .
These four books I have here describe this procedure in minute detail . "
This certainly looks like an argument you 've lost , does n't it ?
But consider how much stronger a case you make for yourself with this slight modification :
You : " Paper does not come from trees . "
" Paper does not come from trees . "
Opponent : " Yes it does .
My father works in a paper mill .
I have personally observed the process by which lumber is processed and turned into paper .
These four books I have here describe this procedure in minute detail . "
" Yes it does .
My father works in a paper mill .
I have personally observed the process by which lumber is processed and turned into paper .
These four books I have here describe this procedure in minute detail . "
You : " Nuh-uh . "
Name Calling
Name calling is an efficient way of pointing out your opponents ' weaknesses and call into question the authority with which they dispute your position .
By encouraging your opponents to doubt their competence , you can undermine a contrary argument from the inside .
For example :
You : " I believe all short people should be beaten with rocks until they bleed . "
" I believe all short people should be beaten with rocks until they bleed . "
Opponent : " I think that 's a very horrible and malicious idea . "
" I think that 's a very horrible and malicious idea . "
You : " Well , you 're fat !
Fatty fat doo doo head ! "
" Well , you 're fat !
Fatty fat doo doo head ! "
Opponent : ( sobs )
Yelling
Yelling is one of the most instinctive and exciting methods of getting your point across .
It is also very effective .
When you yell , you gain people 's respect and awe .
The louder you yell , the more respect you incur .
When yelling , remember three rules :
Be loud loud loud .
If you are n't loud , you are n't yelling .
Accompany your yelling with eye bulging .
The further out of your head your eyes bulge , the more effective the yell .
Turn red .
Red is a color of power .
The redder you get , the more power you have .
Observe the logo for this tutorial , at the top of this page .
Notice how compelling the 'a ' is , because it is red ?
The other letters are quiescent and relatively nondescript .
But you would n't want to tangle with that ' a ' , would you ?
Witness the following use of the yelling tactic :
You : " Canada is a stupid country . "
" Canada is a stupid country . "
Opponent : " Canada is a fine country that has made many contributions to the world in the areas of economics , cuisine , and the arts . "
" Canada is a fine country that has made many contributions to the world in the areas of economics , cuisine , and the arts . "
You : " No it is n't !!!!
Canada is lame !!!!! "
" No it is n't !!!!
Canada is lame !!!!! "
Opponent : " That 's a totally unsubstantiated opinion . "
" That 's a totally unsubstantiated opinion . "
You : " SHUT UP !!!
CANADA IS A STUPID COUNTRY !!!!
STUPID !!!
STUPID !!!
CANADA SUCKS LIKE A VACUUM !!!!
BAD !!!!
BAD CANADA !!!
BAD !!! BAD !!! "
Swearing
Swearing is absolutely crucial if you want to convince someone of something .
Swearing is a sign of great articulation , vocabulary , and bravado .
By swearing , you can demonstrate that you are mature , for you understand mature concepts , and that you are daring enough to thwart the oppression of social convention .
You : " **** you , man !
****** Canada is a **** ******* *** of a ***** country !!!! "
"**** you , man !
****** Canada is a **** ******* *** of a ***** country !!!! "
Opponent : " Can you tone it down a bit ?
And Canada is a very important nation . "
" Can you tone it down a bit ?
And Canada is a very important nation . "
You : "***** *** * ***** ********
******, MAN !!!!
******!!!! "
"***** *** * ***** ********
******, MAN !!!!
******!!!! "
Opponent : " Could you please watch your language ? "
" Could you please watch your language ? "
You : " Oh , so **** you too , **** , you just go **** ****** *** **** your ***** *** ****** **** ***** **** *******!!!!!
**************!!! "
Physical Techniques
Even the most solidly constructed verbal arguments can crumble if your physical stature is not imposing enough to back it up .
Here we will discuss how you can use body language to support your arguments .
Flailing Arms
The flailing arms strategy is used to express surprise and to reinforce your arguments .
It 's very hard to disagree with someone who waves his arms in confidence .
For example :
Opponent : " Water is very important .
You need to drink it to survive . "
" Water is very important .
You need to drink it to survive . "
You : ( waving arms wildly ) " Water is poisonous ! "
" Water is poisonous ! " Opponent : " Whatever you say man , just please , do n't hurt me ! "
Being Tall
Physical stature is an important intimidation tool .
Your opponent is more likely to concede an argument if you appear to be bigger than he is .
Shortness is associated with children , who are dumb , while tallness is associated with authority figures who know better .
Consequently , you should never debate someone at anything less than eye level .
If your opponent is sitting , stand .
If your opponent is standing , stand taller .
Wear thick - soled shoes .
Stand on tip - toes .
Stand on chairs if you have to .
Another effective gesture you can make that increases the power of your presence is to make a fist with one hand and ominously punch the open palm of your other hand .
Here is an example of how physical intimidation can sway the course of a debate :
Opponent : ( sitting ) " I love old movies . "
" I love old movies . "
You : ( standing up ) " Old movies are all boring and stuffy . "
" Old movies are all boring and stuffy . "
Opponent : ( standing up ) " That 's just because you have no sense of taste .
Modern action flicks have dulled your brain . "
" That 's just because you have no sense of taste .
Modern action flicks have dulled your brain . "
You : ( standing on tiptoes ) " They 're boring , and the acting is bad . "
" They 're boring , and the acting is bad . "
Opponent : ( still standing )
" On the contrary , Laurence Olivier , for example , is one of the greatest actors of all time .
Um , what are you doing ? "
" On the contrary , Laurence Olivier , for example , is one of the greatest actors of all time .
Um , what are you doing ? "
You : ( standing on a chair ) " Old movies suck , and Laurence Olivier was a poser . " ( punches palm )
" Old movies suck , and Laurence Olivier was a poser . "
Opponent : " Uh. Riiiight . " ( sits down )
Biting
Biting is a last ditch effort .
You use this tactic when the other person has been given every opportunity to conform to your opinion and still refuses .
It is normally best to go for an important artery or organ .
The jugular vein is recommended , as it is located roughly at mouth height .
You : " I 'm right . "
" I 'm right . "
Opponent : " I do n't agree .
In my opinion , yo- -"
Using These Techniques Together
Here is a sample debate that illustrates each of the techinques given above .
Notice how , when used in conjunction with one another , you can create an unstoppable argument .
Stephen backs up his " Papa Bear " and defends his " non-ideological " crusade against JetBlue and DailyKos .

Concurrent and Parallel Programming
Haskell offers a broad spectrum of tools for developing parallel or concurrent programs .
For parallelism , Haskell libraries enable concise high - level parallel programs with results that are guaranteed to be deterministic , i.e. , independent of the number of cores and the scheduling being used .
Concurrency is supported with lightweight threads and high level abstractions such as software transactional memory for managing information shared across threads .
Distributed programming is still mainly a research area .
Some low - level tools ( MPI bindings ) and research prototypes are available and new approaches being developed , such as Cloud Haskell ( Erlang - style actors as a Haskell library ) .
This page lists libraries and extensions for programming concurrent and parallel applications in Haskell .
See also the parallel Haskell portal for research papers , tutorials and on parallel and concurrent Haskell .
Parallelism
Strategies and Par
Monad - par
An alternative parallel programming API to that provided by the parallel package .
The Par monad allows the simple description of parallel computations , and can be used to add parallelism to pure Haskell code .
The basic API is straightforward : the monad supports forking and simple communication in terms of IVars .
Data parallelism
Repa REgular PArallel arrays : high performance , regular , multi- dimensional , shape polymorphic parallel arrays .
Accelerate
An embedded language of array computations for high - performance computing in Haskell .
Computations on multi-dimensional , regular arrays are expressed in the form of parameterised collective operations ( such as maps , reductions , and permutations ) .
Data Parallel Haskell Implicitly parallel , high performance ( nested ) arrays , supporting large multicore programming .
Research efforts
Feedback - directed implicit parallelism Implicit parallelism in Haskell , and a feedback - directed mechanism to increase its granularity ( FDIP paper ) GpH : Glasgow Parallel Haskell A complete , GHC - based implementation of the parallel Haskell extension GpH and of evaluation strategies is available .
Extensions of the runtime - system and language to improve performance and support new platforms are under development .
Concurrency
Concurrent Haskell
Concurrent Haskell GHC has supported concurrency with lightweight threads for more than a decade , and it is very fast .
Threads in Haskell are preemptively scheduled and support everything you would normally expect from threads , including blocking I/O and foreign calls .
Documentation
Examples
Software transactional memory
Research efforts
Actors with multi-headed receive clauses Actor - based concurrency for Haskell CHP : Communicating Haskell Processes CHP is built on the ideas of CSP ( Communicating Sequential Processes ) , featuring encapsulated parallel processes ( no shared data ! ) communicating over synchronous channels .
This is a very composable mode that also allows choice on communications , so that a process may offer to either read on one channel or write on another , but will only take the first that is available .
Distributed programming
MPI
hMPI hMPI is an acronym for HaskellMPI .
It is a Haskell binding conforming to MPI ( Message Passing Interface ) standard 1.1/1.2 .
The programmer is in full control over the communication between the nodes of a cluster .
Haskell - MPI
Haskell - MPI provides a Haskell interface to MPI , built on top of the foreign function interface .
It is notionally a descendant of hMPI , but is mostly a rewrite .
Distributed Haskell
GdH : Glasgow Distributed Haskell GdH supports distributed stateful interactions on multiple locations .
It is a conservative extension of both Concurrent Haskell and GpH , enabling the distribution of the stateful IO threads of the former on the multiple locations of the latter .
The programming model includes forking stateful threads on remote locations , explicit communication over channels , and distributed exception handling .
Eden Eden extends
Haskell with a small set of syntactic constructs for explicit process specification and creation .
While providing enough control to implement parallel algorithms efficiently , it frees the programmer from the tedious task of managing low - level details by introducing automatic communication ( via head - strict lazy lists ) , synchronisation , and process handling .
Cloud Haskell Cloud Haskell is a domain - speciﬁc language for developing programs for a distributed computing environment .
Implemented as a shallow embedding in Haskell , it provides a message passing communication model , inspired by Erlang , without introducing incompatibility with Haskell ’s established shared - memory concurrency .

Raja Petra Kamarudin is the editor of a popular political website
The move comes as one of Malaysia 's leading online commentators has been questioned by police following a complaint by the main governing party .
The new rules would allow a suspect to be detained indefinitely , without being charged or put on trial .
But officials insist the law is not intended to strangle internet freedom .
Online critics
Deputy Prime Minister Najib Razak told The Straits Times that the move was aimed at getting some moderation in postings on the internet , especially on sensitive issues : " Some people feel that they have crossed the line , in making racist remarks , " he said .
But the BBC's Jonathan Kent in Kuala Lumpur says the government also appears increasingly concerned about the growing online criticism of its record .
Raja Petra Kamarudin , the editor of one of Malaysia 's most popular political websites , Malaysia Today , turned himself in to police on Wednesday , to answer allegations that he had mocked Islam and threatened racial harmony .
Bloggers who insult the king could be subject to anti-terror laws
" I was alleged to have insulted the king , and also Islam and incite racial hatred , so I am going in there to reply to all these charges .
I promise I 'm going to give them a hell of a tough time , " he told the BBC before he turned himself in .
He defended his website , saying : " Many people , especially the non-Malays in this country , do not have a forum to air their views . "
" We should not deny these people a chance to vent their feelings , " he said .
Malaysia Today is believed to attract around a quarter of a million visitors a day , giving it more readers than most Malaysian newspapers .
The BBC 's correspondent says that with a general election on the horizon , the government seems keen to send a signal to its online critics that it will only tolerate so much .
Uusi blogi laivasaunomisesta
Saunominen on upea harrastus , joka sopii kaiken ikäisille ihmisille .
Ei siis ihme , että siitä on tullut Suomen suositumpia vapaa - ajan harrastuksia .
Kaupungistuminen vähensi ihmisten saunomista , mutta sauna on tekemässä uutta tulemista myös kaupunkilaisten arkeen .
Saunominen on tutkitusti myös erinomaista terveydelle , sillä se muun muassa alentaa verenpainetta ja hoitaa ihoa .
Samalla sauna vilkastuttaa aineenvaihduntaa ja poistaa kuona - aineita .
Sauna on myös ainutlaatuisen rauhallinen paikka , joten saunomisella on myös vaikutusta mielialaan .
Jokainen suomalainen kaipaa mahdollisuutta rauhoittumiseen hektisen arjen aikana , johon sauna sopii erinomaisen hyvin .
Suomessa on valtava määrä erilaisia saunoja .
Monella on vahva mielikuva siitä , että sauna on hirsinen rakennus , joka sijaitsee joko järven tai meren rannalla .
Tämä perinteinen kuva hallitsee vielä monien mieltä .
Saunoja on kuitenkin moneen eri lähtöön , ja lehtien palstoilta voi lukea erityisesti kesällä mitä merkillisimmistä saunoista .
Monien ihmisten käydään suorastaan kilpailua siitä , kuka onnistuu rakentamaan kaikkein erilaisimman saunan .
Moni voi tietenkin olla eri mieltä siitä , kuinka hyvät löylyt esimerkiksi kaivinkoneen hyttiin rakennettu sauna voi tuottaa .
Perinteiset saunat ovat syystä suunniteltu sellaisiksi kuin mitä ne ovat , sillä ne takaavat parhaimmat löylyt .
Laivasaunominen on uusi tapa nauttia saunasta
Tämä uusi blogi esittelee myös täysin uudentyyppisen tavan nauttia saunasta , joka on laivasaunominen .
Se on yksi erikoisimpia ja mielyttävämpiä tapoja saunoa , sillä laivasaunassa yhdistyy liikkuminen ja veneily .
Laivassa saunomisen paras puoli , on ehdottomasti kuitenkin vapaus ja tunnelma , jota ei ole mahdollista saavuttaa missään muussa saunan muodossa .
Suomessa on useita laivoihin rakennettuja saunoja , joista monet ovat myös tilauskäytössä .
Tämän lisäksi monet yksityiset henkilöt rakentavat tai pitävät oman laivansa saunaa kunnossa .
Tämä blogi pyrkii levittämään tietoa laivasaunojen erikoispiirteistä ja levittämään laivassa saunomisen ilosanomaa .
Samalla se pyrkii myös yhdistämään asiasta kiinnostuneita ihmisiä toisiinsa .
Blogista löydät tietoa laivasaunomisen lisäksi tietoa saunan historiasta ja suomalaisesta saunakulttuurista , jonka lisäksi pääset lukemaan myös erilaisista saunauutuuksista .
Moni kaipaa myös erilaista tekemistä saunomisen lomaan , jolloin blogi auttaa myös tässä .
Tervetuloa lukemaan kuumimpia uutisia saunan kuumasta maailmasta .
WARBIRD HOME > JAPAN > SABURO SAKAI
An afternoon with Saburo Sakai
By Scott Hards , © 1998
On Sunday , August 11th [ 1998 ] , I had the unique pleasure of being invited to the Tokyo home of Mr. Saburo Sakai , the great Japanese WWII Zero ace .
Over the course of three hours , he and I discussed a number of topics , almost all related to his exploits in the war , but to some broader issues as well .
What follows are some of the more interesting things he had to say ....
I did not take notes nor use a tape recorder during our conversation , and these " quotes " are paraphrased by myself to the best of my memory .
Please do not repeat them or attribute them to Sakai - san in any published forum .
The conversation was entirely in Japanese , and in my translations , I 've attempted to choose language that best represents the atmosphere of how Sakai - san himself was saying it .
The order is roughly the order that we discussed these topics in .
On the Zero
During the war , I was convinced the Zero Model 21 was the best fighter plane anywhere .
It was always number one with me .
Then a few years ago , at Champlin , I had the chance to fly in a Mustang and take the controls for a while .
What an incredible plane !
It could do anything the Zero could , and many things the Zero can't , like a high - speed , spiraling dive .
On the Type 96 Carrier Fighter " Claude " [ A5 M ]
If the Type 96 had had the range of the Zero , we might have kept using that even up to Pearl Harbor and beyond .
On the key to a good fighter plane
By far the most important thing for a good fighter plane is its range .
On the Zero 's maneuverability
the Zero was incredibly maneuverable , but not over about 250 mph .
Above that speed , the stick just gets too heavy because the plane 's control surfaces are so huge .
In the Zero , the stick would be too heavy to control the plane at those speeds .
The Mustang 's number one with me now , and I 'm afraid the Zero 's number two !
That was the most incredible fighter of its day , by far .
When the Zero was rolled out , we put two equal pilots in a Type 96 and a Zero and had them dogfight .
The Type 96 won quite quickly .
Then we had them switch planes .
The Type 96 won again .
Everybody thought the Zero was a failure at that point .
But they liked the Zero 's range .
I can't tell you how much that affects you when you 're in the cockpit .
When you know you 've got plenty of gas , it really lets you relax .
Those poor Germans in their [ Bf - ] 109s !
They could barely get to altitude and fight for a couple of minutes before they had to start worrying about their fuel supply .
When you are worried about your gas , it really affects what you do with your plane , even how you fight .
Think of how many German fighters ended up at the bottom of the English Channel because they did n't have the gas to get home .
A plane that does n't have the gas to fly is just junk .
If the Germans had had 1000 Zeros in 1940 , I do n't think England would still exist today .
Think about it : With Zeros , they could have operated from airfields near Paris and still hit any target anywhere in the British Isles , or escorted bombers , and still have plenty of gas to get home .
I once flew a Zero for 12 hours continuous once in an experiment to see just how far it could go .
That plane 's range was incredible .
That 's part of what made the Mustang great , too .
Oh yes , You 've seen those films of kamikaze plunging straight down into the water far from any U.S. ships , right ?
The kids in those planes probably put their planes into a dive way too early , and before they realized their mistake , they had too much speed built up to pull out of their dive .
They probably died pulling desperately on the stick with all their strength .
When I coached those kids [ kamikaze pilots ] , I 'd tell them , " If you 've gotta die , you at least want to hit your target , right ?
If so , then go in low , skimming the water .
Do n't dive on your target .
You lose control in a dive .
You risk getting picked off by a fighter , but you 've got better chance of hitting your target . "
On Kamikaze tactics and pilots
A lot of Westerners looked at the kamikaze strategy with complete shock , the idea of putting a kid in a plane and telling him to kill himself by crashing into the enemy .
But even if you do n't tell him to crash into something , putting a kid with only about 20 hours flight time into a plane and telling him to take on U.S. pilots in Hellcats and Corsairs is just as much a suicidal tactic as being a kamikaze .
We figured that if they 're going to die anyway , the kamikaze attack will probably cause more damage to the enemy for the same price in lives .
But let me tell you , all that stuff you read about " dying for the emperor ... Banzai ! " that 's all crap .
There was n't one kamikaze pilot or soldier out there who was thinking anything about the emperor when they were facing death .
They were thinking about their mother and their family , just like anybody else .
The reason those final letters home that they wrote are so filled with emperor glorification stuff is because they knew the censors would read them , and because they simply wanted to try to make their parents proud .
On seeing the enemy
Great vision is absolutely essential for a fighter pilot .
Finding your enemy even a half - second sooner than he finds you gives you a great advantage .
I 'd teach my pilots not to tighten their lap belts too tight , because it prevents you from swiveling your hips so that you can quickly look directly behind yourself .
The field of view in the Zero was great .
I do n't know why those Grumman planes had those high backs that prevented pilots from seeing behind them .
Hards :
Did n't losing the vision in one eye really hurt you in this respect ?
Not really .
By that time , I had learned to know where the enemy was going to appear from , based on conditions .
I never had to sweep the sky , 360 degrees or anything to find them .
You just gain a sense of where they 're going to come from , and search that area most intensely .
An instinct I guess .
And you do n't really need depth perception , because you can gauge distance by the apparent size of the enemy plane .
On just missing Lyndon Johnson
On the IJN leadership
Promotions in the Navy were based on what school you graduated from and who you knew , it had nothing to do with merit .
One day I jumped two B - 26s and shot one down .
I got a few shots off at the other before I lost it in a cloud bank .
After the war , I learned from U.S. records of the incident that the plane that got away had been carrying Lyndon Johnson !
Can you imagine how I might have changed history if I 'd hit the other plane first instead ?
A lot of Americans who know that story have come up to me and said " Saburo , why did n't you shoot the other plane down first ?
Then we could have stayed out of the Vietnam War !
" Some guy could smash up 20 planes trying to learn how to fly , and then not shoot down a damn thing and he'd be promoted faster than me or any other successful pilot simply because he came from the right school .
Those were the kinds of idiots we had leading us .
How were we supposed to win the war with leadership like that ?
Take that idiot [ Minoru ] Genda .
He could barely fly , but he jumped up and down about the Shiden - kai [ " George " ] , so everybody else pretended to like it , too .
That plane was a piece of crap , put together by a third - rate firm [ Kawanishi ] .
On the atomic bomb
" If Japan had had the bomb , and they told me to fly the plane that carried it and bomb San Francisco or something , I would have done it gladly .
On the Rape of Nanjing
On " comfort women 's " demands for compensation
On protests of U.S. bases in Japan
Once , I was on a discussion panel with [ Enola Gay pilot ] Col.
Paul Tibbets in the U.S. and somebody asked me what I thought about the A - bomb .
I said That 's a soldier 's job .
To follow orders and fight for his country . "
I think Tibbets was a great hero for the U.S.
To fly out there with just two B - 29s and no fighter escort , that takes a lot of guts .
At the time , nobody knew about the A - bomb ; there was no international treaty against its use , like there was for chemical weapons .
The U.S. even dropped leaflets warning people in Hiroshima that a new weapon was going to be used .
That 's just war .
There 's no question that Japanese soldiers probably killed a few thousand people there , but stories of 100,000 to 300,000 dead are complete fiction , made up by the Chinese for propaganda purposes .
And most of the " civilians " that got killed were probably Chinese soldiers masquerading as non-combatants by not wearing their uniforms .
That IS against international law .
Why do n't I think the stories are true ?
First of all , there were n't even 300,000 people in Nanjing at the time .
Most of the city 's population had fled when they heard the Japanese were coming .
Secondly , there were over 200 foreign journalists in the area , and you can't find any mention of an atrocity like that in the papers of the day .
There 's no way you could hide something that big , but the stories about it did n't emerge until AFTER the war .
And the only photos from the supposed event that ever get published are taken from a documentary about it and are fakes , staged for the film .
Demanding compensation from a foreign government 50 years after something happened ?
Come on .
The statute of limitations for murder is only 15 years .
After the war , the Japanese government signed agreements with Korea and other nations settling war liability claims .
These are binding , international agreements made by the legal governments of their nations .
If certain victim 's groups have a claim , they have to address it to their own government , not to some foreign government .
You do n't see A - bomb victims groups going to Washington demanding that the U.S. government pay for their suffering , do you ?
No , instead , the Japanese government pays them an allowance .
If the comfort women have a claim , it should be with their own Korean or Philippine government .
They 're just looking for cash now that Japan is a rich nation .
Those people are so stupid .
Do they think that soldiers actually want to start a war or something , even though they would be the first ones killed ?
Do they think that if we get rid of armies , that we can rid the world of war ?
Do they also think that if we banish doctors , that we can rid the world of disease ?
Why do n't they understand that armed forces are like an insurance policy for use in case of emergency .
Who do they think is going to protect them if someone were to actually invade Japan ?
Article 9 of the Constitution [ the part of the Japanese Constitution that renounces war as a sovereign right ] ?
Do they think that if they staple copies of Article 9 onto boards and post them all around Japan 's shores that a foreign invader is going to turn around and go home if they read it ?
For such a serious matter , it 's being treated in a very casual fashion .
There is no national program to manage oil demand in the event of a supply crisis , or employ market forces to help .
Neither is there a long - term initiative to reduce oil dependence and the size of the threat .
While the US looks to become dependent upon imported natural gas in addition to oil , there 's nothing in the works for a Strategic Natural Gas Reserve .
And as for a national building code or even minimum standards for building codes , there 's nothing worth mentioning .
One of the biggest threats the USA faces today is a serious shortage of energy .
Vulnerabilities in our system have been made glaringly obvious several times ; since the 1970's the USA has had social and economic upheaval due to the actions of foreign oil producers , and two hurricanes in 2005 showed just how fragile our remaining domestic supplies of oil and natural gas are .
The fact that the nation has a Strategic Petroleum Reserve shows that this is a matter of national security .
Other , less - serious problems have been dealt with far more competently .
The USA had a plan for achieving the goal of saving the peregrine falcon and bald eagle from DDT , and another for saving the world 's ozone layer from halocarbon emissions .
Both of these were carried forward both domestically and internationally , with considerable success on both programs .
Given the last ten years of concern about global warming and three decades of concern over energy supplies , you would expect something similar would be in the works for those also .
Something broad - based and serious :
A self - sustaining system which replaces petroleum - based fuels in the short term , and all fossil fuels eventually .
Productivity high enough to eliminate the displaced fuels without major land - use or other changes .
A shift toward a neutral carbon and GHG balance , or even a negative net balance .
You can look through our initiatives from last year 's energy bill through the previous three administrations , and you would n't find anything like this .
Nothing in our current energy " policy " even aims squarely at these goals , let alone has a prospect of meeting them ( though Carter and Clinton / Gore do deserve credit for thinking about it ) .
It looks like we could do a lot , with the right engineering backed by supportive policies .
What would you say if I told you that we could use biomass to :
Replace all the petroleum used by the ground - transport sector ( 55 % or more ) ?
Replace all the natural gas used by the electric - generation sector ( about 1/3 of US natural gas consumption ) ?
Replace every pound of coal burned for electricity ( about 90 % of all US coal consumption ) ?
Eliminate over 1.2 billion tons of carbon emissions ( 4.4 billion tons of CO 2 ) from oil and coal .
All that , and have some left over .
I believe we could , and I 'll illustrate how ( with numbers ! ) below .
But to understand where we need to go , we should first see where we are and how we got here .
From interest - group politics to policy
There are many frustrating things about our current energy non-policy .
One of the worst is that we 're paying people to do ineffective or even counterproductive things in the name of " sustainability " , " energy independence " and even supporting family farming .
For instance , our current production of ethanol depends on natural gas or even coal to distill the product .
( " Live green , go yellow " ?
If something depends on burning coal , how green can it be ? )
But what if we fixed that ?
It wo n't be easy to change .
There are huge interest groups which reap benefits from the status quo .
This gives the non-policy a great deal of support , whether it is productive or not .
The example of corn ethanol illustrates this nicely .
A bunch of people are doing well by it , including :
Corn - belt farmers , who have a market too big to saturate .
Agribusinesses like ADM , which reap billions in taxpayer subsidies in the name of ( illusory ) energy independence .
Manufacturers and sellers of seed , fertilizer and pesticides .
The politicians whose taxpayer - financed largesse created this bonanza , and who are in turn supported by its beneficiaries ( the benefits are n't for the taxpayer ) .
Contrary to mouthpieces of those interests , corn ethanol does n't do well at anything else ; it takes nearly a gallon - equivalent of various fuels ( including natural gas and diesel ) to make a gallon of ethanol .
By the USDA 's over - optimistic accounting , the increase is roughly 1.27:1 , which is not nearly enough to make a sustainable system .
Here 's a graph of the typical energy balance :
The displaced gasoline comes mostly from some other fossil fuel , the greenhouse benefit is minuscule , and the public pays more overall for the ethanol than they would for imported oil to fill their tanks .
In the long run , this is bound to collapse .
But in the short run , the program thrives and grows because of the interlocking political support .
Perverse incentives can do that .
But what if we paid people to do the right thing , instead of the wrong thing ?
Incremental improvements
There are small things we could do .
To name one , we could use these resources in ways which really do save fossil fuel .
For example , the Ford / MIT ethanol - injection engine uses ethanol and turbo - boosting to roughly double the power output of an engine .
This allows downsizing of the engine , which in turn reduces friction and throttling losses ; the result is about a 30 % improvement in fuel economy .
( It also creates a true flex - fuel vehicle which starts on gasoline in cold weather but can run on any mixture of petroleum and ethanol , even ethanol - water mixtures , afterward .
This may be important in the future , as I 'll describe below . )
This is a far better use of ethanol than just blending it into the gasoline supply .
If it was substituted across the US vehicle fleet overnight , it could cut our annual gasoline consumption from 140 billion gallons to about 108 billion gallons ( efficiency figures are estimates ; some appraisals of vehicle drivetrain efficiency are as low as 14.9 % ) :
There are further benefits .
Distillation is a very energy - intensive step in the production of ethanol for gasohol or E85 ; blending with gasoline requires anhydrous ethanol , which requires considerable processing beyond making moonshine .
But if you do n't blend the ethanol with petroleum , the ethanol does not have to be anhydrous ; this saves energy in distillation and improves the energy balance of ethanol production .
On top of this , a little water in the mix improves the octane - boosting effect .
Penny wise , pound foolish
Unfortunately , 30 % improvement ( plus production savings ) is nowhere near enough .
To stop the increase of atmospheric CO 2 , we need to cut emissions on the order of 80 % ( while we still have oil ) ; eventually we 're going to have to replace all oil - derived fuels with renewables .
Worse , cellulosic ethanol can't do the job by itself .
The processes for producing it are too inefficient .
Iogen 's process is about 50 % efficient , compared to 83 % well - to - tank efficiency for producing gasoline1 ; this means we 'd need a lot more biomass input energy compared to crude oil to get the same output .
The consequence is that we'd have to turn most of our croplands and forests into fuel plantations .
Here 's what we 'd need just to replace gasoline :
The EERE report Billion - Ton Vision adds various sources of unused biomass and comes up with a possibility of 1.3 billion tons per year .
At 15.8 million BTU / ton , this is about 20.5 quads of energy .
But just replacing gasoline with cellulosic ethanol requires 26.2 quads of biomass energy ; that would take almost 1.7 billion tons !
But that 's not the end of the story .
Gasoline only accounts for about 44 % of petroleum products delivered in the USA .
Diesel accounts for about 2.8 million barrels / day ( at considerably greater energy per gallon ) , so a full replacement of motor fuel with bio-fuels would take about 2.5 billion tons .
That 's a lot , but it does n't look extremely difficult .
However , it does n't include jet fuel , industrial fuel and so forth .
I wo n't calculate biomass - equivalents for these .
But that 's not the end of the story .
Full renewability requires replacing more than just oil .
Replacing the fossil energy we get from coal ( 22.8 quads ) would require another 1.4 billion tons plus conversion losses , and natural gas ( 22.6 quads ) would take about the same ; those are going to need replacement sooner ( global warming ) or later ( resource exhaustion ) too .
This all adds up to roughly 5.3 billion tons per year , year in and year out .
At a reasonable figure of ten tons per acre for dedicated biofuel crops , this would take about four hundred million acres over and above what 's producing the 1.3 billion tons of waste .
In 2003 , only about 380 million acres were planted to crops in the entire USA !
It 's pretty clear that this is n't going to happen .
Even if we did it , the supply would be stretched to the limit from day one .
Energy security demands more than this .
We need a supply of energy which averages considerably more than what we consume , so that temporary downturns do n't create crises .
( Remember how gasoline got very expensive or even ran out post - Katrina , when the Gulf wells and refineries were shut down ?
Remember how expensive natural gas was that fall ?
That 's what happens when supply is too close to demand .
Now imagine an all - biofuel future in a prolonged drought , and add some fires . )
Oil supplies are stretched way too tight ; replacing one scarce fuel with another is great for producers ( like the ethanol lobby ) but it just makes the consumer slave to a different master .
The old - school methods are n't going to work this time .
Pols say what they want , but Nature can't be spun ; when the laws of physics say otherwise no vote or PR campaign can trump them .
We 're going to have to find that energy somewhere else , which means getting creative .
Knowing where to look
Take another look at those graphs above .
One thing should strike everyone : a whale of a lot of energy is lost in conversions .
The average refinery makes gasoline with 83 % efficiency , but engines are so inefficient that more energy goes to refining losses than pushing the vehicle .
An ethanol engine is potentially more efficient than the gasoline equivalent , but the conversion from biomass to ethanol loses so much that it takes more biomass energy than crude oil to do the same job !
Biomass gasification may be more efficient than Iogen 's hydrolization and fermentation , but even a 70 % - efficient process yields barely 18 % end - to - end efficiency at best .
Still , the available energy from biomass looks to be several times the energy we actually use from crude oil .
The conclusions are inescapable :
There is sufficient biomass energy to replace motor fuel and then some ... if the energy is not wasted .
Using bio-ethanol in piston engines means taking between 4/5 and 9/10 of the captured energy and throwing it away .
Even burning biomass as a replacement for e.g. coal in conventional powerplants means 60 % losses or more .
It looks impossible to grow enough biomass to take that path .
The old paradigm wo n't work any more .
A new systems approach is required .
The essence of a successful system will be fewer conversions and minimizing losses .
The potential is enormous .
If we can manage to get our hands on 20 - odd quads worth of biomass each year , we could replace huge amounts of other demand .
Here 's a short list of what actually makes it to useful form :
The useful work we get out of all of these things comes to roughly 15 quads , far less than the 20 - odd quads of biofuels we could get ; the problem is getting enough of it in useful form .
The key to a renewable economy is efficiency , and efficiency is one thing we are n't pushing hard enough .
We could certainly do better .
But none of this will change as long as people benefit more from the status quo .
What gets rewarded , gets done
Before digging too much into what we should do , let 's look at what we 're doing now , and why .
The incentive structure around our " biofuels " is designed to profit interest groups , rather than to reduce fossil - fuel use or fix global warming .
The farmers of the USA grew more corn than we could use , so the price collapsed .
Washington 's solution : pay to turn corn into motor fuel , no matter how inefficient it is .
We can't afford that inefficiency any more , so it 's obviously got to change .
But unless a sea change in the body politic overwhelms the current system , this requires breaking the current interests apart : some fraction of the people ( or at least the voters ) who are benefitting now need to see more advantage for themselves in upsetting the apple cart .
The big agribusiness and ethanol interests ( e.g. ADM ) are n't in this group and will have to be dragged along or forced out .
Fortunately , some segments do n't need to make great changes .
The farmers are doing at least part of what needs doing : pulling carbon out of the air and fixing it in a form which contains energy .
Is it possible to get them to buy into " more of the same , only different " ?
And what would that look like ?
A modest proposal
Every Ergosphere reader knows I 've got a thing for turning waste into gold .
Using corn stover to feed a fertilizer plant ( and make all the nitrogen the corn needs , plus more ) is the sort of solution I like .
Farm income income depends a lot on subsidies , but we 're paying for things that do n't do us much ( if any ) good .
It 's time to stop wasting that money and get something useful for it .
So what can farmers make that they ought to get paid for ?
Rather , what problems can they solve , above and beyond keeping folks fed ?
The obvious issues are :
Too much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere , and A dearth of storable , renewable energy .
# 1 is the big global - warming issue .
Farmers can help solve it , but they did n't make it ; the problem was created by others .
Since CO 2 reduction is a public good , it looks like the ideal farm price - support program for the next half - century : we can tax greenhouse - gas creators to pay farmers to offset the damage , and pay farmers some extra to return the atmosphere to a stable state .
Just pulling the atmospheric CO 2 level from today 's 379 ppm down to 350 ppm ( a level which would probably stabilize Greenland and Antarctica ) requires the net capture of about 230 billion tons2 of carbon dioxide .
If we can get 1.72 billion dry tons of biomass per year ( 720 million tons of waste and another billion dry tons of biomass crops ) , about 770 million tons would be carbon3 ; even if we took it all , released nothing back to the atmosphere , and added twice again as much effort from the rest of the world , we 'd still be at the job for around a century .
Paying farmers to take carbon out of the air and put it in the ground , out of reach ( e.g. as charcoal mixed with earth ) could be the ultimate price backstop for anything they grew .
The risk of price collapses due to bumper harvests would be a thing of the past ; sequestration would be the ultimate backup " market " able to absorb anything beyond marketable quantities .
# 2 favors products which can be stockpiled .
Light gases such as methane can be stored in underground formations , but liquids can be stored in tanks most anywhere and many solids can just be heaped .
And to solve the greenhouse problem , the fuels must be able to deliver sufficient energy to the user to replace what we'd otherwise require from fossil fuels .
Ideally , much of the carbon leaving the system should be produced in a form which can be stored indefinitely .
Charcoal certainly meets that requirement ( it is used to carbon - date campfires up to 10,000 years old , and perhaps older ) .
Every system has its limits , which must be respected scrupulously ; failure to take them into account means the system will fail to meet its expectations , sometimes in spectacular fashion .
The limiting factor in most biofuel systems is carbon capture by plants .
Once the carbon is captured there are ways to recycle it ( some of them with very impressive possibilities ) , but most of them ( like Greenfuel ) wo n't just run on air ; they require a concentrated stream of CO 2 .
If the system is to be run on renewable inputs , something else has to do the gruntwork of pulling the carbon out of the atmosphere .
Is n't that a healthy part of what farming does ?
And it could be quite profitable .
If carbon removal is compensated at $ 85 / ton social cost , farmers would do very well by it .
What we 've got to work with
The EERE report which came up with the 1.3 billion ton figure measures potential waste biomass in the USA .
Current production is much smaller .
A great deal of that 1.3 billion tons assumes greater production of non-crop biomass from grain and bean crops , which may not happen .
Accordingly , I 'm only going to assume about 348 million tons of crop byproducts .
The other major waste biomass stream comes from forestry , which might produce 368 million tons per year .
We could add to that with biomass crops such as Miscanthus Giganticus , switchgrass or fast - growing trees such as coppiced willow or poplar .
The productivity varies , but if Miscanthus can average 10 short tons / acre , an additional billion tons of biomass would require only 100 million acres .
To compare , roughly 80 million acres are planted to corn ( maize ) for grain alone each year ( not including silage ) , and considerable marginal or erodible land is currently in agricultural set -asides .
Waste plus dedicated biomass would make 1.72 billion tons a year .
Here 's a complete listing of my assumptions :
Crop byproduct Product ,
tons / acre Acres Total tons Wheat straw 1 48,800,000 48,800,000 Rice straw 4 3,300,000 13,200,000 Corn stover 2.5 80,700,000 202,000,000 Process residue 84,000,000 Forest products 368,000,000 Biomass crops 10 100,000,000 1,000,000,000 TOTAL 1,720,000,000
Okay , what do you do with it ?
Suppose for a minute that we 've got that 1.7 billion tons every year .
We 've got MSW authorities pulling out all their " green waste " , unrecyclable paper and everything else , foresters capturing chips , bark and sawdust , and farmers baling all their extra crop wastes and growing switchgrass or Miscanthus on their marginal land and buffer strips .
Where do you go from there ?
First thing , you turn the biomass into charcoal .
This does n't take sophisticated equipment ; it can be made simple , rugged and cheap ( though it can always be improved ) .
The process takes biomass and compressed air ( or heated gas of some kind ) .
Its products are :
Hot medium - BTU fuel gas ( the content of heavy molecules such as tars depends on the operating conditions ; hotter operation breaks down heavier molecules ) .
Charcoal , amounting to as much as 30 % of the dry weight of the input biomass .
A 30 % ( ashless ) yield of carbon would contain about 50 % of the energy of the original biomass .
The remaining 50 % would come off as heat and chemical energy in the gas .
The simplest processes for making charcoal do it by burning some of the input fuel , but this can be improved .
If the carbonization process was driven partly by external or recycled heat , less energy would be expended in combustion ; the net energy yield in the gas would shift away from heat toward chemical energy ( and total energy yield of charcoal + gas could exceed 100 % of the heat of combustion of the biomass ) .
Medium - BTU gas is n't easily transported , but it can be used at the site of production to good effect .
There are several uses for fuel gas , but one of the best is making electricity .
Hot combustible gas is more or less what an SOFC runs on .
GE and Delphi have been developing small SOFC's for automotive applications , and both recently beat the $ 300 / kW price barrier .
Efficiency is 49 % and headed upward .
If we assume that :
1.72 billion tons per year of biomass is carbonized .
This biomass has 15.8 million BTU / dry ton of energy ( 27.1 quads total energy ) .
53.5 % of the energy is yielded as charcoal ( 30 % by weight ) .
88 % of the remainder is yielded as chemical energy in hot gas ( 11.1 quads gas + 1.51 quads reaction heat + recycled heat ) .
The gas can be converted to electricity at 50 % efficiency .
The electric yield from the processing of the gas would be 5.55 quads , or 1620 billion kilowatt - hours .
This is more than twice the US electric generation from natural gas ( ~750 billion kWh ) , and more than 1/2 of the total US electric generation from all fossil fuels .
In short , all non-renewable natural gas generation could be replaced by energy from the carbonization stage , and a large chunk of the coal - fired generation as well .
But that 's not the end of it !
The process also produces charcoal ; at 30 % yield , 1.72 billion tons of input would leave about 515 million tons of output .
Charcoal can be used for fuel , as a soil amendment or as a feedstock for further processing .
Gasified charcoal would produce fewer pollutants than gasified coal and could be used for power generation or production of nitrogen fertilizer .
But the most efficient option appears to be use in direct - carbon fuel cells ( DCFC's ) .
Up to 80 % of the chemical energy of the charcoal can be turned into electricity in DCFC's ( and the byproduct heat is still useful ) .
Charcoal is like coal , only more stable .
Charcoal is the product of a high - temperature process , and is missing most of the hydrogen and volatile chemicals of coal .
It can be heaped and stored for weeks to thousands of years ; charcoal from ancient forest and camp fires allows prehistoric events to be dated .
It is a valuable addition to soil , creating the fertile " terra preta " 4 of the notoriously nutrient - poor Amazon rainforest .
It 's perhaps the ultimate answer to irregular supplies of renewable energy .
An annual supply of 515 million short tons of charcoal fed to DCFC 's would produce roughly 3400 billion kilowatt - hours of energy .
This is more than the total US generation from fossil fuels , and about 84 % of the total electric energy consumed in the USA in 2005 ; together with the generation from the gas , it could conceivably replace every kilowatt - hour we now use , from the trivial amounts made by solar to the entire contribution of coal , with about 25 % extra to play with .
It would n't be wise to replace everything with biomass energy , of course ; throwing away diversity of supply means reducing security .
But it shows just how much potential we 've got , if we only start using it .
So how does this relate to oil again ?
I 've spent the last several hundred words talking about the production of electricity , not petroleum or other liquid fuels .
At the moment , electricity has almost nothing to do with petroleum ; only about 3 % of electricity is generated from oil ( and that 's including petroleum coke , a coal - like byproduct of oil refining ) .
Our transportation system is the opposite : it currently runs on liquid petroleum fuels almost exclusively , and most vehicles can't accept anything else .
These two parts of the energy economy are almost completely disconnected from each other .
Any scheme which replaces oil is either going to have to produce a liquid fuel , or find a way to make vehicles take another medium of energy ; if that medium is electricity , it means that connection must be established .
To use electricity as the green , renewable substitute for oil , two things are necessary :
Making enough renewable electricity to replace the energy derived from liquids , and Getting that electricity aboard the vehicle .
If we use the scheme illustrated above , making enough electricity is a fait accompli .
Each year the USA burns about 17 quads of gasoline in vehicles averaging perhaps 20 % efficient5 , and another 6 quads of diesel in vehicles averaging perhaps 40 % efficient6 ; the total useful energy delivered to wheels is about 5.8 quads , or 1700 billion kilowatt - hours7 .
( The average power is only about 194 GW , a small fraction of the US grid 's nameplate generating capacity of over 1000 GW ; the current grid could move that much energy during off - peak hours without straining . )
Once we 've got this energy , the only problem is getting it to vehicles in useful amounts .
One possibility is to put DCFC 's in vehicles and run them directly on charcoal .
If it works , it would be mighty convenient ; however , it may be too much of a stretch .
DCFC's are based on molten - carbonate chemistry and might be too fragile , hot or difficult to cold - start to make them suitable for the job ; they are being investigated for powering ships , but cars and even heavy trucks may be too small .
( Carbon storage is also an issue , if it 's going to be sequestered . )
If the fuel cell can't go on the vehicle , electricity has to be generated elsewhere and stored on the vehicle .
That means the possibilities are limited only by the capabilities of batteries .
For over a century that capability was limited indeed , but that 's changing with amazing speed .
The drive to pack more energy into smaller cellphones and laptops has led to an explosion of new technology with performance once found only in science fiction .
It used to be sized and priced like gemstones , but it 's getting to be available in economy - size packages too .
I wo n't go too far into the details of these technologies , except to detail their breadth .
Lithium - ion batteries are coming in at least two new flavors , one based on titanium oxide and the other on iron phosphate ; these have already hit the market in high - performance cordless tools .
Lead - acid batteries look to make a comeback , with carbon foam replacing bulk metal for electrical connections and mechanical strength ( eliminating most of the corrosion which limited their lifespan and also slashing the weight ) .
There 's even a dark horse in the race , an ultracapacitor from EEStor .
These batteries charge in minutes ( Altair Nano claims 0 - 80 % in 60 seconds flat or 0 - 100 % in 6 minutes for 15,000 cycles ; ultracaps are probably limited only by the wiring ) ; it could make filling at a gas pump feel slow .
These technologies are hitting limited - production vehicles today .
Tesla Motors has sold out its first run of electric roadsters , powered by off - the - shelf lithium - ion cells .
250 miles of range is enough for lots of driving , and a network of fast charging stations would make them suitable for most trips .
But most of us can't afford cars with $ 30,000 battery packs just to run on electrons .
Fortunately , most driving is within a few tens of miles of home ; some estimate that a car which can run its first 60 miles on electricity before switching on a conventional engine can eliminate 80 % of liquid fuel demand .
( Shorter ranges would probably be effective as well ; 30 miles of electric range would probably suffice to replace well over half of that 80 % , because shorter trips could still be all - electric . )
This is n't science fiction ; CalCars has already done this with the Prius + .
The combination of hybrid efficiency and grid - power assist turns a sedan which might attain 35 MPG with a standard drivetrain into an economy monster which can average up to 180 MPG of gasoline , plus 200 watt - hours of grid juice per electric mile .
The problem is that 60 miles is n't enough by itself , and a PHEV like the Prius + will still need liquid fuel for extended range ; heavy vehicles will probably need diesel or the like for a large fraction of their operation .
Plug - in operation cuts the fuel requirement down a lot , but 20 % of 140 billion gallons of gasoline plus maybe 50 % of 27 billion gallons of diesel is still about 40 billion gallons a year of hydrocarbons or about 65 billion gallons of ethanol .
All together , it comes to about 1150 billion kWh of electricity ( assuming no efficiency improvements ) plus 5.1 quads worth of liquid fuel .
Bi-cycles and re-cycles
The difficulty with liquid fuels is that all the best prospects contain carbon , and using liquid fuels in vehicles dumps the carbon back into the atmosphere .
If we go for carbon - neutrality , it means that we can't emit any more carbon than we capture ( about 1 billion tons / year in this scenario ) .
Most concepts would go back to the biomass at this point and say " Okay , divvy it up ; we use THIS part for electricity and make liquid fuel out of the rest ! "
But if you go back to the third graph , it takes huge amounts of biomass to get just a little energy to wheels .
5.1 quads of ethanol from cellulose needs something over 10 quads of biomass .
This seriously cuts into the electric output and the charcoal available for fuel ( or just to keep carbon out of the atmosphere ) .
It takes a lot of work to grab that carbon .
Ideally , we 'd hold onto it and use it over and over .
It may be asking too much to capture carbon and use it in a closed cycle indefinitely , but twice - through does n't seem far - fetched .
A system which captures a billion tons of carbon a year and turns 30 % of it into gas at or near the point of production ( biomass is too bulky and expensive to transport very far ) is going to have 300 million tons of carbon to play with , as 1.1 billion tons of carbon dioxide .
This will probably be mixed with nitrogen , water vapor and some oxygen .
This happens to be exactly what some folks want to use as feedstock to make liquid fuels ( ethanol and biodiesel ) .
Their current proposal is to use the stack gas from coal - fired powerplants , but cleaner and greener inputs would almost certainly work just as well .
Greenfuel claims to be able to capture 30 - 40 % of the carbon passing through its algal bioreactor system .
That capture figure seems rather low , because algae grow very quickly on very dilute CO 2 from the atmosphere ; algae should be able to reduce CO 2 concentrations to well below 1 % , which would mean 90 + % capture .
I speculate that Greenfuel 's figures are based on the CO 2 source running 24 hours a day , whether there is light for the algae to capture carbon for its growth or not ; the un-captured carbon would go through to the atmosphere .
But that assumes that neither the CO 2 source nor the algae - growing system have any way of storing carbon until the algae can use it .
If the system is engineered to capture carbon , this is probably a bad assumption .
Accordingly , I 'm going to make one optimistic assumption here : no less than 60 % of the CO 2 output of the above fuel - cell system can be captured as algae - derived biofuel .
Once you put it all together , the result is an 8 - step process with two energy loops :
Heat the biomass in the absence of oxygen to convert it into charcoal ( 515 million tons of carbon , 14.5 quads energy ) and gas ( ~257 million tons of carbon as CO and CO 2 , traces of methane , etc. plus hydrogen and water , ~ 11.1 quads of chemical energy + process heat ) .
Burn the gas in solid - oxide fuel cells at 50 % efficiency , producing 5.55 quads of electricity ( 1620 billion kWH ) plus 5.5 quads of heat .
The heat would first be used to drive the pyrolysis process and then for other uses , closing part of the energy loop .
( Recycling of heat might increase step 1's yield of chemical energy considerably8 , but I 'm trying to be slightly pessimistic . )
Send the fuel - cell exhaust gas , full of CO 2 , to an algal photosynthesis process .
Capturing 30 % of the carbon as carbohydrate would process 83 million tons / year ; if it came out as ethanol , it would amount to 44.9 billion gallons ( about 3.5 quads out of the 5.1 required ) .
If another 30 % could be captured as vegetable oil , it would be another 20 billion gallons or so ; that would make about 3.1 quads of energy as liquid fuel .
That totals 6.6 quads , enough to cope with some losses .
The ethanol is distilled with the waste heat from step 2 .
The vegetable oil is converted to glycerine and ethyl esters ( biodiesel ) with some of the ethanol from step 4 .
Excess glycerine from step 5 is gasified and fed to the fuel cells in step 2 ( energy recycled ) .
The charcoal goes to burial ( sequestration ) or electric generation .
The CO 2 from electric generation is either sequestered ( deep - well injection , enhanced oil recovery ) or used as more feedstock for algal fuel ; 1/3 of the carbon from charcoal recycled to step 3 would roughly double the liquid fuel yield .
Here 's a simplified graph of mass and energy flows ( minus steps 5 , 6 and 8 ) :
What does this do for us ?
The issues at hand are liquid - fuel demand , electric demand and carbon sequestration .
Let 's take them in order .
It 's claimed that plug - in hybrid vehicles with as little as 60 miles of electric range can reduce motor fuel needs by as much as 80 % .
If that is the case , the demand for gasoline could be cut from 140 billion gallons of gasoline equivalent ( GGE ) to about 28 billion .
Providing the same amount of energy from ethanol would require about 42 billion gallons / year , which could be provided by step 3 above .
Displacing half our diesel fuel could be accomplished with the capture of another 30 % of the off - gassed carbon .
If the total carbon capture could be improved beyond 60 % , it would supply other needs as well .
Transferring energy demand from gasoline to electricity might add as much as 800 billion kilowatt - hours per year to grid consumption .
The US also uses about 43 billion gallons / year of diesel , supplying perhaps 1400 billion kWh of work to the wheels of vehicles from medium trucks to freight trains ; supplying half of that via the grid would add another 700 billion kWH / year of load .
The sum of these two is roughly equal to the estimate of the electric yield from the carbonization process .
If half of the energy was supplied from electricity and the other half from biodiesel , it would take about 22 billion gallons of biodiesel .
The biodiesel fraction could be largely supplied by step 3 above ; a slight improvement in either biodiesel production or truck efficiency would make up the difference .
The USA uses about 4000 billion kWh of electricity per year .
Roughly half of this comes from coal , and another 19 % each from natural gas and nuclear ; the remainder comes from petroleum and renewables , with the bulk of the last being from hydropower .
The total electric generation from fossil fuels in 2005 was 2900 billion kilowatt - hours .
This entire quantity could be supplied from the 515 million tons of charcoal ; the possible 3400 + billion kWh could more than replace the combined fossil - fired electric production by itself .
That would make both US ground transport and US electric generation approximately carbon - neutral without further measures .
The final issue is carbon sequestration .
Any charcoal not used for fuel could be buried .
Charcoal used in DCFC 's would produce nearly - pure CO 2 , which allows fairly easy and cheap capture .
If not recycled through algae to make liquid fuel ( over and above the quantities calculated above ) , it could be compressed to liquid and injected into old oil and gas fields or deep aquifers .
It appears feasible to remove most or all of the 515 million tons of carbon from the atmosphere permanently , or nearly so .
The final question : Could we produce 1.7 billion tons / year of biomass ?
We 're already making half that or more in waste , in forms ranging from corn stalks to grain straw to sawdust to grass clippings to waste paper .
If we could get as little as 10 tons / acre from crops like switchgrass or Miscanthus , another 100 million acres would do the trick .
These would be perennial crops , requiring little intervention beyond mowing and replacement of harvested nutrients .
But we 've been neglecting one essential party to this effort .
It 's time to return to him .
What does this do for the farmer ?
The farmer is concerned about doing well by the land , but to do this he has to stay in business .
How 's he going to make money off something like this ?
It looks like there are at least four possible revenue streams from this scheme : greenhouse - abatement payments plus sales of three products : electricity , ethanol and charcoal .
( There may be worthwhile chemicals in the tars and other heavy bio-molecules from the charcoal production step , but those markets might be easily saturated .
I wo n't consider those . )
Suppose that we pay $ 85 / ton for carbon removed from the atmosphere ( about $ 27/ton of CO 2 ) .
An acre of corn yielding 150 bushels at $ 3/ bu would pay $ 450 for the grain ; the 2.5 tons dry weight of excess stover from that same acre would contain another 1.1 or so tons of carbon , for $ 93 in abatement fees .
But a farmer might be a member of a co-op producing electricity , charcoal and ethanol from crop waste .
2.5 dry tons of stover would provide roughly 39.5 mmBTU of energy , of which roughly 41 % ( 16.2 mmBTU ) would come off as gas during carbonization .
If half of that was converted to electricity , each acre 's worth would yield 2366 kWh ; at 5 ¢ / kWh , the electricity alone would be worth a whopping $ 118.33 .
The 3/4 ton of charcoal byproduct would be worth another $ 63.75 for the carbon - abatement payment , raising the total to $ 182 / acre .
And 750 pounds of carbon put through the improved algae process would yield 65.4 gallons of ethanol , worth $ 196.20 at $ 3/gallon .
The yield of vegetable oil ( for biodiesel ) would be another 38.2 gallons , worth $ 114.44 at $ 3/gallon .
The gross from the abatement credit and stover byproducts would be $ 483 , worth more than the grain !
If the charcoal could be sold as another product ( for energy or chemical synthesis ) , the byproducts could easily be worth far more than the primary crop .
What 's the farmer 's backstop price ?
150 bushels at 56 lbs / bu is 8400 lbs of grain ; if it is also 45 % carbon by weight , the carbon - abatement payment for turning an acre 's worth of grain into charcoal ( ~2520 lbs at 30 % yield ) is about $ 107 , absent any production of electricity or liquid fuel .
The electricity and fuel byproducts would be worth another $ 721 .
Below $ 4.80 / bu the grain is worth more as charcoal and byproducts than as food .
And that 's just from growing corn , which produces 6.7 tons of total harvest ( grain plus stover ) per acre .
A crop like Miscanthus , which produces 10 tons / acre with far less cultivation , would be much more profitable ( if more subject to the market price of fuels and electricity ) .
Last , there is the permanent improvement of the soil from the addition of charcoal .
The example of terra preta shows that charcoal can create massive improvements in nutrient - holding ability , under the most adverse conditions , lasting at least two thousand years .
Had the ancient Greeks and Romans used such practices , their soils would have been very different — and their modern descendants would still be enjoying the results today .
This is literally an investment which can pay for a hundred generations .
What farmer would n't jump at that ?
The problem is to take theory and reduce it to practice .
What would it cost ?
The best system in the world is no good if you can't afford it .
What would a system like this cost us , and what would it save ?
Let 's start with savings .
The USA is currently importing about 12.3 million barrels / day of petroleum and products ; at even $ 60 / barrel , that 's $ 738 million a day or $ 269 billion per year .
Eliminating 9.12 million barrels / day of gasoline and another 2.8 million barrels / day of diesel comes to 11.9 million barrels ; this might come from ~ 11 million bbl / day of crude ( after processing gain ) and cost us $ 241 billion per year .
The replacement of US transport oil consumption by domestic energy would eliminate demand greater than Saudi Arabia 's production , lowering world oil prices and the cost of the remaining imports ( which would be about 1/10 of current levels ) .
Then there 's natural gas .
Eliminating 5.8 quads ( roughly 5.65 trillion cubic feet ) of natural gas demand would more than eliminate US net imports of natural gas .
If we peg that at $ 8.00 / million BTU , 5.8 quads is worth another $ 46 billion ( another total bound to rise ) .
That total comes to $ 287 billion a year .
$ 287 billion a year is roughly $ 960 a head for everyone in the USA .
There 's got to be some sort of cost for this , so here 's an estimate .
The potential generation from carbonizer off - gas is 1620 billion kWh / year , or 185 GW average ; the cost of solid - oxide fuel cells will be below the $ 250 / kW point soon .
If we assume that the balance of the biomass - processing system is $ 500 / kW ( including the power conditioning gear , carbonizer , fuel - gas processing , algae farm , fermenter and ethanol still ) the cost of the system is $ 139 billion dollars .
This is several times total US farm income , but it 's less than half the annual savings from the elimination of imported oil and gas .
It would be an immensely profitable move for the country .
Even at $ 2000 / kW , it would pay off in a little over a year .
The savings would be offset a bit by additional costs of vehicles .
Today 's hybrids cost about $ 2000 - $ 3000 more than their conventional equivalents .
If we keep buying 17 million new light - duty vehicles per year , that would come to between $ 34 billion / year and $ 51 billion / year .
This is n't remotely close to the savings .
Then there 's the effect of eliminating coal - fired electric generation and replacing about 600 million tons of atmospheric carbon emissions ( 2.2 billion tons CO 2 ) with perhaps 500 million tons of carbon removals .
The issues of earth subsidence , acid rain , mercury emissions , acid mine drainage and so forth would disappear .
At $ 30 / ton for a billion tons of coal and perhaps the same price per ton for a half - billion tons of charcoal , the savings would be about $ 15 billion a year .
Last is the effect of eliminating carbon emissions .
The eliminated motor fuel contains about 660 million tons of carbon , and the eliminated coal contains roughly another 600 million .
We 'd replace that with perhaps a half - billion tons of carbon removals .
If we subscribe to the Stern report 's social cost of CO 2 emissions at $ 85 / ton , the net savings would be another $ 155 billion / year .
It looks like we could lay out $ 370 billion plus maybe $ 50 billion / year , and save ourselves $ 287 billion a year in imported oil and natural gas , another $ 15 billion a year in coal costs , and perhaps $ 155 billion a year in social costs from climate change and its knock - on effects .
Unless
I 've missed something very important , it 's not a question of whether we can afford to do this .
It 's a question of whether we can afford not to .
How would our lives be different ?
The ever - present question for any scheme like this is if the public will accept it .
This depends on a great many things , but a lot of it is how much change it would demand from people .
The answer is " not much " .
And that 's by design .
Most of the various additions to the electrical grid would be completely transparent to the consumer .
All the biomass - carbonization co-ops , algae - growth greenhouses and other elements would be off in the countryside , probably looking little different from other farm structures .
Wind farms are far more conspicuous than this would be .
The average driver would have to change habits slightly .
Plugging in every night , or even at every stop , would be fairly important .
But this would be offset by far fewer trips to filling stations .
As fewer and fewer drivers needed liquid fuels except to go out of town , you might see fuel pumps disappear from convenience stores and even whole urban cores .
They 'd wind up clustered around freeway exits and at truck stops .
The character of that fuel would change too .
Use of the Ford / MIT direct - injection engine would require two fuel tanks instead of one , so the driver would have both a gasoline tank and an ethanol tank to fill .
But the mix would shift over time ; as petroleum was displaced by electricity and its ethanol byproduct , the driver would burn more ethanol and less gasoline .
Finally , gasoline would only be used for cold - starting the PHEV 's engine ; normal operation would use ethanol only , with no added petroleum .
And people would use about 1/ 5 as much liquid - fuel energy on average , perhaps 1 / 4 as many gallons if ethanol substituted for gasoline .
At $ 3 / gallon for ethanol but using 1 / 4 as much , people would pay about as much as they would if gasoline cost 75 ¢ / gallon for current vehicles .
Could we handle such things ?
Given that most people look at their windshield washer fluid every so often , I think that managing another fuel tank would n't be all that complicated .
What of electricity , the non-fuel ?
The average PHEV car might consume 300 watt - hours per mile ; Prius - like PHEV's would be more efficient at 200 to 250 , and PHSUV 's might come in at 400 or so .
At 10 ¢ / kWh , it would cost between 2¢ / mile for the Prius+ to 4¢ / mile for the PHSUV .
Comparing against gasoline at 50 MPG for a Prius and 25 MPG for an economical SUV , the cost would be equivalent to gasoline at about $ 1.00 / gallon .
Off - peak electricity might cost considerably less .
A driver covering 13,000 miles / year in a 25 MPG SUV would use 520 gallons of fuel and pay about $ 1300 / year at current prices .
Substituting 130 gallons of ethanol at $ 3/gallon ( $ 390 ) plus 4160 kWh at 10¢ / kWh ( $ 416 ) would come to $ 806 , a savings of $ 494 / year .
Even if we paid $ 3000 more for our PHEV vehicles , we'd get most or all of that money back before the car loan was paid .
Room for improvement
There are several elements of this scheme which could be improved over the baseline assumptions .
They include :
The algal carbon - capture step .
Greenfuel claims 30 % - 40 % capture efficiency , allowing at least 60 % of the input carbon to blow through to the atmosphere .
I assumed 60 % capture , because algae can certainly grow very well on gas with 4 % CO 2 or more .
But that 's not the end .
Natural systems extract carbon out of the air at a measly 380 ppm concentration .
If the system can retain combustion gases in the algae - growth unit until the CO 2 content is less than 1 % , capture could exceed 90 % ; if the exit CO 2 concentration is reduced to 0.1 % ( 1000 ppm ) , the capture efficiency goes up to 99 % .
Photosynthesis by the algae replaces CO 2 with oxygen ; if the oxygen content is high enough , the refreshed air could be recycled through the fuel cells rather than exhausting it ( and its residual CO 2 ) to the atmosphere .
Gas recycling would limit CO 2 losses to the leakage from the system .
Retention of gas for extended carbon capture appears feasible 9 .
or more .
But that 's not the end .

Gas recycling would limit CO losses to the leakage from the system .
Retention of gas for extended carbon capture appears feasible .
Energy storage .
If carbon can be recycled very efficiently in the algae farm system , it could bank liquid fuel ( or dried algae prepared for carbonization ) and function as a solar - electric plant with long - term energy storage .
Supply security .
Stockpiles of charcoal would be a hedge against poor productivity later .
Adding charcoal to the carbonizer and some oxygen and water to the carbonization gas would allow the carbonizer to run as a gasifier .
With the substitution of carbon input , the electric generation and ethanol / biodiesel production systems could run at full capacity with less than the full feed of biomass .
This guards against short - term supply crises due to droughts or grass fires .
Heat reuse .
The outlet heat from the fuel cell would be in the neighborhood of 800°C .
This could easily run a gas turbine of 25 % efficiency , raising the electric efficiency to ~ 62 % .
The exhaust would still be hot enough to make high - pressure steam .
Integrated architecture .
Algae farms might be light enough to be integrated into large , flat rooftops .
If factory and commercial buildings could support the carbon recycling systems on - site , the waste heat and other byproducts of the carbonizer and fuel cell could be used for industrial process heat or space heat .
This could make factories and malls " green " in a very literal way .
Other issues
This analysis is limited to the replacement of fuels for ground transportation and electric generation .
I include no energy to replace heating fuel , industrial energy consumption or several other types of essentials ; some of this demand might be handled with better architecture and cogeneration , but the details are beyond the scope of this analysis .
Neither do I consider the wisdom of relying entirely on biomass - derived energy and liquids to replace liquid motor fuel and fossil fuel for electric generation .
Reliance on a single source risks all end -uses if the supply is interrupted .
This would probably be very unwise indeed , and it appears foolhardy not to add large amounts of e.g. wind generation in the mix .
The combination of battery - electric vehicles , wind farms and easily - throttled fuel cells would certainly have a total effect greater than the sum of the parts .
Making it happen
If Congress decided that this was a desirable future , what policy initiatives should we have ?
I 'd suggest this program for the nation :
Finance the fastest practical development and pilot test programs for solid - oxide fuel cells , molten - carbonate fuel cells and especially direct - carbon fuel cells .
Processing systems for biomass carbonizer off - gas to feed SOFC 's should be a priority .
Block the issuance of permits for any coal - burning powerplants without plans for full carbon sequestration .
Require most new vehicles to be PHEV's .
Promote or require plug - in facilities for new or renovated construction .
Some sort of net metering or other feed - in law is required for the grid .
Get rid of all preferences and mandates for alternative fuels ; incentives should be created by taxes on oil , coal and natural gas .
The rest of the program has more to do with economic policy and foreign policy than energy as such .
These are contentious elements , and I 'll reserve my opinions on them for another day .
Conclusion
Our current fossil - based energy system is problematic ; perhaps fortunately for us , it is very inefficient and leaves a great deal of low - hanging fruit .
Its inefficiency allows the complete replacement of the fuel used for transportation and electric generation by various direct and indirect biomass products .
The cost savings could amount to the better part of a thousand dollars per person per year , and the environmental savings would be immense .
Best of all , the public would n't have to endure any wrenching changes to make it happen .

Cellulose is about 4/9 carbon by weight .
If it is cracked to 30 % solid carbon and the remainder as gas , roughly 40 % of the total chemical energy of the cellulose comes off as gas ( 56 % as carbon ) .
Some of the evolved water could react with carbon to make more carbon monoxide and hydrogen .
It looks to me that the energy loss in this process could be made very small if it 's driven by external heat , such as the waste heat from a high - temperature fuel cell .

A 45 % - efficient , 10 megawatt fuel cell system would consume about 22 MWth of carbonizer off - gas , and emit about 43 tons of carbon ( 160 tons CO 2 ) per day .
160 tons of CO 2 is about 76,000 cubic meters .
If Greenfuel 's process could produce algae sufficient to make 10,000 gallons of ethanol per acre per year , that 's about 15.6 tons of carbon / acre / year or 0.0427 tons / acre/day .
Capture of carbon at this rate would require about 1000 acres of algae farm , or ~400 hectares ( 4 million m 2 ) .
If the algae farm was constructed as plastic greenhouses , they would only need to be about 19 centimeters tall to limit the CO 2 concentration to 10 % ; a greenhouse system an average of 2 meters tall could hold roughly 10 days of carbon inventory at 10 % concentration .

Die Gründungsphase ist für einen Existenzgründer eine besonders intensive Zeit voller offener Fragen .
Der Weg in die Selbstständigkeit hält so manch Hürde bereit , die von jedem Einzelnen zunächst genommen werden müssen .
Eine besondere Problematik stellt hierbei oft der Bereich der Buchhaltung sowie der Finanzen dar .
Im Regelfall besitzen nicht viele Gründer eine natürliche Affinität in diesen Arealen , sodass es hier zu vielen verschiedenen Themen kommt , die nicht zum Alltagsfachwissen eines Menschen gehören .
Hier kann guter
Rat oft teuer sein .
Im nachfolgenden Beitrag werden für Existentgründer eine Reihe offener Fragen zur Start - up - Phase thematisiert und beleuchtet .
Die Wahl des Geschäftskontos
Jeder Selbstständige steht in seiner start - up - Phase vor der Situation , dass die Finanzen geregelt werden müssen .
Viele Banken schließen in ihrem Privatkundenbereich die Abwicklung von Zahlungsvorgängen gewerblicher Tätigkeit aus .
Das bedeutet , dass Kunden in diesem Bereich hier dringend ein Geschäftskonto eröffnen müssen .
Der Finanzmarkt bietet hierzu eine Reihe von Optionen .
Im ersten Schritt erscheint es sinnvoll einzelne unabhängig agierende Vergleichportale im Internet mit einer Anfrage zu bemühen , um einen Überblick über die passenden Kontooptionen und infragekommenden Banken zu erhalten .
Hierbei kann man schnell und unkompliziert Geschäftskonto Konditionsvergleiche aufführen .
Auf diese Weise kann der Suchende schnelle und unkomplizierte Vergleiche durchführen .
Folgende Firmenkonten können für Selbstständige und Freiberufler besonders interessant sein :
N26 Business

Holvi
Kontist
Hufsy
Falls man für eine juristische Person ( z.B. eine GmbH ) ein Firmenkonto sucht , dann lohnt sich der Blick in die Geschäftskundenangebote der Filialbanken , wie Deutsche Bank , Commerzbank oder Postbank , zu werfen .
Ebenfalls bietet es sich die Gelegenheit ein kostenloses Geschäftskonto zu eröffnen , siehe hier https://www.geschaeftskonten24.net/kostenloses-geschaeftskonto/.
Je nach Kontomodell und Angebot kann man so sehr einfach die unnötigen Kontoführungsgebühren vermeiden und von den hilfreichen Features , wie z.B. kostenfreien Rechnungsstellungsoption ( siehe Holvi ) zu profitieren .
Kosten für eine Geschäftskonto
Die kostenpflichtigen Bestandteile eines solchen Kontos können ganz unterschiedlich sein .
Im Regelfall lassen sich die Banken hier Überweisungen und Lastschriften etwas kosten , sodass durchaus umfangreiche Kostenaspekte auf den Existenzgründer zukommen können .
Ein Tipp ist der Abschluss eines Geschäftskontos bei einer Direktbank .
Erfahrungsgemäß fallen die anfallenden Kosten bei einer Direktbank niedriger als bei klassischen Bankenhäusern aus .
Die Direktbanken geben den bestehenden Kostenvorteil an ihre Kunden weiter , denn sie betreiben kein teures Filialnetz oder ähnliche Aspekte .
Ein Steuerberater kann helfen
Vor allem Existentgründer , die in dem finanztechnischen Part der Existenzgründung unsicher sind , sollten sich hier Unterstützung durch einen Fachmann holen .
Es bieten sich in solchen Fällen versierte Steuerberater an , die in diesem Zuge helfen können und mit rat und Tat unterstützen .
Im Zuge einer ordnungsgemäßen Buchführung sind beispielsweise diverse Fristen einzuhalten , die bei vielen Gründern immer wieder nicht eingehalten , nicht aus Böswilligkeit , sondern aus Überarbeitung .
Der Steuerberater hilft auch in solchen Fällen .
Fazit : die Existenzgründungsphase
Die Gründung eines eigenen Unternehmens ist auch für finanztechnische Spezialisten ein anspruchsvolles Unterfangen .
Laien stoßen hier vor allem aufgrund der stressigen Gründungsphase häufig an die eigenen Grenzen .
Um den Buchhaltungs - und Finanzbereich hier adäquat durchführen zu können , sollten aufgrund dessen die Dienste der Spezialisten in Anspruch genommen werden .

CIA Analyst Discusses Possible Cheney 9/11 Stand - down Order .
Retired CIA Analyst Ray McGovern discusses the possibility of vice president Cheney issuing a stand - down order that allowed the 9/11 attacks to succeed , on a national talk radio program .
. . .
Mineta and the secret orders of Cheney
In 2003 , Former Secretary of Transportation Norman Mineta testified before the 9/11 Commission :
Mineta : “ During the time that the airplane was coming into the Pentagon , there was a young man who would come in and say to the Vice President … the plane is 50 miles out … the plane is 30 miles out …. and when it got down to the plane is 10 miles out , the young man also said to the vice president “ do the orders still stand ? ”
And the Vice President turned and whipped his neck around and said “ Of course the orders still stand , have you heard anything to the contrary !? ? ”
Defenders of the Official Conspiracy Theory often claim that Mineta was referring to United 93 and not to unidentified plane coming towards Washington D.C. before the explosion at the Pentagon .

Norman Mineta Confirms That Dick Cheney Ordered Stand Down on 9/11
Norman Mineta made it clear to reporters– who verified his quotes in written text alongside him– that Mineta was indeed talking about a stand down order not to shoot down hijacked aircraft headed for the Pentagon .

Noam Chomsky – Controlled Asset Of The New World Order
Noam Chomsky says , “ Even if it were true , who cares ? ”
He goes onto say that even if it were true that JFK was murdered by the government , “ Who knows ?
And who cares ?
I mean plenty of people get killed all the time . ”
“ The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion , but allow very lively debate within that spectrum . ”

Noam Chomsky the Establishment ’s Left Gatekeeper Misdirecting You Away from Real Issues
Should Noam Chomsky reset his Compass ?
Although Chomsky co-wrote a book , called “ Manufacturing Consent , ” about how the Establishment shapes the opinion of the masses , he did n’t think about using that same kind of keen analysis in this book .
In particular , with respect to 9/11 , neither here nor in his earlier book , entitled , “ 9/11 , ” did Chomsky touch on the powerful idea that the power brokers both cause and interpret what ’s going on in a way that supports their agenda .
This leads me to wonder : Was 9/11 , too , manufactured ?
Did the Bush - Cheney Gang know it was coming and let it happen ?
Or , was it Machiavellian plot put into play by sinister intelligence agencies looking for a pretext to set the U.S. up to demonize Islam , attack Iraq and turn this country into a police state ?
Chomsky declines to open up that kind of necessary inquiry .
Noam Chomsky and the Pro-Israel Lobby
Chomsky frequently criticized the half - hearted criticism by liberals of US foreign policy , yet he nowhere raises a single peep about the absolute silence of Jewish progressives about the major role of the Lobby in promoting the invasion of Iraq .
At no point does he engage in debate or criticism of the scores of Israel First academic supporters of war with Iraq , Iran or Syria .
Instead his criticism of the war revolves around the role of Party leaders , the Bush Administration etc… without any attempt to understand the organized basis and ideological mentors of the militarists .
Chomsky totally ignores the disinformation office set up in the Pentagon by ultra Zionist Douglas Feith – the so - called ‘ Office of Special Plans ’ – run by fellow ZionCon Abram Shumsky to channel bogus “ data ” to the White House – bypassing and discrediting CIA and military intelligence which contradicted their disinformation .
Non-Zionist specialist in the Pentagon ’s Middle East office Colonel Karen Kwiatkowski described in great detail the easy and constant flow of Mossad and Israeli military officers in and out of Feith ’s office , while critical US experts were virtually barred .
Noam Chomsky , Closet Capitalist
Chomsky invests in oil companies , military contractors and pharmaceuticals
Chomsky ’s marketing efforts shortly after Sept. 11 give new meaning to the term “ war profiteer . ”
In the days after the tragedy , he raised his speaking fee from US $ 9,000 to US $ 12,000 because he was suddenly in greater demand .
He also cashed in by producing another instant book .
Seven Stories Press , a small publisher , pulled together interviews conducted via e-mail that Chomsky gave in the three weeks following the attack on the Twin Towers and rushed the book to press .
His controversial views were hot , particularly overseas .
By early December 2001 , the publisher had sold the foreign rights in 19 different languages .
The book made the best - seller list in the United States , Canada , Germany , India , Italy , Japan and New Zealand .
It is safe to assume that he netted hundreds of thousands of dollars from this book alone .
Chomsky , for all of his moral dudgeon against American corporations , finds that they make a pretty good investment .
When he made investment decisions for his retirement plan at MIT , he chose not to go with a money market fund or even a government bond fund .
Instead , he threw the money into blue chips and invested in the TIAA - CREF stock fund .
A look at the stock fund portfolio quickly reveals that it invests in all sorts of businesses that Chomsky says he finds abhorrent : oil companies , military contractors , pharmaceuticals , you name it .
Noam Chomsky – Controlled Asset Of The New World Order
“ Since 9 - 11 , he has steadfastly refused to discuss the evidence of government complicity and prior knowledge .
Furthermore , he claims that the Council on Foreign Relations ( CFR ) , Bilderberg Committee , and Trilateral Commission are “ nothing organizations . ”
When critiquing poverty , he never mentions the Federal Reserve and their role in manipulating the cycle of debt .
Similarly , he claims the CIA was never a rogue organization and is an innocent scapegoat ; that JFK was killed by the lone assassin Lee Harvey Oswald ; that the obvious vote fraud in 2004 did not occur … ”
Rethinking Noam Chomsky
These articles by Michael Morrissey , Bob Feldman , Daniel Abrahamson , and Benjamin Merhav among others , may get you thinking twice about Noam Chomsky and similar nationally touted “ critics ” of the government .
Chomsky , in particular , is thought of as the creme - de - la - creme of anti-government muckrakers while he simultaneously embraces every facet of the government ’s cover story when it comes to who was responsible for killing JFK , or the origin of AIDS , or the Vietnam War turn - around following the JFK assassination , or 9 - 11 .
Despite appearances to the contrary , Chomsky sides with the government ’s version of events with virtually every major ‘ conspiracy ’ scandal to emerge in the past 45 years .

He ’s right .

He owns tens of thousands of shares – including nearly 2,000 shares of Boeing , nearly 1,000 of Sonoco , more than 4,000 of Best Foods , more than 3,000 of Eli Lilly , more than 8,000 of Bank One and more than 2,000 of Halliburton , the company most vilified by Moore in “ Fahrenheit 9/11 . ”
Noam Chomsky has made a reputation for calling America a police state and branding the Pentagon “ the most hideous institution on earth , ” yet his entire academic career , writes Schweizer , has been subsidized by the U.S. military .

BAGHDAD , March 20 — Insurgents detonated a bomb in a car carrying two children after using the children as decoys to get through a military checkpoint in Baghdad , an American general said Tuesday .
Speaking at a news briefing at the Pentagon , Maj. Gen. Michael D. Barbero , deputy director for regional operations at the Pentagon ’s Joint Staff , said that American soldiers had stopped the car at the checkpoint but allowed it to pass after they seeing the two children in the back seat .
“ Children in the back seat lower suspicion , ” he said , according to a transcript .
“ We let it move through .
They parked the vehicle .
The adults run out and detonate it with the children in back . ”
General Barbero offered no further specifics about the incident .
Lt. Col. Christopher Garver , a top American military spokesman in Baghdad , said late Tuesday that his office had no record of the bombing but was researching it .
“ I do n’t know what event he ’s talking about , ” Colonel Garver said , Agence France - Presse , quoting an unnamed American military official , said the incident occurred Sunday .
The bombers parked the vehicle across the street from a school and then ran away , leaving the children inside , the official told A.F.P .
The blast killed the two children and three other civilians and wounded seven , the official said .
There are many people that think being a problogger is great , and for the most part it is , but I wanted to cover some of the negative side of being a problogger , and a few things that most people do n’t think about .
Working From Home
Most people would n’t expect working from home to be an item on the con ’s list , but it is .
There are a lot more distractions at home from telemarketers , family and friends , and objects you own .
I have found a days wasted in front of the television , or on the phone , when I should have been getting work done instead .
Sometimes you just think to yourself , maybe a round or two on the Xbox will allow me to unwind so I can refocus , and the next thing you know , it is late in the evening and you have n’t done any work at all .
Balancing Work and Life
Balancing work and life ties in with working from home as in both , you will need to separate yourself from the world around you , and manage your time .
I am pretty bad at this .
I either give work all my time , or my home life all my time .
Sometimes I wonder if I would n’t be better off working twelve hours a day for four days a week , and dealing with the rest of what constitutes my life during the three days off .
But either way , it can be horrible to try to find the energy and focus to properly balance work and life .
Not being able to do this has caused burnout and created rifts in my relationships on numerous occasions .
Computer Time
When working as a problogger , you will spend an inordinate amount of time on a computer .
So much so that you will have to become an expert at using one .
It will become part of your ever day routine , and take over your life .
I now have three computers at home , and because I am a geek , they all have different operating systems .
I suggest that no one else ever go to such extremes , but if you want to be a problogger , you will have to get used to using computers all the time .
Oh , and you computer (s ) will stop working at the worst time , so you best get good at repairing them or know someone that can .
Personality Requirements
There is something about problogging that requires a strange personality .
One that can deal with being alone for long periods of time , and yet that same person also has to be able to network , and be interesting to be around .
This type of personality is rare , and also a bit odd , and so that is why it is in the con ’s column of being a problogger .
Energy Usage
One of the things that I have noticed about this job is the small amount of energy that the jobs uses .
Sure reading and writing all day can be tiring , but my belly says that I am getting fatter and more physically lazy .
Now , things that were difficult before , like roller blading for a couple hours , seem impossible after only an hour .
It is like your body gets used to only needing a tiny bit of energy .
Your appetite slowly changes , and you begin to gain weight .
Think fatblogging is only a fad ?
I think it ’s only going to get worse .
Between the high amount of focus and concentration , and the near zero amount physical activity , blogging can really wear you down .
Unstable Industry
You have to remember that pretty much anything online is pretty unstable .
As an international problogger , I have to deal with the currency exchange , but other than that , I face the same instabilities as other probloggers .
Some of the things you might face include : monetization strategies change , search engine optimization can shift about , and niches that are worth thousands of dollars one day , can have so much new competition introduced that they are only worth pennies the next .
Does n’t that seem like fun ?
It sometimes feels like you spend almost as much time planning ahead as working on your current projects .
Conclusion
These are just some of the negatives that come with working in the blogging industry , but after all that , I am still glad that I do what I do .
This has been the most enjoyable job I have ever had , and I really hope that it never ends .
Just keep all this in mind when you are looking at going the problogger route , and if any of these are a deal breaker , then walk away , and try something else .
The Above - the - Fold Myth
We are all well aware that web design is not an easy task .
There are many variables to consider , some of them technical , some of them human .
The technical considerations of designing for the web can ( and do ) change quite regularly , but the human variables change at a slower rate .
Sometimes the human variables change at such a slow rate that we have a hard time believing that it happens .
This is happening right now in web design .
There is an astonishing amount of disbelief that the users of web pages have learned to scroll and that they do so regularly .
Holding on to this disbelief – this myth that users wo n’t scroll to see anything below the fold – is doing everyone a great disservice , most of all our users .
First , a definition :
The word “ fold ” means a great many things , even within the discipline of design .
The most common use of the term “ fold ” is perhaps used in reference to newspaper layout .
Because of the physical dimensions of the printed page of a broadsheet newspaper , it is folded .
The first page of a newspaper is where the “ big ” stories of the issue are because it is the best possible placement .
Readers have to flip the paper over ( or unfold it ) to see what else is in the issue , therefore there is a chance that someone will miss it .
In web design , the term “ fold ” means the line beyond which a user must scroll to see more contents of a page ( if it exists ) after the page displays within their browser .
It is also referred to as a “ scroll - line . ”
Screen performance data and new research indicate that users will scroll to find information and items below the fold .
There are established design best practices to ensure that users recognize when a fold exists and that content extends below it1 .
Yet during requirements gathering for design projects designers are inundated with requests to cram as much information above the fold as possible , which complicates the information design .
Why does the myth continue , when we have documented evidence that the fold really does n’t matter in certain contexts ?
Once upon a time , page - level vertical scrolling was not permitted on AOL .
Articles , lists and other content that would have to scroll were presented in scrolling text fields or list boxes , which our users easily used .
Our pages , which used proprietary technology , were designed to fit inside a client application , and the strictest of guidelines ensured that the application desktop itself did not scroll .
The content pages floated in the center of the application interface and were too far removed from the scrollbar location for users to notice if a scrollbar appeared .
Even if the page appeared to be cut off , as current best practices dictate , it proved to be such an unusual experience to our users that they assumed that the application was “ broken . ”
We had to instill incredible discipline in all areas of the organization that produced these pages – content creation , design and development – to make sure our content fit on these little pages .
As AOL moved away from our proprietary screen technology to an open web experience , we enjoyed the luxury of designing longer ( and wider ) pages .
Remaining sensitive to the issues of scrolling from our history , we developed and employed practices for designing around folds :
We chose as target screen resolutions those used by the majority of our users .
We identified where the fold would fall in different browsers , and noted the range of pixels that would be in the fold “ zone . ”
We made sure that images and text appeared “ broken ” or cut off at the fold for the majority of our users ( based on common screen resolutions and browsers ) .
We kept the overall page height to no more than 3 screens .
But even given our new larger page sizes , we were still presented with long lists of items to be placed above the fold – lists impossible to accommodate .
There were just too many things for the limited amount of vertical space .
For example , for advertising to be considered valuable and saleable , a certain percentage of it must appear above the 1024×768 fold .
Branding must be above the fold .
Navigation must be above the fold – or at least the beginning of the list of navigational choices .
( If the list is well organized and displayed appropriately , scanning the list should help bring users down the page . )
Big content ( the primary content of the site ) should begin above the fold .
Some marketing folks believe that the actual number of data points and links above the fold is a strategic differentiator critical to business success .
Considering the limited vertical real estate available and the desire for multiple ad units and functionality described above , an open design becomes impossible .
And why ?
Because people think users do n’t scroll .
Jakob Nielsen wrote about the growing acceptance and understanding of scrolling in 19972 , yet 10 years later we are still hearing that users do n’t scroll .
Research debunking this myth is starting to pop up , and a great example of this is the report available on ClickTale.com3 .
In it , the researchers used their proprietary tracking software to measure the activity of 120,000 pages .
Their research gives data on the vertical height of the page and the point to which a user scrolls .
In the study , they found that 76 % of users scrolled and that a good portion of them scrolled all the way to the bottom , despite the height of the screen .
Even the longest of web pages were scrolled to the bottom .
One thing the study does not capture is how much time is spent at the bottom of the page , so the argument can be made that users might just scan it and not pay much attention to any content placed there .
This is where things get interesting .
I took a look at performance data for some AOL sites and found that items at the bottom of pages are being widely used .
Perhaps the best example of this is the popular celebrity gossip website TMZ.com .
The most clicked on item on the TMZ homepage is the link at the very bottom of the page that takes users to the next page .
Note that the TMZ homepage is often over 15000 pixels long – which supports the ClickTale research that scrolling behavior is independent of screen height .
Users are so engaged in the content of this site that they are following it down the page until they get to the “ next page ” link .
Maybe it ’s not fair to use a celebrity gossip site as an example .
After all , we ’re not all designing around such tantalizing guilty - pleasure content as the downfall of beautiful people .
So , let ’s look at some drier content .
For example , take AOL News Daily Pulse .
You ’ll notice the poll at the bottom of the page – the vote counts are well over 300,000 each .
This means that not only did folks scroll over 2000 pixels to the bottom of the page , they actually took the time to answer a poll while they were there .
Hundreds of thousands of people taking a poll at the bottom of a page can easily be called a success .
But , you may argue , these pages are both in blog format .
Perhaps blogs encourage scrolling more than other types of pages .
I ’m not convinced , since blog format is of the “ newest content on top ” variety , but it may be true .
However , looking at pages that are not in blog format , we see the same trend .
On the AOL Money & Finance homepage , users find and use the modules for recent quotes and their personalized portfolios even when these modules are placed well beneath the 1024×768 fold .
Another example within AOL Money & Finance is a photo gallery entitled Top Tax Tips .
Despite the fact that the gallery is almost 2500 pixels down the page , this gallery generates between 200,000 and 400,000 page views depending on promotion of the Taxes page .
It is clear that where a given item falls in relation to the fold is becoming less important .
Users are scrolling to see what they want , and finding it .
The key is the content – if it is compelling , users will follow where it leads .
When does the fold matter ?
The most basic rule of thumb is that for every site the user should be able to understand what your site is about by the information presented to them above the fold .
If they have to scroll to even discover what the site is , its success is unlikely .
Functionality that is essential to business strategy should remain ( or at least begin ) above the fold .
For example , if your business success is dependent on users finding a particular thing ( movie theaters , for example ) then the widget to allow that action should certainly be above the fold .
Screen height and folds matter for applications , especially rapid - fire applications where users input variables and change the display of information .
The input and output should be in very close proximity .
Getting stock quotes is an example : a user may want to get four or five quotes in sequence , so it is imperative that the input field and the basic quote information display remain above the fold for each symbol entered .
Imagine the frustration at having to scroll to find the input field for each quote you wanted .
Where IS the fold ?
Here is perhaps the biggest problem of all .
The design method of cutting - off images or text only works if you know where the fold is .
There is a lot of information out there about how dispersed the location of fold line actually is .
Again , a very clear picture of this problem is shown on ClickTale .
In the same study of page scrolling , fold locations of viewed screens were captured , based on screen resolution and browser used .
It ’s a sad , sad thing , but the single highest concentration of fold location ( at around 600 pixels ) for users accounted for less than 10 % of the distribution .
This pixel - height corresponds with a screen resolution of 1024×768 .
Browser applications take away varying amounts of vertical real estate for their interfaces ( toolbars , address fields , etc ) .
Each browser has a slightly different size , so not all visitors running a resolution of 1024×768 will have a fold that appears in the same spot .
In the ClickTale study , the three highest fold locations were 570 , 590 and 600 pixels — apparently from different browsers running on 1024 ×768 screens .
But the overall distribution of fold locations for the entire study was so varied that even these three sizes together only account for less than 26 % of visits .
What does all this mean ?
If you pick one pixel location on which to base the location of the fold when designing your screens , the best - case scenario is that you ’ll get the fold line exactly right for only 10 % of your visitors .
So what do we do now ?
Stop worrying about the fold .
Do n’t throw your best practices out the window , but stop cramming stuff above a certain pixel point .
You ’re not helping anyone .
Open up your designs and give your users some visual breathing room .
If your content is compelling enough your users will read it to the end .
Advertisers currently want their ads above the fold , and it will be a while before that tide turns .
But it ’s very clear that the rest of the page can be just as valuable – perhaps more valuable – to contextual advertising .
Personally , I ’d want my ad to be right at the bottom of the TMZpage , forget the top .
The biggest lesson to be learned here is that if you use visual cues ( such as cut - off images and text ) and compelling content , users will scroll to see all of it .
The next great frontier in web page design has to be bottom of the page .
You ’ve done your job and the user scrolled all the way to the bottom of the page because they were so engaged with your content .
Now what ?
Is a footer really all we can offer them ?
If we know we ’ve got them there , why not give them something to do next ?
Something contextual , a natural next step in your site , or something with which to interact ( such as a poll ) would be welcome and , most importantly , used .

The neurobiologist describes how a debilitating stroke gave her the chance to learn a new way of thinking
Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor shows off her piece " Neural Processing " which she created for a community project in Bloomington , Indiana .
The sculpture draws a connection between the metaphor between art and the right hemisphere , which processes information in the same intuitive way in which art expresses itself .
Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor , neuroanatomist and spokeswoman for the Harvard Brain Tissue Resource Center at McLean Hospital , had a stroke at 37 that traumatized her left hemisphere and eliminated her math and language skills .
Her right hemisphere , which typically houses nonverbal and artistic tasks , has taken up the bulk of her cognition .
Yet Dr. Taylor ’s intimate knowledge of the brain has lent her the determination to recover – a seven - year process during which she created stained - glass brains as both a means of expression and a therapeutic tool .
I asked Dr. Taylor a few questions about the links between her art and brain recovery just before the publication of her memoir , My Stroke of Insight : A Brain Scientist ’s Personal Journey .
In it , she recounts her recovery and describes what it was like to struggle with diminished mental abilities while the neuroscientist in her was thinking , “ Wow , this is so cool ! ”
When you were making stained - glass brains , how much were you creating from experience looking at and handling brains , compared to images in neuroanatomy reference books ?
I have a three - dimensional picture of the brain in my mind ’s eye and the stained - glass brain image is my artistic impression of the different parts of the organ and how they intersect .
It is a composite of how others depict the brain in two dimensions and what I know to be true about the brain in three dimensions from dissection .
How much is science , how much is art , and how do they intersect for you ?
Art is beauty to me , the brain is beautiful to me ; therefore the brain is beautiful art to me , whether in glass or in our heads .
This was a form of art therapy ; what differences did you notice between your recovery and others who did n’t benefit from it ?
Were certain abilities re-established more easily or quickly ?
I cannot compare this project to anyone else ’s recovery .
All I can do is speak to what it helped me with :
1. Balance and equilibrium to stand still in front of a workspace and manipulate the project .
2. Gross motor movement .
Handling glass is very delicate and dangerous .
I was highly motivated to be very careful for both the glass and myself .
3. Fine - motor dexterity .
Cutting glass is a precise activity ; grinding glass requires holding my body firm .
Equilibrium , pushing into the grinder – gross motor – and then lining all of the pieces up – fine motor .
4. Cognitive development .
This type of a project is a long - term project with lots of steps .
It helped me in my linear thinking .
5. Cartoon development of the original image required a combination of intuition and sensory organization .
6. Focus and concentration balanced with sleep .
7. Artistry .
How does one tweak it all to make it remarkable and beautiful ?
What about your creative thinking ?
When I lost my left hemisphere I lost all of the normal “ in the box ” thinking .
When we think about shifts in the brain it is inadequate to focus on the loss because with every loss there is a gain .
As a society we do not focus on what someone has gained in the absence of something they have lost .
When I lost the ability to define , organize and categorize information , I gained the ability to be intuitive and creative .
In the absence of the left mind and its dominating inhibition , I gained a completely uninhibited right mind which processes information in a completely unique way when compared to the left mind .
That ’s something many people strive for , and Dr. Taylor achieved this serenity in a unique way .
Do n’t wait for a stroke , cultivate your right - brain functions now .

The IRS wants its money .
That 's why it has helpfully assembled a list of the most common excuses people use ( PDF ) for not paying their taxes .
In case you were n't aware of it , a claim that " the 16th Amendment is invalid because it contradicts the original Constitution , was not properly ratified , and lacks an enabling clause " wo n't fly with the government .
In the same spirit , the government has recently been leaning on eBay to make sure that sellers are not dodging their own tax responsibilities , but eBay wants no part of the government 's plan .
This is an ongoing saga , but the Financial Times has a wrapup of the current situation .
In short , the US government wants to treat eBay as a " broker " who would then be required to file notices with the government about how much money its traders have made .
The US proposal calls for this reporting to take place only when people sell more than several thousand dollars worth of merchandise in a year .
With so many people making part or all of their living through eBay , the government wants its cut .
This is n't an issue of any new taxes , but an attempt to collect the income tax that is already required .
Because eBay does not report information about its sellers to the government , income reporting is left up to individuals , and the temptation not to list eBay revenue as income can be a strong one — and in some cases , it 's not always clear when one has to do so .
The government believes that tougher enforcement of the rules could net as much as $ 2 billion a year , which is n't chump change , even to the Feds .
e Bay is resisting calls for it to file any documents , saying that it does not fit the definition of a broker , and that to selectively target it puts the company at a competitive disadvantage .
eBay apparently believes that sellers would go elsewhere if they knew that the government would learn how much they made in a given year .
A San Francisco Chronicle on the subject points out just what a difference such reporting makes .
When wages are reported directly to the government ( as they are on W - 2 forms from most employers ) , 96 precent cough up what they owe .
When income is not reported , compliance drops in half .
e Bay is n't the only Internet business that has been feeling the heat in recent months .
The government is also considering how to apply tax laws to virtual worlds and goods , and it faces some of the same problems that it does with eBay .
While some sellers can make a good living out of hawking such items , few report the profits as taxable income , and Uncle Sam wants its cut .
Finally , in other tech tax news , the IRS has just announced that 30 percent of filers this years have so far missed out on the refund they are owed from a long - distance excise tax .
A recent court ruling declared that the tax did not actually apply to contemporary long - distance services , and the government stopped collecting it .
Now , they are offering a refund that ranges from $ 30 -$ 60 .
Do n't forget to claim the refund ; the IRS is publicizing the tax break , but wo n't give it unless filers request it .
Well - connected drug company obtained anthrax vaccine contracts despite side effects Julie Weisberg
Published : Tuesday May 29 , 2007 Print This Email This
Two former high - ranking health officials with close ties to the Bush administration helped a Michigan - based pharmaceutical company secure sole - source , multi-million dollar federal contracts for the purchase of its controversial anthrax vaccine , a RAW STORY investigation has found .
Last month , Emergent BioSolutions announced that the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) intended to purchase more than 18 million doses of its Biothrax vaccine for the Strategic National Stockpile .
The strategic stockpile is set aside for civilian use during a large - scale emergency , such as a bioterrorism attack or natural disaster .
Once finalized , the contract will be the largest of its kind for Emergents anthrax vaccine .
BioThrax is the only FDA - licensed vaccine for anthrax in the United States .
The Pentagon has used it for the militarys mandatory anthrax vaccination program for the last ten years , though not without problems .
Although the military continues to publicly claim the vaccine is safe and effective ,  thousands of soldiers have suffered adverse reactions , ranging from mild to severe .
In March , RAW STORY revealed that Walter Reed is investigating links between the vaccine and life - threatening autoimmune diseases .
Hundreds of U.S. service members have refused the shots , fearing the side - effects experienced by some 80 percent of the soldiers who receive them , according to a 2002 General Accountability Office report .
Last year , the Department of Homeland Security granted BioThrax special protections under its Support Anti-Terrorism by Fostering Effective Technology Act , or SAFETY Act .
It was the first vaccine to receive protection under the Act .
According to an Emergent press release , the act certifies BioThrax is an approved product for homeland security  and provides significant liability protection in the event the vaccine is administered to civilians in a terrorist attack .
After an initial contact with DHS spokesperson Christopher Kelly , Kelly did not respond to further RAW STORY requests for additional information on the departments decision to grant BioThrax SAFETY
Act protections .
The corruption of revolving doors According to company documents filed by Emergent BioSolutions with the Security and Exchange Commission , two former officials with the Department of Health and Human Services -- Jerome Hauer , who was Acting Assistant Secretary of the Office of Public Health and Emergency Preparedness in 2002 - 03 , and Dr. Louis Sullivan , who served as HHS Secretary under former President George H.W. Bush -- worked as paid lobbyists in an aggressive and well - connected lobbying effort to secure the Biothrax contracts .
In their administration posts , both Hauer and Sullivan had helped oversee the National Strategic Stockpile and aided in policy development and drug procurement related to countering bioterrorism .
After working as lobbyists for Emergent , the two men were invited to sit on the companys board of directors .
 The pharmaceutical industry is a strong case in point of the corruption of revolving doors ,  says Craig Holman of Public Citizen , a national , nonprofit consumer advocate and government watchdog group .
Holman , who is also the co-author of  A Matter of Trust : How the Revolving Door Undermines Public Confidence in Government -- and What To Do About It ,  states that winning  government contracts by establishing or exploiting close personal ties to an administration is part of the on-going , widespread corruption that plagues the federal government .
 The very businesses subject to regulation have largely taken over the agencies that oversee them through critical governmental appointments , and befriended the same agencies by hiring former key public officials to sit on their boards and make phone calls to their colleagues still in the agencies ,  Holman said .
However , Marc Wolfson , an HHS spokesperson , says lobbying and connections have not been a factor in Emergents recent success .
 Having these people on the board has not been a factor at all ,  Wolfson said .
Emergent BioSolutions  vice president for corporate communications , Robert Burrows , agreed .
 This companys success is not based in political know - how ,  Burrows wrote in an email .
 The ability to move science from the laboratory bench to product development and through the worlds toughest regulatory system -- the Food and Drug Administration review process -- is what matters most .
 Other companies are not competing with Emergent for government contracts for one reason only : they have not developed a product that meets the standards set by the FDA ,  he added .
Another former Bush administration official , former Federal Emergency Management Director Joe Allbaugh , joined Emergents board in June 2006 .
Allbaugh had been George W. Bush 's chief of staff when he was governor of Texas and was national campaign manager for the 2000 Bush - Cheney campaign .
In 2003 , Allbaugh formed his own consulting and lobbying group , Allbaugh Company , which boasts clients such as Kellogg Brown and Root , Northrup Grumman , and BP America .
 The revolving door has been richly rewarding for the pharmaceutical industry -- and those public officials who give the industry what it wants ,  Holman said .
Hauer declined to be interviewed for this story , and both he and a spokeperson for Allbaugh said all press questions should be directed to Emergents PR people .
RAW STORY was unable to independently contact Sullivan .
Ramping up its lobbying effort
To help jump - start its lobbying effort , from September to November 2004 Emergent board member and former Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Louis Sullivan provided consulting services for a fixed fee of $ 25,000 per month ,  according to Emergents proxy report for shareholders , filed last month .
During that time , Sullivan set up at least one meeting with government scientists and Emergent officials .
On November 4 , 2004 , HHS filed an intent to procure five million doses of BioThrax for the nations strategic stockpile .
It was Emergents first large scale production contract with the department and was worth more than $ 122 million .
That same day , HHS announced it had awarded an $ 877.5 million sole - source contract to VaxGen Inc. -- a small pharmaceutical company in California with no marketable products , best known for its failed HIV vaccine -- for the creation and delivery of 75 million doses of a new anthrax vaccine , with 25 million doses due in 2006 .
Emergent BioSolutions had not entered a bid for the contract .
However , over the next two years , Emergent would spend millions of dollars on a lobbying effort to discredit VaxGen and convince HHS that instead of focusing on a new vaccine , the department should purchase millions of doses of BioThrax for its civilian stockpile .
 They spread a lot of misinformation about us ,  Lance Ignon , a spokesman for VaxGen said , referring to lobbyists for Emergent .
Emergents Burrows countered that  the proven safety and efficacy of BioThrax as a preventive therapy for front line troops , first - responders and the start of a general stockpile of care speaks for itself in winning contracts .
The long and well - connected road Perhaps the best - connected member of Emergents board is Jerry Hauer .
Hauer , who served as an adviser on national security to the National Institute of Health and helped lead the response to the 2001 anthrax mailing attacks , has had a lucrative association with Emergent over several years .
While head of HHSs bioterrorism program , Hauer had urged an increase in the stockpiles amount of anthrax vaccine to allow for the inoculation of thousands of first responders .
He also urged mass smallpox vaccinations for health care workers .
Hauer left HHS in November 2003 and was working as a paid lobbyist and consultant for Emergent by December 2004 .
( Government ethics rules bar top federal officials from lobbying their former administrative agency for one year . )
In January 2005 , Hauer joined the lobbying group Fleishman - Hillard as a senior vice president .
The same month , Emergent entered into a contract with the firm , paying $ 20,000 a month for its services , according to the companys SEC filings .
That fee was increased to $ 30,000 several weeks later .
In June 2005 , Hauer joined Emergents board of directors , while still serving as one of the companys paid lobbyists .
He continues to maintain both positions with the company .
In March 2006 , Hauer left Fleishman - Hillard to form his own consulting and lobbying firm , with himself and his wife as sole owners .
That same month , Emergent terminated its lobbying contract with Fleishman - Hillard and entered into an agreement with Hauers firm to provide strategic consulting and domestic marketing advice .
Under the terms of the agreement , included in the SEC filing , Emergent BioSolutions pays the Hauer Group $ 15,000 a month for its services , which includes relationship management with targeted media outlets and reporters ,  facilitating introductions to relevant government officials ,  and introductions to potential commercial partners . 
Despite requesting RAW STORY s questions for this story , Burrows would not confirm the date when Hauer first began working for Emergent BioSolutions as a paid consultant or if Hauers service as a board member and employment as a consultant for the company -- as well as other biopharmaceutical companies -- would violate Emergents conflict of interest code .
VaxGen is squeezed out Around the same time that Hauer joined Emergent 's board of directors , in mid-2005 , VaxGen was required to push back its production timeline after running into difficulties with its vaccines development .
 Drug development is unpredictable ... you are going to run into twists and turns ,  Ignon said of the delay .
In fact , a recent GAO report referred to the governments contract with VaxGen as very aggressive with  no margin for error . 
Up until VaxGens 2005 stumble , Ignon said , the company had enjoyed a good working relationship with HHS .
But then , over the next several months , things started to deteriorate , and it just became more and more difficult to work with Health and Human Services . 
On May 5 , 2006 , the HHS Assistant Secretary for Public Health Emergency Preparedness -- the position that Hauer held during President Bushs first term -- announced that his department would purchase $ 120 million in additional doses of Emergents vaccine for the national stockpile .
A few days later , VaxGen announced that while HHS had granted an extension on the development and delivery of its vaccine , the department had unilaterally  made significant changes to its contract , imposing new requirements on the California drug maker before the government would purchase and pay for a finished product .
Louis Sullivan joined Emergent BioSolutions board of directors just a few weeks later , in June of 2006 , followed by Joe Allbaugh in July .
On November 15 , 2006 , Emergent BioSolutions -- previously a private company -- made an initial public offering .
In early November , the FDA ordered VaxGen to delay its trials , citing concerns over a possible decline in the vaccines shelf life .
In December , HHS cancelled the VaxGen contract , arguing that the company had failed to meet a required deadline to begin clinical trials .
The two parties recently settled out of court , after VaxGen appealed the decision .
Although Ignon said he couldnt draw a direct line from Emergents aggressive lobbying tactics and well - connected board of directors to VaxGens cancelled contract , he did say that it certainly did not make the process go any smoother .
 There was a real face off between science and politics ,  Ignon said .
 And I think that in the end , politics won. 
Late last month , Emergent announced that Health and Human Services intended to purchase up to more than 18 million doses of BioThrax .
The Pentagon also announced it would be purchasing at least four million doses of the vaccine , after resuming its mandatory anthrax vaccination program earlier this year .
HSS spokesman Marc Wolfson said that after canceling VaxGen 's contract , HSS had turned to Emergent to help fill civilian stockpile shelves , because it was the only company that manufactured an FDA - licensed anthrax vaccine .
He could not yet estimate what the contract would be worth to Emergent , because HHS and the company were still negotiating the details .
 It s the sole source ,  he said .
 It s the only one out there . 

The authorities had warned of the threat of attack by far - left groups
Rocks , bottles and sticks have been hurled at riot police , who are using tear gas and batons charges to try to disperse the hundreds of rioters .
However , the violence only involves a small portion of the estimated 30,000 people police say had joined the rally .
They are protesting against next week 's G8 summit of leading industrial nations in Heiligendamm , 25 km ( 16 miles ) away .
More than 160 groups of anti-globalisation activists , left - wing groups , students and anarchists had been taking part in the march .
Police say that at least 146 officers have been hurt in the fighting .
Masked protesters have broken up paving stones to use as projectiles and overturned and torched several vehicles , spreading a pall of black smoke over the area .
" The police were attacked massively from the violent protesters .
They threw bottles , fire crackers , rocks and Molotov cocktails , " police spokesman Frank Scheulen told the Associated Press .
Riot police have responded with tear gas and water cannon in an effort to drive them back .
Our correspondent says that although police have been involved in running charges with protesters they are isolated incidents on the fringes of the rally , involving just a fraction of those in attendance .
The majority of demonstrators have already passed through the city centre and are gathered near the harbour to enjoy a pop concert , our correspondent says .
The challenge for the police now is to contain the violence and ensure it does not reach that concert area , she adds .
Organisers at the concert have been making announcements urging people to stay where they are and not venture over to the part of town where the violence is taking place , but , according to our correspondent , many have been leaving to do just that .
Here to stay
The German authorities had warned in advance that there were serious concerns that far - left groups were planning violent attacks .
The authorities said they would react quickly to any trouble and had deployed at least 13,000 police onto the streets .
Some shops had boarded up their windows as a precautionary measure .
Many of the protesters have travelled to Rostock from all over Europe and the majority have made camp by the harbour saying that they will stay put until the G8 summit , which runs from 6 - 8 June .
The activist have pitched their tents in a large field where the main entrance bears the words : " No police and no neo - Nazis . "
" It 's very important people all over the world come and protest against the politics of G8 , which actually refer to all people of the world , although they are driven from the high elite in the G8 countries , " said one protester .
" They actually use citizens of the world and the environment of the world as their playground to achieve more money and power . "
Please Vote Targets !

While it 's generally admitted that the anthrax was produced by the US military or the CIA , that does n't tie it to Bush .
Someone could have stolen it .
Someone at the highest levels of the CIA or DOD could have ordered it made and sent .
What ties the anthrax to Bush is the targets .
They speak to motive .
A few other people in the world , say in a CIA / Military cabal , might have had access to the cultures , to Level 3 or 4 Biosafety containment , and even to the classified information and anthrax bacteria necessary to make this form of weaponized anthrax but only Bush would have the motivation to hit these specific targets .
The anthrax letters to the media are generally considered peripheral to political targets .
I do n't believe they were .
I think the letters to the media show how personal the targets were .
Let 's look the targets and their timing .
Sept. 18 , 2001 : Trenton Mailing of anthrax letters to NBC and NY Post and probably to the National Enquirer .
Oct. 9 , 2001 : Trenton Mailing of anthrax letters to Daschle and Leahy .
There were only five real targets .
Everyone else who got sick , who died , did so as a result of cross contamination in the mail stream .
The other victims were not targets .
They were collateral damage .
I believe their deaths were just as unimportant to Bush and the people around him as the deaths of innocents in Afghanistan or Iraq .
They just do n't matter to someone like him .
To identify a murderer the police concentrate on method , opportunity and motive .
Other members of the right wing / intelligence community / military cabal might have had the method and opportunity , but only Bush had the motive to hit these particular people .
They say a serial murder 's first victim tells more about him than any subsequent killing so let 's examine that first killing .
Florida anthrax letter : postal traces show that a letter containing anthrax must have been sent to the National Enquirer at its previous address , then forwarded to the AMI office .
http://www.fas.org/bwc/news/anthraxreport.htm
The trail of anthrax spores in postal machinery and equipment shows the letter was originally sent to The National Enquirer at its previous address , then forwarded to the AMI building , which contained offices for both The Enquirer and The Sun , and ended up in the hands of The Sun 's photo editor , Bob Stevens , 63 .
Later investigations indicate he might have opened the letter while sitting at his computer , spilling spores over the keyboard .
FBI Ignored Letter in Anthrax Probe
By now , there should be no dispute as to where the anthrax that killed Bob Stevens and nearly killed Ernesto Blanco came from .
If you follow the spores found by the EPA in the samplings it took at the AMI building , even the most obtuse investigator would have to conclude that they arrived by mail .
Begin at the Boca Raton , Fla. , post office that serviced AMI .
Anthrax spores matching those found at AMI were found there .
Once in the AMI building , the mail was sorted .
Either because the letter was addressed to the Sun tabloid , or because Blanco determined that it should go to the Sun even if addressed to the National Enquirer , he put it on his cart and began his regular route .
That route is marked by a trail of anthrax spores .
It begins at the mail room , wends its way up to the second floor and ends up at the Sun offices on the third floor , where it is given to a Sun employee .
Anthrax spores found on Bob Stevens ' computer keyboard show that he handled the letter .
http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2002/8/14/165224.shtml
It seems likely the letter that killed Bob Stevens was addressed to Photo Editor , The National Enquirer .
But the address for the Enquirer was no longer current .
They had moved to the American Media Building and so it was that the letter came into Bob Stevens hands .
Was he the only photo - editor in the building that day ?
Did he sub for The Enquirer photo editor ?
Who would have had a grudge against the tabloid and the photo - editor ?
Well , probably a lot of people , but none of them with this particular weapon at their disposal .
No one in the putative CIA / intelligence cabal seems likely to have had any grudge against The National Enquirer either .
Except for one .
Except for George W. Bush .
The Enquirer had published the picture of Jenna Bush , falling down drunk and looking like she was humping another girl 's leg .
For Bush it was personal .
A picture of his drunken daughter made him look bad and brought up all his drinking , drugging and partying issues .
And who knows , maybe he loves his daughter and was angry about the publication of a picture that made her look like a drunken whore .
But I doubt Bush is capable of love , except self - love .
This picture might have been an attack on that self - love , Jenna being an extension of himself , the child most like him , the party girl , not bright but fun , while daughter Barbara is the good child , the good student , the smart one .
She represents Jeb in this equation .
But even Barbara could n't be attacked with immunity .
The next target was at The New York Post .
It 's addressed to Editor , New York Post , 1211 Ave of the Americas , New York , NY 10036 .
Why would he and the Post be a target ?
If you go to their search page and do a search for Jenna what you come up with is a plethora of articles on the Boozing Bush Twins .
More and worse than anything published in The National Enquirer .
I believe the NYPost 's many articles on the boozing Bush twins made them a target .

Abstract : [ Bush ] 's warning came a day after The Post revealed that Comedy Central is doing a hasty retreat from plans to paint the Bush twins as " hot and sexy " and maybe lesbians in a new sitcom satirizing the first family .
So instead of another threat like the one aimed at Comedy Central , Bush went for the kill .
They were making fun of him and his drunken daughters and they would be punished for it .
And some of them died .
When it comes to revenge think of Valerie Palme .
THE VENGEANCE AND VILE WORK OF BUSH WHITE HOUSE ARE PLAIN TO SEE
By Bill Gallagher
The message to Joseph Wilson was abundantly clear and brutal :
If you deviate from the script , if you defy our power and might , serious consequences will result .
Woe betide those who cross us , and going public will cost you dearly .
Mess with us and you are going to pay a severe price .
The message was especially intended for the intelligence community -- the career government employees who know the White House exaggerated , misrepresented , misused and abused legitimate intelligence reports to fit its already determined political conclusion that Iraq was an " imminent threat " to U.S. security .
As Joseph Wilson told Reuters in August , " The reason for it was not to smear me or to even smear my wife .
...
The reason was to intimidate others from coming forward .
" Karl Rove is notoriously vindictive and his temper is volcanic .
While preparing an " Esquire " magazine profile , Ron Suskind , a Pulitzer prize - winning writer , had an appointment for a rare interview with Rove , and was sitting in an outer office waiting to be summoned .
Suskind heard Rove erupt , speaking to an aide about a political operative who displeased him .
Rove spewed the f-word , vowing to stick it to whomever crossed him .
" We will ruin him like no one has ever f----d him , " the president 's " brain " bellowed .
Maureen Dowd , the New York Times columnist , got it right on the mark as usual , writing , " Unable to find weapons of mass destruction , the Bush team has turned to weapons of personal destruction .
" That 's what the president and Karl Rove 's boys did to Joe Wilson and his wife , Valerie Plame .
It 's a vicious crime and reflects the fact that George W. Bush will do anything to stay in power and punish anyone who challenges his regime .
The next target was Tom Brokaw .
Brokaw had scheduled the broadcast of an interview with Clinton for September 18 on the NBC Nightly News .
When the White House got wind of it they called NBC to rant and complain .
The interview was still broadcast and that very evening an anthrax letter to Tom Brokaw hit the mailstream .
White House whitewashers
On the same day last week that " NBC Nightly News " anchor Tom Brokaw sat down to interview former President Clinton , executives for the program received unexpected phone calls from senior communications staffers at the White House , expressing disappointment about the decision to spotlight Bush 's predecessor .
While not asking the network to refrain from running the interview , they expressed the feeling that the Sept. 18 interview with Clinton would not be helpful to the current war on terrorism .
Neither NBC nor the White House would comment on the phone calls , but sources familiar with the calls confirmed that they happened .
http://dir.salon.com/news/feature/2001/09/27/spin/index.html
The personal nature of these three targets is deeply disturbing .
In some ways even more disturbing than the next targets and Bush 's successful attempt to get the Patriot Act , the most repressive bill ever introduced , passed by Congress and passed without it even being read .
Was it part of his still unsuccessful attempt to close down Congress and assume budgetary power ?
Not since the Magna Carta has a ruling monarch in an English country or colony had such power but it nearly happened in the days after the anthrax attack on the US Congress .
Certainly Daschle and Leahy were political targets but the media was just as much of an objective .
Bush was sending them a message that if they did not support him unconditionally then they might get another package of death .
If the anthrax attacks on the media were supposed to bring them into line , it totally worked .
Now no major media will cross Bush and they put the most minor of his appearances on TV and avoid any negative coverage of him .
You have to go to the web to get any real reporting .
US anthrax attackers aimed to assassinate Democratic leaders
Citing interviews with lab personnel , the newspaper concluded : " the emerging details are consistent with the increasingly popular hypothesis that last fall 's bioterrorist attacks were the work of a current or former Fort Detrick scientist .
" In other words , the leaders of the Democratic Party were targeted for assassination by right - wing elements that have some connection to the military .
This staggering fact , however , has been met with a strange silence by the media , government officials and the Democrats themselves , including the two senators who were targeted .
Investigators have determined that the letters contained weapons - grade anthrax , which an FBI microbiologist said was designed for " overkill . "
Two postal workers at the mail facility where the tainted letters were processed died after being exposed to up to 3,000 times the lethal dosage of the bacteria , while scores of Senate office workers were only spared because they were quickly treated .
The anthrax powder has been genetically traced to a single US military source : the Army 's Dugway Proving Grounds in Utah , the only facility known to have processed anthrax into the highly lethal powder form found in the letters .
The spores in the letters to Daschle and Leahy were identical to those sent from Dugway to the Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Disease ( USAMRID ) at Fort Detrick , in Frederick , Maryland , just outside of Washington , DC , and to a CIA lab in Langley , Virginia .
Within political and media circles it is generally conceded that the assassination plot was hatched by right - wing elements in the US .
In a barely reported comment last month Senator Daschle told a CNN interviewer , almost in passing , that he believes the most likely suspect in the attacks was someone related to the US military .
But neither Daschle , Leahy , nor any other Democratic Party spokesman has sought to make an issue of this attempted political murder .
Anyone who thinks it is preposterous that elements within the state apparatus and the backers of the Bush administration could actively be involved in an assassination attempt or could have condoned such an act should consider recent history in the United States .
From the series of shutdowns of the federal government in 1995 - 96 , to the impeachment drive against Clinton and the theft of the 2000 election , the Republican Party has shown it no longer plays by the traditional rules of bourgeois democracy .
After being thwarted by popular opposition during the 1990s , the right has concluded it can only achieve its agenda through extra-parliamentary and illegal methods .
That these forces will resort to violence was demonstrated during the 2000 election when a Republican mob attacked officials recounting votes in south Florida .
At the time the Wall Street Journal urged Bush to use an " iron fist " against his opponents .
In the face of such attacks the Democrats have proven their unwillingness and incapacity to wage a genuine struggle against these fascistic forces .
They respond with cowardice even as leaders of their party are targeted for assassination .
At the same time the Democrats have concealed from the American people the extent of the danger posed by the ultra - right .

Government By Anthrax by Richard J. Ochs ( revised June 9 , 2002 )
Cabal - a number of persons secretly united to bring about an overturn or usurpation , esp. in public affairs ( Websters ) .
CONSIDER THESE " COINCIDENCES "
· The anthrax attacks were concurrent with the debate of Bush 's Patriot Act by Congress and the media .
· The Senators who received anthrax letters were trying to amend the Patriot Act to protect civil liberties and the innocent .
· Two Senate democratic leaders received anthrax letters mailed the same day that Senator Feingold blocked an attempt to rush the bill through without discussion or amendments .
· Senator Leahy received an anthrax threat after he expressed reservations about the Bill .
As Chairman of the Judiciary Committee , he managed the debate on the Bill .
· Senate Majority Leader Daschle received the first Senate anthrax letter as he led the opposition to the original version of the Bill .
· After receiving the anthrax letter , Daschle switched from supporting a 2 year limit on the Bill , later defending a 4 - year sunset clause as the " appropriate balance . "
· No Republican received an anthrax letter .
· The House and Senate buildings were closed and not reopened until after the Patriot Act was passed .
· The Supreme Court was shut down with an anthrax scare the day after the constitutionally - challenged Patriot Act was signed by President Bush .
· All the contaminated letters contained the Ames strain of anthrax , the DNA of which is traced to the original batch preserved in a university lab in Ames , Iowa .
This strain was " weaponized " in Utah into a potent powder with an elaborate secret technique developed at Fort Detrick , Md .

Who had a motive ?
Who had a grudge against The Enquirer and The New York Post ?
Who had a grudge against Brokaw ?
Who wanted to frighten or manipulate Congress ?
First to get it to adjourn indefinitely , leaving Bush with the power of the purse .
Second to get the Patriot Act Passed in all its fascist glory , without even being read .
Who ?
It 's as plain as the nose on your face .
Why is the major media pussyfooting around it ?
Are they still terrified ?
The anthrax attacks were almost certainly an attempted Operation Northwoods / Media Attack / Political Coup and its targets , as group , would only have been chosen by George Bush .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Saying he sees signs the White House is open to changing course in Iraq , a leading House Democrat on Wednesday proposed starting a U.S. troop pullout without a hard deadline for completion that many Republicans oppose .
Rep. John Murtha , a moderate Pennsylvania Democrat and longtime critic of the war , said he would propose that in an amendment to a defense spending bill for the fiscal year starting October 1 , expected on the House floor next week .
The bill providing $ 459.6 billion for defense was approved by the House Appropriations Committee on Wednesday .
Murtha said some Republicans on Capitol Hill , backed by the White House , have advocated reducing U.S. troops in Iraq to 70,000 from the current level of nearly 160,000 .
While he opposes leaving any U.S. troops behind , Murtha said he ’ll bring an amendment to the House floor next week that requires the White House to start redeployment within 60 days of enactment , without setting a deadline for completion .
“ I ’m hearing signals .
They ( Republicans ) are trying to work out a deal where we leave 70,000 troops over there ...
That ’s the White House telling them to do that , I ’m convinced , ” he told reporters .
“ I ’m hoping there will be an agreement between Democrats and Republicans and the Senate and the House and the White House and I think you ’ll see that happen .
I think you ’ll see that happen by September , October , ” he said .
The House of Representatives has voted three times this year for timetables to end U.S. involvement in the Iraq war , but similar provisions have stalled in the more closely divided Senate amid strong resistance from the White House .
Murtha said pressure from liberal Democrats in the House could still force a pullout deadline to be added to his proposal .
“ I know they get so much pressure from the public .
The public wants us the hell out of there , ” he said .
But he hoped to get Republicans on side who do n’t want to telegraph the final U.S. departure date to enemies attacking U.S. troops in Iraq .
His amendment also would require the Bush administration to draft a “ regional stability plan for the Middle East ” including a description of projected U.S. military presence in the area for the next five years .
Murtha said next week he would also propose an amendment to close the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba within 180 days and another to require that U.S. troops sent to Iraq be fully trained and equipped .
“ ( Secretary of Defense Robert ) Gates wants it closed , the president wants it closed , and we want it closed , ” he said of Guantanamo .
“ We think that will pass . ”
Los Angeles , CA - The MPAA is lobbying congress to push through a new bill that would make unauthorized home theaters illegal .
The group feels that all theaters should be sanctioned , whether they be commercial settings or at home .
MPAA head Dan Glickman says this needs to be regulated before things start getting too far out of control , " We did n't act early enough with the online sharing of our copyrighted content .
This time we 're not making the same mistake .
We have a right to know what 's showing in a theater . "
The bill would require that any hardware manufactured in the future contain technology that tells the MPAA directly of what is being shown and specific details on the audience .
The data would be gathered using various motion sensors and biometric technology .
The MPAA defines a home theater as any home with a television larger than 29 " with stereo sound and at least two comfortable chairs , couch , or futon .
Anyone with a home theater would need to pay a $ 50 registration fee with the MPAA or face fines up to $ 500,000 per movie shown .

" Ideally we expect each viewer to have their own copy of the DVD , but we realize that is n't always feasible .
The registration fee is a fair compromise .
The bill also stipulates that any existing home theaters be retrofitted with the technology or else the owner is responsible for directly informing the MPAA and receiving approval before each viewing .

A right - wing law firm with very deep pockets are working with GOP reps to steal the election by destroying California 's winner - take - all system of electoral votes -- they would instead be divided per results in each congressional district .
This gives the GOP presidential ticket at least 20 electoral votes ( because of safe GOP districts ) that it would n't get UNDER ANY RULES IN ANY OTHER LARGE STATE .
The major swing states would be mandatory for us to win to have a chance .
And lest you think this is all for the good of the people in CA to be represented equally - - it 's not .
It 's about the GOP winning .
Period .
Notice that TEXAS , with a GOP governor and GOP legislature , shuns the idea of dividing their votes that might go to the Democratic ticket .
No , it 's only OK for the people of California .
Here is the problem .
I Googled this to try to find some organization or some effort to STOP this , and all I found were complaints about it .
I did n't find anything organizing to stop it .
Folks , if we are going to beat this , we need to start NOW !
I know , it sucks .
Dems have to work to get their candidates elected , guard the election from vote - tampering , and now , stop shady initatives .
But that is our lot in life .
If anyone can tell me of a link to website or group dedicated to stopping this , please let me know .
What can we do now ?
Bartimaues Blue had some good ideas from his diary :
Obviously the first effort has to be put into getting the word out about this GOP stealth plot .
The more Californians become aware of this initiative and the shadowy purposes behind it , the less likely they may be to accept it .
We can begin raising money , and pulling back the curtain n this stealth campaign to steal the 2008 election ; and we can start a grass - roots campaign to defeat the the initiative .
We can also lodge an initiative of our own that , if passed , would limit the effect of the new initiative to a futire time when enough other states have taken similar steps .
That is , we can , through our own initiative , write in a savings clause that will prevent Initiative 07-0032 from having the manifestly unfair effect that its proponents hope .
Any takers want to help put this together ?

Parents who feed young children low - calorie foods and beverages in a bid to keep them at a healthy weight may inadvertently contribute to overeating and even childhood obesity , new research suggests .
In studies of laboratory rats , researchers at the University of Alberta found that young rodents could be trained to connect the taste of food with their caloric value .
When food flavours were associated with low - caloric energy – as with diet foods and drinks – the rodents would chow down on far more food at regular meals than their bodies required .
Calorie - wise foods that taste the same as their full - calorie counterparts may undermine the body 's natural ability to regulate food intake and weight , said David Pierce , a professor of sociology and lead author of the study .
He speculated that a similar mechanism could lead young children who consume diet foods and drinks to also end up overeating and gaining excess weight over time .
" I think the data showed that if you subvert the usual relationship between taste and calorie content , it leads to disruption of the normal physiological and behavioural energy balance in juveniles , resulting in an overeating effect , " Pierce said Tuesday from Edmonton .
" Based on what we 've learned , it is better for children to eat healthy , well - balanced diets with sufficient calories for their daily activities , rather than low - calorie snacks or meals , " he said .
For one of the studies in their research paper , published Wednesday in the journal Obesity , four - week - old lab rats were conditioned over 16 days to associate certain sweet or salty flavours with low - calorie food .
Following that conditioning , the rodents were fed a high - calorie rice cake snack dipped in a flavour they 'd come to associate with low - energy foods .
And even though the rice cake should have helped satiate their need for energy - producing calories , the animals still overate when it came to the regular meal that followed .
In a second study , eight - week - old " adolescent " rats had low - cal foods added to their diet , but those animals did not display the same tendency to overeat .
The researchers believe the older rats did n't eat excessively because they had learned as youngsters to rely on a variety of taste - related cues to correctly assess the energy value of their food .
Dr. Katherine Morrison , a pediatric endocrinologist and childhood obesity expert at McMaster University , called the study intriguing .
" I welcome a study such as this to help us to move further in our understanding of how do we become full and what is it that encourages us to eat , " Morrison said from Hamilton .
" When it comes specifically to sweetened drinks , I think this study raises a question ( about ) just substituting diet pop for ( regular ) pop .
It does n't tell us that we should n't do it .
It raises the question : Is that a good approach ? "
Morrison said she encourages parents when their child comes home ``famished " after school to have healthy foods on hand – such as vegetables , fruits or salad – " that will sort of take the edge off as you move into your evening meal .
" You certainly do n't want to be going with something like chips or chocolate bars or even granola bars , which give a pretty high - calorie punch in short order . "
Dr. Jean - Pierre Chanoine , head of the endocrinology and diabetes clinic at the B.C. Children 's Hospital , said childhood obesity experts often advise that overweight children substitute diet soft drinks for all or most of the regular pop they drink as a way of reducing calories .
But this study suggests that could be a mistake , he said .
" We tell them if you can replace one can of pop with a diet equivalent , you 're going to be doing well , " Chanoine said from Vancouver .
" But maybe we are actually barking up the wrong tree .
Maybe we should not say that . "

Of all the reasons to quit charging people to take the bus , one of the most important ones has to do with how inefficient and expensive it is to shake loonies loose from riders .

Simply put , collecting bus fares costs a lot of money .
There can be no doubt about this , since it takes both machines and people to sell , make and distribute tickets and collect , count and deposit cash .
Granted , fares add up to a major chunk of change for transit operators -- TransLink for instance gets about one - third of its annual budget charging passengers , with the remaining two thirds coming from property taxes and fuel surcharges .
( More on how we could replace this type of inefficient fare collection with larger , more consistent funding streams tomorrow . )
Regardless , just how much money it costs to collect and enforce fares is a matter of great debate , and surprisingly little fact .
No fare estimate
I tried to get the hard numbers in British Columbia by repeatedly contacting the eight largest transit systems in B.C. , as well as the branch of B.C. Transit that supports the smaller transit systems .
TransLink , with a transit - dedicated operating budget of $ 500 million in 2005 , told me it spends an estimated $ 2.4 million each year on producing what are called " fare media " -- things like month and day passes , transfers , vending machine tickets and any of the range of other specialized transit products available to customers ( U - Passes , FareCards , FareSavers , community passes and the like ) .
But that number leaves many other costs associated with fare collection completely out of the picture , including the expensive machines used ; the collecting and counting of money ; commissions to third - party vendors ; lost productivity for bus trips due to having to explain prices and accept payment from riders ; the staff time involved in figuring out when and how to raise fares ; and so on .
And that 's not even considering the costs of enforcement : TransLink has been bombarding riders with advertisements about fare - paid zones on buses and how they consider it illegal to give or sell valid transfers , as well as creating Canada 's first transit police force two years ago , with an annual budget of over $ 12 million .
Funny numbers
TransLink's ' Broken Promises ' David Hendry insists riders in Greater Vancouver have been getting a raw deal ever since TransLink 's inception back in 1999 .
An organizer with Vancouver 's Bus Riders Union , Hendry says overcrowded buses , four consecutive fare increases and a spike in the number of buses so full they can't stop to take on passengers have all rankled mass transit advocates in the Lower Mainland .
He also says TransLink has yet to live up to the original promises it made when it took over the helm for the region .
" Basically what they had said was that they would have 1,600 buses on the road by 2005 , " says Hendry , who points out that not a single new bus was added to the system between 2000 and 2006 .
Until the fall of last year , when 100 new buses were added , the number of trolley and articulated buses was the same as in 2001 , which was 1,190 .
During that time , ridership soared from 129 to 165 million trips .
To placate riders , Hendry says TransLink has been playing a game of sleight of hand when announcing new additions to their fleet .
Instead of treating big and little buses like apples and oranges , TransLink has been replacing " conventional " buses ( meaning trolleys and the accordion - like articulated buses ) with smaller vehicles for service to the outlying suburbs .
The latter are known as community shuttles .
" The shuttle buses are a lot less expensive , " says Hendry .
" They carry probably about half the people , or even less . "
Although some argue shuttles make good sense in less densely populated areas , they certainly do n't help rising pressures along the main arteries in the city .
Hendry cites one survey that counted 19,000 pass-ups -- or people who watched fully loaded buses zip by without stopping -- in 2006 .
He figures that number is way less than the actual number of people who had to wait for the next bus due to overcrowding .
With four consecutive fare increases , Hendry says riders are getting the short end of the stick from what is supposed to be a public service .
" We paid our share , " he says , " They 're the ones who should be paying us .
They have n't actually followed through on their promises . "
Hendry and other Union volunteers do weekly ride - along surveys of hundreds of transit passengers .
He says many are getting fed up .
" They do n't have to read reports or anything , they know from their pocketbooks and from riding the bus all the time that it 's getting more overcrowded , there are more pass-ups and yet they 're being asked for more money . " -- Bryan Zandberg
In a similar fashion , Barry Miller , a spokesperson for B.C. Transit in Victoria , said that his organization estimates their fare collection costs at less than two per cent of the revenue collected .
That estimate did not include the cost of prepaid media or the capital cost of the fare boxes , or even the costs of debating and deciding fare changes .
Steve New , senior vice president for the Municipal Systems Program of B.C. Transit , gave another low estimate .
His organization provides support to the 24 smaller systems around the province , and in an interview with The Tyee , New stated that the annual cost of fare collection is " not material " in the discussion on free fares in the transit systems under his watch , like the ones in Nanaimo and Kamloops .
When pressed , he offered the following guess : " Fare collection costs are not publicly reported .
I 'd estimate these costs at less than two per cent of the revenue collected . "
None of the other transit system operators I e-mailed could even provide an estimate of any of their fare collection costs .
Can you imagine a business , a co-op , or any type of organization choosing a method of collecting money for its services without knowing what it costs to do so ?
The BC lowball
Looking south shows there 's reason to question the low figures transit bigwigs put forward in B.C .
King County 's Metro Transit System , which includes the city of Seattle and an estimated population of just under two million , conducted a comprehensive assessment of the cost of collecting fares in 1999 .
Chuck Sawyer , supervisor of Metro's Research and Information Section , said when it comes to tallying up just how much it costs to charge riders , their numbers are much higher -- about $ 6 million , or 10 per cent of the revenue collected that year .
( That 's the equivalent of 14 new buses . )
While that figure is still an estimate , it better reflects the real costs involved , taking into account expenditures for fare media production , distribution , sales and promotion ; cash collection and counting ; accounting ; and employee discount passes , not to mention the cost of staff time associated with fare analysis and policy .
They estimate that in 2006 , the costs of fare collection are still 10 per cent of the revenue collected , now about $ 8 million or 18 new buses per year .
Big Apple bite
As noted earlier , TransLink estimates its costs of fare media production to be $ 2.4 million each year ( about six new buses ) .
In an interview with The Tyee , Glen Leicester , TransLink 's vice president of planning , said the other costs identified by King County above were not included because it's not possible to directly link the staff and overhead costs associated with the various processes .
A major analysis of U.S. public transit systems found that for larger systems , fare collection costs can be as high as 22 per cent of the revenue collected .
Another study showed that New York City 's Metropolitan Transportation Authority spends roughly $ 200 million a year just to collect money from transit riders .
Tyee Interview Listen to audio : Kathryn Gretsinger interviews Dave Olsen about the reasons for making transit free .
Them 's the brakes
If you think newer , more efficient technology is the cure , bear in mind that TransLink 's effort to stock each of its buses with new electronic fare - boxes cost $ 21,500 apiece , to the tune of $ 27 million to outfit the entire fleet .
Just this one - time cost alone added up to 50 per cent of the cash collected by these fare boxes in 2006 -- the equivalent of 58 new buses .
Every replacement bus since 2001 has had to have a fare box installed as well .
With those expensive new boxes came new headaches too .
Take the U - Pass fiasco , for example .
For students at the University of British Columbia and at Simon Fraser , the annual discounted student passes include a mandatory fee tacked on to tuition .
But during that program 's first year , 13,000 faulty and damaged U - Passes were delivered to students , highlighting the kinds of kinks that often accompany adopting new technology .
When their new machines could n't read the cards , some operators attempted to confiscate passes , which registered as invalid .
Others prevented students from boarding , even though it was a fare - box error .
A student on the SkyTrain was fined for using a faded pass despite the fact that TransLink was well aware that the printing on some U - Pass passes wears within a few months of use , to the point that the student 's name and photograph are no longer legible .
Although counterfeit U - Passes do exist , it still strikes as odd that in an age of global warming , riders are presumed guilty and required to prove themselves innocent for trying to take the bus .
How would you choose to travel after being prevented from making your class , meeting , or work shift on time or at all ?
Fare box 2.0
Despite the costs of the current fare boxes , Leicester said TransLink is already planning to replace them with so - called smart card technology , although he did n't know how much this would cost .
Metro Transit in Seattle has been converting to smart card technology since 2003 and expects to finally launch its new collection system in 2008 .
Sawyer said staff time for this project has been significant .
In Toronto , the city 's Transit Commission is also considering smart cards , although expected costs of that switch -- $ 260 million for card readers , vending machines and retrofits and $ 11 million a year after that -- have some transit authorities there saying the money could be better used in improving service .
' Not enough buses '
Meanwhile , TransLink continues to promise to add more full - size buses to their system in Greater Vancouver .
Similar promises were made the previous three times TransLink raised fares since June of 2000 .
But recent correspondence from TransLink shows that at the end of 2006 , it had 1,190 full - size and articulated ( extended ) buses -- also known as conventional buses -- the same number it had in 2001 , when the first promise of more buses was made .
In fact , TransLink does n't even seem to know what it is promising .
The company ran an ad in the May 24 , 2007 , edition of the Georgia Strait announcing 203 new buses in 2008 .
The finer print , however , stated 94 were new and 109 would be replacements .
Another press release said there will only be 90 new buses .
Whatever the number , if it actually happens this time , it will be the largest bus expansion in 31 years .
Transit advocates say it 's high time .
According to one news report , one - third of bus routes on the Lower Mainland were identified as overcrowded in 2005 .
Ridership has grown from 129 million in 2000 to a projected 164 million in 2006 .
Jim Houlihan , a spokesman for the union representing bus drivers , has stated there just are n't enough buses on the road , a source of stress for drivers because bus service has not kept up with increased ridership .
" We are 300 to 400 buses short , ridership is through the roof and [ there are ] zero spares in our system , and [ there are ] not enough buses on the way , " he told the CBC .
Invisible turnstiles
In 1996 , the Maryland Mass Transit Administration ( MTA ) wanted to figure out how to stop transit riders from cheating .
Its Central Light Rail Line was " barrier free " and operated in a way similar to the SkyTrain in Vancouver .
MTA wanted to know whether it should start using barriers in order to force people to pay their fares .
The study found that any type of barrier system would create significant new costs and numerous operational difficulties .
More people would pay , yes , but the cost of making them pay would be higher than the revenue from extra fares collected .
Their analysis showed that the least expensive alternative would cost the MTA $ 18.54 for each potential fare dollar recovered over a 10 - year period .
In other words , if $ 1 million is currently lost to fare evasion , it would cost at least $ 18.5 million to collect that money .
Pays not to pay
All of which brings us back to the logic of fare - free transit .
Whidbey Island 's transit planners came to a similar conclusion when they did their own studies two decades ago .
During the year prior to the commencement of Island Transit 's service in 1987 , they did an extensive cost - benefit analysis of collecting fares and found that either no significant revenue would be generated for Island Transit , or that the costs of collecting fares would exceed the revenue generated .
Skagit Transit in Washington State recently calculated that it takes in $ 121,300 from fares but spends $ 133,385 to collect them .
The irony here is that the system started out fare - free and changed to a user - pay system because taxpayers did not want people to have a " free ride . "
Now it costs taxpayers more than when it was fare - free .
In 1994 , a report by the Washington State Department of Transportation came to the following conclusion :
" The cost of adopting a fare - free policy is minimal .
Half of the transit systems in Washington return less than a 10 per cent fare box recovery rate .
Our analysis demonstrates that once the costs of collecting fares are deducted ( usually from 2 per cent to 7 per cent of operating costs ) little , if any , net revenue is generated .
We conclude that fare - free policy does make a difference and that smaller communities especially are better served by a fare - free transit policy . "
All of the 24 transit systems supported by B.C. Transit 's Municipal Systems Program are smaller or of a similar size to Island Transit 's fare - free system 's service population , and so it stands to reason they too could benefit from doing away with fares .
A TransLink tally
Back in 2001 , when TransLink removed all of the old fare - boxes from our buses , if instead of installing the current ones , they simply converted our system to a fare - free system , we would have saved ( em > at minimum $ 240 million ( and counting ) .
How ?
Let 's add it up :
$ 27 million in fare boxes during 2001 and about $ 3 million more since ;
at least $ 30 million per year in reduced costs from not collecting fares ( and possibly as much as $ 60 million per year -- we 'll never know because they do n't know ) ;
$ 25 million in Transit Police costs the past two years ( while they arguably protect passengers and drivers , it is the only force of its kind in Canada ) ;
many millions spent on various ad campaigns , increased policing , information pamphlets , and installing secured transfer receptacles to try to stop people from giving away or selling transfers ; and
millions more creating the new fare - paid zones on buses .
At roughly half a million dollars per new bus ( regular diesel buses cost $ 465,000 ) , TransLink could now be celebrating the fulfilment of their original promise of a fleet of 1,600 buses , made back in 2000 .
( None of this , by the way , includes the huge costs involved in converting to smart card technology , as is being considered in Toronto .
Making the switch , which many experts say is an inevitable move to improve efficiency , could easily add hundreds of millions more to the total spent gathering change from riders . )
Instead , TransLink recently forced a fourth fare increase upon us for a service that is overcrowded and literally breaking down .
But what about the money that would n't have been collected if TransLink had had the foresight and fortitude to go ' fare - fare ' like the dozens of Hasselt and Island Transit inspired systems have done around the world ?
That is a question best answered tomorrow , in the final part of this five - part series .

Hundreds of people braved goosepimples and frostbite when they posed naked on Switzerland 's shrinking Aletsch glacier for U.S. photographer Spencer Tunick .
The photoshoot is part of a Greenpeace campaign to raise awareness of global warming .
Tunick , perched on a ladder and using a megaphone , directed nearly 600 volunteers from all over Europe and photographed them on a rocky outcrop overlooking the glacier , which is the largest in the Alps .
Scroll down for more ...
Later he took pictures of them standing in groups on the mass of ice and lying down .
Camera crews were staged at five different points on the glacier to take photographs .
Glaciers are sensitive to climate change and have been receding since the start of the industrial age but the pace of shrinkage has accelerated in recent years .
The environmental group Greenpeace , which organised the shoot , said the aim was to " establish a symbolic relationship between the vulnerability of the melting glacier and the human body . "
Scroll down for more ...
The Aletsch descends around the south side of the Jungfrau mountain in the Upper Rhone Valley .
Alpine glaciers have lost about one - third of their length and half their volume over the past 150 years .
The Aletsch ice mass has retreated by 115 metres in the last two years alone , said Greenpeace .
Tunick has staged mass nude photo shoots in cities across the world , from Newcastle , Britain , to Mexico City , where a record 18,000 people took off their clothes in the Mexican capital 's Zocalo square in May .

Speaking to Geneva 's Le Temps newspaper in an interview published before the shoot on Saturday , Tunick said his photographs were both works of art and political statements .
" I will try to treat the body on two levels .
On an abstract level , as if they were flowers or stones .
And on a more social level , to represent their vulnerability and humanity with regard to nature and the city and to remind people where we come from . "
Switzerland has about 1,800 glaciers and almost all of them are shrinking rapidly .

THE CRISIS IN subprime mortgages betrays a deeper predicament facing consumer capitalism triumphant :
The “ Protestant ethos ” of hard work and deferred gratification has been replaced by an infantilist ethos of easy credit and impulsive consumption that puts democracy and the market system at risk .
Capitalism ’s core virtue is that it marries altruism and self - interest .
In producing goods and services that answer real consumer needs , it secures a profit for producers .
Doing good for others turns out to entail doing well for yourself .
Capitalism ’s success , however , has meant that core wants in the developed world are now mostly met and that too many goods are now chasing too few needs .
Yet capitalism requires us to “ need ” all that it produces in order to survive .
So it busies itself manufacturing needs for the wealthy while ignoring the wants of the truly needy .
Global inequality means that while the wealthy have too few needs , the needy have too little wealth .
Capitalism is stymied , courting long - term disaster .
We still work hard , but only so that we can pay and play .
In order to turn reluctant consumers with few unsatisfied core needs into permanent shoppers , producers must dumb down consumers , shape their wants , take over their life worlds , encourage impulse buying , cultivate shopoholism and invent new needs .
At the same time , they empower kids as shoppers by legitimizing their unformed tastes and mercurial wants and detaching them from their gatekeeper mothers and fathers and teachers and pastors .
The kids include toddlers who recognize brand logos before they can talk and commodity - minded baby Einsteins who learn to shop before they can walk .
Advertisement
Consumerism needs this infantilist ethos because it favors laxity and leisure over discipline and denial , values childish impetuosity and juvenile narcissism over adult order and enlightened self - interest , and prefers consumption - directed play to spontaneous recreation .
The ethos feeds a private - market logic ( “ What I want is what society needs ! ” ) and combats the public logic fashioned by democracy ( “ What society needs is what I want to want ! ” ) .
This is capitalism ’s all - too - logical way of solving the problem of too many goods chasing too few needs .
It makes consuming ubiquitous and omnipresent , turning shopping into an addiction facilitated by easy credit .
Compare any traditional town square with a modern suburban mall .
In the square , you ’ll find a school , town hall , library , general store , park , movie house , church , art gallery and homes -- a true neighborhood exhibiting our human diversity as beings who do more than simply consume .
But our new town malls are all shopping , all the time .
When we see politics permeate every sector of life , we call it totalitarianism .
When religion rules all , we call it theocracy .
But when commerce dominates everything , we call it liberty .
Can we redirect capitalism to its proper end : the satisfaction of real human needs ?
Well , why not ?

The world teems with elemental wants and is peopled by billions who are needy .

To do this , we will require the assistance of democratic institutions and an adult ethos .
Public citizens must be restored to their proper place as masters of their private choices .
To sustain itself , capitalism will once again have to respond to real needs instead of trying to fabricate synthetic ones -- or risk consuming itself .
SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales said on Friday he is putting the building blocks in place for a community - developed Web search service that would rival search engines such as Google or Yahoo .
Wikipedia founder and Chairman of Wikia.com Jimmy Wales speaks during a news conference in Tokyo March 8 , 2007 .
Wales said on Friday he is putting the building blocks in place for a community - developed Web search service that would rival search engines such as Google or Yahoo .

Wales told a conference of software developers in Portland , Oregon , that his commercial start - up , Wikia , has acquired Grub , a pioneering Web crawler that will enable Wikia ’s forthcoming search service to scour the Web to index relevant sites .
“ If we can get good quality search results , I think it will really change the balance of power from the search companies back to the publishers , ” said Wales , chairman of San Mateo , California - based Wikia .
“ I could be wrong about this , but it seems like a likely outcome . ”
Wikia -- which has helped groups set up thousands of Wikipedia - style sites on topics ranging from popular TV shows to specialist health or travel -- plans to develop an “ open source ”
Web search service with the help of volunteers .
Wales founded the anyone - can - edit Wikipedia encyclopedia , a noncommercial project that is one of the Web ’s most popular sites .
He also co-founded the Wikia ad - supported network of self - edited wiki sites .
However , the two organizations have no formal ties .
The new Wikia search service will combine computer - driven algorithms and human - assisted editing when the company launches a public version of the search site toward the end of 2007 , Wales said in a phone interview .
Human editors would help untangle terms with multiple meanings , such as palm , which can refer to location like Palm Beach , or generic topics like trees or handheld computers .
Search results are generated via another open - source software project called Lucerne .
Wales said he is looking at options to enhance Lucerne , but would not detail his plans .
Grub was originally an open source project that was freely available to software makers to enhance as long as they shared any improvements they made .
Wikia has acquired Grub from LookSmart Ltd. , which had halted work on the project .
Wikia plans to open up Grub to other developers to make improvements or to incorporate the crawler into other sites .
Terms of the deal between Wikia ( wikia.com ) and LookSmart ( search.looksmart.com / ) were not disclosed .
However , last week , San Francisco - based LookSmart , which provides banner and search - based online advertising to Web sites , said it had agreed to supply advertising across Wikia ’s network of wiki sites .
Wikia had been using Google ’s advertising service .
“ We have interest from a lot of other commercial players in the search space , ” said Wales .
Grub relies on distributed computing technology to power the crawler .
Computer users who download the software at www.grub.org/ can share computer processing time when they are not using their machines , cutting the cost of Wikia developing its own network of computers to crawl the Web .
Open search is part of Wikia ’s broader push to promote the spread of free content publishing on the Web .
Wales ’ objective is to make explicit the editorial judgments involved in modern Web search systems .
Proprietary search systems such as Google Inc. keep secret key details of how their search systems work to prevent spamming and for competitive reasons .
Ultimately , Wales wants the Wikia search service to be available to other Web sites and smaller publishers who would be able to install a custom version of the service that points
Web site visitors only to links with a specific site .
Target customers might include local newspapers , for example .
He detailed his plans at the O’Reilly Open Source Convention ( OSCON ) in Portland , an annual gathering of open source software developers .
More details can be found at search.wikia.com /.
Wikia has raised $ 14 million in outside financing , including its latest round of $ 10 million from Amazon.com , according to a regulatory filing by the company .

First , a bit of history .
I started using GNU Emacs in 1990 .
The latest version at the time was version 18 .
It had almost no support for menus , the mouse , fonts , colors , dialog boxes , drag & drop , etc .
It was basically a text - only application .
In these respects it was a step back from the editors I had been using in DOS , Windows , Mac , and OS / 2 .
However , Emacs was what people used at school , and I needed to use it for some of my classes , so I learned it .
I found that it was quite powerful , and I learned how to customize it to match my needs better .
One of the things I liked best was automatic indentation .
When you press
Tab it will indent the line correctly based on what you 're typing now and what you had typed earlier in the file .
I want this on every line .
Most of my classmates press Return and then Tab every line .
I 'm too lazy for that , so I changed Return to do the indentation ( for Emacs users among you : ( global - set - key " \r " ' reindent - then - newline - and - indent ) does the trick ) .
So now whenever I typed normally , it would automatically indent each line properly .
A simple change but it made a big difference , and it encouraged me to learn more about Emacs customization .
I was still annoyed by the lack of colors , though .
Colors in particular are quite useful when programming , because they can be used to highlight langauge constructs ( keywords , punctuation , identifiers , expressions , definitions , etc. ) .
It makes programs easier to read , and you can quickly spot errors as you type them because they show up in the wrong color .
My classmates who had never used non-Unix editors had no idea what they were missing , but I did , and I kept looking for a way to have colors in Emacs .
It was 1990 , after all , six years after the introduction of Macintosh .
Why should I be stuck in a black - and - white text - only world with only a single font ?
Ugh !
Well , Emacs 18 had come out in 1986 .
The Mac did n't even have color back then ( but at least it had multiple fonts , which could have served the same purpose ) .
Where was Emacs 19 , I wondered , and would it have the features I wanted ?
As I looked around I found something intriguing : a version of Emacs called Epoch , maintained by someone named Marc Andreesen .
I tried it out and I loved it .
It had colors and fonts and supported multiple windows ( what a concept ! ) .
I finally had a version of Emacs that gave me what I had been looking for .
( Side note : Marc went on to write Mosaic , and then started a company called Netscape . )
Meanwhile , a few people were trying to work on Emacs 19 , but work was apparently going very slowly , and a company named Lucid had been working on their own version of Emacs 19 , called Lucid Emacs 19 .
Lucid 's version progressed much faster than GNU Emacs 19 ( thanks to Lucid 's uber - hacker , Jamie Zawinski ) , and this was the beginning of the big split between Emacs and XEmacs .
Around 1992 or 1993 I switched from Epoch to Lucid Emacs 19 , and it was everything I wanted out of an Emacs system .
When GNU Emacs 19 came out , I tried it , but it was missing so much .
The menubar did n't match the standard Mac / Windows menubar , the scrollbar acted weird , you could n't use multiple fonts , and lots of things in the UI seemed wrong to me .
My impression was that GNU Emacs 19 had a UI designed for long - time Emacs users , and Lucid Emacs 19 was designed for the rest of us ( DOS , Windows , Mac users ) .
I stuck with Lucid Emacs , which later became XEmacs .
( Side note : Jamie went on to a company called Netscape . )
While in school I found plenty of ways to procrastinate , and one of them was learning to customize my environment instead of working on my class project .
I spent some time trying out and customizing window managers ( twm , ctwm , vtwm , mwm , etc. ) , but most of my time I spent learning and customizing XEmacs .
I tried out lots of extension packages and wrote my own customization .
My classmates benefited from my procrastination , as I shared the best of what I had learned with them .
Some of the Emacs customizations I developed back then are still in use .
Over the years I 've continued to do learn , extend , and customize , and I 've built up more and more XEmacs customization .
A few years ago I tried running GNU Emacs , and my customization did n't work , and it did n't look easy to fix .
XEmacs and GNU Emacs have diverged enough that the things I 've learned for XEmacs were n't working in GNU Emacs .
So I gave up on ever using GNU Emacs again .
The problem is that XEmacs development has slowed quite a bit .
The “ stable ” version , XEmacs 21.4 , came out in 2001 .
Features like anti-aliased fonts , support for the Mac , and UTF - 8 are not available in that version .
I 've been using the development version , 21.5 , and it has partial support for those things .
One of the developers left XEmacs to work on his own version of Emacs , called SXEmacs ( which looks neat ) .
GNU Emacs on the other hand seems to be progressing faster , and is catching up in many ways to XEmacs .
The stable version of GNU Emacs is also a few years old , so people who care about features run the development version ( GNU Emacs 22 ) .
The other problem is that last year , when I got a Mac , I found that none of the versions of XEmacs available on the Mac were satisfying .
I tried out Aquamacs , which is GNU Emacs 22 for the Mac , and I liked it , except that none of my customizations worked .
Non-Emacs editors like TextMate seem somewhat limited , and would require me to unlearn 15 years of Emacs .
I had a tough choice to make : after 15 years of being on the XEmacs side of the Emacs / XEmacs split , should I switch back ?
After talking to several people about their experiences with both , I decided that I should at least consider it .
GNU Emacs 22 seems like it has caught up with XEmacs in some ways ( not all ) , and it 's ahead of it in other ways .
I still love XEmacs .
I like that it uses a package system , so you can choose packages , install new ones , and upgrade a package without upgrading XEmacs .
The package system in XEmacs is somewhat like packages in popular Linux distributions .
For example , I can download a new version of the Python editing package when that package is released , instead of installing it manually or waiting until a new version of Emacs is available .
GNU Emacs does n't seem to have anything like this .
I like the XEmacs philosophy for colors / fonts ( they are properties of how you look at a file ) more than the GNU Emacs philosophy ( that they are properties of the file itself ) .
I like that XEmacs has abstract data types like hash tables .
I like that XEmacs uses more readable names of key and mouse commands , like [ ( ctrl x ) ( alt tab ) ] instead of " C-x A - \t " .
I like that the XEmacs colorization package , font - lock , was more capable than the Emacs package , hilit19 , although these days GNU Emacs also uses font - lock .
I like that XEmacs had a menu structure more like other apps , although GNU Emacs seems to have adopted this too .
I like that XEmacs can run as a “ server ” , where I can connect to it remotely and access all my open files from multiple machines ( I 've heard that GNU Emacs will get this at some point ) .
I like that default XEmacs packages have historically seemed more advanced than GNU Emacs versions ( for example , psgml seems much more advanced than html - helper - mode , and vm was more advanced than rmail ) .
I like that XEmacs came with more packages standard .
I like that XEmacs supported proportional fonts and multiple sized fonts in the same document ( GNU Emacs seems to do that now , but it took them ten years ) .
I like the XEmacs experiments ( embedding XEmacs inside other apps , embedding other apps inside XEmacs , GTK support , incremental garbage collector , ability to run as a window manager , embedding images inside documents ) .
I really like XEmacs .
But I want really good Mac support , nice fonts , and UTF - 8 support , so I 'm going to try out GNU Emacs again .
This weekend 's project is to look at GNU Emacs 22 ( the Aquamacs version ) much more closely .
I 'll try porting some of my XEmacs customizations to GNU Emacs .
I 'll look for GNU Emacs packages that do things similar to the XEmacs packages I had been using .
And over the next few months I 'll use both XEmacs ( at work ) and GNU Emacs ( at home ) and see how it goes .

The IOBSD project has released their first public beta of IOBSD .
This storage - focused fork of OpenBSD was created to address the storage shortcomings of the security - focused OpenBSD community .
Founders Marco Peereboom , Darren Reed and Thorsten Glaser have been working in parallel on this project for a few months now .
" Although Open [ BSD ] is a really good platform for firewalls , we feel that Theo et .
al have spent a disproportionate amount of time and effort with stuff like CARP and BLOBs and license wars " , explains Marco .
" Our users have been clamoring for advanced storage features like a journaling filesystem and distributed storage nodes .
Our primary goal for the 1.0 release is to port Linux resierfs to IOBSD .
Beyond that is anyone 's guess , but as always , we 're focused on user requests . "
Interested users are asked to visit the project website and download current snapshots for testing .

U.S. troops have isolated certain quarters in the neighborhood of Dora with concrete slabs , blocking the passage of vehicles .
Residents now vent their fury on U.S. troops , accusing the military of turning their neighborhood into a big prison .
Doura is one of the most violent areas in Baghdad and repeated U.S. military forays have failed to pacify it .
Residents said at least three districts were now completely cut off , leading to shortages of food and vegetables .
Cars are not allowed to enter or leave these areas making it difficult for patients to visit hospitals and shop owners to replenish supplies .
" These measures have caused a lot of problems for us .
We are under fire now from all sides .
Mortars and bombs by rebels and terrorists continue falling over our heads while U.S. troops have turned our areas into a big prison , " said Abu Saif .
Residents have now to walk for long distances to reach bus terminals and it is impossible for ambulances and cars to drive patients in acute conditions to hospitals .
Um Mohammed , a house wife , said conditions in Dora were deteriorating with every passing day .
" We have become almost like detainees in a prison camp .
There is no water and there is no electricity and no fuel to run the standby generators , " she said .
Mohammed Salem blamed the government for Dora�s predicament .
He said even before the Americans besieged certain areas the government had failed to provide residents with food rations , fuel and other public utilities .
Dora is already ringed by fences and walls but it is the first time U.S. troops separate its parts with concrete slabs .
Adnan Ahmed urged Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki and the parliament to order a halt to U.S. building of walls in Dora .
" We have become U.S. prisoners .
Their tanks and Humvees have occupied our streets and their snipers the roofs of our houses , shooting randomly at anyone they find walking in the streets , " he said .
Falah Hassan said U.S. troops � practices have turned most of the population against them .
" Sometimes U.S. soldiers take ordinary people , women and men , who leave their homes for shopping , to their barracks .
They chain them and humiliate them before they are released .
" This government pays no attention to the innocent sons of this nation who are being subjected to inhuman practices , " Hassan said .
Ouch !
YouTube is probably feeling the burn with this one .
Viacom has decided to slap YouTube with a $ 1 billion lawsuit over damages for copyright infringement .
We knew they were n’t getting along so well after Viacom cracked the whip and demanded YouTube remove 100,000 unauthorized video clips .
They mean serious business at this point , and now YouTube and Google will have a battle to fight .
What does this mean for YouTube and Google ?
Well , it could mean a lot of things .
Considering Google paid $ 1.6 Billion for YouTube in the first place ( Viacom is seeking $ 1 Billion ) , they may be rethinking the biggest purchase of 2006 .
Viacom states that YouTube has “ built a lucrative business out of exploiting the devotion of fans to others ’ creative works in order to enrich itself and its corporate parent Google .
” And because Viacom ’s networks tend to cater to the younger tech savvy crowd who turn to the Internet to get their entertainment , YouTube is / was definitely a threat .
Just for the sake of what if ’s – what if Google had n’t acquired YouTube ?
It would most certainly mean that YouTube would have had to shut themselves down .
Google can afford the legal team to fight this , but is it worth it ?
People turn to YouTube most often for copyrighted material , not the silly home - videos that are posted .
I ’m far from a legal expert , but this is probably one of the largest lawsuits of its ’ kind in terms of dollar amount .
Google will definitely be feeling the sting from this one !

Ethics of blocking ads · 2006 - 06 - 27 04:55 by Wladimir Palant
I found one of the better blog posts on the topic of ethical implications of ad blocking today .
Being on the pro-adblock side of the discussion , it does n’t fall for the usual “ I do n’t care how they earn their money ” kind of argument .
So , obviously , there ’s the first & most popular argument , “ I run a website , it costs me money to do so , I need advertising revenue to pay for the website , adblocking robs me of this revenue . “
In other words , people should support bad business models because it ’s more convenient for the businessmen .
And what follows is actually a nice argumentation about how alienating users with ads really is a bad business model and what webmasters and advertisers could do differently .
I tend to agree on all points , surfing the web without ad blocking software is unbearable — and this misery ca n’t be justified with a vague “ social contract ” .
For the sake of fairness I want to quote the other side of the discussion here as well :
Adblock effectively robs these free sites of their revenue .
If Internet Explorer came with a feature such as Adblock , you would effectively wipe out thousands of websites , maybe more .
So the question is : maybe these sites deserve to be wiped out ?

As the author or
KILLER DRUG
, I am obviously interested in what people are saying about my new thriller .
Here are a couple of comments from the very first reviews :
A stand - out thriller fueled by real experience .
By Ed Stackler
" For readers who love escapist thrillers as I do , this novel delivers a fluid , fast - paced ride that outdoes virtually all its " financial thriller " competition .
This is remarkable , given that Peter Rost , a native of Sweden , speaks and writes English as a second language .
Most born - and - bred Americans who tried their hand at fiction would n't come close to matching Rost 's dialogue or prose . "
" But what makes the novel truly exceptional is that -- like most great fiction -- it 's rooted in real - life experience .
Like his novel 's protagonist , Peter Rost blew the whistle at a major pharmaceutical company ( actually , at two of them ) .
Without that experience , no author could do what Rost does -- make his own hero 's whistleblowing journey a visceral and emotionally charged journey where the stakes are unimaginably high . "
Killer Drug : An Accelerated Review
By Steve Woodruff
" I generally read my Wall Street Journal at night before bed , after which I 'll pick up a book .
Last night , I actually skipped my Wed. WSJ to get right into the action in Killer Drug .
THAT does not happen often ! "
" I wo n't give the plot away , but in brief , there are shenanigans going in the top echelons of a drug company , and the novel 's protagonist , Alex McGraw , ends up finding out the shady stuff and blows the whistle .
People start disappearing .
Human chess pieces move and counter - move , and some end up out of play .
Oh , and one lady gets painted blue . "
" In many ways , it was a pretty decent read - some good thriller action , a few gory sequences , ruthless characters getting payback in kind , etc .
For a first novel , not bad . "
" Beside seeing the good guys victorious in the end , and some bad dudes go down hard , you do get a bit of an education on some of the legal aspects of whistleblowing .
The main protagonist and his lawyer / fiancee do get into discussions that spotlight how that area of the law works .
Just in case you need it in the future ... "
" All in all - a nice summer time - killer .
You wo n't get college credit for this , but one thing you 'll take away is this - if someone offers you anything with " Convulsor " as an ingredient , probably you should opt to take a pass ! "
Peter Rost , M.D. is a former VP of Pfizer and the author of Killer Drug and The Whistleblower .

N.M. Voters Divided Over Spaceport Tax
A referendum in New Mexico yesterday on whether to raise a local sales tax to help pay for construction of the world ’s first commercial spaceport remained undecided today , and wo n’t be passed or defeated until about 550 provisional ballots are counted later in the week .
Dona Ana County election bureau supervisor Lynn J. Ellins said those in favor of the tax increase were leading by 204 votes .
He said 17,000 votes were cast and the final tally of outstanding ballots will begin tomorrow .
The county has 67,000 active , registered voters .
The unusual Spaceport America referendum– believed to be the first of its kind in the nation — would raise about $ 49 million toward the $ 200 million cost of building the facility .
Richard Branson ’s space tourism company , Virgin Galactic , has agreed to sign a long - term lease for the spaceport if the referendum passes .
Step right up , boys and girls !
For a mere quarter of a percent of the cost of everything you buy , you can send eccentric rich people into space !
Do n’t get me wrong , I ’m a huge fan of space tourism .
I intend to make it off this rock before I die .
Heck , I ’d even donate some money to a cause like this , as it makes it that much more possible that it will occur within my lifetime .
But I wo n’t ever — EVER — advocate taking your money by force to do it .
I ’m not a big fan of class warfare , but honestly , should people in Las Cruces on Social Security REALLY be footing the bill over this ?
These are the impressions by Bob Schacht as reported at pd-hawaii.com about Rep.
Abercrombie ’s views on impeachment during the April 7th meeting hosted by Americans for Democratic Action ( Hawaii ) and Progressive Democrats of Hawaii in which the parents of Ehren Watada attended .
Abercrombie said that he would vote for a motion to impeach , if it came to the floor .
However , he did n’t think that it would happen .
He also thought there were n’t enough votes in the Senate to find Bush guilty .
He thought that there were more important things to do , and worried about the House getting tied up in knots debating impeachment .
At one point , he defended the Democratic congress , pointing out how much had been accomplished in only 3 months , and that aggressive investigations were under way against the President ’s misdeeds .
Not all the questions were about impeachment , but that was the main focus .
After the Q & A had gone on for an hour , I was getting signals from Amy that we had 5 minutes more , but the questions were still coming fast and furious passionate , so when I tried to wrap things up , Rep.
Abercrombie brushed aside the concern over time , and continued to respond to questions for another 20 minutes or so , and then stayed afterwards for about 15 minutes talking to individuals , including the Watadas , before leaving .
This meeting will not be the last word , but hopefully the beginning of an ongoing dialogue with Rep. Abercrombie .
We are grateful for his attention , and for being so generous with his time !
If you were there , please add your own comments on the meeting !

Introduction
Back in February we reported that Intel 's Douglas Carmean , new Chief Architect of their Visual Computing Group ( VCG ) in charge of GPU development at Intel , had been touring universities giving a presentation called " Future CPU Architectures -- The Shift from Traditional Models " .
Since then he 's added a few more major university stops , and now the feared B3D ninjas have caught up with him .
Our shadow warriors have scored a copy of Carmean 's presentation , and we 've selected the juicy bits for your enjoyment and edification regarding the showdown that Intel sees as already underway between CPU and GPU makers .
Without further ado .
. . .
After a fairly standard review of CPU development over the last thirty years , a serpent is detected in the CPU boys ' garden of eden , threatening their supremacy .
" CPU profit margins are decreasing .
GPU margins are increasing . "
As the old saying goes , " Follow the money ! " and you 'll rarely be lead astray .
But where has this serpent come from ?
Ah ha , NVIDIA and ATI are revealed as the wannabe usurpers , and the GPU programability trends that began with 2001 's NV20 DX8 capabilities have now grown to be enough of a threat to gain even the attention of mighty Intel .
Given that Carmean first began giving the original form of this presentation in 2005 , one might wonder how large a part the rationale displayed here played in AMD 's acquistion of ATI which was first proposed in December of that year .
One of the largest studies into the short - term health effects of mobile phone technology has found that reported symptoms such as anxiety , tension and tiredness are not caused by the typical emissions from phone masts ( cell phone towers ) .
A team of independent scientists at the University of Essex tested 44 people who had previously reported symptoms or sensitivity to mobile phone technology , and 114 people who had not reported any health effects ( controls ) , at a specially - designed laboratory .
The three - year study found that physiological measures such as heart rate , blood pressure and skin conductance were not affected by whether the mast was switched on or off , and did not detect any significant effects in either sensitive or control participants between GSM ( conventional ) exposure and no exposure .
When both sensitive and control participants were exposed to a 3G ( UMTS ) signal , neither the physiological measures nor the number of reported symptoms increased .
However , the sensitive group did report increased levels of arousal when exposed to 3G , but further analysis suggested that this was related to the fact that a higher proportion of sensitive people received the UMTS signal during their first 50 - minute testing session .
All other measures did not differ between the 3G and the sham conditions .
All participants were tested in several different sessions .
In open provocation tests , when both participant and experimenter knew whether the signal was on or off , sensitive individuals reported lower levels of well - being and more symptoms when the signal was on .
This confirmed that the laboratory conditions did not prevent them from experiencing typical symptoms in response to mobile phone masts .
However , when tests were carried out under double - blind conditions , where neither experimenter nor participant knew whether the signal was on or off , the number of symptoms reported was not related to whether the mast was on or off .
Two of the 44 sensitive individuals correctly judged whether the mast was on or off in all six tests , compared with five out of 114 control participants .
This proportion is what is expected by chance and was not increased in the sensitive group .
advertisement
The study found that , compared with controls , sensitive individuals reported more symptoms and greater severity of symptoms , as well as higher skin conductance ( which is a good measure of physiological response to environmental stressors ) , regardless of whether the signal was on or off .
Hence , the range of symptoms and physiological response does not appear to be related to the presence of either GSM or 3G signals .
Principal investigator Professor Elaine
Fox explained :
‘ It is clear that sensitive individuals are suffering real symptoms and often have a poor quality of life .
It is now important to determine what other factors could be causing these symptoms , so appropriate research studies and treatment strategies can be developed . ’
The results are consistent with the only other published large - scale study of the effects of short - term exposure to mobile phone masts with sensitive individuals ( published in Environmental Health Perspectives by Regel et al , 2006 ) .
Dr James Rubin , of the Mobile Phones Research Unit at Kings College London , who has reviewed 31 blind and double - blind studies carried out under controlled laboratory conditions , said : ‘ The Essex study is one of the largest and most detailed of these experiments and its findings , that mobile phone signals are not responsible for the symptoms that some people describe , are in line with those from most other previous experiments .
This should be reassuring news for anyone who is concerned about the possible short - term health effects of masts . ’
The multi-disciplinary scientific research team at Essex included cognitive psychologists , electronic and biomedical engineers and a medical doctor .
Testing took place in the Electromagnetics and Health Laboratory at the University ’s Colchester campus .
The exposure system was provided by Red-M , and the accuracy of both the exposure system and the testing environment was confirmed by the National Physical Laboratory .
The study was funded by the Mobile Telecommunications and Health Research ( MTHR ) programme ( http://www.mthr.org.uk).
The results are published online today by the journal Environmental Health Perspectives ( http://www.ehponline.org).
The Essex research team is now undertaking an MTHR - funded study into the short - term health effects of exposure to TETRA mobile radio masts , which are used for the emergency services ’ communications systems .

HE CLICKS his fingers , catches the beat and , with an unselfconscious shimmy , takes the floor .
Swiveling on black patent leather , he locates his lady and , rather sweetly , they bob together , in a rhythmic two - step .
There 's no denying it : General Pervez Musharraf may be no snake - hips , but he 's got some moves .
And he 's got timing .
As the music starts to fade , he inclines his head to Sebha , his wife of almost forty years , and they retire to their chairs .
Once reclined , Pakistan 's military ruler pops a large cigar into his mouth and smiles on the scene — a small wedding - party in Lahore .
As recorded on videotape by a pal of mine , whose tipsy giggles form part of the sound - track , General Musharraf looks relaxed .
He waves at the bridegroom .
He shakes a young admirer by the hand and pats him on the back .
Perhaps only a glass of whisky , the general 's favourite tipple , it is said , is absent from a happy scene .
Alas , General Musharraf cannot drink booze in public .
The video is entertaining but yields no surprises .
In public and in private , General Musharraf is an average sort of man .
He is affable and sensible .
Though not the brightest general in the corps , he can usually spot good advice .
He lacks the charm of his predecessor , General Zia ul - Haq ; but nor is he cruel like Zia .
This is creditable .
But it does not justify General Musharraf 's self - appraisal .
In July he said he must stay on as Pakistan 's president and army chief because he was “ indispensable ” .
Perhaps the general should behave in politics as in disco — and quit before it gets embarrassing .
His country almost certainly does not need him .
It wants to see the back of him .
Even government ministers say so .
Reuters
If he were to retire now to his easy - seat , General Musharraf might be thought of kindly in the years ahead .
When he grabbed power , Pakistan 's reputation was bad even by its standards .
No government had completed its term for a decade .
The economy was a wreck .
The mayhem that followed 9/11 , soon after , made matters worse .
It alerted the world to Pakistan 's deep support for the Taliban — and to many fundamentalist maniacs of its own .
At the time , General Musharraf 's straightforwardness was what was required .
For dropping the Taliban and aligning Pakistan with America , he has been called courageous .
I 'd call it a no - brainer .
In his domestic policy , too , General Musharraf has mostly trod a decent middle - line .
He has made the economy his priority .
He has tried to make peace with India .
Most Pakistanis supported his policies on both counts .
But support for General Musharraf 's policies is not quite the same as support for him .
He is probably not charismatic enough to be genuinely popular .
And besides , he is a military ruler .
This means , his good policies came at a cost , to Pakistan 's democratic institutions — its courts , Parliament and the electoral commission .
All have been bullied and subverted as the general has grappled for power .
Having experienced military dictators before , Pakistanis are wise to all of this .
They appreciate a clutch of good policies ; but would prefer good institutions .
And ironically , out of the current crisis , one of these , an independent judiciary that upholds the constitution , threatens to emerge .
It is ironic because it is a direct result of General Musharraf 's blundering .
Had he not made such a hash of trying to sack Mr Chaudhry , there would have be no public support for the judges .
And without that support , they would not now be trying to hold General Musharraf to account .
The music is fading .
General Musharraf 's chair is beckoning .
But , being an ordinary man , he may just keep shuffling on .

Thursday
WHEN I think of young Muslims getting radicalised , I think of Omar Sheikh .
He is the Pakistani - Briton waiting to hang in Pakistan for killing Daniel Pearl , an American journalist .
By chance , I had heard of Omar a long time back .
He was a slight friend of a good friend of mine ; they met at the London School of Economics ( LSE ) .
Their backgrounds were not dissimilar : both were the sons of men who had left Lahore to seek their fortune .
And having made it in England , they spent their time harping back to Pakistan .
That was where their religion , and their culture , was — let neither boy forget it .
I remember my friend mentioning Omar at the time .
He quite admired his seriousness , especially about Islam .
But he felt sorry for him , too .
I think he found him slightly unhinged .
And when Omar turned up at the LSE , after a vacation in Bosnia to recruit willing hands for the Jihad there , well , that was enough for my friend .
In the years that followed , I remembered Omar .
After all , he was getting famous : for kidnapping some British tourists in India , for being handed over by India to Pakistan — in Kandahar , via the Taliban !
But when Omar kidnapped Daniel Pearl in 2002 , I had more or less forgotten about him .
It was a slightly awful book , entitled “ Who Killed Daniel Pearl ? ” , by a French writer , Bernard - Henri Lévy , that reminded me .
Mr Lévy reckoned Omar was working for Pakistani's Inter Services Intelligence agency ( ISI ) .
Maybe he was .
But with its absurdly terrifying descriptions of Pakistan , with a fundamentalist killer on every corner , Mr Lévy 's was not a serious book — though it was better than the autobiography of General Pervez Musharraf that came out last year .
The general reckoned Omar was working for MI6 .
When I moved to Pakistan in 2003 I fell in with a crowd who had also known Omar .
A bunch of rich Punjabi swells , a privileged , frivolous lot , I met them through my LSE pal .
But they did n't know Omar from the LSE .
They knew him from Aitchison College .

Omar Sheikh : class warfare
A red -brick public school in the heart of Lahore , “ Pakistan 's Eton ” is how it is sometimes described .
Aitchison 's main sport is tent - pegging : driving a lance through a peg from a galloping horse .
Thus did British officers practice spearing pigs in the days of the Raj .
But it was an unlikely sport , and an unlikely school , for Omar — at this time a 14 - year - old budding arm - wrestling champ from the east end of London .
Then again , Omar 's dad had moved back to Pakistan for a spell and he wanted the best for his son .
The best was Aitchison and he could afford it .
How Omar had got on at the school , however , my swell Punjabis would n't or could n't tell me .
Most had shared a classroom with him , during the three years he spent there .
But none of them had much to say about him .
They clearly considered Omar an embarrassment .
And they had treated him as such — according to the account I heard over dinner in Islamabad last night , from another Aitchison boy of their year .
He knew my rowdy friends , but he was not like them .
A witty Wildean type , he said he was studious at school .
Not much of a tent - pegger , I imagine .
In class , this new acquaintance of mine , let us call him Shah , sat next to Omar Sheikh .
They were friends , of a sort .
Shah thought Omar was basically all right .
Even if he felt sorry for him and for his type .
That is , he felt sorry for the dozen Pakistani - Britons in that year at Aitchison .
They were all sons of working - class Pakistanis who had emigrated to England and done well .
They had been dispatched to Aitchison to be the Pakistani gents that their fathers never were .
But of course , class does n't work that way .
These working - class Pakistani - Brits were despised by the local tent - peggers .
They scorned the interlopers ' self - made fathers .
They sneered at the boys sincere religiosity .
Omar was the king of these losers .
If any tent - peggers dared laugh at Omar , he punched their lights out
The effect was devastating .
The young Brits grouped together under siege .
They were miserable and always bottom of the class .
Reacting to the sneers , they grew beards , and grew even more religious .
Shah said that one later tried to kill himself .
And Omar , he was the king of these losers .
If any tent - peggers dared laugh at Omar , he punched their lights out .
The truth is complicated .
It always is .
But , who knows , maybe this was when Omar got radicalised .

Wednesday
WHEN conversing with a Pushtun , it is interesting to observe how he massages his feet .
Indeed , it is hard not to do so .
Seated cross-legged and bare - footed , the traditional Pushtun loves nothing more than to sip a glass of sweet green tea with one hand and caress the soles of his feet with the other .
It is a gesture designed to convey how entirely at ease with the world he is .
Or , at least , that is its effect — as now , in the lodgings of the honourable Maulana Nek Zamin , member of Pakistan 's national assembly for North Waziristan .
Lining the walls are two dozen turbaned Pushtuns , bearded , impassive and administering the public pedicure that is their inalienable right .
I have called on Mr Zamin for a break from Pakistan 's crisis - ridden national politics .
This is appropriate , because Mr Zamin and his fellow Waziristanis can only loosely be described as Pakistani .
Their semi-autonomous area , part of a tribal region that hugs the border with Afghanistan , is outside the bounds of Pakistan 's regular criminal law .
Political parties may not operate there – which is one reason that the tribes almost invariably elect Islamists , like Mr Zamin , to Parliament .
Another reason is that North Waziristan is the main refuge of the Taliban , those religious students turned holy warriors , who launch attacks into Afghanistan from its mountain remoteness .
America says that al - Qaeda is well - organised among them .
Over the past month , in an effort to soothe his ally 's fears , General Musharraf has redoubled military efforts against these militants , especially in North Waziristan .
More than 60 soldiers and 250 militants are said to have been killed .
Yet Mr Zamin and his friends will hear no talk of violence and hate .
From the moment I enter the room — to a solemn hand - shake from each of its occupants , plus a bearish embrace from the hulking maulana — they seek to make clear that they are a peace - loving lot .
“ There are no Taliban in North Waziristan , ” says Mr Zamin , with a kindly shake of his hennaed beard .
“ But what are these Taliban ?
They are the students of our madrassas — just as you have students at your universities of Oxford and Cambridge . ”
This is not an original gambit .
Across northern Pakistan and southern Afghanistan , the Pushtun territory , bearded men repeat the line with baffled indignation .
And maybe some of them do see no distinction between scholarship and suicide - bombing .
But I doubt it .
Anyway , I am not trying to find out how many Taliban there are in North Waziristan .
I assume Mr Zamin will not tell me , even if he knows .
My questions to him are less controversial .
I ask whether Pakistan should rebuild the peculiar civil administration that British colonialists bequeathed to the tribal areas , and which seems to have dissolved in the current conflict .
In addition , I 'd like to know what parts of Pakistan 's constitution the maulana would introduce to his region .
But I might as well ask whether Osama bin Laden is using his spare room .
“ The issues of North Waziristan , ” the maulana repeats like a mantra , “ can only be solved when the Western troops leave Afghanistan . ”
Fair enough .
I only have one more question .
Can the maulana tell me anything about two corpses , allegedly of American spies , that according to newspaper reports turned up in North Waziristan yesterday ?
Pausing for a moment 's reflection , he shakes his head .
The maulana knows nothing about this .
Around him , his bearded companions shake their heads and fondle their feet .
These corpses were found without heads .
They did not have any arms either .
As I say so , a quietness falls on the maulana 's parliamentary digs .
Each bearded man stares carefully forwards , avoiding his neighbour 's eye .
I complete the report : “ Nor did they have any legs . ”
And the maulana 's men can no longer help themselves .
Bearded smirks and muffled laughter ripple about the room .
The maulana smiles and says : “ There must have been some personal and political differences ! ”
And the laughter continues .
They like a good joke in North Waziristan .

Tuesday
I USED to hate Islamabad , where I lived for a few months in 2003 .
A concrete new city , after a stringent grid design , it was built in the 1960s to exclude anything unseemly , chaotic or poor — which is to say , most of Pakistan .
Islamabad is Abuja , but without the Nigerians , who can never bore .
It is Brussels , but without the old buildings and beer .
There is nothing much here but government and diplomacy .
Islamabad may be the most boring capital in the world .
Yet at least it is easy to get around .
And , living as I do now in smoggy , log - jammed Delhi , I appreciate this fact .
Breezing in along the airport road — past a notorious fibre - glass model of the Chagai hills , where Pakistan tested its nuclear bombs in 1998 — I do not mourn the absence of any rickshaw , bus or truck .
The city is open and approachable , as indeed , for the most part , are the bureaucrats , politicians and diplomats that it contains .
Nonetheless , even several days of engaging conversation here can leave you little the wiser about what is going on .
Very often , your interlocutors do n't know the truth either .
Or else , as with American diplomats alarmingly often , they may think they know , but it turns out that they do n't .
The generals and intelligence chiefs of the Inter Services Intelligence agency ( ISI ) , who tend to rule Pakistan , as currently , do give interviews .
But rarely do they give much away .
That leaves most of the country 's 160 m people playing an extravagant guessing game about what is afoot .
Ample rumour , mystery and smug allusion are a result of this .
Here are a few Pakistani favourites :
Q : Why did the ambulance ferrying Muhammad Ali Jinnah ( the country 's founding father ) to hospital , as he was dying , break down ?
A : The Indians / Americans / ISI fixed the engine .
Q : Why did a plane carrying Zia ul - Haq , a cruel army ruler of the 1970s and 80s , crash ?
A : The Americans / Indians / ISI blew it up .
Q : Who destroyed the World Trade Centre in 2001 ?
A : The Israelis .
Or the CIA .
Or maybe India did this one too , though I have yet to be told as much .
Where conspiracy theorising is a national habit , a certain amount of damn foolish conversation is unavoidable .
By and large , however , Pakistanis are first - rate company .
In particular , they rarely exhibit the prickly nationalism of their Indian cousins , which can be a turn - off for foreign guests .
In its place , I often find , is a rather beautiful kindred sense , transcending frontiers of race and nationality , of wondering what the hell is going on .
Such is the mood at a party thrown by a friend , let us call him Sohail , at which many Pakistani journalists are gathered .
The soirée is held upstairs while Sohail 's brother , a successful arms dealer , gets his accountant drunk downstairs .
The current political crisis , unsurprisingly , is hotly discussed .
Plenty of wine and whisky ensures that , for about ten hours , this conversation never fades .
Naturally , there is no consensus on what is happening in Pakistan .
But in Sohail 's house , and other hideouts of Pakistan 's chattering classes , this seems to be the most common view :
General Musharraf has had it , though his American friends do n't know it .
Benazir Bhutto , by appearing to cosy up to an unpopular military dictator , may have done herself and her party great harm .
Nawaz Sharif , a late runner in this election contest , has profited from her error .
In exile , he has thunderously ruled out co-operating with General Musharraf .
All of a sudden , he is looking good for the election .
Always assuming — though no Pakistani does assume this — that an election is held .

Monday
SOMETHING is eating Aitzaz Ahsan .
He is a new star , a hero of a trampled - upon democracy — the most popular man in Pakistan , some say .
With an election looming , Mr Ahsan , a lawyer and member of the opposition Pakistan People 's Party ( PPP ) , should be pitching for greatness .
So why , sitting in his charmingly chaotic chambers in Lahore , amid stacks of paper smelling faintly of mildew in the monsoon air , does Mr Ahsan look so glum ?
First , some background .
Mr Ahsan acted for Pakistan 's chief justice , Iftikhar Chaudhry , in a legal stand - off with General Pervez Musharraf that may have changed Pakistani history .
In March General Musharraf tried to sack Mr Chaudhry .
It seems he wanted a pliable top judge , which Mr Chaudhry , a vain and stubborn man , was not .
But , in an act of civilian defiance previously unknown in Pakistan , Mr Chaudhry refused to go .
Cheering up slightly , Mr Ahsan proffers , unrequested , a few photographs of the scenes that ensued .
After filing a challenge to his marching orders in the Supreme Court , Mr Chaudhry went on a grand tour .
That is , he accepted invitations to address various of the country 's bar associations .
For this was not — you understand — a political protest .
Nonetheless , Mr Ahsan made sure that Mr Chaudhry visited , on the same day , every bar association to be found along Pakistan 's main roads .
In a twenty - hour crawl from Islamabad to Lahore — ostensibly to address bar associations en route – over 100,000 people turned out to cheer Mr Chaudhry .
Mr Ahsan displays photographs of that day .
The chief justice — or “ CJ ” , as Pakistanis call him — is barely visible behind a wind - screen strewn with pink rose - petals .
A few lawyers , in their funereal uniform of black jacket , black tie and white shirt , dance upon his car 's bonnet .
A throng of thousands presses in from the sides , waving Pakistani flags , PPP flags , the flags of all Pakistan 's put -upon political parties .
Mr Ahsan suffered that day .
He says he lost 8 pounds ( 3.5 kg ) in sweat , after the car 's air - conditioner became choked with petals .
Yet he looks well on it — in a chiselled photo of himself superimposed upon another of the flag - waving throng , using a dreamscape technique popular in Communist regimes and Bollywood .
The photo shows Mr Ahsan microphone in hand , denouncing General Musharraf 's rule .
And indeed , it was he who took the CJ 's battle to the masses .
Mr Chaudhry , his lawyer concedes , is not much of a public speaker .
Mr Ahsan is .
And for this reason alone , no one won richer congratulations than he last month when the CJ was reinstated by his peers .
So why the long face , Mr Ahsan ?
AFP
Mr Chaudhry 's petal - strewn progress
For one , rather like Maximus Decimus Meridius ( Russell Crowe ) in the film Gladiator , Mr Ahsan may have made himself a little too popular for his caesar 's liking .
His caesar is Benazir Bhutto , the PPP 's leader , a former prime minister and the exiled daughter of the party 's martyred former leader , Zulfiqar Ali .
Well , that is the conjecture , widely - believed in Pakistan .
What is certain , however , is that even as Mr Ahsan was denouncing the “ dictatorship ” of General Musharraf , Ms Bhutto was negotiating a power - sharing deal with him .
Here is a glory of Pakistani politics .
Even during two stints at the helm of Pakistan , Ms Bhutto , the leader of Pakistan 's biggest and most liberal party , was willing to co-operate with the generals who man its guns .
Now marooned , a fugitive in Dubai for almost a decade , she has looked ready to compromise again — if General Musharraf would only let her clamber back on - board .
America and Britain , important allies of the general , like the look of this accord .
They want General Musharraf to remain in charge , at a time of Islamist strife in Pakistan .
But they also want him to have more plausibly democratic and liberal support .
That is to say , Ms Bhutto .
And here is another glory .
Ms Bhutto , educated at Harvard and Oxford , sells herself as a die - hard liberal .
And no doubt , in her personal beliefs , she is .
Yet most liberal — which is to say , Westernised — Pakistanis , who mostly vote PPP , nonetheless grimace to hear her name .
There is nothing liberal about Ms Bhutto 's running of her party , which she lords over like the Sindhi feudal leader that she is .
During her eight years of absence from Pakistan , it has fallen into decline .
Yet she has refused to countenance handing power to another leader .
Nor did Ms Bhutto 's performance in power do much to inspire confidence .
Even enemies of General Musharraf — of whom there are now many in Pakistan — tend not to demur when he accuses her of having looted the country .
Yet the problem for many liberal Pakistanis is the other guy — Nawaz Sharif , Pakistan 's other exiled ex-prime - minister .
As leader of the opposition Pakistan Muslim League party ( Nawaz ) , Mr Sharif presided over regimes that were about as corrupt as Ms Bhutto's , and more vindictive .
On his watch , dissidents were locked up and beaten .
At the time that Mr Sharif was removed by General Musharraf in a coup , in 1999 , he was trying to introduce sharia law — of which he was to be the final arbiter .
Now both Ms Bhutto and Mr Sharif are contemplating returning to Pakistan .
And General Musharraf is looking weaker by the day — not least because of the judgements that the CJ has been dishing out .
Last week , for example , he decreed that Mr Sharif was free to return home from exile , though General Musharraf had said he was not .
If Mr Sharif does return — and he says that he will do so within days — Ms Bhutto might quickly follow him .
There might then be no deal between herself and General Musharraf .
Instead , there will be more showers of pink petals and heady talk of democracy restored .
That would be good for Pakistan , most of its inhabitants agree .
But Mr Ahsan will not be alone in his discomfort .
" I do n't believe my role is to replace the verdict of a jury with my own , " - George W. Bush on why he signed death warrants for 152 inmates as governor of Texas .
The quote is from his own book , " A Charge To Keep . "
I think that 's a debate - ender , is n't it ?
We want to hear what you think about this article .
Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com .
Now this is a real shame :
The Maryland Republican Party , reeling from the loss of the governor 's mansion , is nearly broke , according to a copy of its financial statement obtained by The Sun .
The state GOP treasurer 's report from July 31 shows the party had $ 4,615 in cash and $ 50,500 in debt .
Because of lackluster fundraising , the party operated at a $ 103,536 deficit in the first six months of the year .
A report from the party 's accountants shows that funding from major donors has dried up , and that the party 's major annual fundraising event , the Red , White and Blue Dinner , netted $ 15,572 , less than 10 percent of the amount the party had been counting on .
The poor fundraising comes at a time when conservative and moderate wings of the party are fighting over whether the party should take sides in state Sen. Andrew P. Harris ' primary challenge to Rep. Wayne T. Gilchrest , a stark contrast to the unity and strength that the party displayed during former Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. 's term .
PHOTOGRAPHS OF
HIROSHIMA AND NAGASAKI
1. The Huge Atomic Cloud / The Mushroom Cloud Blowing Up
The atomic cloud ( mushroom cloud ) produced just after the burst is one of the most intensive characteristics of the A - bomb explosion .
The Hiroshima Meteorological Observatory reported that just after the flash , black smoke rose from the ground up to the sky reaching an altitude of several thousand meters , and covered the whole city .
When the fireball disappeared , the angry clouds , like grey smoke , rose and reached an altitude of 8,000 meters in 5 minutes after the explosion .
One of the EnolaGay crew recorded in his flight diary , " 9:00 a .m..... Clouds were observed .
Altitude of 12,000 meters or more . "
From a distance the cloud formation looked like a mushroom growing out of the ground , with white cloud at the top and yellowish clouds enveloping reddish - black clouds , creating a color that cannot be described as while , black , red or yellow .
In Nagasaki , from an observation point at the air - raid lookout post on Kouyagi Island located about 8 kilometers south of the city , just after the flash it appeared that a huge fireball covered the city , as if it were suppressing the city from the sky .
Around the fireball there was a doughnut - shaped ring from the midst of which black smoke and flames rose up to the sky in an instant .
The ring of the flames did not initially reach the ground .
When the fireball scattered with a flash , the city was covered with darkness .
The smoke rising from the midst of the ring , glittering in colors of red , white and yellow , reached an altitude of 8,000 meters in only 3 or 4 seconds .
After reaching an altitude of 8,000 meters , the smoke ascended more slowly and took about 30 seconds to reach an altitude of 12,000 meters .
Then , the mass of smoke gradually discolored and scattered in wads of white clouds .
2. Hiroshima Was Burnt To Ashes
The building was the former Hiroshima Prefecture Industrial Promotion Hall ,
Where special products of Hiroshima were exhibited and various gatherings were held until the A - bomb was dropped .
Since it was located just under thehypocenter , blast pressure was vertically exerted on the bulding and only the dome - shaped framework and part of the outer wall remained .
It has come to be called " the A - bomb Dome " , and it has come to symbolize to the people of the world " No More Hiroshimas " .
As years passed , however , the ruin has deteriorated further due to winds and rain .
A civic movement was started calling for permanent preservation of the A - bomb Dome , and money was contributed from all over Japan , not to mention from Hiroshima .
Within a year after the fund - raising campaign was started , the restoration funds had been collected .
In August 1967 , the reinforcing construction was completed .
That is why the present A - bomb Dome gives a different impression from that in the photograph .
The bridge located to the south ( the other side ) of the Dome is Motoyasu Bridge , and the area to the west ( right ) of the bridge is the present Peace Park .
The hill a little right from the center is Ninoshima ( called small Mt. Fuji ) , which is about 9 kilometers from the spot where the photograph was taken .
3. Victimes Who Escaped Hell On Earth
August 6 . 1945 .
This is one of the six photographs recording the disaster of Hiroshima .
A precious photograph taken only three hours or so after the explosion .
Towards the right and beyond is the center of Hiroshima City , and the raging fire is creeping up .
Both ends of this bridge , which was the longest one in Hiroshima at that time , were filled with A - bomb victims .
Many of them were students of the Hiroshima Prefectural Daiichi Middle School and the Hiroshima Girls ' Commercial School who were exposed to and injured by the A - bomb while participating in the demolition of buildings .
Mr. Matsushige , who was a news cameraman then , wrote in the " Hiroshima Tokuho " , issued on August 6 , 1980 , based on his experience , ads follows :
" ... in front of the police box of Senda township located at the west end of Miyuki Bridge , a policeman took off the lid of an oil can and started to give first aid treatment to the people with burns , but the number of the injured increased rapidly .
I thought this must be photographed and held the camera in position .
The scene Isaw through the finder was too cruel .
Among the hundreds of injured persons of whom you cannnot tell the difference between male and female , there were children screaming ' It 's hot , it 's hot ! ' and infants crying over the body of their mother who appeared to be already dead .
I tried to pull myself together by telling myself that I 'm a news cameraman , and it is my duty and privilege to take a photograph , even if it is just one , and even if people take me as a devil or a cold - hearted man .
I finally managed to press the shutter , but when I looked the finder for the second time , the object was blurred by tears . "
Because of the atomic bombing , there were no newspaper reports in hiroshima for August 7th and 8th of 1945 .
The " The Hiroshima Tokuho " ( the phantom newspaper ) was published on August 6 , 1980 , faithfully reflecting the feeling of that time based on the news collected by three reporters and a cameraman who heated toward the hypocenter immediately after the detonation of the A - bomb .
4. 300 - Year - Old Camphor Tree Uprooted By The Blast
In the precincts of the Kokutaiji Temple , the big camphor tree , said to be over 300 years old was designated as a natural monument .
Its branches and thick leaves provided a place of comfort for the passers - by during summertime .
Its roots spread out in all directions for 300 meters , and the street car lines shown on the left in the photograph had to avoid the tree , which formed an archway over the sidewalk .
By a blast pressure of 19 tons per square meter , the tree was uprooted .
Also , hundreds of tombstones were knocked in all directions by the complex flow of wind from the blast .
The white building seen on the extreme right is the Hiroshima branch of the Bank of Japan .
Because it was built of strong ferro - concrete and stonework , the exterior remained uncollapsed but the interior burned .
5. A Building Brought To Knees By The Blast
This was a clock store located in Hiroshima 's central business quarters called the ' Hondori ' , which is still a bustling street .
The upper part was the clock tower which had been telling the time to passers - by , until the explosion .
The first floor shown in the photograph was the second floor .
This two - storied building was of a strusture like a match box with no central pillar , so when it received the blast pressure from the side , the first floor was crushed and the building sank into itself .
Hence , the second floor became the first floor , and the building leaned toward the side away from of the blast .
There were many buildings of ferro - concrete structure in Hiroshima , mostly in the vicinity of the hypocenter .
According to a survey , these durable buildings were only destroyed if they were within 500 meters of the hypocenter .
Buildings of earthquake - proof construction were damaged only on the inside .
However , many buildings situated beyond 500 meters were essentially destroyed too , as in the case of this clock store situated farther than 500 meters .
6. Disaster Near The Hypocenter
Around the Matsuyama - cho intersection which is close to the hypocenter , victimswere burned to death in their last gesture grasping at the air or trying to escape .
Everything that burns was burnt .
Roof tiles were crushed into small pieces and scattered all over , air - raid shelters and street cars were burned and ruined .
All tell the miserable story without words .
In the Record of the Nagasaki A- bomb War Disaster , the situation in Matsuyama township is described as follows :
" A huge fireball formed in the sky .
Directly beneath it is Matsuyama township .
Together with the flash came the heat rays and blast , which instantly destroyed everything on earth , and those in the area fell unconscious and were crushed to death .
Then they were blown up in the air and hurled back to the ground .
The roaring flames burned those caught under the structures who were crying or groaning for help .
When the fire burnt itself out , there appeared a completely changed , vast , colorless world that made you think it was the end of life on earth .
In a heap of ashes lay the debris of the disaster and charred trees , presenting a gruesome scene .
The whole city became extinct .
Citizens who were in Matsuyama township , the hypocenter , were all killed instantly , excepting a child who was in an air - raid shelter . "
7. The Urakami Cathedral Destroyed In An Instant
The cathedral collapsed at the burst of the A - bomb and scores cf believers died , sharing the same fate .
Then , fire broke out .
It is said that the remains of the cathedral continued to further collapse with eerie thuds even after dark .
It is also said that there were 1,400 believers in Urakami at the time of the bombing , and 850 were killed by the A - bomb .
In the ruins of the cathedlal , there were many stone statues of the saints in the heaps of broken bricks and stones .
The photograph shows part of the outer wall of the south entrance where the statues of the Holy Mother and Saint , John lie chat , red by the heat rays .
Also , the shadow in the lower left of the photograph shows that the largest twin tower in the Orient fully received the blast and was shifted 8 centimeters from the foundation stone .
The building .
of this cathedral began in 1985 and it took 30 years to be completed in Urakami , a village then , where the believers have kept their faith since Christianity was introduced to Japan , and even through the years of the Edo period ( 1603 - 1867 ) when Christianity was prohibited .
The building employed the Romanesque style , using stones and bricks .
This cathedral had a floor space of 1,162 sq. meters and tower 26 meters high .
The current LTr.akami Cathedral was built in 1959 .
Part of the destroyed cathedral is preserved at the hypocenter .
8. A Factory Destroyed By The Blast
The steel framework of this factory was broken and bent in a mess as if it were made from a pliable material .
The concrete base supporting the steel frame was shoved by the blast .
This is testament to how frightful the blast pressure was .
It is estimated that this factory was subjected to a wind velocity of 200 meters per second arid a wind pressure of 10 tons per square meter .
Until the Very moment of the explosion , there was an array of machine tools in the factory , and a number of overhead cranes were busily operating .
Most of the workers
Were crushed to death .
On August 9 , it is recorded that 1,721 persons came to work , among whom 1,019 died and 149 were seriously injured .
The rate of casualties was 68 % .
A worker Who miraculously kept his life said : " I was talking about work with my colleague , but in a moment he was killed instantly by a crane which crushed half of his body .
It was a shocking sight and a horrible way to die -- his head was smashed , his belly torn and his bowels ballooned . "
This photograph shows where many such tragedies took place .
9. Shiroyama Primary School Leveled By The Blast
Shiroyalna Primary School is the primary school nearest to the hypocenter .
Built on a hill surrounded by beautiful woods , this was the most modern ferro - concreate school building in Nagasaki .
The Shiroyama township was a neathly - planned , quite residential district , but with one flash of the A - bomb , the school , homes and the woods were reduced to rubble .
According to the records of April 1945 , this school had 32 classrooms , 1,500 pupils and 37 teachers and staffs .
Since an air - raid alert was announced on that day , the pupils were s( nt home .
Those who remained were 32 teachers ( including a child of one of the teachers ) , 44 students of the Gakuto Hokokutai , and 75 workers from the Mitsubishi Heiki Seisakusho .
A total of 151 persons .
Of the 151 persons , 52 were instantly killed by the heat rays and the enormous wind pressure , and 79 died later .
A total of 131 victims accounts for a death rate of 87 % .
Of the 1,500 pupils who were at a home , it is estimated that about 1,400 were killed .
10 . The Heat Rays Burned the Clothing Pattern Onto the Skin / A Woman 's Back Burned By The Strong Heat Rays
Though it is unknown at what distance from the hypocenter these two women were , the left photograph was taken at the Army Hospital , Ujina blanch ( in the southern part of Hiroshima City ) , and the right photograph at the Army Quarantines on Ninoshima Island ( Hiroshima Bay ) .
The photograph on the right shows the dark portion of the pattern of the clothing imprinted on the skin by the powerful heat rays .
This is also called secondary burns , ins which the skin under the clothing received burns through the clothes scorched by the heat rays .
The photograph on the right shows a woman who must have been exposed to the A - bomb less than 2 kilometers from the hypocenter , judging by the extent of the burns on her entire back .
Though the affected part was medically treated , you can see that the degree of the burns differs according to the angle at which the heat rays were received : the burns on the left shoulder are most severe , and the burns on the right shoulder to the waist are relatively light .
Ninoshima Island , where this woman was evacuated to , is situated about 4 kilometers south of Ujina port ; it has a circumference of about 14 kilometers .
On this island there were several facilities , including the Army Quarantines .
These facilities became emergency first - aid stations , and it is estimated that roughly 10,000 victims of the A - bomb were transported to this island by boat .
Over 2,000 people breathed their last here .
11 . Keloids Of a Person 1.6 Km Away From the Hypocenter
The date of this photograph is unknown , but there are records indicating that it was taken in October 1945 , and the patient was 17 years old then .
Although the portion covered by the shoulder strap of a bag was left lmburned , traces of burns on the patient 's back can be seen since the patient had light clothes on at that time .
Heavy keloids started to show on both arms , .
Which were exFN=.SEA .
The cause of keloids is not clear yet , but it is consideretd to be caused by a combination of powerful heat rays and radiation .
According to an observation record containing 200 entries , a clinical examination showing the sequence of protrusion from skin surface --> tone of color --> contraction of skin described the tramsition as follows :
December 1945 - protrusion started , red , contracted ; May 1946 - protrusion becomes most noticeable , red , excessively contracted ; July 1946 - partial flattening occurred , reddish purple , contraction continues but also some wrinkles ; October 1946 - light keloids flattened , purple color takes on , contraction somewhat eases ; January 1947 - heavy keloids shrink and wrinkles increase ; purplish blue wrinkles occur .
12 . Thermal Rays Leave Human Shadow On Stone Steps / Shadow Of Handrail
The left photograph shows the stone steps of the main entrandce of Sumitomo Bank which is only 250 meters from the hypocenter .
It is believed that a person sat down on the steps facing the direction of the hypocenter , possibly waiting for the bank to open .
By a flash of the heat rays with temperatures well over a 1,000 degrees or possibly 2,000 degrees centigrade , that person was incineratied on the stone steps .
Up to about 10 years after the explosion , the shadow remained clearly on the stones , but exposure to rain and wind has been gradually blurring it .
So , when the bank was newly built , the stone steps were removed and are now preserved at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum .
The right photograph shows the shadow made by the heat rays .
This place is about 800 meters from the hypocenter , and the unshielded asphalt surface was scorched , whereas the surface shielded by the handrail appears to be a whitish shadow .
The peculiarity characterizing the heat rays from the A - bomb is that an enormous amount of heat is emitted in a short time -- for 3 seconds after the explosion .
The thermal loss by heat conductivity is very little because of the short time , and consequently the surface temperature of a material becomes very high .
Within a 1 kilometer radius of the hypocenter , there were many instances where the roof tiles melted and left bubbles .
13 . A Boy Who Received Radiation Burns On His Whole Body
This boy had thermal burns on more than one - third of his body , and his chest and the left side of his belly were seriously injured .
He managed to leave the hospital after 3 years and 7 months .
This person , who miraculously recovered , is now a father of two children , and recollects what happened then ; " At that time I was riding a red bibycle on the streets of Sumiyoshi township ( about 2 kilometers from the hypocenter ) .
I was 16 years old , and it was my second year as a telegram messenger .
The moment of face , I was blinded by the flash and thrown 3 meters away by the blast that came from my rear left , and my bicycle was twisted and bent .
It was strange that I was not bleeding and did not feel any pain until I reached an underground shelter 300 meters away .
The moment I reached the shelter , I felt severe pain in my back , which ran through my whole body .
From then on , for three days and three nights , I kept on groaning in the shelter , and on the fourth day I was finally rescued and sent to a first - aid station . "
" In the early stages , the only treatment I received for my burns was the application of a mixture of ash and oil as a substitute for medicine .
I do not know how many times I yelled " kill me ! " because of the severe pain and desperate feeling . "
" Thereafter , as a result of the several operations I underwent , I escaped death and returned to work .
Since I have once given up my life , I wish to dedicatemy new life to the struggle against atomic bombs . "
He is continuing to devote his efforts to the prohibiton of atomic and hydrogen bombs .
14 . The Burned Corpse Of A Boy
This boy , who was burned to death with his hands placed on his chest , leaving an impression of agony , is believed to have been a mobilized student exposed to the A - bomb in Iwakana township , which is about 700 meters from the hypocenter .
In those days , students who were in the 7th or 8th grade or in middle school were mobilized to munitions factories , farms , and national defense crews .
They hardly did any learning at school .
In the Urakami district of Nagasaki , there were several factories , including the Mitsubishi munitions , to which many students were mobilized .
The death toll of mobilized students is unknown .
Regarding the disaster in Iwakawa township where this student was burned to death , the record of the Nagasaki A - bomb War Disaster reads as follows :
The instant the A - bomb exploded , almost all of the houses collapsed .
The scattered pieces of wood and other debris covered the ground , and in some places they were heaped into drifts .
Those who were outdoors all died , and those who were caught under the collapsed houses were screaming for help , and those who barely escaped frantically ran around .
The town got dark , and , when visibility was regained , the collapsed houses started to smolder and then took fire .
While there were mixed outcries of calls and for help , the town turned into a sea of flames . "
15 . Streetcars And Passengers Blown Away
The Urakami district , the northern part of Nagasaki City , was originally a quiet residential area ; but , from around the time of the Japan - China War , munition factories were constructed one aftere another .
The streetcars transported factory workers and mobilized students to the factory area from the center part of Nagasaki City .
This photograph shows a streetcar that was blown away from the Shimonokawa car - stop while it was heading for the Ohashi terminal , two stops away .
The corpses of passengers were blown from the streetcar to a stone wall .
Most of them were soldiers of the 2nd Company of Special Guards on the way to the Municipal Commercial School where their defensive position was .
This streetcar was only 230 meters from the hypocenter and was destroyed to the extent that none of its original shape remained after unimaginable pressure of that blast from the upper right .
The soldiers and other passengers on the streetcar instantly succumbed to the blast and the heat .
The black portions of the corpse , which are actually dark red , are burns from the heat rays .
Currently , this spot is a railway crossing that separates the Peace Park from National Highway 34 where the streetcar line and the National Railway line run parallel , on a lower level , to the National Highway .
After the war , the Shimonokawa car - stop was no longer used , but the curbstone of the car - stop still carries the traces of the burn .
The place shown in the photograph is now a parking lot , and by the sidewalk along the National Highway above the stone wall , there are two monuments to the memory of the A - bomb vicim .
In between is a monument for those victims who had no surviving relatives .
Offerings of flowers to these monuments never cease .
16 . Subcutaneous Hemorrhage / Atomic Bomb Cataract Caused By Radiation
The left photograph shows a 21 - years - old soldier who was in a wooden house situated 1 kilometer from the hypocenter .
Since he was indoors , he was saved from burns , but , as he received cuts on his buck , right elvow and right belly , first - aid treatment was given to him .
However , when we follow his medical record , we learn more :
August 18 -- Hair falling out is noticed ; August 19 -- Bleeding from gum , and purplish subcutaneous hemorrhage starts to appear as in the photograph ; August 30 -- Is hospitalized in the Ujina Branch of the Army Hospital , and on the 31st becomes feverish ; September 1 -- Tonsillitis occurs and with a sore throat he can not eat .
Bleeding from gum dose not stop , and subcutaneous hemorrhage multiplies on face and upper half of body : September 2 -- Has an indistinct consciousness and starts to talk in delirium .
September 3 -- Died at 9:30 p.m .
This photograph was taken 2 hours before his death at the request of an American Army surgeon .
This soldier 's symton record is a typical description of the acute effects of radiation .
The right photograph shows an eyeball of an A - bomb victim who got an atomic bomb cataract .
There is opacity near the center of the eyeball .
It has been known for some time , through that radiation causes cataracts in animals .
But cataracts developed in human beings after the atomic bombings in Hiroshima and Nagasaki .
According to a clinical report of 128 cataract cases in Hiroshima during the four years from 1957 , 38.3 % had atomic bomb cataracts or suspected atomic bomb cataracts .
It is reported that 70 % of those were within 1 kilometer from the hypocenter , and 30 % were within 2 kilometers .
Some Atomic - bomb cataracts occurred several months after exposure , while most occurred several years later .
In the case of this patient , it was diagnosed as an atomic bomb cataract in 1970 , 25 years after the bomb .
The patient filed an application with the Ministry of Health and Welfare of the Japanese Government in August 1971 so as to be registered as an A - bomb victim .
His application was turned down because ' it is not considered necessary that you be medically treated now ;
The patient filed the second and third application in August and November of 1972 .
The second one was turned down and he was told to apply anew at the time was commenced .
The third one was turned down with a reply saying , ' submit application at the time of operation . '
So , the patient had no other choice but to sue the Government and Ministry of Health and Welfare in May 1973 .
After 3 years in court , the patient 's request was finally approved in July 1976 .
17 . A Girl 's Epilation Caused By Acute Radiation Effects
This girl ( 11 years old ) was on the second floor of a wooden house which was situated 2 kilometers from the hypocenter .
Since she was indoors , she did not receive any burns , but about a week later , epilation started .
She suffered from loss of appetite , bleeding from the gum , and fever .
She was recovered a little when this photograph was taken .
Epilation is a characteristic external sympton of exposure to radiation .
It can occur as early as 5 or 10 days after exposure , but in most instances the hair loss commenced in the second or third week .
Fever begins a few days after the start of epilation and rises to about 40 degrees centigrade .
Many people died in this condition .
Even those who were shielded and did not receive any external wound or burn suffered from symptons such as epilation , fever , bleeding and bloody excrement if they were within 1 kilometer of the hypocenter .
Many of these victims died within 7 days .
18 . HIROSHIMA Has Not Ended
Citizens who were able to escape from hell on earth that day evacuated to the suburban areas of Hiroshima City and took refuge at first - aid stations set up in public buildings .
However , this provided only momentary relief .
They started to die one after another at the first - aid stations , and cremation could not catch up with the rate of death , so many of them had to be buried togeter .
In July of 1952 , seven years after the atomic bombing , 252 remains were dug out from five places in Saka township of Aki country , which is situated 8 or 9 kilometers from the hypocenter .
In one location , 156 bodies had been buried together ; in another location , the cremated remains of 36 people had been buried together .
This photograph shows the remains in Saka township .
In the same year , 43 bodies from a vacant lot which used to be the Yamanaka Girl 's High School in Senda township of Hiroshima City , and 29 bodies from Kanawajima Island off Ujina , Hiroshima City , were also dug up .
Twenty years after the bombing , in the autumn of 1971 , humanbones were accidentally found on the grounds of Ninoshima Junior High School on Ninoshima Island , where thousands of A - bomb victims dies .
Believing these bones were remains of A - bomb victims , the Hiroshima municipality dug the area for about one month and recovered the remains of 617 bodies .
The remains of A - bomb victims are still being recovered scores of years after the bombing .
Hiroshima , Nagasaki and surrounding areas are still the graveyards of the A - bomb victims .
19 . The Dead And The Living
There was nothing burnable left near the hypocenter in Nagasaki around noon August 10th , the day after the bombing .
In the report " Air Defense Information And The Extent of Damage Caused by Aerial Attracks " of Nagasaki Prefecture , the scene was descrived this way : " Buildings were almost all burnt down .
All the area was reduced to ashes due to the fierce heat , and the casualties are as large in number as ever recorded . "
What is this girl looking for , standing vacantly on the ruins swept by flames for a whole day , where embers are still smoldering ?
She is probably a student judging from her clothes .
Is she at a loss , not finding the place where her house used to be ?
Her eyes , gazing into the distance , look vacant and exhausted .
At her feet lies a scorched corpse , but she does not even pay attention to it .
This person , the corpse who was squashed down and enveloped in flames in an instant , is so terribly scorched that it is impossible to distinguish if it is male or female .
This person must have died screaming .
Meanwhile is this girl , who was lucky enough to escape death , still in good health after 50 - odd years , or dose she carry the agony that comes with exposure to residual radioactivity ?
In this photograph , the contrast of life and death is vividly shown .
It was a sight seen at many places in Nagasaki then .
20 . Abolishment Of Nuclear Weapons !
Peace World !
These are photographs of the peace Memorial Ceremony held in Hiroshima and Nagasaki respectively on August 6th and 9th .
The memorial Cenotaph in Hiroshima was unveiled on August 6 , 1952 .
Under the Cenotaph , which is in the shape an ancient clay house , is a stone coffin .
On its surface are inscribed the words , " Rest in peace , for the mistake shall not be repeated . "
The registers of the names of those who died by the A - bomb explosion are placed in the stone coffin , and people in Hiroshima ( Aki ) district call it " kako - cho " ( death registers ) .
The names of the dead are added to the registers every year .
The total number , as of August 6 , 1980 , stands at 98,685 , less than a half of the estimated 200,000 or more people who died by the A - bomb explosion in Hiroshima .
In the case of Nagasaki , too , only half the dead have been identified .
The peace Statue was completed in 1955 by voluntary money raised from all over Japan .
It has been made a custom to hold the Peace Memorial Ceremony by hanging a big curtain in front of the Statue .
The photograph shows the 35th Ceremony .
The design of the flowers placed in front of the Statue , represents pigeons with their wings outstretched toward the sun .
They symbolize the figure is appealing for eternal world peace as well as consoling the souls of the dead .
The A - bomb did not simply and injure masses of people and destroy buildings .
It destroyed all the living and the community of the living .
The experience Hiroshima and Nagasaki underwent is not confined to damage by war .
It represents genocide , the obliteration of the society , and devastation of the environment .
Inaddition , it is the first experience in the history mankind which augurs the destruction of the earth .
According to the report made by the U.N. General Secretary in the autumn of 1980 .
There are 40,000 to 50,000 nuclear weapons stocked in the world today , a number equivalent to one million Hiroshima - type A - bombs .
It is certain that the nuclear weapons stocked today are enough to kill the whole population of the earth dozens of times .
Thus , nuclear weapons have the power to hold sway over the fate of mankind , between survival and eradication .
We live in the age of nuclear horror whether we like it or not .
Therefore in order to make our own lives secure and to ensure the perpetuation of mankind , we must abolish all nuclear weapons from the earth .
Japan is in the forefront of this drive for peace .
The movement against nuclear weapons originated with the " Stockholm Appeal " in 1950 .
With the threat of the use of A - bombs in the Korean War , which broke out in June of that year , the Appel was promoted world - wide and 500 million signatories were collected .
When a hydrogen bomb test was conducted at Bikini Atoll on March 1 , 1954 , a Japansese tuna fishing vessel , " Fukuryu Maru No.5 " , was covered with " deadly ashes " and Mr. Aikichi Kuboyama , one of the crew , died due to the radiation .
This triggered the signature - collecting movement against atomic and hydrogen bombs all over Japan , and thirty million signatures were collected in a year .
This powerfull message was brought into full play in the First World Conference Against A - and H-Bombs held in August , 1955 .
A global movement calling for the extinction of nuclear weapons was spearheaded by an organization called NGO and by the nonaligned neutral coungries , which comprise more than two - thirds of the countries in the world .
NGO , an organization formed on the basis of Clause 71 of the U.N. Charter , has vigorously impeached the competition for nuclear development by holding the Hiroshima International Forum Commemorating the 30th Anniversary the Atomic Bombing in Tokyo , Hiroshima and Nagasaki in the summer of 1977 ; the NGO International Disarmament Conference in February , 1978 .
NGO has been pointing the way for protecting mankind from nuclear crisis .
Another blobal event to be noted was The U.N. Special Session on Disarmament , held for the first time from May 23 to July 1,1978 .
This gathering was the result of a joint proposal of the nonaligned nations made to the U.N. General Assembly in the autumn of 1976 .
Some important resolutions were made in terms of disarmament , including nuclear weapons .
A Commitiee of Disarmament ( CD ) was to be formed with the participation of 35 nuclear and non-nuclear countries .
In addition , a week beginning on October 24 every year was designated as " The U.N. Disarmament Week " , a period of time during which each country would highlight the cause of disarmament .
At the 33rd U.N. General Assembly helf in the autumn of that year , the following recommendation was made after the Special Session : ( 1 ) The use of nuclear weapons violates the U.N. Charter .
( 2 ) An international agreement be made to protect non-nuclear countries .
( 3 ) Nuclear weapons must not be deployed in non-nuclear countries .
( 4 ) Nuclear tests must not be conducted .
( 5 ) An investigation must be made so as to terminate the production of nuclear weapons and nuclear test equipment .
The above recommendation have not been fully carried out .
Therefore , it is necessary to mobilize public opinion all over the world .
Endeavours for peace should be strengthened so that the second U.N. Special Session on Disarmament to be held in 1982 will be much more successful .
The devil 's weapon made by man must be removed by the wisdom of man .
We must strengthen our belief with one another , and define what we can do now and what we must do now .
We must gather each and everyone 's efforts into one big force for the abolition of nuclear weapons in order to secure eternal surbibal , prosperity and peace for all mankind .

" QUANTUM SHOT " # 224
Article by guest blogger M. Christian
Good Night America ... and Good Luck to us all
Welcome our guest blogger M. Christian ( " Meine kleine fabrik " is a place where M.Christian ( www.mchristian.com ) and s.a. ( caferacersociety.blogspot.com ) put some of the odd , weird , and wonderful things they 've stumbled across or tripped over : art , history , machines , heroes , movies , music , and more .
The only rule is that we try and make whatever goes up as unexpected as possible -- just like life . )
Accidents happen .
No one is immune : tyops typos slip in , numbers get misdialed , directions are screwed up .
We all make them ; no one is perfect .
Except that these mistakes involved thermonuclear weapons , and could easily have reduced a sizable hunk of this world to a Geiger - clicking pit .
While I do n’t have the time or the space to list all of them , here ’s a sample of nuclear boo - boos guaranteed to make you at least look up the next time a plane scrawls a contrail across the sky , or go fishing .
( images credit : vintagephoto )
Just a few years after Oppenheimer and those wacky guys at the Manhattan Project turned a piece of the American desert into a glowing tourist spot , a B - 36 putting its way from Alaska to Texas had a slight problem staying in the air .
Luckily for the crew they managed to drop their bombs , which fell 8,000 feet , landing with a bang off the coast of British Columbia .
Luckily for Canada only the bombs ’ high explosives went off , not their nuclear cores .
It was a very nice opening shot , a 1950 intro to " nuclear weapons accidents " .
Eight years ( and several similar accidents ) later a bomber from Hunter Air Force Base , Georgia made a severe " oops " when it dropped its cargo of one nuclear device onto the backyard of the Gregg family in South Carolina .
Fortunately for the Greggs , and South Carolina , again ONLY part of the bomb that went off was the ordinary component of the warhead which injured six members of that clan and made a nice divot in their garden : a hole 70 feet wide and 30 feet deep .
The blast also took out five other houses and damaged a church .
For almost irradiating a sizable hunk of the US , the Air Force coughed up $ 54,000 .
One of my favorite atomic butter fingers is the one that almost plays out as a Zucker Bro ’s gag : A bunch of US sailors at a Scottish base , rollicking it up , maybe wolf - whistling at some highland cutie , did a boo - boo and dropped ( yes , I said dropped ) a fully - armed Poseidon missile some twenty or so feet .
It is pretty safe to say that the base laundry was very busy that night getting stains out of underwear .
Another tragic yet almost comedic incident of near nuclear devastation occurred in 1980 , this time with almost Pythonesque timing .
A sudden explosion in a Titan missile base near Little Rock , Arkansas popped the top of a silo off like a cheap champagne cork and tossed the missile ’s 9 megaton warhead straight up .
Landing some 1,000 feet away , it was later found to be pretty much intact .
Like said , this little piece is much too short to do into the couple ... no , wait , that is n’t quite fair , more like the dozens and dozens and DOZENS of nuclear weapons mishaps that have livened up the lives of US and international servicemen .
But I have n’t even touched on the ones that got away .
Imagine if you will , some sport fisherman trying to forget a hectic few months at the office by hooking himself a handsome marlin .
He ’s out there , casting and reeling , casting and reeling , letting those stressful workdays melt off as he imagines how nice that deep sea beauty will look on his office wall , when he has a nibble , then a bite .
And , boy , what a bite !
In a hot flash of atomic fusion , the ocean for miles around simply vanishes in an expanding bubble of superheated steam .
The shockwave travels through the surrounding ocean , a compression sledgehammer that kills everything it encounters , reducing life and the sea floor into component molecules .
For a moment , the sun blooms under water .
It would be inaccurate to say that there are a few stray thermonuclear devices " floating " around out there because there are certainly more than a few .
( image credit : Pierre J. )
In 1957 a C - 124 hauling three atomic devices from Delaware across the Atlantic suddenly developed serious engine trouble .
The crew , rather than ride the nukes down to the briny deep , dropped their cargo somewhere between Rehobeth , Delaware , and Wildwood , New Jersey .
Got that ?
Get your charts out and rent yourselves a boat or two , because there ’s nuclear treasure to be found out there .
The very next year a B - 47 smacked into another plane , spilling it ’s own atomic cargo into the ocean off of Savannah , Georgia .
They looked and they looked but they could n’t find it .
Savannah used to be quite a lovely city ....
Also in 1956 ( not a very good year for the military ) another B - 47 bomber flying to Europe vanished without a trace .
Poof !
In addition to one very excellent aircraft , the Air Force also lost a nuclear device .
Somewhere sperm whales are using it for a back scratcher : in ‘ 65 an A - 4E jet simply fell off the USS Ticonderoga as it steamed somewhere near the coast of Okinawa and sank in 20,000 feet of water .
That little plane was also carrying one hellava large bomb and , somewhere in all that water and pressure , it ’s still there .
The Russians have also had their own share of nuclear mishaps , and while we have n’t heard about most of them , the ones we HAVE heard of it are enough to make you pack your dehydrated beans and go live up in the hills .
For instance , in 1986 a Soviet Yankee class nuclear sub sort of .... well , sank some 600 miles from Bermuda .
In addition to its own nuke power plant , this fine example of Russian engineering was also carrying a few thermonuclear weapons ... 34 of them to be exact .
My all - time favorite , and the one that spawned this little trip to radioactive weirdness , is this little tidbit of Cold War fear .
While it does n’t rank with 34 missing warheads , you ’ll see how that does n’t necessarily mean that this story has what you ’d call a happy ending .
In 1961 a B - 52 decided to do a shake - and - shimmy over North Carolina , dropping two 24 - megaton nuclear weapons .
One of the little toys released its parachute and glided down to a less - than - gentle landing .
The other device though smacked down somewhere in waterlogged farmland .
Not at sea , not in 20,000 feet of water , not " off the coast " of anywhere .
Farmland , near North Carolina .
Anyone live in North Carolina ?
Come on , a show of hands - gee , quite a few of you .
Is n’t North Carolina a great place to live ?
You might , though , reconsider because even though this little boo - boo happened over twenty years ago the capable US military never recovered that little gizmo .
It ’s still out there .
Tick , tick , tick , tick ....
I can hear some of you die - hard optimists mumbling something about " safety " and " redundant backups " .
Well , you just keep mumbling that comfortable little mantra to yourself while I casually bring up that other bomb , the one that parachuted down .
Well , while they found that little fissionable puppy , the guys that inspected it found something very interesting .
You see , a device of that type has six safety devices -
- and five of them had failed .
Good night , America , and all the ships at sea .
Sleep tight , do n’t let the bed bugs bite , and always remember : accidents will happen .

UPDATE :
On a positive note , as many comments ( thank you ) have pointed out :
" It is extremely difficult for a nuclear or thermonuclear weapon to go off accidentally .
Unless every segment of the explosive shell is triggered simultaneously to create a uniform implosion wave that smoothly compresses your fissionable core to supercriticality , you 're going to just get a messy conventional explosion that tosses fissionable material around .
( Worst case is a fizzle where you get momentary criticality and a yield equivalent to a few tons . )
Any weapon that 's been sitting underwater for any length of time is going to be in much too bad a shape to have any meaningful risk of fission detonation . "
Even as it is an assuring thought , still the massive accumulation of nukes presents tremendous risk , in many cases coming down to " the human error " - read this hair - raising account of close the world came to mutual annihilation in 1983 - Wikipedia article about Stanislav Petrov .

COVID -19 UPDATE | Folded Square is operating normally , but delivery times may be affected by disruption to national postal services
The Supreme Court hit the trifecta yesterday : Three cases involving the First Amendment .
Three dismaying decisions by Chief Justice John Roberts ’s new conservative majority .
Chief Justice Roberts and the four others in his ascendant bloc used the next - to - last decision day of this term to reopen the political system to a new flood of special - interest money , to weaken protection of student expression and to make it harder for citizens to challenge government violations of the separation of church and state .
In the process , the reconfigured court extended its noxious habit of casting aside precedents without acknowledging it  insincere judicial modesty scored by Justice Antonin Scalia in a concurring opinion .
First , campaign finance .
Four years ago , a differently constituted court upheld sensible provisions of the McCain - Feingold Act designed to prevent corporations and labor unions from circumventing the ban on their spending in federal campaigns by bankrolling phony “ issue ads . ”
These ads purport to just educate voters about a policy issue , but are really aimed at a particular candidate .
The 2003 ruling correctly found that the bogus issue ads were the functional equivalent of campaign ads and upheld the Congressional restrictions on corporate and union money .
Yet the Roberts court shifted course in response to sham issue ads run on radio and TV by a group called Wisconsin Right to Life with major funding from corporations opposed to Senator Russell Feingold , the Democrat who co-authored the act .
First of all , we had no idea the All Terrain Armored Transport ( AT - AT ) had a Powerstroke diesel .
That 's pretty impressive .
Nonetheless , trying to maneuver an Imperial walker out of a mall parking lot takes the kind of finesse even the Empire 's elite armor assault crews are n't trained for .
Then again , this guy should n't be trying to go it alone — that 's what a crew is for .
But , as written in the StarWars.com databank , " AT - AT pilot training stresses their importance , and successful soldiers are often convinced of their invincibility , making them insufferably arrogant to the frontline grunts . "
Yeah , that 's probably it .
[ Thanks to Mike for the tip . ]

client : " I really would like a site on the internet but I 'm worried about the cost of the CD's . "
They thought that I would go to all the computers in the area and put their site on them via CD ...... 1 computer at a time !
Steve Jobs ' new partnership with EMI to sell music without copy protection is a lesson in how to wield power in the digital age .
Carefully and strategically , Jobs set up the pieces to create a new business model for online music – one without copy protection – and now we 're starting to see the dominos fall .
The first to topple is EMI , the smallest and weakest of the big four record labels .
With EMI on board , the other record labels must act .
Either they join the DRM - free party , or hold out like dinosaurs from a bygone , locked - down age .
A key move that brought them to the table was his February open letter critiquing DRM copy - protection systems – the first time to my knowledge that Jobs has expressed his thinking in such detail .
At the time , Jobs ' letter seemed to be in response to several European governments that were making threats to break the lock between iTunes and the iPod .
Now the open letter looks like a lever to weaken the position of the record labels at the negotiating table .
Jobs wrote :
" Imagine a world where every online store sells DRM - free music encoded in open licensable formats .
In such a world , any player can play music purchased from any store , and any store can sell music which is playable on all players .
This is clearly the best alternative for consumers , and Apple would embrace it in a heartbeat .
If the big four music companies would license Apple their music without the requirement that it be protected with a DRM , we would switch to selling only DRM - free music on our iTunes store . "
With the letter , Jobs planted the idea that DRM is the wrong way to run an online music business .
Since its publication two months ago , the letter has created a broad consensus that the current copy - protected system is n't working , and puts considerable pressure on the labels to drop DRM .
When Jobs published the letter , he likely already had EMI in his back pocket , and now the other labels are on the defensive .
The open letter also allowed Jobs to take a leadership position on the copy protection issue .
Thanks to the letter , Monday 's deal looks like it was his idea , not EMI 's .
If Jobs ' had n't published the letter , or published it now after the fact , people would assume EMI came to Apple with idea – now it appears the other way around .
Only Jobs has the power and the cojones to make such a move .
Only Jobs could so boldly rip down the system he had previously built – the iTunes music store , which is the most - successful online store ( perhaps the only one ) , which was built on copy - protected music , and force the music industry to follow suit .
He 's tearing down the old system for something much more modern – high - fidelity tracks that can be played on any device .
Oddly for a business leader with a reputation for tight control and lock in , Jobs is ceding control of a locked - down format in favor of a much bigger , open market .
The move is sure to remake the online music business .
The old DRM system is going to be swept aside in favor of a much more open approach .
Jobs is already confident his power plays will work .
In a statement on Monday , Jobs said he expects half of the songs on iTunes will be sold DRM - free by the end of the year .
It will also have ramifications for other digital media further down the line – maybe movies , Jobs ' other business .

This chapter describes Scheme 48 's thread system : Scheme 48 threads are fully preemptive ; all threads ( currently ) run within a single operating system process .
Scheme 48 allows writing customized , nested schedulers , and provides numerous facilities for the synchronization of shared - memory programs , most importantly proposals for optimistic concurrency .
The bindings described in this section are part of the threads structure .
( spawn thunk ) -> thread
( spawn thunk name ) -> thread
Spawn creates a new thread , passes that thread to the current scheduler , and instructs the scheduler to run thunk in that thread .
The name argument ( a symbol ) associates a symbolic name with the thread ; it is purely for debugging purposes .
Relinquish - timeslice instructs the scheduler to run another thread , thus relinquishing the timeslice of the current thread .
Sleep does the same and asks the scheduler to suspend the current thread for at least time - in - milliseconds milliseconds before resuming it .
Finally , terminate - current - thread terminates the current thread .
Each thread is represented by a thread object .
The following procedures operate on that object :
( current - thread ) -> thread
( thread ?
thing ) -> boolean
( thread - name thread ) -> name
( thread - uid thread ) -> integer
Current - thread returns the thread object associated with the currently running thread .
Thread ? is the predicate for thread objects .
Thread - name extracts the name of the thread , if one was specified in the call to spawn , #f otherwise .
Thread - uid returns the uid of the thread , a unique integer assigned by the thread system .
The following bindings are part of the threads - internal structure :
( terminate - thread ! thread )
( kill - thread ! thread )
Terminate - thread !
unwinds the thread associated with thread , running any pending dynamic - wind after thunks ( in that thread ) , after which the thread terminates .
Kill - thread !
causes the thread associated with thread to terminate immediately without unwinding its continuation .
Debugging multithreaded programs can be difficult .
As described in section 3.11 , when any thread signals an error , Scheme 48 stops running all of the threads at that command level .
The following procedure ( exported by the structure debug - messages ) is useful in debugging multi- threaded programs .
( debug - message element 0 ... )
Debug - message prints the elements to ` stderr ' , followed by a newline .
The only types of values that debug - message prints in full are small integers ( fixnums ) , strings , characters , symbols , booleans , and the empty list .
Values of other types are abbreviated as follows :
pair (... ) vector #(... ) procedure # {procedure} record # { < name of record type > } all others ???
debug - message
The great thing aboutis that it bypasses Scheme 48's I/O and thread handling .
The message appears immediately , with no delays or errors .
Most of the bindings described in this section are part of the proposals structure -- the low - level bindings described at the very end of the section are part of the low - proposals structure .
A proposal is a record of reads from and and writes to locations in memory .
Each thread has an associated current proposal ( which may be #f ) .
The logging operations listed below record any values read or written in the current proposal .
A reading operation , such as provisional - vector - ref , first checks to see if the current proposal contains a value for the relevent location .
If so , that value is returned as the result of the read .
If not , the current contents of the location are stored in the proposal and then returned as the result of the read .
A logging write to a location stores the new value as the current contents of the location in the current proposal ; the contents of the location itself remain unchanged .
Committing to a proposal verifies that any reads logged in the proposal are still valid and , if so , performs any writes that the proposal contains .
A logged read is valid if , at the time of the commit , the location contains the same value it had at the time of the original read ( note that this does not mean that no change occured , simply that the value now is the same as the value then ) .
If a proposal has an invalid read then the effort to commit fails ; no change is made to the value of any location .
The verifications and subsequent writes to memory are performed atomically with respect to other proposal commit attempts .
( call - ensuring - atomicity thunk ) -> value ...
( call - ensuring - atomicity ! thunk )
( ensure - atomicity exp ... ) -> value ... ( syntax )
( ensure - atomicity ! exp ... ) ( syntax )
If there is a proposal in place call - ensuring - atomicity and call - ensuring - atomicity !
simply make a ( tail - recursive ) call to thunk .
If the current proposal is #f they create a new proposal , install it , call thunk , and then try to commit to the proposal .
This process repeats , with a new proposal on each iteration , until the commit succeeds .
Call - ensuring - atomicity returns whatever values are returned by thunk on its final invocation , while ensure - atomicity !
discards any such values and returns nothing .
Ensure - Atomicity and ensure - atomicity !
are macro versions of call - ensuring - atomicity and call - ensuring - atomicity ! : ( ensure - atomicity exp ... ) expands into ( call - ensuring - atomicity ( lambda ( ) exp ... ) ) ; likewise for ensure - atomicity !
and call - ensuring - atomicity ! .
( provisional - car pair ) -> value
( provisional - cdr pair ) -> value
( provisional - set - car ! pair value )
( provisional - set - cdr ! pair value )
( provisional - cell - ref cell ) -> value
( provisional - cell - set ! cell value )
( provisional - vector - ref vector i ) -> value
( provisional - vector - set ! vector i value )
( provisional - string - ref vector i ) -> char
( provisional - string - set ! vector i char )
( provisional - byte - vector - ref vector i ) -> k
( provisional - byte - vector - set ! vector i k )
These are all logging versions of their Scheme counterparts .
Reads are checked when the current proposal is committed and writes are delayed until the commit succeeds .
If the current proposal is #f these perform exactly as their Scheme counterparts .
The following implementation of a simple counter may not function properly when used by multiple threads .
( define ( make - counter ) ( let ( ( value 0 ) ) ( lambda ( ) ( set! value (+ value 1 ) ) value ) ) )
Here is the same procedure using a proposal to ensure that each increment operation happens atomically .
The value of the counter is kept in a cell ( see section 5.6 ) to allow the use of logging operations .
( define ( make - counter ) ( let ( ( value ( make - cell 0 ) ) ) ( lambda ( ) ( ensure - atomicity ( lambda ( ) ( let ( ( v (+ ( provisional - cell - ref value ) 1 ) ) ) ( provisional - cell - set ! value v ) v ) ) ) ) ) )
Because ensure - atomicity creates a new proposal only if there is no existing proposal in place , multiple atomic actions can be merged into a single atomic action .
For example , the following procedure increments an arbitrary number of counters at the same time .
This works even if the same counter appears multiple times ; ( step - counters ! c0 c0 ) would add two to the value of counter c0 .
( define ( step - counters ! . counters ) ( ensure - atomicity ( lambda ( ) ( for -each ( lambda ( counter ) ( counter ) ) counters ) ) ) )
( define - synchronized - record - type tag type - name ( constructor - name field - tag ... ) [ ( field - tag ... ) ] predicate - name ( field - tag accessor - name [ modifier - name ] ) ... )
This is the same as define - record - type except all field reads and writes are logged in the current proposal .
If the optional list of field tags is present then only those fields will be logged .
( call - atomically thunk ) -> value(s )
( call - atomically ! thunk )
( atomically exp ... ) -> value (s ) ( syntax )
( atomically ! exp ... ) ( syntax )
Call - atomically and call - atomically !
are identical to call - ensuring - atomicity and call - ensuring - atomicity !
except that they always install a new proposal before calling thunk .
The current proposal is saved and then restored after thunk returns .
Call - atomically and Call - atomically !
are useful if thunk contains code that is not to be combined with any other operation .
Atomically and atomically !
are macro versions of call - atomically and call - atomically ! : ( atomically exp ... ) expands into ( call - atomically ( lambda ( ) exp ... ) ) ; likewise for atomically !
and call - atomically ! .
( with - new - proposal ( lose ) exp ... ) -> value ... ( syntax )
With - new - proposal saves the current proposal , installs a new one , executes the forms in the body , and returns whatever they returns .
It also binds lose to a thunk repeating the procedure of installing a new procedure and running the body .
Typically , the body will call maybe - commit and , if that fails , call lose to try again .
The following procedures give access to the low - level proposal mechanism .
They are defined in the low - proposals structure .
( maybe-commit ) -> boolean
( make - proposal ) -> proposal
( current - proposal ) -> proposal
( set- current - proposal ! proposal )
Maybe - commit verifies that any reads logged in the current proposal are still valid and , if so , performs any writes that it contains .
A logged read is valid if , at the time of the commit , the location read contains the same value it had at the time of the original read ( note that this does not mean that no change occured , simply that the value now is the same as the value then ) .
Maybe - commit returns #t if the commit succeeds and #f if it fails .
Make - proposal creates a new proposal .
Current - proposal and set- current - proposal access and set the current thread 's proposal .
It is an error to pass to set - current - proposal !
a proposal that is already in use .
Condition variables ( defined in the condvars structure ) allow threads perform condition synchronization :
It allows threads to block , waiting for a specified condition -- associated with a condition variable -- to occur , and other threads to wake up the waiting threads when the condition is fulfilled .
Note that , in Scheme 48 , condition variables work in conjunction with proposals , not with mutex locks or semaphores , as in most other implementations of this concept .
( make - condvar ) -> condvar
( make - condvar id ) -> condvar
( condvar ? thing ) -> boolean
( set - condvar - has - value ?!
condvar boolean )
( condvar - has - value ?
condvar ) -> boolean
( set - condvar - value ! condvar value )
( condvar - value condvar ) -> value
( maybe-commit-and-wait - for - condvar condvar ) -> boolean
( maybe-commit-and- set- condvar ! condvar value ) -> boolean
Make - condvar creates a condition variable .
( The optional id argument is only for debugging purposes ; the discloser for condition variables prints it out if present . )
Condvar ? is the predicate for condition variables .
Each condition variable has an associated value and a flag has - value ?
signalling if the condition has already occured .
The accessor for flag is condvar - has - value ? ; set - condvar - has - value ?!
sets it .
Both are provisional operations and go through the current proposal .
Set - condvar - value !
sets the value of the condition variable ( provisionally ) , and condvar - value extracts it .
Maybe - commit - and - wait - for - condvar attempts to commit the current proposal .
If the commit succeeds , it suspends the current thread and registers it with the condvar condition variable .
Upon waking up again maybe - commit - and - wait - for - condvar returns #t , If the commit fails , maybe - commit - and - set - condvar returns #f .
Maybe - commit - and - set - condvar !
sets the value of the condvar condition variable to value , ( provisionally ) sets the has - value ?
flag to #t , and then attempt to commit the current proposal .
Upon success , it wakes up all suspended threads registered with condvar and returns #t , otherwise , it returns #f .
Scheme 48 also has more traditional mutual - exclusion synchronization abstractions , specifically mutex locks and placeholders .
Note that typically synchronization via optimistic concurrency is usually preferable : Mutual exclusion often puts the running program into an inconsistent state for the time of the inclusion , which has adverse effects on modularity and interruptibility .
The locks structure contains bindings that implement standard mutex locks :
( make - lock ) -> lock
( lock ? thing ) -> boolean
( obtain - lock lock )
( maybe-obtain - lock lock ) -> boolean
( release - lock lock )
Make - lock creates a lock in the ``released '' state .
Lock ? is the predicate for locks .
Obtain - lock atomically checks if lock is in the ``released '' state .
If it is , the lock is put into the ``obtained '' state , and obtain - lock returns immediately .
If the lock is in the ``obtained ' ' state , the current thread is suspended and registered with the lock .
Maybe - obtain - lock , like obtain - lock , checks the state of lock : if it is ``released , '' the lock is put into the ``obtained '' state , if it is ``obtained , '' maybe - obtain - lock returns immediately .
Maybe - obtain - lock returns #t if it was able to obtain the lock , and #f otherwise .
Release - lock does nothing if lock is in the ``released '' state .
If it is in the ``obtained ' ' state , release - lock causes one of the threads suspended on an obtain - lock lock operation to continue execution .
If that thread is the last thread registered with the lock , the lock is transferred to the ``released '' state .
In any case , release - lock returns immediately .
The placeholders structure contains bindings for placeholders -- thread - safe , write - once variables , akin to ID - 90 I - structures or CML I -variables .
The typical scenario for placeholders is that , say , a thread A computes a value needed by another thread B at some unspecified time .
Both threads share access to a placeholder ; when A has computed the value , it places it into the placeholder .
When B needs the value , it extracts it from placeholder , blocking if necessary .
( make - placeholder ) -> placeholder
( make - placeholder id ) -> placeholder
( placeholder ? thing ) -> boolean
( placeholder - set !
placeholder value )
( placeholder - value placeholder ) -> value
Make - placeholder creates an empty placeholder .
( The optional id argument is only for debugging purposes ; the discloser for placeholders prints it out if present . )
Placeholder ? is the predicate for placeholders .
Placeholder - set ! places a value into a placeholder .
Doing this more than once signals an error .
Placeholder - value extracts the value from the placeholder and returns it .
If the placeholder is empty , it blocks the current thread until it becomes full .
The bindings explained in this section are part of the threads - internal structure .
They are concerned with suspending threads and making them runnable again upon some later event .
Typically , a suspended thread needs to be recorded in a queue somewhere for later waking - up .
To allow a thread to be recorded in multiple queues ( say , when it waits for one of a number of events ) , such thread queues are ordinary queues containing cells that , in turn , contain the thread objects themselves .
Each thread has at most one such cell associated with it which is shared among all queues ( or other data structures ) holding on to the suspended thread .
The cell is cleared when the thread is woken up .
( thread - queue - empty ?
thread - queue ) -> boolean
( maybe -dequeue - thread ! thread - queue ) -> boolean
Thread - queue - empty ?
atomically checks whether the thread - queue thread queue is empty , i.e. , if it does not contain non-empty cells .
Maybe - dequeue - thread !
provisionally dequeues a thread from thread - queue if it contains one .
It returns the dequeued thread or #f if the queue is empty .
( maybe-commit-and - block cell ) -> boolean
( maybe-commit-and-block-on- queue thread - queue ) -> boolean
( maybe-commit- and - make - ready thread - or - queue ) -> boolean
Maybe - commit - and - block attempts to commit the current proposal .
If this succeeds , the current thread is blocked , the thread 's cell is set to cell , and #t is returned .
Otherwise , #f is returned .
Maybe - commit - and - block - on - queue is like maybe - commit - and - block , excepts that it creates a fresh cell for the thread and enqueues it in thread - queue if the commit succeeds .
Maybe - commit - and - make - ready accepts either a thread object or a thread queue as an argument .
In either case , maybe - commit - and - make - ready tries to commit the current proposal .
If that succeeds , it maybe - commit - and - make - ready makes its argument runnable : if thread - or - queue is a thread , that thread is made runnable , if it is a thread queue , all threads on the queue are made runnable .
( In the latter case , none of the threads actually runs until all have been made runnable . )
Marybe - commit - and - make - ready returns #t if it succeeded , and #f otherwise .
The interface to the Concurrent ML abstractions in Scheme 48 is mostly analogous to the original implementation shipped with SML / NJ [ 9 ] .
Note that both the interface and implementation are new and may change in future releases .
The main terminological difference is that CML events are called rendezvous in Scheme 48 .
For more information on programming with the CML abstractions , Reppy 's book [ 9 ] is recommended .
The basic rendezvous combinators live in the rendezvous structure .
never -rv ( rendezvous )
( always - rv value ) -> rendezvous
Never -rv is a rendezvous that is never enabled for synchronization .
( It is the same as the never event in CML . )
Always - rv returns a rendezvous that is elways enabled for synchronization , and always yields the same value value .
( This is the same as the always Evt function in CML . )
( choose rendezvous ... ) -> rendezvous
Choose creates a rendezvous representing the choice of its arguments : Synchronization on the resulting rendezvous will synchronize on one of the arguments to choose , depending on which becomes enabled first .
( This is the same as the choose function in CML . )
( wrap rendezvous proc ) -> rendezvous
Wrap wraps a post - synchronization procedure around rendezvous :
When the resulting rendezvous is synchronized , rendezvous is synchronized , and the value it yields is passed to proc ; the value returned by proc then is the result of the synchronization .
( This is the same as the CML wrap function . )
( guard thunk ) -> rendezvous
Guard delays the creation of a rendezvous until synchronization time :
It returns a rendezvous that will , upon synchronization , turn into the rendezvous returned by thunk .
Guard can be used to perform pre-synchronization actions such as resource allocation .
( This is the same as the CML guard function . )
( with - nack proc ) -> rendezvous
With - nack , like guard , creates a delayed rendezvous :
Upon synchronization , the rendezvous actually used is the one returned by proc .
In addition to the functionality offered by guard , proc receives , as an argument , another rendezvous which becomes enabled when another rendezvous involved in the synchronization ( via choose ) is picked instead of the one produced by proc .
( This is the same as the CML withNack function . )
( sync rendezvous ) -> value
( select rendezvous ... ) -> value
Sync synchronizes the current thread on rendezvous rendezvous , returning the value it yields .
Select synchronizes on the choice of its argument ; ( select r 1 ... r n ) is semantically equivalent to ( sync ( choose select r 1 ... r n ) ) , but may be implemented more efficiently .
( These are the same as the CML functions sync and select . )
The rendezvous - channels structure contains abstractions for bidirectional , synchronous channels for communicating between two threads .
( make - channel ) -> channel
( channel ? x ) -> boolean
Make - channel creates a new synchronous channel .
( This is the same as the CML channel function . )
Channel ? is the predicate for synchronous channels .
( send - rv channel value ) -> rendezvous
( send channel value )
Send - rv creates a rendezvous that , upon synchronization , sends message value on the synchronous channel channel .
The synchronization suceeds only when another thread attempts to receive a message from channel .
( This is the same as the CML send Evt function . )
Send directly sends a message value on channel channel ; ( send c v ) is equivalent to ( sync ( send - rv c v ) ) . ( Send is the same as the CML send function . )
( receive - rv channel ) -> rendezvous
( receive channel )
Receive - rv creates a rendezvous which , upon synchronization , receives a message on channel channel .
( This is the same as the CML recEvt function . )
Receive directly receives a message on channel channel ; ( receive c v ) is equivalent to ( sync ( receive - rv c v ) ) .
( Receive is the same as the CML recv function . )
Two structures contain abstractions for synchronous variables : the rendezvous - placeholders structure for so - called placeholders ( write - once variables ) , and the rendezvous - jars structure for jars ( which allow multiple updates . )
Placeholders are write - once variables .
The placeholders implemented by the rendezvous - placeholders structure offer equivalent functionality to the placeholders implemented by the placeholders structure ( see Section 7.6.2 ) , but additionally allow converting a placeholder into a rendezvous .
Note , however , that placeholders from placeholders are different from and not interchangable with placeholders from rendezvous - placeholders .
( make - placeholder ) -> placeholder
( make - placeholder id ) -> placeholder
( placeholder ? x ) -> boolean
Make - placeholder creates an empty placeholder .
( The optional id argument is only for debugging purposes ; the discloser for placeholders prints it out if present . )
( This is the same as the CML iVar function . )
Placeholder ? is the predicate for placeholders .
( placeholder - set ! placeholder value )
Placeholder - set ! places a value into a placeholder .
Doing this more than once signals an error .
( This is the same as the CML iPut function . )
( placeholder - value - rv placeholder ) -> rendezvous
( placeholder - value placeholder ) -> value
Placeholder - value extracts the value from the placeholder and returns it .
If the placeholder is empty , it blocks the current thread until it becomes full .
( This is the same as the CML iGet function . )
Placeholder - value - rv creates a rendezvous that will , upon synchronization , extrasct the value from the placeholder and yield it as a result .
( This is the same as the CML iGetEvt function . )
A jar is a synchronous variable which can have two states : full and empty .
It becomes full when a value it put into it ; putting a value into a full jar is an error .
Conversely , it becomes empty when a value is taken out of it .
Trying to take a value out of an empty jar blocks until it becomes full .
( Jars are similar to ID - 90 M- structures . )
Jars live in the rendezvous - jars structure .
( make - jar ) -> jar
( make - jar id ) -> jar
( jar ? x ) -> boolean
Make - jar creates an empty jar .
( The optional id argument is only for debugging purposes ; the discloser for jars prints it out if present . )
( This is the same as the CML mVar function . )
Jar ? is the predicate for jars .
( jar - put ! jar value )
Jar-put !
places a value into a jar if it is empty .
Applying jar - put ! to a full jar is an error .
( This is the same as the CML mPut function . )
( jar - take - rv placeholder ) -> rendezvous
( jar - take placeholder ) -> value
Jar - take takes a value from a full jar , emptying it in the process .
If the jar is empty , jar - take blocks until it becomes full .
( This is the same as the CML mTake function . )
Jar - take - rv creates a rendezvous that , upon synchronization , will extract the value from a jar and empty it in the process .
( This is the same as the CML mTake Evt function . )
The rendezvous - time structure allows creating rendezvous for alarms and timeouts :
( after - time - rv milliseconds ) -> rendezvous
( at - real - time - rv time ) -> rendezvous
After - time - rv creates a rendezvous that becomes enabled at time interval milliseconds after synchronization .
( Actually , milliseconds is a minimum waiting time ; the actual delay may be longer . )
( This is the same as the CML timeOutEvt function . )
At - real - time - rv creates a rendezvous that becomes enabled at an absolute time specified by time ; this absolute time is specified in the same way as the return value real - time from the time structure .
( This is the same as the CML atTimeEvt function . )
The following table lists the Scheme names that correspond to particular CML names .
CML name Scheme name rendezvous never never - rv always
Evt always - rv choose choose wrap wrap guard guard withNack with - nack sync sync select select rendezvous - channels channel make - channel sendEvt send - rv send send recEvt receive - rv rec receive rendezvous - placeholders iVar make - placeholder iPut placeholder - set !

If you 've worked as a C++ programmer for long enough , I 'm sure you have plenty of stories about operator overloading abuse .
Today , Jake Wyland shares the worst abuse he 's seen to date ...
" The company I used to work for went on a hiring binge to staff up for a big project .
The work required a lot of domain experience working with a gargantuan plug - in API .
To make learning the API easier , we decided to have weekly code excursions where people would come in and present the code they were working on and show off how to use the portion of the API they were working on .
During one such code excursion , I saw the following code scroll by in the image projected on the wall :
bool fixNodes ( State &s ) { CFNode * firstPtr = s.getFirstNode( ) ; bool done = false ; while ( ! done ) { for ( CFNode * nptr = * first Ptr + 1 ; * nptr + 1 ; nptr = * nptr + 1 ) { //
Some code ... } // ... more code } }
" Knowing that almost every pointer value plus 1 will result in a non-NULL pointer , I said that the code contained a bug because the for - loop would never terminate .
" Undaunted , the young coder doing the presentation said that is surely would terminate as he had overloaded the ' +' operator for CFNode .
He then showed us the overload in the header file :
class CFNode { Point3D nodePoint ; CFNode * prevNode ; CFNode * nextNode ; public : CFNode * getNextNode ( ) ; CFNode * getPrevNode ( ) ; CFNode * firstNode ( ) ; CFNode * lastNode ( ) ; //
More fields deleted ~ CFNode ( ) ; CFNode ( Point3D point , CFNode * const prevNode ) ; // Returns the same thing as getNextNode ( ) CFNode * operator +( const int rhs ) ; void takeAction ( ) ; //
More methods deleted };
" After that presentation , operator overloading was banned .

Since when do local citizens have “ no authority ” to criticize the country ’s leadership ?
A group of residents is lobbying the Nyack village board to join dozens of municipalities around the nation and adopt a resolution calling on Congress to impeach President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney .
Group members say the administration lied about pre-war intelligence in Iraq , violated the Geneva Conventions and U.S. laws on prisoner torture , and violated citizens ’ constitutional rights in various ways .
Nyack Republican Party Chairman Joseph Brady - Amoon has said the village board has no authority on the matter .
We beg to differ .
While a village board ca n’t institute impeachment hearings , it most certainly can call for such action .
The question is whether it should bother , not whether it can . ( More )
THE PENTAGON'S CLAIM that its overseas soldiers were sapping too much bandwidth has been contested by the founders of Youtube .
Military bigwigs banned Youtube claiming soldiers were blocking its network by watching raucous clips of people falling over and cats mugging children .
But Youtube founder , chief executive Chad Hurley , said the Pentagon only thought it would be a bandwidth issue it could not be certain .
He pointed out that the US military created the Internet so it should know a bit more about the problem than that .
Hurley , chief technology officer Steve Chen and Youtube spokeswoman Julie Supan said that the company is trying to work with the Pentagon in hopes the military will reverse course or at least partially repeal the ban .
They were especially puzzled by the block because it came just days after the military launched its own channel on the web site offering what it calls a " boots - on - the - ground " perspective of scenes of combat , they said .

July 11 , 2007 , will mark the third - annual global " Fair Use Day , " but chances are this is the first you 've heard of it .
Started back in 2005 , " Fair Use Day " ( project website ) was created by Eric Clifford to raise awareness of the shifting balance in copyright laws around the world .
Clifford acknowledges that Fair Use Day has n't become the biggest advocacy day in existence , but perhaps the third time is the charm , as the Pirate Party of the United States has announced its support of the effort to raise awareness about copyright issues .
As Clifford says , " Garbage had a day , taxes have a day , why not fair use ? "
As we have chronicled here on Ars for years , copyright laws are increasingly being rewritten , modified , or tossed out in favor of new laws which grant copyright holders extremely broad powers over how you use content you pay for .
Both Clifford and the Pirate Party hope that July 11 will serve as a day to remind users across the globe that fair copyright laws are essential to culture .
" It is important the people are aware of what they can legally do with regards to copyrighted material , " said Pirate Party US spokesman Andrew Norton .
" Very often people believe that a use of copyrighted material that would normally fall into fair use is an infringement of copyright .
It is a belief that copyright holders seek to enforce , either through frivolous litigation , intimidation , or legal and political maneuvering to legally restrict what can be considered fair use .
This is especially true when it comes to critical reviews , or parodies . "
The Pirate Party calls on citizens to exercise their fair use rights tomorrow , and to contact their representatives to voice support for the Freedom and Innovation Revitalizing U.S. Entrepreneurship Act of 2007 ( FAIR USE Act of 2007 ) .
Our own examination of the FAIR USE Act of 2007 raised serious doubts about the Act 's power to accomplish any true revamp of fair use in the United States , or any of the other major issues brought about by the DMCA .
In our view , the proposed legislation is oriented towards making the lives of consumer electronics manufacturers easier , but without any payoff for end users .
When asked about their support of the FAIR USE Act , Andrew Norton told Ars that " any step in the right direction is better than what we have now .
A bigger step would be better , but any movement in the right direction is a movement that should be supported , " he said .
As for how to make the best of Fair Use Day , founder Eric Clifford told Ars that users should " enjoy fair use in any way that you can , " but he added that " the problem is that the legal ways to exercise fair use is diminishing . "
Sir Peter Williams , who was appointed last week to review the teaching of maths in primary schools , said that the A - level gold standard had been slipping for a ' long period of time ' .
The distinguished academic and businessman , who chairs the Advisory Committee on Mathematics Education ( ACME ) , said : ' Over 20 or 30 years , I do n't think there is any doubt whatsoever that absolute A - level standards have fallen .
They have edged south , continuously over a long period of time .
I think all university academics and a good proportion of sixth - form teachers would agree with my assertion . '
The idea that A - levels are getting easier is a widely held perception , he added , but in his own areas of physics and maths it is also a ' testable fact ' .
He said that he did not , however , think the decline ' disastrous ' .
Looking at maths exam papers , Williams , who is Chancellor of Leicester University , found that A - level students faced equations today that required less depth of knowledge and understanding than in the past .
As a result , universities had been forced to adapt , he argued .
Some three - year courses were now stretched over four , while in physics , for example , thermodynamics was being taught in the second year rather than the first because students needed a year following simpler studies .
Williams is a leading figure in the education world , having held a string of illustrious positions .
He is currently chair of the internationally respected National Physical Laboratory and has also been a Master of St Catherine 's College , Oxford , and president of the Institute of Physics .
His comments are significant because the Government has always maintained that improving exam results are due to better teaching and pupil effort rather than dumbing down .
' There is a general misconception that the A - level has become impossible to fail and that A grades are handed out like sweets .
This , like many myths surrounding the exams , is nonsense ' , then Schools Minister Jim Knight said last year .
In 2005 the Headmasters ' and Headmistresses ' Conference , which represents more than 200 independent schools , said it was considering dropping A - levels altogether .
A study carried out at the CEM centre , an education research unit at Durham University , has recently suggested a dramatic decline in maths standards .
For nearly two decades up to 50,000 pupils a year have taken the same ability test before facing A - levels .
Researchers found that , in most subjects , pupils of the same ability achieved two grades higher in their A - levels in 2006 than in 1988 jumping to three grades in maths .
In recent years senior figures in universities and in business have complained that they are struggling to differentiate between the good students and the very best .
Williams said that A - levels needed ' fine tuning ' with optional , tougher questions , rather than being completely changed .
He welcomed last week 's announcement that A - level students achieving more than 90 per cent would be rewarded with the new ' A - star ' super - grade , and there would be ' Oxbridge style ' questions added to exams .
He also commended the Further Maths Network for successfully persuading more of the brightest pupils to take higher - level maths exams .
' I believe that , with some more stretch and challenge inserted into it , the A - level is still the right vehicle , ' said Williams .
' We should not decry the fact that increasingly large cohorts of young 18 - year - old men and women attain higher levels in their graduation qualification coming out of secondary education .
That is something we should applaud .
It is the universities ' job , then , to somehow select the most appropriate pupils . '
Robert Coe , director of secondary projects at the CEM centre , said one of the things driving down standards was competition between exam boards .
' I agree with everything Peter Williams is saying , ' he said .
' With a slight rider - is this a bad thing ?
Yes , A - levels have got easier , but for the majority of people who take them that means they are better suited to the type of performance they are going to achieve . '
Speaking about mathematics in particular , Ken Boston , chief executive of the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority , said there would be extra ' stretch ' to help pick out the best performing students and ' strengthen the A - level ' .
Ministers were accused of ' dumbing down '
GCSEs last week after it emerged that up to half of the marks in GCSE English would be awarded for skills as basic as punctuation .
Pupils will also face multiple choice questions as part of the exam .
For more than a century , investigators have identified suspects by looking at the unique shapes of their fingerprints , carefully noting such details as where the lines end , bifurcate , and diverge .
But the few micrograms of sweat and dirt left behind in a fingerprint contain more than a physical pattern :
The chemicals in the print are clues themselves , and a new technique shows promise for using this information to make more accurate fingerprint identifications .
The technique is a sort of chemical photography that takes a snapshot of the traces of substances on a person 's hands when she leaves a print — everything from the mundane , like caffeine spilled on a coffee - drinker ’s fingers , to incriminating particles of explosives .
" This is potentially a very valuable procedure for certain cases , " says Lawrence Kobilinsky , chair of the science department at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice .
" I think it 's a significant advancement . "
In a paper published August 1 in the journal Analytical Chemistry , Sergei Kazarian , Camilla Ricci , and Steve Bleay described the method in which they used infrared spectroscopy to analyze the content of fingerprints .
Organic molecules absorb particular frequencies of infrared radiation , and spectroscopy detects these frequencies so that researchers can identify the chemicals in a sample .
This technology is sometimes used in crime labs to determine the origin of paint chips or to analyze ink in potential forgeries , but until now it could not be applied to fingerprints left at crime scenes .
In using infrared spectroscopy to analyze fingerprints , Kazarian , a physical chemist at Imperial College London , relied on a gelatin tape that is sometimes used to lift footprints , fingerprints , and other evidence .
This particular tape makes the infrared analysis possible because its own chemical composition does n't interfere with the infrared analysis of the fingerprint .
For the study , Kazarian and his colleagues lifted prints from such surfaces as a door handle and a computer screen .
Prints left on porous surfaces , like newspaper , are difficult to analyze because the pores disrupt the pattern .
By employing an imaging technology initially developed for the military , Kazarian 's technique also has the unique ability to differentiate the content of the fingerprint at different depths .
He says this could help an investigator distinguish between chemicals in a print and those already on a surface before it was touched .
This sort of contamination is always a concern at crime scenes , says Kobilinsky .
The combination Kazarian has put together could bolster criminal identifications made from the physical pattern of a fingerprint , a technique that is not infallible , as is often portrayed .
In a particularly high - profile mistake , the FBI erroneously matched a print from a plastic bag at the Madrid train bombings to a lawyer from Portland , Oregon , who was then unfairly jailed for two weeks .
The FBI said his prints bore an “ unusual similarity ” to those of the guilty party .
Kazarianis n't the only researcher working to glean more than the standard patterns from fingerprints .
Crime - scene investigators can already gather DNA from skin cells sloughed off into fingerprints .
Now a team of British researchers , led by chemist David Russell of the University of East Anglia , has found a way to visualize the chemicals that show up in sweat after the body has processed a drug .
Their research focused on a chemical produced by the breakdown of nicotine in the body , which the researchers made visible by tagging it with fluorescent antibodies .
The researchers are currently working to make their technique more practical for law - enforcement use .
Kazarian ’s method for revealing contaminants probably wo n’t show up in crime labs anytime soon , says Kobilinsky .
Not only is further research needed but the technique must pass admissibility standards in the courtroom .
Regular aspirin use may significantly reduce the incidence of both cancer and heart disease , according to a large new study , but other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs , or Nsaids , have no effect .
Researchers studied 22,507 postmenopausal women , following them for 10 years .
All reported their aspirin and Nsaid use as part of a detailed physical and behavioral health questionnaire .
None of the women had cancer or heart disease at the start of the study .

After controlling for age , exercise , diet and other factors , those who used aspirin had a 16 percent reduced risk of getting cancer , and a 13 percent reduced risk of cancer death , compared with women who never used it .
Aspirin use was also associated with a 25 percent reduced risk of dying from coronary artery disease and an 18 percent reduction in all - cause mortality compared with those who never took aspirin .
But use of other Nsaids like ibuprofen ( Advil and other brands ) and naproxen ( Aleve and others ) had no effect , and there was no significantly reduced risk among aspirin users who were currently smoking .
The study was published in the June issue of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute .
White House officials fear that the last pillars of political support among Senate Republicans for President Bush ’s Iraq strategy are collapsing around them , according to several administration officials and outsiders they are consulting .
They say that inside the administration , debate is intensifying over whether Mr. Bush should try to prevent more defections by announcing his intention to begin a gradual withdrawal of American troops from the high - casualty neighborhoods of Baghdad and other cities .
Mr. Bush and his aides once thought they could wait to begin those discussions until after Sept. 15 , when the top field commander and the new American ambassador to Baghdad are scheduled to report on the effectiveness of the troop increase that the president announced in January .
But suddenly , some of Mr. Bush ’s aides acknowledge , it appears that forces are combining against him just as the Senate prepares this week to begin what promises to be a contentious debate on the war ’s future and financing .
Four more Republican senators have recently declared that they can no longer support Mr. Bush ’s strategy , including senior lawmakers who until now had expressed their doubts only privately .
As a result , some aides are now telling Mr. Bush that if he wants to forestall more defections , it would be wiser to announce plans for a far more narrowly defined mission for American troops that would allow for a staged pullback , a strategy that he rejected in December as a prescription for defeat when it was proposed by the bipartisan Iraq Study Group .
“ When you count up the votes that we ’ve lost and the votes we ’re likely to lose over the next few weeks , it looks pretty grim , ” said one senior official , who , like others involved in the discussions , would not speak on the record about internal White House deliberations .
George who ?
Road Engine Patent No. 549,160 Inventor : George Selden , Rochester , New York Filed : May 8 , 1879
Issued : November 5 , 1895
This patent represents a forgotten episode in the history of the automobile .
The question of who invented the motor car is an open one - Ford , Daimler , Duryea , Cugnot all lay claim to the title of " Father of the Automobile " - but you will seldom hear the name of patent attorney George Selden of Rochester , New York , mentioned .
Selden applied for a patent on the " Road Engine " in 1879 .
Sensing that the time was not right for a horseless carriage , he delayed issuance of the patent until 1895 , by which time a young automobile industry was growing in the USA .
Although he had no interest in manufacturing his invention , he was very interested in benefiting from it .
Under threat of suit , almost all of the manufacturers took out licenses from Selden , or from the Association of Licensed Automobile Manufacturers ( ALAM ) , to whom he sold the patent .
In fact , on most cars built during the next ten or fifteen years you will find a small brass plaque reading " Manufactured under Selden Patent . "
An ad for the 1910 Dorris
with a Selden license notice
There was one notorious holdout , a young manufacturer named Henry Ford .
Selden sued Ford ( among others ) , and the lawsuit dragged on for nearly eight years .
During that time the ALAM took out magazine ads , threatening to sue anyone who bought an unlicensed car - some advised people " do n't buy a lawsuit with your new automobile . "
Here 's a sample ALAM advertisement , claiming that the Selden patent was so broad that any practical car must infringe :
Ford countered with his own ads , disputing the patent , and offering to indemnify anyone who was actually sued by the ALAM :
Although the Selden patent was upheld at the trial level , Ford appealed .
Finally , only one year before it was to expire , the appeals court declared the Selden patent to be invalid , except as to cars powered by the Brayton - type external - compression two - stroke engine described in the patent , which Selden 's own expert testified at trial was not actually used by anyone making cars at that time .
It was reported that at one point during the trial , an automobile race was being organized outside the windows of the courthouse .
Ford 's lawyer looked out the window and said to the judge , " your honor , I see a Winton , and a Duryea , and many Fords out there - but not one single Selden ! "
He was right , of course - Selden was a patent attorney , not a car builder .
In the course of the suit Selden did build a car according to the patent ( for the first time , apparently ) , and it managed to stagger along under its own power for a short while before expiring .
Selden died at age 78 on January 17 , 1922 .
He is buried in Rochester , New York .

the Selden Patent ( PDF format )
A series of e-mails from Doug Harword , a reader of this site , offers an insight into the Selden licensing program .
This page originally said that Henry Ford was the only manufacturer who would n't take a license - that is n't so , as he points out :
I was just doing a little research on the Selden patent and came across a bit about it on your website .
Actually , there were dozens of manufacturers who did not get licenses .
Selden sued some of them and won , but still , many refused or simply did n't bother .
For details , you can compare the list in Selden 's ads with other information contained in old Horseless Age magazines .
Ford won applause for openly defying Selden and advertising his defiance in such a manner that Selden could n't ignore the threat .
( Ford was obviously itching to for a fight ) .
I have been grazing through a collection of horseless age magazines from the turn of the century ... have been finding more and more accounts of various Selden suits .
There was a French concern ... Panhard ... which was sued at the same time as Ford , and the two companies apparently joined hands ( or at least discovery motions , since there is a reference to Ford 's asking for a delay in the trial so that it could translate some documents ) .
Before Ford egged on the Selden people , Winton , which was a fine manufacturer , set a couple speed records etc. , was sued by Selden .
Winton did n't have a lot of money , and found several manufacturers to join .
The horseless age urged everyone to , but they did n't ... this was in about 1903 , and despite Winton making the same basic arguments
Ford made later , Winton lost and grudgingly coughed up the licensing fee .
Selden not only fought unlicensed gasoline cars , but set up a little subsidiary to go after the electrics .
( Save n't seen anything about steam yet , but it was bound to have come up ) .
For a brief period , when Winton was being sued , an alternative association was established in order to try to break the Selden extortion .
I suspect somewhere , buried in all the cases of lawsuits , motions , transcripts , etc. , sitting next to the ark of the covenant in some federally - owned cave , there is an incredible book .
Note from Mike Brown , webmaster :
If Selden was going after electric and steam manufacturers , the effort would have been doomed to failure , at least if it was this patent they were trying to enforce .
All of the claims in the Selden patent required a " liquid hydrocarbon gas- engine of the compression type " which would specifically exclude electric or steam autos .
( That is , except for claim 4 which said " a hydrocarbon engine applied to the driving axle and having flexible valve or clutch connections located within the steering mechanism , substantially as described " , which does n't seem to describe any car I 've ever heard of ) .
The first suit Selden filed , according to the Horseless Age , was filed in 1900 .
The prime defendant was the Winton Motor Carriage Company .
( There were several others . )
Alexander Winton built bikes in Cleveland , went bust in the bust of 1893 , and after a year or two of playing with gasoline engines in his basement - not a good idea - scraped up enough money to build a car , then another .
Had a flair for publicity and made the first serious cross - a - chunk - of - the - country trips in 1898 , going from Cleveland to New York on roads that were n't in 11 days .
The Smithsonian has that first car .
It was also the first American car to be delivered to an American customer .
Winton did n't plan it , but he and the car arrived on April Fool 's Day .
A Winton was also the first car to be driven across the North American continent .
That was in 1903 .
Winton later build three " bullet " racers , the second of which , a 17 - litre straight - eight , went a mile in less than 84 seconds in 1904 .
The Winton company made and sold cars up until 1924 , the most popular being the Winton Six .
All of the information about Winton comes from Ralph Stein 's sadly out - of - print " The American Automobile . "
As does a bit about the Selden Patent .
According to Stein , in 1897 a group of speculators and " street - railway magnates " bought the patent .
The same crew owned an electric cab company dubbed " the lead cab trust , " in New York .
In 1900 , when the suit was brought , the electric cab company was operating about 2,000 electric cabs that it built .
The cabs were n't any good .
Neither were the cabbies .
The patent was a much more reliable source of money .
The suit against Winton was filed in US District Court in Buffalo .
A " Hydro- carbon association , " was formed by manufacturers to fight it .
They hired the law firm of Kenyon and Kenyon , who filed a demurrer , lost that skirmish , then went on to lose the battle .
But the administrators of the patent , dba the Association of Licensed Automobile Manufacturers , were remarkably inept .
For instance , the same magazine ( from 1903 ) that carries a list of all 24 manufacturers that had been granted licenses in the wake of the success of the suit� including Winton , Pierce , Packard , Knox , Cadillac , Oldsmobile , Peerless , Haynes - Apperson , and Searchmont , carries advertisements for ten manufacturers who had n't .
That list includes the Crestmont , Jones - Corbin , Crestmobile ( you supply the brushes ) , Duryea , Clarkmobile , the American Gasoline Automobile , the Overland , the Brazier , the Covert Chainless , the Elmore , the Stearns .
Some of the names have been completely forgotten .
But even the most forgotten of the companies were around long enough to raise some money , build something , and advertise it in a national magazine .
On the other hand , the Selden enforcers faced a challenge not unlike those who try to enforce the music anti-piracy laws .
In the first decade of the century , there were just too many people who knew , or thought they knew , or learned after a few tries how to build a car .
Blacksmiths , machinists , sewing - machine manufacturers , carriage makers , bicycle makers , farmers , gun makers ... the list could go on forever .
We really were " a nation of tinkerers , " and all but the grouchiest of tinkerers could n't help being smitten with the machine .
And most of them did n't see the foggiest reason to ask for permission .

Infants were anxious and fearful
Latest UK research by Professor Vivette Glover of Imperial College London found stress caused by rows with or violence by a partner was particularly damaging .
Experts blame high levels of the stress hormone cortisol crossing the placenta .
Professor Glover found high cortisol in the amniotic fluid bathing the baby in the womb tallied with the damage .
The babies exposed to the highest levels of cortisol during their development had lower IQs at 18 months .
The same infants were also more likely to be anxious and fearful , she told a conference of the Royal College of Psychiatrists .
About a million children in the UK have neurodevelopmental problems - ADHD , cognitive delay , anxiety and so on .
About 15 % of this might be due to antenatal stress .
Professor Glover
Professor Glover said : " We looked at what stresses were most harmful .
" We found that if the woman had a partner who was being emotionally cruel to them while they were pregnant it had a really significant effect on their baby 's future development .
" It really shows that the partner has a big role to play . "
The work suggests maternal stress is a true risk factor in its own right , although Professor Glover acknowledged that genetic factors and home environment after birth would also have an impact on a child 's development .
She said most babies grow up unaffected by a stressful womb environment .
Big impact
However , she said maternal stress increases the risk of a range of problems - it doubles the risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) , for example .
" We should be screening women in pregnancy for stress and intervening .
" It has big public health implications .
About a million children in the UK have neurodevelopmental problems - ADHD , cognitive delay , anxiety and so on .
" About 15 % of this might be due to antenatal stress .
" If we could reduce the mother 's stress while she is pregnant we might be able to potentially improve the outcome for about 150,000 children , " Professor Glover said .
Dr David Coghill , senior lecturer and honorary consultant in child and adolescent psychiatry at the University of Dundee , said pregnant women should not be " unduly concerned " by the findings .
He explained : " We are talking about here is extremely high levels of stress and distress .
" Stress is a normal factor of daily life and is something that the body copes with very well .
" However , it is a warning for people who may be facing more severe stresses and for those around women who are pregnant that increasing stress levels above what is normal for a person is not a good thing to do at that time . "
Professor Glover has submitted her work for publication in a peer - reviewed journal .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Wall Street ’s push for record profits is ruining careers , tearing apart families and keeping drug dealers busy , mental health experts say .
Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange , April , 25 , 2007 .
While record bonuses make some Wall Street bankers feel invincible , others become emotional wrecks from pressure to perform and some hit rock bottom , experts say .

While record bonuses make some Wall Street bankers feel invincible , others become emotional wrecks from pressure to perform and some hit rock bottom , experts say .
Harris Stratyner , a psychologist at Caron ’s New York Recovery Center , said some executives he treats are experimenting with cocaine , opiate - based drugs , Ecstasy and marijuana , as well as abusing alcohol .
“ It ’s like they ’re chasing a dream .
Even when they make tremendous profits , they ’re still worried , ” he said .
Alden Cass , a clinical psychologist who counsels Wall Streeters with drug addictions , said drug abuse and high anxiety are undercurrents to the current boom .
“ When things are really good , they feel invulnerable , ” Cass said .
“ That can lead to adultery , substance abuse , problems with the law . ”
When it comes to profits , things are really good .
Six of the largest U.S. investment banks -- Goldman Sachs , Lehman Brothers , Citigroup , JPMorgan & Chase Co. , Morgan Stanley and Bear Stearns -- combined for $ 17.6 billion in first - quarter profit this year .
That ’s after shelling out $ 28.8 billion for pay and benefits , financial statements show .
Those profit and pay figures are more than double those seen in the first quarter of 2000 , the last days before the dot - com bubble burst .
New York ’s comptroller estimates Wall Street ’s 2006 bonuses will generate $ 1.6 billion in state tax revenue .
COCAINE AND HILLBILLY HEROIN
“ To my knowledge , we have not seen an uptick in drug use , ” Morgan Stanley spokeswoman Jean Marie McFadden said .
The other five firms declined comment or did not return telephone calls .
But Cass said opiate abuse among his clients is rising and they openly talk about being hooked on prescription drugs like OxyContin , known as hillbilly heroin .
“ That ’s what has changed from previous booms on Wall Street , ” he said .
Cass and Stratyner said their clients sometimes conceal their habits by taking prescription drugs they get for back surgery or sports - related injuries .
The Internet has also expanded the black market for drugs .
Wall Street professionals in their 20s use Ritalin and Adderall , prescription drugs used to treat attention - deficit disorder and hyperactivity , to enhance their performance as they grind out 100 - hour weeks , Cass said .
Big bonuses and the need to blow off steam have helped invigorate demand for cocaine in Manhattan , according to two junior bankers who did not want to be named .
Juan Rodriguez , convicted of selling drugs to investment bankers and other professionals , said his clients never complained about the price of cocaine , even as it escalated .
“ My customers were all business individuals , ” Rodriguez said , citing Morgan Stanley bankers as among his clients .
Morgan Stanley said the company has a strong policy against substance abuse and uses random drug testing .
PASSING THE TEST
One hiring manager at a major New York bank said new staff must take a urine test , which is typical for the industry .
But he said new hires can choose when to schedule the test during a 45 - day period before their start date .
“ Our drug test is not so much a test of whether you actually take drugs as it is an intelligence test to see if you can figure out how long it takes to get traces of the drug out of your system , ” said the manager , who asked not to be named .
The hiring manager said his employer also had a policy of random drug tests for employees but that in several years he had never encountered anyone subjected to such a test .
Drugs are not the only reason for executive meltdowns .
Overwhelming pressure and anxiety to meet profit goals undid star trader David Becker as he rose the Citigroup ladder .
Nine months after becoming global commodities chief , Becker found himself on the fast track to prison .
The largest U.S. bank discovered in 2004 that Becker and others conspired to overstate profits by $ 20 million .
Becker , 41 , pleaded guilty and is serving a 15 - month sentence in federal prison .
He declined to comment .
Before he committed his crime , he sought psychiatric help to deal with the pressure of balancing family and career , court papers show .
A metaphor for his life was a painting he owned depicting a man being pulled by all four limbs , Becker ’s psychiatrist , Dr. Barbara Deutsch , wrote to the judge in the case .
“ He felt enormous pressure to make the group ’s budget at all costs , ” Deutsch wrote .
“ He felt identified with this tortured man . ”
In Typing Trumps Pointing , I extolled the virtues of the full - text search included in Vista 's new Start Menu .
As many commenters pointed out , the feature itself is nothing new :
I love keyboard searching , but basically you say you are installing Vista , an entire operating system , just so you do n't have to install Colibri , SlickRun , Launchy , or one of the many other similar and fully functional tools that give similar results for 10 % cost and 1 % hassle .
It 's true .
There are dozens of third - party solutions that deliver very similar interactive full - text search UI experiences .
But there 's one key difference between those solutions and the one in Vista : I have to install them .
You may argue that , in the near term , I also have to install Vista .
Fair enough .
But over the next five years , millions of users will buy computers with Vista pre-installed .
And they 'll immediately benefit from the built - in , default full - text search UI that 's accessible right out of the box with a single press of the Windows key .
There 's nothing to install .
There 's nothing to configure .
It just works .
That 's the power of defaults .
Defaults are arguably the most important design decisions you 'll ever make as a software developer .
Choose good defaults , and users will sing the praises of your software and how easy it is to use .
Choose poor defaults , and you 'll face down user angst over configuration , and probably a host of tech support calls as well .
Furthermore , once a default becomes a well - accepted standard , it 's an expectation .
Other vendors will be peer pressured into at least matching that default .
And to truly succeed , they 'll have to come up with an even better default .
Defaults are how the software industry evolves .
It also highlights a problem with the Linux and Unix models ; because they 're infinitely configurable , it 's impossible to tell what you 're comparing the next version of the software with .
There 's no baseline , no standard , only the giant cop -out of endless user configuration .
Defaults are n't just important to software developers ; they 're incredibly important to UI designers , too .
Jakob Nielsen elaborates :
Users rely on defaults in many other areas of user interface design .
For example , they rarely utilize fancy customization features , making it important to optimize the default user experience , since that 's what most users stick to .
In forms and applications , pre-populate fields with the most common value if you can determine it in advance .
For example , on the registration form for my usability conference , if people register for an event in Boston , the country field will say " United States " by default , but if they register for London , it will say " United Kingdom . "
Obviously , many people come from other countries , and they 'll have to change this entry to specify their own country -- but they'd have to specify it anyway if we 'd left it blank .
By choosing the most common country as the default , we save many users that bit of work .
Defaults make two essential contributions to usability :
By showing a representative value , they serve as just - in - time instructions to help users understand how to complete a field .
By showing a frequent value , they help users understand the commonly expected response , as opposed to more atypical ones .
You can use this knowledge for sales purposes -- for example , by pre-selecting the one - year option in a subscription interface that also offers monthly payments .
But , if you consistently pick the most expensive option as the default , you 'll lose credibility , so do n't overdo it .
By educating and guiding users , default values help reduce errors .
It 's therefore important to select helpful defaults , rather than those based on the first letter of the alphabet or whatever the first option on your original list happened to be .
Defaults can also affect your company 's bottom line .
That 's why Google , Microsoft , and Yahoo are willing to pay millions of dollars to influence the defaults on a user 's desktop .
For most users , the default value is the only value .
Your choice of default values will have a profound impact on how your application is used .
You should agonize over every default in your software .
If you are n't , you 're doing the user , and yourself , a disservice .
One of the most important trends in personal technology over the past few years has been the evolution of the humble cellphone into a true handheld computer , a device able to replicate many of the key functions of a laptop .
But most of these " smart phones " have had lousy software , confusing user interfaces and clumsy music , video and photo playback .
And their designers have struggled to balance screen size , keyboard usability and battery life .
Now , Apple Inc. , whose digital products are hailed for their design and innovation , is jumping into this smart - phone market with the iPhone , which goes on sale in a few days after months of the most frenzied hype and speculation we have ever seen for a single technology product .
Even though the phone 's minimum price is a hefty $ 499 , people are already lining up outside Apple stores to be among the first to snag one when they go on sale Friday evening .
We have been testing the iPhone for two weeks , in multiple usage scenarios , in cities across the country .
Our verdict is that , despite some flaws and feature omissions , the iPhone is , on balance , a beautiful and breakthrough handheld computer .
Its software , especially , sets a new bar for the smart - phone industry , and its clever finger - touch interface , which dispenses with a stylus and most buttons , works well , though it sometimes adds steps to common functions .
The Apple phone combines intelligent voice calling , and a full - blown iPod , with a beautiful new interface for music and video playback .
It offers the best Web browser we have seen on a smart phone , and robust email software .
And it synchronizes easily and well with both Windows and Macintosh computers using Apple 's iTunes software .
Ed note :
This story was originally published in the November 2006 issue .
Fate can take strange forms , and so perhaps it does not seem unusual that Captain Charles Moore found his life 's purpose in a nightmare .
Unfortunately , he was awake at the time , and 800 miles north of Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean .
It happened on August 3 , 1997 , a lovely day , at least in the beginning : Sunny .
Little wind .
Water the color of sapphires .
Moore and the crew of Alguita , his 50 - foot aluminum - hulled catamaran , sliced through the sea .
Returning to Southern California from Hawaii after a sailing race , Moore had altered Alguita 's course , veering slightly north .
He had the time and the curiosity to try a new route , one that would lead the vessel through the eastern corner of a 10 - million - square - mile oval known as the North Pacific subtropical gyre .
This was an odd stretch of ocean , a place most boats purposely avoided .
For one thing , it was becalmed .
" The doldrums , " sailors called it , and they steered clear .
So did the ocean 's top predators : the tuna , sharks , and other large fish that required livelier waters , flush with prey .
The gyre was more like a desert–a slow , deep , clockwise - swirling vortex of air and water caused by a mountain of high - pressure air that lingered above it .
The area 's reputation did n't deter Moore .
He had grown up in Long Beach , 40 miles south of L.A. , with the Pacific literally in his front yard , and he possessed an impressive aquatic résumé : deckhand , able seaman , sailor , scuba diver , surfer , and finally captain .
Moore had spent countless hours in the ocean , fascinated by its vast trove of secrets and terrors .
He 'd seen a lot of things out there , things that were glorious and grand ; things that were ferocious and humbling .
But he had never seen anything nearly as chilling as what lay ahead of him in the gyre .
It began with a line of plastic bags ghosting the surface , followed by an ugly tangle of junk : nets and ropes and bottles , motor - oil jugs and cracked bath toys , a mangled tarp .
Tires .
A traffic cone .
Moore could not believe his eyes .
Out here in this desolate place , the water was a stew of plastic crap .
It was as though someone had taken the pristine seascape of his youth and swapped it for a landfill .
How did all the plastic end up here ?
How did this trash tsunami begin ?
What did it mean ?
If the questions seemed overwhelming , Moore would soon learn that the answers were even more so , and that his discovery had dire implications for human–and planetary –health .
As Alguita glided through the area that scientists now refer to as the " Eastern Garbage Patch , " Moore realized that the trail of plastic went on for hundreds of miles .
Depressed and stunned , he sailed for a week through bobbing , toxic debris trapped in a purgatory of circling currents .
To his horror , he had stumbled across the 21st - century Leviathan .
It had no head , no tail .
Just an endless body .
" Everybody 's plastic , but I love plastic .
I want to be plastic . "
This Andy Warhol quote is emblazoned on a six - foot - long magenta and yellow banner that hangs –with extreme irony –in the solar - powered workshop in Moore 's Long Beach home .
The workshop is surrounded by a crazy Eden of trees , bushes , flowers , fruits , and vegetables , ranging from the prosaic ( tomatoes ) to the exotic ( cherimoyas , guavas , chocolate persimmons , white figs the size of baseballs ) .
This is the house in which Moore , 59 , was raised , and it has a kind of open - air earthiness that reflects his ' 60s - activist roots , which included a stint in a Berkeley commune .
Composting and organic gardening are serious business here –you can practically smell the humus–but there is also a kidney - shaped hot tub surrounded by palm trees .
Two wet suits hang drying on a clothesline above it .
This afternoon , Moore strides the grounds .
" How about a nice , fresh boysenberry ? " he asks , and plucks one off a bush .
He 's a striking man wearing no -nonsense black trousers and a shirt with official - looking epaulettes .
A thick brush of salt - and - pepper hair frames his intense blue eyes and serious face .
But the first thing you notice about Moore is his voice , a deep , bemused drawl that becomes animated and sardonic when the subject turns to plastic pollution .
This problem is Moore 's calling , a passion he inherited from his father , an industrial chemist who studied waste management as a hobby .
On family vacations , Moore recalls , part of the agenda would be to see what the locals threw out .
" We could be in paradise , but we would go to the dump , " he says with a shrug .
" That 's what we wanted to see . "
Since his first encounter with the Garbage Patch nine years ago , Moore has been on a mission to learn exactly what 's going on out there .
Leaving behind a 25 - year career running a furniture - restoration business , he has created the Algalita Marine Research Foundation to spread the word of his findings .
He has resumed his science studies , which he'd set aside when his attention swerved from pursuing a university degree to protesting the Vietnam War .
His tireless effort has placed him on the front lines of this new , more abstract battle .
After enlisting scientists such as Steven B. Weisberg , Ph.D. ( executive director of the Southern California Coastal Water Research Project and an expert in marine environmental monitoring ) , to develop methods for analyzing the gyre 's contents , Moore has sailed Alguita back to the Garbage Patch several times .
On each trip , the volume of plastic has grown alarmingly .
The area in which it accumulates is now twice the size of Texas .
At the same time , all over the globe , there are signs that plastic pollution is doing more than blighting the scenery ; it is also making its way into the food chain .
Some of the most obvious victims are the dead seabirds that have been washing ashore in startling numbers , their bodies packed with plastic : things like bottle caps , cigarette lighters , tampon applicators , and colored scraps that , to a foraging bird , resemble baitfish .
( One animal dissected by Dutch researchers contained 1,603 pieces of plastic . )
And the birds are n't alone .
All sea creatures are threatened by floating plastic , from whales down to zooplankton .
There 's a basic moral horror in seeing the pictures : a sea turtle with a plastic band strangling its shell into an hourglass shape ; a humpback towing plastic nets that cut into its flesh and make it impossible for the animal to hunt .
More than a million seabirds , 100,000 marine mammals , and countless fish die in the North Pacific each year , either from mistakenly eating this junk or from being ensnared in it and drowning .
Bad enough .
But Moore soon learned that the big , tentacled balls of trash were only the most visible signs of the problem ; others were far less obvious , and far more evil .
Dragging a fine - meshed net known as a manta trawl , he discovered minuscule pieces of plastic , some barely visible to the eye , swirling like fish food throughout the water .
He and his researchers parsed , measured , and sorted their samples and arrived at the following conclusion :
By weight , this swath of sea contains six times as much plastic as it does plankton .
This statistic is grim–for marine animals , of course , but even more so for humans .
The more invisible and ubiquitous the pollution , the more likely it will end up inside us .
And there 's growing –and disturbing –proof that we 're ingesting plastic toxins constantly , and that even slight doses of these substances can severely disrupt gene activity .
" Every one of us has this huge body burden , " Moore says .
" You could take your serum to a lab now , and they 'd find at least 100 industrial chemicals that were n't around in 1950 . "
The fact that these toxins do n't cause violent and immediate reactions does not mean they 're benign : Scientists are just beginning to research the long - term ways in which the chemicals used to make plastic interact with our own biochemistry .
In simple terms , plastic is a mix of monomers linked together to become polymers , to which additional chemicals can be added for suppleness , inflammability , and other qualities .
When it comes to these substances , even the syllables are scary .
For instance , if you 're thinking that perfluorooctanoic acid ( PFOA ) is n't something you want to sprinkle on your microwave popcorn , you 're right .
Recently , the Science Advisory Board of the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) upped its classification of PFOA to a likely carcinogen .
Yet it 's a common ingredient in packaging that needs to be oil - and heat - resistant .
So while there may be no PFOA in the popcorn itself , if PFOA is used to treat the bag , enough of it can leach into the popcorn oil when your butter deluxe meets your superheated microwave oven that a single serving spikes the amount of the chemical in your blood .
Other nasty chemical additives are the flame retardants known as poly - brominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) .
These chemicals have been shown to cause liver and thyroid toxicity , reproductive problems , and memory loss in preliminary animal studies .
In vehicle interiors , PBDEs–used in moldings and floor coverings , among other things –combine with another group called phthalates to create that much - vaunted " new - car smell . "
Leave your new wheels in the hot sun for a few hours , and these substances can " off - gas " at an accelerated rate , releasing noxious by - products .
It 's not fair , however , to single out fast food and new cars .
PBDEs , to take just one example , are used in many products , incuding computers , carpeting , and paint .
As for phthalates , we deploy about a billion pounds of them a year worldwide despite the fact that California recently listed them as a chemical known to be toxic to our reproductive systems .
Used to make plastic soft and pliable , phthalates leach easily from millions of products –packaged food , cosmetics , varnishes , the coatings of timed - release pharmaceuticals –into our blood , urine , saliva , seminal fluid , breast milk , and amniotic fluid .
In food containers and some plastic bottles , phthalates are now found with another compound called bisphenol A ( BPA ) , which scientists are discovering can wreak stunning havoc in the body .
We produce 6 billion pounds of that each year , and it shows : BPA has been found in nearly every human who has been tested in the United States .
We 're eating these plasticizing additives , drinking them , breathing them , and absorbing them through our skin every single day .
Most alarming , these chemicals may disrupt the endocrine system –the delicately balanced set of hormones and glands that affect virtually every organ and cell–by mimicking the female hormone estrogen .
In marine environments , excess estrogen has led to Twilight Zone - esque discoveries of male fish and seagulls that have sprouted female sex organs .
On land , things are equally gruesome .
" Fertility rates have been declining for quite some time now , and exposure to synthetic estrogen–especially from the chemicals found in plastic products–can have an adverse effect , " says Marc Goldstein , M.D. , director of the Cornell Institute for Reproductive Medicine .
Dr. Goldstein also notes that pregnant women are particularly vulnerable : " Prenatal exposure , even in very low doses , can cause irreversible damage in an unborn baby 's reproductive organs . "
And after the baby is born , he or she is hardly out of the woods .
Frederick vom Saal , Ph.D. , a professor at the University of Missouri at Columbia who specifically studies estrogenic chemicals in plastics , warns parents to " steer clear of polycarbonate baby bottles .
They 're particularly dangerous for newborns , whose brains , immune systems , and gonads are still developing . "
Dr. vom Saal 's research spurred him to throw out every polycarbonate plastic item in his house , and to stop buying plastic - wrapped food and canned goods ( cans are plastic - lined ) at the grocery store .
" We now know that BPA causes prostate cancer in mice and rats , and abnormalities in the prostate 's stem cell , which is the cell implicated in human prostate cancer , " he says .
" That 's enough to scare the hell out of me . "
At Tufts University , Ana M. Soto , M.D. , a professor of anatomy and cellular biology , has also found connections between these chemicals and breast cancer .
As if the potential for cancer and mutation were n't enough , Dr. vom Saal states in one of his studies that " prenatal exposure to very low doses of BPA increases the rate of postnatal growth in mice and rats . "
In other words , BPA made rodents fat .
Their insulin output surged wildly and then crashed into a state of resistance –the virtual definition of diabetes .
They produced bigger fat cells , and more of them .
A recent scientific paper Dr. vom Saal coauthored contains this chilling sentence : " These findings suggest that developmental exposure to BPA is contributing to the obesity epidemic that has occurred during the last two decades in the developed world , associated with the dramatic increase in the amount of plastic being produced each year . "
Given this , it is perhaps not entirely coincidental that America 's staggering rise in diabetes–a 735 percent increase since 1935 – follows the same arc .
This news is depressing enough to make a person reach for the bottle .
Glass , at least , is easily recyclable .
You can take one tequila bottle , melt it down , and make another tequila bottle .
With plastic , recycling is more complicated .
Unfortunately , that promising - looking triangle of arrows that appears on products does n't always signify endless reuse ; it merely identifies which type of plastic the item is made from .
And of the seven different plastics in common use , only two of them–PET ( labeled with # 1 inside the triangle and used in soda bottles ) and HDPE ( labeled with # 2 inside the triangle and used in milk jugs ) –have much of an aftermarket .
So no matter how virtuously you toss your chip bags and shampoo bottles into your blue bin , few of them will escape the landfill–only 3 to 5 percent of plastics are recycled in any way .
" There 's no legal way to recycle a milk container into another milk container without adding a new virgin layer of plastic , " Moore says , pointing out that , because plastic melts at low temperatures , it retains pollutants and the tainted residue of its former contents .
Turn up the heat to sear these off , and some plastics release deadly vapors .
So the reclaimed stuff is mostly used to make entirely different products , things that do n't go anywhere near our mouths , such as fleece jackets and carpeting .
Therefore , unlike recycling glass , metal , or paper , recycling plastic does n't always result in less use of virgin material .
It also does n't help that fresh - made plastic is far cheaper .
Moore routinely finds half - melted blobs of plastic in the ocean , as though the person doing the burning realized partway through the process that this was a bad idea , and stopped ( or passed out from the fumes ) .
" That 's a concern as plastic proliferates worldwide , and people run out of room for trash and start burning plastic –you 're producing some of the most toxic gases known , " he says .
The color - coded bin system may work in Marin County , but it is somewhat less effective in subequatorial Africa or rural Peru .
" Except for the small amount that 's been incinerated –and it's a very small amount–every bit of plastic ever made still exists , " Moore says , describing how the material 's molecular structure resists biodegradation .
Instead , plastic crumbles into ever - tinier fragments as it's exposed to sunlight and the elements .
And none of these untold gazillions of fragments is disappearing anytime soon :
Even when plastic is broken down to a single molecule , it remains too tough for biodegradation .
Truth is , no one knows how long it will take for plastic to biodegrade , or return to its carbon and hydrogen elements .
We only invented the stuff 144 years ago , and science 's best guess is that its natural disappearance will take several more centuries .
Meanwhile , every year , we churn out about 60 billion tons of it , much of which becomes disposable products meant only for a single use .
Set aside the question of why we 're creating ketchup bottles and six - pack rings that last for half a millennium , and consider the implications of it : Plastic never really goes away .
Ask a group of people to name an overwhelming global problem , and you 'll hear about climate change , the Middle East , or AIDS .
No one , it is guaranteed , will cite the sloppy transport of nurdles as a concern .
And yet nurdles , lentil - size pellets of plastic in its rawest form , are especially effective couriers of waste chemicals called persistent organic pollutants , or POPs , which include known carcinogens such as DDT and PCBs .
The United States banned these poisons in the 1970s , but they remain stubbornly at large in the environment , where they latch on to plastic because of its molecular tendency to attract oils .
The word itself–nurdles –sounds cuddly and harmless , like a cartoon character or a pasta for kids , but what it refers to is most certainly not .
Absorbing up to a million times the level of POP pollution in their surrounding waters , nurdles become supersaturated poison pills .
They 're light enough to blow around like dust , to spill out of shipping containers , and to wash into harbors , storm drains , and creeks .
In the ocean , nurdles are easily mistaken for fish eggs by creatures that would very much like to have such a snack .
And once inside the body of a bigeye tuna or a king salmon , these tenacious chemicals are headed directly to your dinner table .
One study estimated that nurdles now account for 10 percent of plastic ocean debris .
And once they 're scattered in the environment , they 're diabolically hard to clean up ( think wayward confetti ) .
At places as remote as Rarotonga , in the Cook Islands , 2,100 miles northeast of New Zealand and a 12 - hour flight from L.A. , they 're commonly found mixed with beach sand .
In 2004 , Moore received a $ 500,000 grant from the state of California to investigate the myriad ways in which nurdles go astray during the plastic manufacturing process .
On a visit to a polyvinyl chloride ( PVC ) pipe factory , as he walked through an area where railcars unloaded ground - up nurdles , he noticed that his pant cuffs were filled with a fine plastic dust .
Turning a corner , he saw windblown drifts of nurdles piled against a fence .
Talking about the experience , Moore 's voice becomes strained and his words pour out in an urgent tumble : " It 's not the big trash on the beach .
It 's the fact that the whole biosphere is becoming mixed with these plastic particles .
What are they doing to us ?
We 're breathing them , the fish are eating them , they 're in our hair , they 're in our skin . "
Though marine dumping is part of the problem , escaped nurdles and other plastic litter migrate to the gyre largely from land .
That polystyrene cup you saw floating in the creek , if it does n't get picked up and specifically taken to a landfill , will eventually be washed out to sea .
Once there , it will have plenty of places to go :
The North Pacific gyre is only one of five such high - pressure zones in the oceans .
There are similar areas in the South Pacific , the North and South Atlantic , and the Indian Ocean .
Each of these gyres has its own version of the Garbage Patch , as plastic gathers in the currents .
Together , these areas cover 40 percent of the sea .
" That corresponds to a quarter of the earth 's surface , " Moore says .
" So 25 percent of our planet is a toilet that never flushes . "
It was n't supposed to be this way .
In 1865 , a few years after Alexander Parkes unveiled a precursor to man-made plastic called Parkesine , a scientist named John W. Hyatt set out to make a synthetic replacement for ivory billiard balls .
He had the best of intentions : Save the elephants !
After some tinkering , he created celluloid .
From then on , each year brought a miraculous recipe : rayon in 1891 , Teflon in 1938 , polypropylene in 1954 .
Durable , cheap , versatile–plastic seemed like a revelation .
And in many ways , it was .
Plastic has given us bulletproof vests , credit cards , slinky spandex pants .
It has led to breakthroughs in medicine , aerospace engineering , and computer science .
And who among us does n't own a Frisbee ?
Plastic has its benefits ; no one would deny that .
Few of us , however , are as enthusiastic as the American Plastics Council .
One of its recent press releases , titled " Plastic Bags– A Family 's Trusted Companion , " reads : " Very few people remember what life was like before plastic bags became an icon of convenience and practicality–and now art .
Remember the ' beautiful ' [ sic ] swirling , floating bag in American Beauty ? "
Alas , the same ethereal quality that allows bags to dance gracefully across the big screen also lands them in many less desirable places .
Twenty - three countries , including Germany , South Africa , and Australia , have banned , taxed , or restricted the use of plastic bags because they clog sewers and lodge in the throats of livestock .
Like pernicious Kleenex , these flimsy sacks end up snagged in trees and snarled in fences , becoming eyesores and worse :
They also trap rainwater , creating perfect little breeding grounds for disease - carrying mosquitoes .
In the face of public outrage over pictures of dolphins choking on " a family 's trusted companion , " the American Plastics Council takes a defensive stance , sounding not unlike the NRA : Plastics do n't pollute , people do .
It has a point .
Each of us tosses about 185 pounds of plastic per year .
We could certainly reduce that .
And yet –do our products have to be quite so lethal ?
Must a discarded flip - flop remain with us until the end of time ?
Are n't disposable razors and foam packing peanuts a poor consolation prize for the destruction of the world 's oceans , not to mention our own bodies and the health of future generations ?
" If ' more is better ' and that 's the only mantra we have , we 're doomed , " Moore says , summing it up .
Oceanographer Curtis Ebbesmeyer , Ph.D. , an expert on marine debris , agrees .
" If you could fast - forward 10,000 years and do an archaeological dig … you'd find a little line of plastic , " he told The Seattle Times last April .
" What happened to those people ?
Well , they ate their own plastic and disrupted their genetic structure and were n't able to reproduce .
They did n't last very long because they killed themselves . "
Wrist - slittingly depressing , yes , but there are glimmers of hope on the horizon .
Green architect and designer William McDonough has become an influential voice , not only in environmental circles but among Fortune 500 CEOs .
McDonough proposes a standard known as " cradle to cradle " in which all manufactured things must be reusable , poison - free , and beneficial over the long haul .
His outrage is obvious when he holds up a rubber ducky , a common child 's bath toy .
The duck is made of phthalate - laden PVC , which has been linked to cancer and reproductive harm .
" What kind of people are we that we would design like this ? "
McDonough asks .
In the United States , it 's commonly accepted that children 's teething rings , cosmetics , food wrappers , cars , and textiles will be made from toxic materials .
Other countries–and many individual companies –seem to be reconsidering .
Currently , McDonough is working with the Chinese government to build seven cities using " the building materials of the future , " including a fabric that is safe enough to eat and a new , nontoxic polystyrene .
Thanks to people like Moore and McDonough , and media hits such as Al Gore 's An Inconvenient Truth , awareness of just how hard we 've bitch - slapped the planet is skyrocketing .
After all , unless we 're planning to colonize Mars soon , this is where we live , and none of us would choose to live in a toxic wasteland or to spend our days getting pumped full of drugs to deal with our haywire endocrine systems and runaway cancer .
None of plastic 's problems can be fixed overnight , but the more we learn , the more likely that , eventually , wisdom will trump convenience and cheap disposability .
In the meantime , let the cleanup begin : The National Oceanographic & Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) is aggressively using satellites to identify and remove " ghost nets , " abandoned plastic fishing gear that never stops killing .
( A single net recently hauled up off the Florida coast contained more than 1,000 dead fish , sharks , and one loggerhead turtle . )
New biodegradable starch - and corn - based plastics have arrived , and Wal - Mart has signed on as a customer .
A consumer rebellion against dumb and excessive packaging is afoot .
And in August 2006 , Moore was invited to speak about " marine debris and hormone disruption " at a meeting in Sicily convened by the science advisor to the Vatican .
This annual gathering , called the International Seminars on Planetary Emergencies , brings scientists together to discuss mankind 's worst threats .
Past topics have included nuclear holocaust and terrorism .
The gray plastic kayak floats next to Moore 's catamaran , Alguita , which lives in a slip across from his house .
It is not a lovely kayak ; in fact , it looks pretty rough .
But it 's floating , a sturdy , eight - foot - long two - seater .
Moore stands on Alguita 's deck , hands on hips , staring down at it .
On the sailboat next to him , his neighbor , Cass Bastain , does the same .
He has just informed Moore that he came across the abandoned craft yesterday , floating just offshore .
The two men shake their heads in bewilderment .
" That 's probably a $ 600 kayak , " Moore says , adding , " I do n't even shop anymore .
Anything I need will just float by . "
( In his opinion , the movie Cast Away was a joke– Tom Hanks could 've built a village with the crap that would 've washed ashore during a storm . )
Watching the kayak bobbing disconsolately , it is hard not to wonder what will become of it .
The world is full of cooler , sexier kayaks .
It is also full of cheap plastic kayaks that come in more attractive colors than battleship gray .
The ownerless kayak is a lummox of a boat , 50 pounds of nurdles extruded into an object that nobody wants , but that 'll be around for centuries longer than we will .
And as Moore stands on deck looking into the water , it is easy to imagine him doing the same thing 800 miles west , in the gyre .
You can see his silhouette in the silvering light , caught between ocean and sky .
You can see the mercurial surface of the most majestic body of water on earth .
And then below , you can see the half - submerged madhouse of forgotten and discarded things .
As Moore looks over the side of the boat , you can see the seabirds sweeping overhead , dipping and skimming the water .
One of the journeying birds , sleek as a fighter plane , carries a scrap of something yellow in its beak .
The bird dives low and then boomerangs over the horizon .
Gone .

He rarely speaks in public and closely guards his privacy .
But there 's a growing consensus in America that it 's Dick Cheney who calls the shots at the White House , on everything from the war in Iraq to climate change policy .
Ed Pilkington reports
It is a party trick well known to curious teenagers across America .
Zoom down on Washington via Google Earth and you get an extraordinary eagle - eyed view of the world 's greatest powerhouse .
There 's the White House and its West Wing .
There 's the spot where they put the national Christmas tree festooned with lights .
Sweeping south - east across the Potomac you soar above the pentagon of the Pentagon ; then back up a bit north and you can sit for hours counting the tiles on the roof of the Lincoln memorial .
But there is one thing you can't do .
If you scroll over the site of the vice - president 's official residence , all you will see , mysteriously , is a blurry fuzz .
The 46th vice - president of the US , Dick Cheney , has a fondness for remaining invisible .
It does n't matter whether it 's Google Earth or a bank of television cameras , he wo n't play ball .
He rarely presents himself to the media , and when he does so he likes to keep it in the family .
Take the interview he gave last October to Scott Hennen , a rightwing talkshow host with North Dakota 's WDAY radio .
At the time Iraq was imploding and the Republican party was heading towards meltdown at the mid-term elections .
So what does Hennen ask him ?
" Mr Vice - President , I know you 're fond of pheasant hunting in South Dakota , but there 's some great bird hunting in North Dakota .
Is this going to be the year you come up and do a little bird hunting in North Dakota ? "
Cheney : " Well , I do n't know ... "
Incisive stuff .
Hennen did , though , almost by accident , extract a seminal soundbite from the vice - president .
The discussion turned to terrorism and where to draw the line on the interrogation of suspects .
Hennen : " Would you agree a dunk in water is a no - brainer if it can save lives ? "
Cheney : " It 's a no - brainer for me . "
That quote , so innocently obtained , dunked Cheney himself in deep water .
The man who had for months vehemently rejected the title of " vice - president for torture " found himself agreeing on air that the use of waterboarding - the technique of holding a prisoner underwater to the point of drowning in order to break their will - was a " no- brainer " .
It was a moment of rare candidness from the ultimately controlled and secretive politician .
For once that infamous steely guard that seems to shield Cheney - with his unreadable face and equally inscrutable half - smile - appeared to have slipped .
Obscurity has been Cheney 's hallmark since he took office in January 2001 , and that 's the way he likes it .
" Am I the evil genius in the corner that nobody ever sees come out of his hole ? " he quipped in 2004 .
" It 's a nice way to operate , actually . "
But what started as a single , unguarded gaffe last October appears nine months on to be developing into a pattern .
Increasingly , the focus is switching from President Bush to the man who stands in the shadows behind him .
This month sees the publication of two books analysing the role of Cheney , one by Stephen Hayes of the neocon bible the Weekly Standard , the second a more critical work called Opportunist , by Robert Sam Anson .
Those volumes will land before the dust has settled over a classic piece of Washington Post journalism .
Under the headline " The Angler " - a reference to Cheney 's secret service code name - two Post journalists , Barton Gellman and Jo Becker , have dissected Cheney 's approach to his job in forensic detail .
Virtually a book in its own right - the series runs to 20,000 words - they reveal how Cheney has dictated policy in several crucial areas , including the war on terror , the economy and the environment .
In all these polarised accounts Cheney is universally presented as the most powerful vice - president in American history .
He has taken an institution that John Adams , its first holder , described as " the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived " and turned it into a seat of power .
" He has expanded the power of the vice - president fiftyfold , " says Bruce Fein , a lawyer who served in the Reagan administration and who worked with Cheney during the Iran - Contra hearings .
" Previous VPs typically handed out blankets in disaster zones or attended funerals in Burkina Faso . "
Not Cheney .
So dominant has he been in a traditionally submissive role that some commentators are now wondering whether it is time to drop the " V " from his title .
" Cheney is de facto president in all areas of policy , bar just a few aspects of the domestic agenda , " Fein says .
Cheney 's biographer , John Nichols , the Washington correspondent of the left - leaning Nation magazine , goes as far as to argue that " this was not George W Bush 's presidency .
It was Dick Cheney's . "
In hindsight , it was obvious the Cheney vice - presidency was never going to stick to convention from the day in July 2000 George Bush announced his running mate .
After all , the man who recommended Cheney for the job was ... Cheney .
When Bush was asked to explain why he had gone along with such auto - selection , he replied : " I picked him because he is without a doubt fully capable of being president of the United States . "
The moment the two men entered the White House it was clear Cheney had no intention of whiling away the hours at state funerals .
The Bush cabinet was formed in Cheney 's image .
Figures who were to become seminal - Donald Rumsfeld , Paul Wolfowitz , John Bolton , Scooter Libby - were all Cheney 's people .
In policy terms , too , his stamp was instantly visible , not least over the environment .
Both Cheney and Bush are fossil - fuel men to their bone marrow - Bush through his family 's oil connections in Texas and Cheney through the five years he spent in the 1990s as CEO of Halliburton .
But early on it became clear that Cheney was prepared to go even further than Bush in his devotion to the industry .
In the 2000 election campaign , Bush had made much of his intention to cut carbon dioxide emissions from coal - burning power plants as part of a new push towards cleaner skies .
But in March 2001 , just two months into the administration , he announced a sudden policy reversal : there would be no new regulations after all .
Administration officials told the New York Times that " the views of Dick Cheney had been instrumental in the final decision " .
Cheney 's stranglehold over energy policy was made official when he was put in charge of a task force to review the country 's energy needs .
The consequences were immediately apparent to those , like Eric Schaeffer , working to improve environmental standards .
For 12 years Schaeffer worked at the Environmental Protection Agency , acting as chief enforcer of federal anti-pollution regulations .
He remembers what happened when EPA scientists produced a report on the impact of clean - air restrictions on business , the findings of which ran counter to Cheney 's preconceived opinions .
" A few weeks later the report disappeared from the library - it was just wiped out , " Schaeffer recalls .
After months of similar irregularities , Schaeffer resigned in March 2002 .
" Government is a bargaining process and I know there has to be compromise .
But equally , there has to be some respect for the facts , " he says .
Schaeffer 's boss at the EPA , Christie Whitman , resigned the following year .
She said she wanted to spend more time with her family , but the Washington Post series finally reveals the real reason .
She quit because Cheney - whom she had counted at one time as a friend - had ruthlessly blocked her every attempt to raise anti-pollution standards .
When she tried to press her case directly to Bush , the vice - president was always in the room .
" You leave and the vice - president 's still there , " she told the Post .
As Whitman 's comment suggests , Cheney 's impact has been partly due to his unparalleled access to Bush .
Over six years in office , observers have seen a distinctive relationship develop between them .
The older man is a master at the warp and weft of government .
He revels in detail in a way that Bush notoriously does not .
Bush 's bed - at - nine routine may be exaggerated , but he certainly is n't up and reading dispatches by 4.30 am as his VP is .
Such precision gives
Cheney an edge in any policy debate .
As James Mann , author of a collective biography of the Bush cabinet , Rise of the Vulcans , puts it , Cheney is " the accountant who takes over the film studio " .
These qualities of open access to the president , hard work and attention to detail were all present from day one .
So too was a fondness for secrecy .
Bob Woodward , in his account of the build - up to the Iraq war , Plan of Attack , likens him to a " kind of Howard Hughes , the reclusive man behind the scenes who would not answer questions " .
But it took the events of September 11 2001 to bring these elements to the fore .
This was the moment for which Cheney had been preparing for many years .
Since his days as White House chief - of - staff to Gerald Ford , living with the fallout of Nixon 's destruction , Cheney had harboured ambitions to hit back at Congress and reinstate the untrammelled authority of the president .
The Washington Post series examines the most controversial aspects of the administration 's response to 9/11 - Guantánamo , the global kidnappings known as " extraordinary renditions " , torture , wire - tapping of Americans - and finds that in all these cases the road leads to the vice - president 's door .
Within hours of the attacks on New York and Washington , while Bush was still floundering around in Air Force One , Cheney had assembled a legal team within his own office and was actively planning how to roll back the restraints on the president 's executive power that had been introduced in the wake of Vietnam and Watergate .
Central to the team was Cheney 's legal adviser , David Addington .
By September 18 Addington and a couple of trusted colleagues , including the current attorney general , Alberto Gonzales , had drawn up proposals for the use of military force .
By September 25 they had drafted authorisation for the interception of communications to and from America without court permission - a form of surveillance banned in federal law since 1978 .
By November 6 they had scripted a memo that conceived a whole new legal system that would allow alleged terrorists to be held indefinitely without charge .
If necessary , they would be tried through " military commission " - a concept that Cheney put to Bush and had him approve personally over dinner .
Addington 's team operated largely in secret .
When CNN announced the military commissions on November 13 , Colin Powell , the secretary of state whose more measured approach was to bring him increasingly in conflict with the vice - president , was heard to exclaim : " What the hell just happened ? " Condoleezza Rice , then national security adviser , had also been left in the dark .
The pattern repeated itself the following year when Addington and his team , operating out of Cheney 's office , drew up legal advice that in effect tore up the Geneva convention .
Under its terms , the president had the right to order any means of interrogation of a terror suspect - by now designated " enemy combatants " - no matter how cruel or inhumane .
According to the Washington Post , further secret opinion approved as lawful a range of previously banned interrogation techniques , including that little " dunk in water " .
The first time Powell and Rice heard about the torture memo was two years after it had been written ; they read about it in a newspaper .
And then there was Iraq .
If 9/11 was Cheney 's moment , the invasion of Iraq in March 2003 may come to be seen as his undoing .
Apart from his old mentor Rumsfeld , Cheney did more than any other member of the administration to lay the path to Baghdad .
He had set his eyes on toppling Saddam well before 9/11 , and by the time he entered the White House had already framed in his mind a rationale of pre-emptive military action .
According to the former treasury secretary , Paul O'Neill , another friend of Cheney 's who the vice - president ousted from the administration , Cheney was actively engaging in debate about " the next war in Iraq and the shape of a post - Saddam country " barely 10 days after the Bush administration took office .
Bush , by contrast , had no such appetite or vision .
Consider the polar views that were expressed by the two men during their televised debates during the 2000 election .
In debate with Al Gore , Bush said : " I just do n't think it 's the role of the United States to walk into a country and say , ' We do it this way ; so should you . ' "
Cheney struck a very different tone when , in debate with Joe Lieberman , he was asked what he would do were Iraq found to be developing weapons of mass destruction : " We 'd have to give very serious consideration to military action to stop that activity , " he replied .
Through the build - up to war , the VP was the rabble - rouser - in - chief , uttering his now famous prediction of the Iraqi people : " They will welcome us as liberators . "
Iraq seems to have gripped Cheney with a passion that struck close observers as highly uncharacteristic .
Woodward writes that Powell saw Cheney undergo a transformation .
It was as though he had a fever , an unhealthy fixation in nailing Saddam .
Fein detected a similar sea-change in the man .
" I 've been amazed by his change of character , " he says .
" When we served together on the Iran - Contra committee , he was measured , restrained , unflappable .
Now he seems totally otherwise . "
In all of this it would be crude to suggest , as some have , that Cheney called the shots while Bush merely saluted and shuffled behind .
In the final analysis the buck stops with Dubya .
But to say that Bush made all the big decisions , having duly taken the advice of his VP , would also be to miss the nuance of their relationship .
In many cases the advice that Cheney gave his president was so narrowly cast that there could only be one serious outcome .
In the case of Iraq , the consequences for the country , the surrounding region and America 's reputation in the world are now plain to see .
What is less clear are the consequences for Cheney 's own fortunes .
Certainly , in recent months he has suffered a string of setbacks that have undoubtedly weakened his standing within the administration .
While Bush is in the doldrums , with historically low personal poll ratings , Cheney too has suffered deep blows to his credibility .
He has lost in the most humiliating circumstances several of his closest people : Rumsfeld , Bolton , Wolfowitz and now Libby have all fallen in quick succession .
The supreme court has also been nipping at Cheney 's heels , overturning several important aspects of his anti-terror laws .
In Rasul v Bush , the court threw out the White House argument that Guantánamo was beyond the reach of the US courts .
But it would be foolhardy to write off this supreme political machine quite yet .
Terminator - style , he has a way of crawling back after every blow .
The international lawyer Michael Ratner , president of the Centre for Constitutional Rights , has seen the phenomenon close up .
He has argued against the administration before the supreme court on several occasions , and a pattern has emerged .
" Each time there has been a decision against Cheney he has come right back and changed the rules , " he says .
With 18 months to go , the administration has undoubtedly now entered its lame - duck phase .
Yet there is time enough for it still to cause trouble .
For the past year a tug - of - war has been going on within the cabinet , with Bush in the middle .
Rice , together with Rumsfeld 's replacement at the Pentagon , Robert Gates , has been pulling the president in the direction of negotiating with Tehran over what the US claims is its nuclear weapons programme .
On the other side , arguing doggedly that diplomacy is not enough and that military solutions may be necessary , is yet again Cheney .
Until recently the rope was moving decidedly in the Rice / Gates direction .
But as the Guardian recently reported , the balance of the debate has just begun to swing back in Cheney 's favour , behind a military option .
Unthinkable though that may seem in the light of Iraq , he still appears to believe in the efficacy of shock and awe .
The question now is : does he have one last gasp left in him ?
All these struggles have left those at the sharp end of his dealings profoundly gloomy about America 's future .
" Dick Cheney has changed the whole landscape of the country , " Ratner says .
" And no matter who takes over from him , I 'm not convinced we will ever get back to where we were before him " .
Ever since I bought my Power Mac and PowerBook , I ’ve fallen in love with OS X .
But eventually , even the most beloved hardware needs to be replaced .
I skipped the first batch of Intel based Macs , but last week I finally decided to upgrade .
As always , things are never as simple as they seem , and therein lies a tale … before we begin though , please bear in mind that this is not a review .
These are just some of my impressions after spending a few days with my new MacBook Pro .
For a full - blown review , check out PC Magazine ’s excellent article on the MacBook Pro .
17 - Inch or 15 - Inch ?
One of the first questions I had to confront was the size of my new laptop .
Since I do n’t travel much I ’d thought that the 17 - inch MacBook Pro might be the one for me .
Then I heard about the beautiful , bright LED - backlit screens that the 15 - inchers had .
Wow .
Nice !
But how come the 17 - inch ones did n’t have them ?
Darn .
However , the 17 - inch MacBook Pros did have one thing going for them that the 15 - inchers did n’t — a gorgeous , 1900 x 1200 high - res screen !
I ’d gone to Apple ’s online store a zillion times , trying to make up my mind which one I wanted .
Finally I decided it was pointless to bother .
I needed to see these things in front of me to make up my mind .
So off I went to the Apple store at the local mall .
First thing I did when I arrived was to find the 17 - inch MacBook Pro .
Wow , the 1900 x 1200 screen was even better than I thought !
It had an amazing amount of screen space !
So then I went over to the 15 - inch and took a look at it .
Not nearly as much screen real estate , obviously but that screen sure was bright !
Hmm what to do , what to do ?
Then I remembered that I ’d pretty much decided that I ’d get an iMac after its next redesign / release sometime in the fall ( probably ) .
So did I really want a big , bulky 17 - inch laptop ?
What happens if I have to travel ?
It ’s heavier than the 15 - inch and it takes up too much space .
Ugh .
Would I really want to be toting around that 17 - inch behemoth ?
And what about the lack of an LED - backlit screen ?
Why get an older kind of screen even if it is high resolution ?
Ultimately , I decided to by the 15 - inch MacBook Pro and I ’m glad I did .

Career Calculus
A couple weeks ago there was a flurry of blogging over the price of Microsoft 's upcoming Professional Developers Conference ( PDC ) .
In the midst of this controversy , Doug Reilly chimed in with a post entitled " Who is responsible for your career ? " .
Doug 's post got a lot of reads and links , including well - said " amen posts " from Sam Gentile and Robert Hurlbut .
While I do n't care to debate the issue of PDC pricing , I do want to affirm the concept of taking responsibility for our own careers .
Often we choose to focus on the things which are outside our control .
But the truth is that our career path is largely determined by our own choices .
I 've known and worked with lots of developers , and I have noticed one thing which separates those with great careers from everybody else .
Developers with outstanding careers understand a secret that seems to elude the majority :
Focus on the first derivative .
And You thought Math would Never be Useful
Remember your introductory calculus ?
Probably not .
You were either a horny high school senior or a hung - over college freshman , so you were n't paying attention .
But there in the first few chapters of your calc textbook is a hint about the secret of your career path .
In basic calculus we learned that the first derivative of a function is the " rate of change " of the value of that function with respect to another variable .
In the case of your career , the other variable is time .
The basic equation for a developer career looks like this :
C = G + LT C is Cluefulness .
It is defined as an overall measure of your capabilities , expertise , wisdom and knowledge in the field of software development .
It is the measure of how valuable you are to an employer .
It is the measure of how successful your career is .
When you graph your career , C is on the vertical axis .
G is Gifting .
It is defined as the amount of natural cluefulness you were given " at the factory " .
For each individual , G is a constant , but it definitely varies from person to person .
L is Learning .
It is defined as the rate at which you gain ( or lose ) cluefulness over time .
T is Time .
It is on the horizontal axis of your career graph .
As you can see above , your career success is determined by three variables , only one of which you can control :
You obviously can't control T . Time marches forward mercilessly at the same rate for everyone .
You also can't control G .
The truth is that some people are just naturally smarter than you are , and that 's the way it is .
But G is not the sole determiner of your success .
I have known some truly gifted programmers with lame careers , and I have also known some less - gifted folks who have become extremely successful .
You can make choices which affect the value of L .
In fact , you do make choices which affect the value of L , every day , whether you know it or not .
Focus on the First Derivative
Old habits die hard .
Focusing on the first derivative can be very difficult to do , as our natural inclination is to focus on C itself .
We wonder why somebody else got the promotion .
We wonder why the boss does n't seem to value our ideas as much as some other person .
When we apply for a job , we submit a document which is filled with claims about how high our C value is .
We convince ourselves that the real problem is that people do n't seem to know how clueful we are .
Over time , we come to believe that the important thing is not our actual cluefulness but rather the degree to which others perceive us as clueful .
I submit that worrying about how others perceive your C value is a waste of time .
The key to a great career is to focus on L , the first derivative of the equation .
L is the rate at which your cluefulness is changing over time .
The actual value of C at any given moment is usually a distraction .
Only one question matters :
With each day that goes by , are you getting more clueful , or less clueful ?
Or are you just stuck ?
Sound obvious ?
It 's not .
Most people do n't get this , and you will leave your peers in the dust if you do .
For most developers , L is zero .
Any positive value for L can elevate you above the crowd .
When you make L into a positive number , you have a great career happening .
It no longer matters what G was .
You are getting more clueful every day , and that means your opportunities are going to get better in the future .
Constant Learning
I started with the example of paying your own way to PDC .
Yes , this is one example of a positive L . Go to PDC and you 'll learn about C# generics and query optimization for Yukon and managed APIs in Longhorn and all kinds of other stuff .
In the last week of October , your Cluefulness will increase .
But PDC only happens every couple years or so .
How are you going to keep L positive the rest of the time ?
A great career is not likely to happen if L merely spikes above zero once in a while .
We need " constant learning " .
We want learning to be a process , not an event .
Making your first derivative constantly positive is not just about formal training .
It is a posture which you bring to your job each day .
It is a posture of teachability , a constant willingness to learn .
What opportunities do you have for learning on a typical day as a developer ?
You spend approximately 250 days a year sitting in front of a keyboard and a screen .
For how many of those days can you make L a positive number ?
Unfortunately these are questions you have to answer for yourself .
When you start looking at things from this perspective , you will find your own ways to be constantly learning .
The implementation specifics depend almost entirely on you and your work environment .
But there is one big factor which is holding back L for almost everybody .
The most important learning experiences in day - to - day work are the opportunities to learn from our mistakes .
Seize Your Mistakes
In between formal training events like PDC , our mistakes are the peaks in our opportunities for learning .
Our value of L is heavily determined by the way we handle those mistakes .
My own mistakes have been the difference - makers in my career .
When SourceGear won the Inc 500 award last fall , the editors asked me to name the most surprising thing I had learned from being an entrepreneur .
I told them the most surprising thing was that I could make so many dumb mistakes and still end up on the Inc 500 list . :-)
I 've been running my own company for almost seven years now , and I have made some truly excellent mistakes .
Some of these mistakes have been downright embarrassing , but I have very few regrets .
I have learned an awful lot .
We all screw something up from time to time , but we do n't always learn from the experience .
Why not ?
Quite often , the reason we do n't learn from a mistake is because we 're too busy trying to hide it .
The best learning occurs when we choose to process a mistake with a mentor or peer .
Unfortunately , this goes against our natural tendency .
When we foul something up , the last thing we want to do is shine a light on it so everyone can see what a bonehead we are .
What we really want to do is cover it up and hope nobody notices .
But in doing so we miss a huge opportunity to increase our cluefulness .
Sometimes we become so practiced at hiding mistakes that we learn to hide them from ourselves .
When the daily build fails , what is your first reaction ?
Do you just assume that somebody else broke it ?
People with a positive L are more likely to immediately investigate to see if one of their checkins caused the problem .
A posture of teachability means that you are quick to recognize your own mistakes and can confidently process them .
Bottom line , you can choose only one of the following options :
A -- Manage your career .
B -- Manage others ' perceptions of you .
Choose A and your career will be outstanding .
Choose B and your career will stagnate .
Bug 5909
We recently had an opportunity to practice this discipline here at SourceGear .
One of our best developers ( let 's call him Jeremiah ) made a really big mistake .
The coding error itself was small , a simple case of an if statement that was n't quite right .
But the potential effect of the bug was rather severe .
Jeremiah took full responsibility for cleaning up the mess .
The actual bugfix was only the beginning .
Jeremiah worked directly with each customer that might have been affected .
He did n't stop to worry about whether anyone would think less of him for the mistake .
In fact , he handled the situation so well that his perceived C is up , even though he never seemed to make that a goal of the experience .
In the end , we lost some time , but the major lasting effect of bug 5909 was increased cluefulness for Jeremiah .
Risks
I am quite tempted to argue that an everyday posture of teachability is a lot cheaper than PDC . :-)
But to be fair , I 'll have to admit that constant learning is a choice which involves risk .
In two very important ways , choosing to have a high L will make you more vulnerable to your manager :
The first big risk is the possibility that getting your mistakes out in the open will mean that your manager will punish you for them .
The consequences here could vary broadly .
Your manager might simply start thinking you are an idiot .
One of those mistakes might even get you fired .
The second risk is the possibility that your manager will become afraid of you .
Some managers really prefer to have a zero - derivative team .
Whether consciously or not , they stack their team with stagnant people who are not likely to threaten their position .
If you are on just such a team and you suddenly become a " first derivative developer " , you are upsetting a very delicate balance .
Your manager may react unpredictably .
You may be labeled a troublemaker .
He may even contrive some excuse to fire you .
Both of these risks are real , with consequences that can feel quite severe .
Depending on your personal circumstances , the sudden loss of a job can be a very distressing event .
This is a valid concern , and I am trying not to flippantly dismiss it .
But you really do n't want to work for this kind of a bozo anyway .
In either of the situations above , it is time to be shopping for a new manager .
This a basic axiom and a starting point for taking responsibility for your career :
Do n't work for a manager
who is actively hindering
your practice of
constant learning .
Just do n't do it .
Corollary :
Next time you 're interviewing for a job , pretend that the power structure is reversed .
The hiring manager is trying to figure out if there is any chance you are worthy of the job .
Ignore that .
Instead , spend your time trying to figure out if there is any chance that guy is worthy of being your manager .
Postscript
By the way , as long as you 're going to develop a voracious appetite for knowledge , may I suggest that you not necessarily limit your scope to issues of coding and architecture ?
If you are in a small ISV , or if your career goals include management , you may want to watch for opportunities to learn about other stuff .
Heck , you might even want to learn a thing or two about marketing . :-)
David Barbano , director of the Northeast Dairy Foods Research Center , operated by Cornell and the University of Vermont and supported by the dairy industry , grew up drinking raw milk on a family farm .
He does not remember ever getting sick , but says science has never found any evidence that it was more beneficial than pasteurized milk .
In fact , he said , raw milk has very little vitamin D , which is added to most pasteurized milk .
“ There is always going to be a percentage of raw milk that carries disease - causing bacteria , ” said Dr. Barbano , who is a professor of food science at Cornell .
“ As long as I have pasteurized milk available for me , and I guess more importantly for my daughter , the risk is not worth any benefit anyone has been able to prove . ”
Sally Fallon , president of the Westin A. Price Foundation , another nutrition advocacy group , argues that the risk to raw milk drinkers is insignificant , and the demand for product is growing steadily .
In 1998 , when the Washington - based foundation created the Web site realmilk.com , it barely had half a page of sources where raw milk could be purchased legally .
Now , the list has grown to more than two dozen pages , and Ms. Fallon puts the number of raw milk drinkers at half a million .
“ We are trying to be pragmatic and create demand , ” said Ms. Fallon of the 10,000 - member , 400 - chapter foundation , which has mounted legal challenges to raw milk regulations in several states .
“ Even though it is illegal in some places , it is very available through cow sharing or cow herding programs . ”
In Virginia , for example , Chip and Susan Planck — Nina ’s parents — pay $ 40 a year plus $ 25 monthly to own a share in one cow , the only legal way to get raw milk in that state .
In return , they get a gallon of raw milk a week .
It is technically not a sale but compensation for the cow ’s room and board .
Last year the Hawthorne Valley Farm in Ghent , N.Y. , offered a buyers ’ club program to its raw milk customers in the hopes of giving a bigger boost to a steadily growing market .
It was designed to encourage those customers in New York and beyond to order in bulk but send only one representative a week to pick up the order .
When the New York State Department Public Interestand Markets caught wind of it , however , it asked Hawthorne to end the program and the farm complied .
Still , Abe Madey , the farm ’s dairy manager and cheesemaker , says business is steady .
About 100 regular customers , many of whom drive two hours from New York City , purchase up to 7,500 gallons annually of raw milk worth about $ 45,000 to the farm , he said .
Barbara Tubb 's entire yard is a garden of colorful plants and flowers .
Palmetto .
Pungent - smelling blue basil .
And her favorite : bright white cat whiskers .
Buttressed by pine needles , the yard looks to one neighbor like a fire hazard .
Inspired by environmentalism , rising water bills , and her husband 's support before he died , Ms. Tubbs hired a landscape architect to design her new drought - resistant yard .
The homeowner 's association in the country club where she lives – a community of manufactured homes in suburban Orlando – resisted her save - water - and - the - planet attitude but eventually granted permission for her to tear out all her St. Augustine grass .
Immediately , there was backlash from her neighbors ; one even called the fire department .
In Florida , there seems to be little awareness of water as a limited resource , and why should there be ?
The state is mostly a lush , tropical landscape with lakes , rivers , and springs .
Surrounded by ocean water , it gets pounded by hurricanes and tropical storms that , with other rainfall , dump up to 50 inches annually .
But some warn Florida 's groundwater is nearing its limits .
And people like Tubbs who uproot lush sod for less thirsty landscaping often do n't get much support from their neighbors .
This summer 's drought – the worst in the Southeast since record - keeping began in 1895 – has laid bare parts of Lake Okeechobee , the second - largest freshwater lake in the continental US behind Lake Michigan .
It has also exposed permanent water problems in the eastern part of the nation , says Cynthia Barnett , a longtime Florida journalist and author of " Mirage : Florida and the Vanishing Water of the Eastern U.S. "
She and others warn that the state may soon face water wars once unique to the arid West , a situation that eventually could reach well beyond Florida as populations grow across the eastern United States and climate changes affect water availability .
" Florida will never be arid like Arizona , but it 's certainly going to have the same water problems as Arizona has , " says Peter Gleick , president of the Pacific Institute , an independent nonprofit research group based in Oakland , Calif .
" Florida is reaching the limits of its natural water availability .
The population is growing rapidly , and it 's outstripping the natural endowment . "
The average Floridian household consumes 174 gallons of water daily , using up to 75 percent of it to irrigate sod and landscaping .
The sod of choice is St. Augustine – grass that dies without water .
In this state of golf courses and country clubs , many homeowner 's associations require that a certain percentage of a homeowner 's yard is sod with St. Augustine , maintained to a specific shade of green , Ms. Barnett says .
Xeriscaping – landscaping using drought - resistant and usually native plants and flowers – is catching on thanks to trailblazers like Tubbs .
But it 's still not mainstream in Florida .
Proponents avoid using the term , because they say it 's misconstrued as zero landscaping or landscaping with rocks and gravel .
Striking a balance between attractive , drought - resistant landscaping and landscaping that is unkempt is tricky , says Teresa Watkins , Central Florida yards and neighborhoods coordinator for the University of Florida .
A dirt yard saves water , but it sure is n't pretty .
Very few Florida yards – perhaps fewer than 1 percent – are " Florida - friendly , " says Ms. Watkins .
" We still see lawns everywhere , " says Mr. Gleick .
" It does n't matter if you think you 're in a state that gets a lot of water if you use it all . "
In 2005 , the Florida Legislature passed two laws , one requiring local governments to ensure water sources are available before approving new development and another allocating $ 60 million to localities to develop new water sources .
Gleick warns that any real progress will have to come from local governments , because local agencies distribute water .
That 's starting to happen in Florida .
In Sarasota , the average household has reduced its number of gallons used daily to 90 through measures that limit the amount of sod allowed in a yard .
Some residents , conscious of shortages , have asked for restrictions on water use to go even further , says Pat Haire , a Sarasota County spokeswoman .
Other municipalities are exploring ways to remove salt from sea water .
In Orange County , home to Orlando , water managers are pushing for an attitude shift – starting with children , says Jacqueline Torbert of the Orange County Utilities ' Water Division .
They are visiting schools and promoting conservation on Radio Disney in programs broadcast throughout Central Florida .
And they 're encouraging home builders and homeowner 's associations to landscape with less St. Augustine grass .
Orange County is also developing water and landscaping ordinances .
Most golf courses in the Orlando area already use reclaimed water or reused waste water .
And only about half of an average household 's water is used outside , Ms. Torbert says .
Though the issue gained urgency for the agency only about five years ago , time is of the essence :
The agency expects the region 's groundwater to reach a critical level by 2013 .
Florida is unique because it is so dependent on its groundwater , says Gleick , but other parts of the country also over - pump their aquifers .
He cites the Ogallala aquifer that spans Nebraska , Oklahoma , Texas , and Kansas as one example .
Nationwide it 's hard to know how much water landscaping like Tubbs 's saves .
Landscaping in different regions requires vastly different amounts of water .
But Tubbs sees a difference in her water bill – down $ 10 to $ 20 a month since her new yard went in .
" I 'm willing to be the first one , " she says .
" I can handle [ the neighbors . ] "
Thread .
Sleep has it ’sits use : simulating lengthy operations while testing / debugging on an MTA thread .
In .NET there ’s no other reason to use it .
Thread .
Sleep (n ) means block the current thread for at least the number of timeslices ( or thread quantums ) that can occur within n milliseconds .
The length of a timeslice is different on different versions / types of Windows and different processors and generally ranges from 15 to 30 milliseconds .
This means the thread is almost guaranteed to block for more than n milliseconds .
The likelihood that your thread will re-awaken exactly after n milliseconds is about as impossible as impossible can be .
So , Thread .
Sleep is pointless for timing .
Threads are a limited resource , they take approximately 200,000 cycles to create and about 100,000 cycles to destroy .
By default they reserve 1 megabyte of virtual memory for its stack and use 2,000 - 8,000 cycles for each context switch .
This makes any waiting thread a * huge * waste .
If the current thread is a foreground thread , Thread .
Sleep (n ) also means your application cannot exit for >n milliseconds .
After all foreground threads have completed , the CLR will allow an application to terminate .
If the current thread is a background thread , and the application exits the thread will simply never be awoken ( not good if you need your objects to be disposed or finalized ) .
STA threads have an implicit requirement to not make blocking calls .
STA threads use a message queue ( of finite size ) to communicate with the outside world ; that communication occurs whether you explicitly use it or not .
When you block your STA thread with Thread .
Sleep you ’re blocking that communication and run the risk of the queue overflowing .
A WinForm thread must be STA , so it has the same implicit requirement to not make blocking calls simply to support being an apartment .
A GUI should never make calls that can affect the responsiveness of the user interface , for obvious reasons .
There is one non-breaking use for Thread .
Sleep : Thread .
Sleep ( 0 ) .
This tells the system you want to forfeit the rest of the thread ’s timeslice and let another , waiting , thread run .
If there are no other threads waiting to run you still relinquish your timeslice .
If There are other threads waiting to run , you wo n’t be sure when you get control back ; if the waiting thread has a higher priority , you may never get control back .
Thread .
Sleep (0 ) effectively tells the OS that you ’re better at scheduling processes than it is and you ’ll likely affect the way it can schedule threads and processes and affect the responsiveness of the entire system if you ’re using Sleep ( 0 ) a lot .
As future versions of the CLR and CLR hosts are implemented they will eventually implement threading without a direct dependence on unmanaged threads ( e.g. managed entirely by the CLR using fibers . )
Which means Thread .
Sleep will have to be reimplemented to do something different ( e.g.i.e. if Sleep ( 0 ) means relinquish the current thread ’s timeslice to the OS and there is no current OS thread then Sleep ( 0 ) means nothing .
If Thread .
Sleep is not re-implemented Thread .
Thread ( 0 ) means block all fibers , or managed threads , associated with the current OS thread .
You never want to cause other threads to suspend , especially arbitrarily ) .
So , System .
Thread is not future - friendly .
Thread .
Sleep has been used for many things it should n’t be used for .
Here ’s a list of the common mistakes :
The thread needs to wait for another thread to complete
In this case no value , other than infinite , passed to Thread .
Sleep will be correct .
You simply do n’t know when the other thread will complete using this method .
If the thread completed after Sleep returned you ’ll likely have synchronization problems .
If the other thread completed before Sleep returned the thread was needlessly blocked for an amount of time rendering the benefits of multithreading limited or moot .
In the control circumstances where you ’ve tested this it may seem like it always works ; it just takes a busy program to cause it to faile : a defrag program , a sudden influx of network traffic , a network hiccup , etc .
The thread needs perform logic every n milliseconds
As noted earlier , Sleep means relinquish control .
When your thread gets control again is n’t up to the thread ; so it ca n’t be used for periodic logic .
We do n’t know why Thread .
Sleep is required ; but if we take it out the application stops working
This is flawed logic because the application still does n’t work with Thread .
Sleep .
This is really just spackling over the problem on that particular computer .
The original problem is likely a timing / synchronization issue , ignoring it by hiding it with Thread .
Sleep is only going to delay the problem and make it occur in random , hard to reproduce ways .
Be careful when hooking up with other " adults " online — even if they say they 're 18 , you 'll be the one in hot water if they turn out to be 14 instead .
That 's the opinion of a federal judge in Ohio , who dismissed a suit last week against SexSearch.com , a web site that hosts personals ads by people who are looking for sex .
The plaintiff , who went by John Doe due to the very personal nature of the suit , accused the site and its owners of negligent misrepresentation , fraud , and breach of warranty , but Judge Jack Zouhary ruled that the site and its alleged transgressions were protected under the 1996 Communications Decency Act .
It all goes back to 2005 , when Doe became a paying member of SexSearch.com in order to find ... well , you know .
He eventually met another paying member on the site , a woman named in the court documents as Jane Roe .
Roe had completed her profile on the site with a recent and authentic picture , a birth date that indicated that she was over 18 , and a statement that she was looking for someone " who could last for a long time . "
The two eventually decided to meet , with Doe going over to Roe 's abode in November of 2005 to engage in ... well , you know .
Things were all well and good , and the two had even lost contact after a short period of time .
Until one night a month later , that is , when Doe found his house surrounded by police — it turned out that Roe was merely 14 .
Doe was arrested and charged with three separate accounts of unlawful sexual conduct with a minor , and he currently faces up to 15 years in prison as well as a lifetime registration as a sexual offender .
Doe was publicly named for engaging in sexual relations with a minor , which he said ruined his reputation as a law - abiding citizen and caused him to lose his job .
All in all , Doe 's case sounds like the worst nightmare of almost anyone who has searched for a " casual " relationship with someone online .
Doe 's complaint places blame for the entire series of events on the shoulders of SexSearch.com , which he says misrepresented itself by displaying the phrase " all persons within this site are 18 + . "
Since SexSearch.com also reserved the right to modify member profiles that it believed to be misleading or underage , Doe said that it was negligent and deceptive since it allowed Roe 's profile and photo to remain on the site .
Basically , if the site had discovered Roe 's real age and subsequently prevented her from posting on the site , none of this would have ever happened .
While that may be true , Judge Zouhary did n't feel that that Doe should have placed that much trust in the site .
In his 29 - page ruling , the judge wrote that there was nothing deceptive about the site 's warning language stating that all persons were over 18 .
" Plaintiff was not an unsuspecting customer , " wrote Zouhary in his opinion .
" He was aware the SexSearch membership registration process did not include an age - verification procedure .
As noted above , Plaintiff specifically agreed to Terms and Conditions which stated that SexSearch did not guarantee or verify any information provided by users of the website , and nothing outside of the Terms and Conditions creates warranties . "
Ultimately , Zouhary said , SexSearch.com was protected under section 230 of the Communications Decency Act , which states that " interactive computer services " cannot be held responsible for publishing information provided to them by members .
Judge Zouhary also cited a 2007 lawsuit involving MySpace , which asserted that MySpace should be held responsible for minors participating in communications with adults — another case dismissed as a result of section 230 .
Since
Doe never attempted to argue that the site had modified Roe 's profile , Zouhary said that the service was otherwise protected by section 230 .
Zouhary ruled that even without the section 230 protections , Doe 's case was not a strong one .
He wrote that Doe had plenty of opportunity to verify Roe 's age when he met her in person at what we all presume to be her parents ' house , but failed to do so .
" Plaintiff employed a double - barreled shotgun approach to this case , but failed to hit a claim upon which relief may be granted , " reads the opinion .
Unfortunately for John Doe , it looks like 14 will get him 15 in the slammer .
Nach mehr als vier Monaten hat das Landgericht Hamburg die schriftliche Begründung seines viel beachteten Urteils zur Forenhaftung ( Az. 324 O 721/05 ) vom 2 . Dezember 2005 vorgelegt .
Demnach handelt es sich bei Webforen um eine " besonders gefährliche Einrichtung " .
Derjenige , der eine solche Gefahrenquelle betreibe , sei einer verschärften Haftung unterworfen .
Der bisherigen Rechtsprechung , wonach der Anbieter eines Forums erst ab Kenntnis eines rechtswidrigen Inhalts haftet und nicht zu einer aktiven Suche verpflichtet ist , folgten die Hamburger Richter nicht .
Das Bereithalten von Internetforen stelle eine Form unternehmerischen Betriebs dar .
Der Betreiber müsse sein Unternehmen so einrichten , dass er mit seinen sachlichen und personellen Ressourcen in der Lage sei , diesen Geschäftsbetrieb zu beherrschen .
" Wenn die Zahl der Foren und die Zahl der Einträge so groß ist , dass die Antragsgegnerin nicht über genügend Personal oder genügend technische Mittel verfügt , um diese Einträge vor ihrer Freischaltung einer Prüfung auf ihre Rechtmäßigkeit zu unterziehen , dann muss sie entweder ihre Mittel vergrößern oder den Umfang ihres Betriebs [ ...] beschränken " , so das Landgericht Hamburg .
Im vorliegenden Fall sahen das Unternehmen Universal Boards und dessen Geschäftsführer Mario Dolzer ihre Rechte verletzt .
Einzelne Forenteilnehmer hatten im Forum zu einem Bericht von heise online über die Geschäftspraktiken von Universal Boards ein Skript veröffentlicht , das geeignet sein soll , den Betrieb von Download - Services dieses Unternehmens zu gefährden .
Dessen Rechtsanwalt Bernhard Syndikus verlangte daraufhin per Abmahnung vom Verlag , es zu unterlassen , " an der Verbreitung von ' Leserkommentaren ' mitzuwirken , in denen wörtlich oder sinngemäß dazu aufgerufen wird , Dateien , insbesondere das Programm ' k.exe ' , so oft wie möglich von den Servern meiner Mandantschaft downzuloaden , um die Server meiner Mandanten ' in die Knie zu zwingen ' " .
Der Verlag löschte umgehend die genannten Forenbeiträge , gab aber die geforderte Verpflichtungserklärung nicht ab , da er seiner Auffassung nach nur bei Kenntnis der potenziell rechtswidrigen Beiträge handeln muss .
Obwohl nach der Löschung kein weiterer Beitrag mit einem entsprechenden Aufruf folgte , erwirkte die Universal Boards eine der Unterlassungsaufforderung entsprechende einstweilige Verfügung am Landgericht Hamburg .
Den Widerspruch des Verlags gegen diese Verfügung wies das Gericht ab .
Die Kammer sieht den Verlag als so genannten " Störer " , weil er über sein Forum die unzulässigen Blockadeaufrufe verbreitet habe .
Schließlich sei er in der Lage , die Aufrufe zu unterbinden , indem " die Einträge vor ihrer Freischaltung auf die rechtliche Zulässigkeit ihres jeweiligen Inhalts überprüft werden . "
Dem Argument des Heise Zeitschriften Verlags , dass eine laufende Kontrolle der Inhalte angesichts von mehr als 200.000 Beiträgen pro Monat nicht zu leisten und damit unzumutbar sei , erteilte das Gericht eine klare Absage .
Nur vage äußerte sich die Kammer zur Frage , ob sich ihre Sichtweise auf jedes Webforum oder nur auf Dienste von Presseorganen bezieht .
Sie spricht von derjenigen " Person , die Einrichtungen unterhält , über die Inhalte in pressemäßiger Weise verbreitet werden " .
Dies gelte " auch für Unternehmen , die Inhalte über das Internet verbreiten . "
Der Heise Zeitschriften Verlag verbreite in seinem Webforum Äußerungen von Nutzern " pressemäßig " .
Dies dürfte folglich auf jedes Internet - Forum zutreffen , eine weitere Differenzierung nehmen die Richter zumindest nicht vor .
Sogar bevor die schriftliche Begründung des Urteils vorlag , hatten Rechtsanwälte bereits unter Berufung darauf mißliebige Forenbetreiber kostenpflichtig abgemahnt .
Derlei Fälle dürften sich nun häufen .
Der Heise Zeitschriften Verlag wird gegen das Urteil Rechtsmittel einlegen .
" Eine Vorabkontrolle von Nutzerbeiträgen würde das Ende der gewachsenen Forenkultur in Deutschland bedeuten " , kommentierte Verlagsjustiziar Joerg Heidrich : " Unserer Ansicht nach handelt es sich um ein grobes Fehlurteil .
Es hätte gravierende Folgen für alle Betreiber von Foren , wenn die Entscheidung Bestand haben sollte . "

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Senate delivered an apparently fatal blow on Thursday to President George W. Bush ’s planned immigration overhaul and dashed the hopes of millions of immigrants seeking legal status .
In a crucial make or break vote that exposed deep lack of support among Bush ’s own Republicans , the legislation fell 14 votes short of the 60 needed in the 100 - member Senate to advance toward a final vote .
Supporters of the bill , which was the result of months of negotiations between a group of Republican and Democratic senators and the White House , were dismayed by the vote .
Rosa Rosales , the national president of the League of United Latin American Citizens , said it was unlikely Congress would return to immigration reform before next year ’s presidential election .
“ No one benefits now , there is nothing to look forward ... it ’s very disappointing , ” Rosales told Reuters .
Bush has sought an overhaul of U.S. immigration laws for years and this bill may have been his last chance for a significant domestic legislative victory before leaving office at the end of his second term in January 2009 .
Bush made clear he was moving on from immigration to other issues like balancing the federal budget .
“ A lot of us worked hard to see if we could n’t find common ground ( on immigration ) , it did n’t work , ” Bush said in a stop at the Naval War College in Rhode Island .

The president was unable to overcome fierce opposition from fellow Republicans who said it was an amnesty for an estimated 12 million illegal immigrants in the country and would do little to stem illegal immigration .
Even the promise of an additional $ 4.4 billion to pay for more border security and enforcement did not quell Republican opposition .
The bill failed to garner even a simple majority .
Only 46 senators -- 33 Democrats , 12 Republicans and 1 independent -- voted to advance the bill .
Some 15 Democrats joined 37 Republicans and 1 independent to block the legislation .
It was the second time in as many weeks the Senate tried to pass the legislation .
TOUGH TO REVIVE
Senate leaders have said it would be difficult if not impossible to revive the bill again before the November 2008 presidential election .
Immigration has already become an issue in the election campaign .

The bill tied tough border security and workplace enforcement measures to a plan to legalize illegal immigrants and create a temporary worker program sought by business groups .
It also would have created a new merit - based system for future immigrants .
The bill was also opposed by some labor unions , who said its temporary worker program would have created an underclass of cheap laborers .
Immigrant groups opposed measures in the bill that limited migration on the basis of family ties .
Republican opponents of the bill said Bush should give up on broad immigration reform and concentrate on keeping illegal immigrants out .
“ The next step is to immediately push the president to take up his word and enforce security at the border , ” said Sen .
David Vitter , a Louisiana Republican who help lead the fight against the bill .
Supporters of the bill were crushed .
“ We were looking to politicians for leadership on this issue , and there has been none and it ’s deeply disappointing , ” said Sheridan Bailey , the president of Ironco Enterprises in Phoenix and a co-founder of Arizona Employers for Immigration Reform .
“ It ’s like in Vietnam when they said ‘ we had to destroy the village to save it , ’ well here they are destroying the economy to save the U.S. border , ” said Bailey , echoing the views of employers from eleven U.S. states , who have formed lobby groups to advocate for immigration reform .
Secret Service : Retired Bush will be ' high value terrorist target '
David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday June 21 , 2007 Print This Email This
CNN reported Thursday that the Secret Service expects President Bush to be " a high value terrorist target after he leaves office . "
They then showed the Secret Service practicing to deal with everything from James Bond - style stealth weapons to roadside IED 's in order to meet that challenge .
Retired agent Terry Samway told CNN , " We have the mandate to make sure that whatever they did during their presidency , they are still safe from any of those lingering issues after their presidency . "
Even before 9/11 , the cost of protection for former presidents was estimated as $ 24 million a year , and Bush will be guarded by an unprecedented 103 full - time agents starting in January 2009 .
However , a 1997 law limits the duration of Secret Service protection for former presidents to just 10 years .
" But before they can protect a president or former president , " concluded CNN , " the new recruits are drilled in the basics , including target practice at 100 yards and then a sprint to load and fire again -- this time much more up close and personal . "

Novak : I 'd print Valerie Plame Wilson 's name again Michael Roston
Published : Wednesday July 4 , 2007 Print This Email This When Robert Novak publishes his memoir , The Prince of Darkness , 50 Years Reporting in Washington , the conservative political pundit will seek to settle some scores with colleagues in the nation 's capitol .
But he wo n't be expressing any regrets for printing the name of and ' outing ' covert CIA agent Valerie Plame Wilson , according to a Tuesday report in ' Washington Whispers , ' a blog published by US News and World Report .
" Novak was investigated in the CIA spy case , slammed by fellow journalists for ' outing ' an agent , the subject of what he calls false stories , kicked off his regular CNN gig , and barred from Meet the Press for two years - and out $ 160,000 in legal fees , " Paul Bedard , who acquired a copy of the forthcoming book , writes .
" Still , he writes , ' Judging it on the merits , I would still write the story . ' "
The pundit also has choice words for Ambassador Joe Wilson , Plame 's husband , who was sent by the CIA to investigate claims that Niger was selling uranium oxide or yellowcake to Iraq .
" He kept saying , ' We did this '' and ' We did that . '
The 'we , ' I soon surmised , consisted of the National Security Council staff in the departed Clinton administration .
He was making clear that ' we ' handled affairs better than ' they '-- the Bush NSC - - did now , " Novak reportedly writes .
" In view of what followed , I hope I can be excused for the vulgarism that crossed my mind : ' What an asshole ! ' "
Novak also reiterates that former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage was his sole source for Plame 's identity .
He insists that the ' leak ' was not a deliberate act on the part of a White House out to get the Wilsons .
" After mentioning her first name , ' Valerie , ' Novak says that Armitage even joked , ' that 's real Evans and Novak , is n't it , ' a reference to the type of insider gossip Novak and his deceased former colleague Rowland Evans used to traffic in , " Bedard reports Novak saying .
Novak reportedly adds , " I am sure it was not a planned leak but came out as an offhand observation . "
Bedard 's full report can be accessed at this link .
Domain registrars are providing services that aid terrorism , claims Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail .
A lengthy article published over the weekend , " Terror goes digital .
With Canadian help , " delves into the many different facets of the Internet that have been used by Islamic terrorist groups to communicate their messages to each other and to the rest of the world .
But the " Canadian help " part of the equation comes by way of domain registrars Register.com and Tucows , which both operate out of Canada .
The newspaper 's assertions that these companies somehow aid terrorists with their services , however , are somewhat misguided .
The linchpin of The Globe and Mail 's argument is that registrars are aiding terrorists by helping to keep them anonymous .
As many of our readers know , people who register new domains now often have the option to do so without having their personal information displayed to the public through a WHOIS query .
This service usually only costs a few extra dollars per year and has been applauded by privacy advocates as a way to keep a citizen 's personal info private — no one needs to know who has registered those domains , they argue .
But according to The Globe and Mail , the service has made it easier for terrorists to put their message out online without exposing their location or contact information .
But it 's not as if the registrars themselves do n't store the information .
Both Register.com and Tucows require people who are registering domains to enter all of their personal information , regardless of whether they make use of the public anonymizing services or not .
Register.com told us that the company provides private registration services so that its customers can avoid getting unwanted spam , mail , and telephone calls , but that there are a number of terms that users must agree to in order to use them .
The company says that it takes reports of illegal activity on its servers seriously .
" Our policy clearly states that any site that does not comply with applicable laws , government rules or requirements , court orders or requests from law enforcement , is subject to immediate termination , " Register.com 's Wendy Kennedy told Ars .
" In the event that Register.com is notified that a user of our Private Domain Registration is violating our policy , we follow a very specific process to respond .
This process includes investigating the report and if applicable , disabling the domain and notifying the customer of the reason for this action .
Register.com has , and will continue , to work with law enforcement to protect our domains for being used for any such activities . "
As the " war on terror " moves onto the Internet , however , domain registrars will continue feeling pressure from both sides over the privacy services offered to their customers .
And although Register.com appears to be making a reasonable effort to strike a balance thus far , shutting down web sites that are hosted on this side of the pond only represents small victories against those determined to spread word of their activities around the world .
His purpose , of course , is to hold the Official Line , Reefer Madness .
His job is to lie , to distort , to confuse , and to muddy the waters of public discourse .
A typical Team Bush croney .
While the man has overseen the return of the reefer madness of yesteryear , it is the repeated comparison of cannabis with tobacco I wish to focus upon .
Here are some excerpts from a CNN appearance of John Walters in 2002 , talking about the cannabis reform question on the Nevada ballot at that time ( the " legalization " of up to an ounce , which failed . )
First , on medical marijuana :
We have to correct the attitude that this is medicine , that this is simply as safe as alcohol and tobacco .
I mean , we already have 55 million people who are cigarette smokers and over 100 million who are users of alcohol .
We have problem drinkers and certainly are concerned about the health consequences of cigarettes , but we have 16 million people who are users of drugs , most of that is marijuana .
Now , would the 16 million grow or would it shrink if we decriminalized it ?
What health consequences , John ?
Cancer ?
Emphysema ?
Deaths ?
The first thing wrong here , before we look at some more , is that you know and I know that tobacco and alcohol are not " safe " .
Tobacco - related illnesses kill 350,000 people in America each year and John Walters says they are " concerned " .
A lady down the street from me was diagnosed with tobacco cancer last year and was dead in 3 months .
Her son freaked out due to the stress and had a psychotic break that has only recently gone into remission .
The death of the tobacco smoking mom was a tragedy for her son and her husband .
Tobacco causes cancer .
There is no credible challenge to this .
Back to John and tobacco supporting marijuana propaganda :
I mean , we try to control cigarettes and alcohol , but still many more kids have access to cigarettes and alcohol .
So the way in which the disease of addiction is spread is by non-addictive users .
They 're the carriers of this disease .
If we unleash non-addictive use , we are going to increase the spread of the disease of addiction , so instead of six million people , we 'll have something more approximate to the 55 million smokers or the number of problem drinkers we have .
The disease of addiction is " carried " by " non-addictive users " ?
WTF is he talking about ?
I try to grasp this but I am afraid I 'll go blind .
Is he trying to say that because I function just fine I am a threat to others ?
Team Bush 's style of logic is all over this mess .
On to the hardcore lying :
Many people who are dying of smoking - related cancers smoke up to the end because cigarettes make them feel better , but it would be outrageous for cigarette companies to claim that makes tobacco medicine and we ought to give it to people .
The fact is , I would like to save smoked marijuana -- we 're doing research to isolate elements of it that are medicine .
But there is a dimension of this issue that is the con and it's extremely cruel , using suffering people to suggest that this is efficacious medicine .
It has three to five times as much tar and carbon monoxide as cigarettes , smoked marijuana does .
It suppresses the immune system .
It is a dangerous carcinogenic substance , and it 's not medicine .
John 's not alone .
Here 's Karen Tandy of the DEA playing the same tune :
Smoking a marijuana cigarette deposits about three to five times more tar into the lungs than one filtered tobacco cigarette .
34
Consequently , regular marijuana smokers suffer from many of the same health problems as tobacco smokers , such as chronic coughing and wheezing , chest colds , and chronic bronchitis.35
In fact , studies show that smoking three to four joints per day causes at least as much harm to the respiratory system as smoking a full pack of cigarettes every day .
36 Marijuana smoke also contains 50 to 70 percent more carcinogenic hydrocarbons than tobacco smoke and produces high levels of an enzyme that converts certain hydrocarbons into malignant cells .
37
Well ....
Where are the bodies ?
Really , if this was an issue we would know about it much like we know tobacco causes cancer and lung disease .
Scientific studies merely confirm what people have noticed over the years .
Here 's a quote from WebMD citing of the most recent study :
While a clear increase in cancer risk was seen among cigarette smokers in the study , no such association was seen for regular cannabis users .
Even very heavy , long - term marijuana users who had smoked more than 22,000 joints over a lifetime seemed to have no greater risk than infrequent marijuana users or nonusers .
The findings surprised the study ’s researchers , who expected to see an increase in cancer among people who smoked marijuana regularly in their youth .
" We know that there are as many or more carcinogens and co-carcinogens in marijuana smoke as in cigarettes , " researcher Donald Tashkin , MD , of UCLA ’s David Geffen School of Medicine tells WebMD .
" But we did not find any evidence for an increase in cancer risk for even heavy marijuana smoking . "
Carcinogens are substances that cause cancer .
So there are carcinogens in marijuana smoke , most likely the same ones in smoked tobacco , related to burning vegetation .
But the cancers are absent .
Let 's repeat that in different ways :
While two - pack - a - day or more cigarette smokers were found to have a 20 - fold increase in lung cancer risk , no elevation in risk was seen for even the very heaviest marijuana smokers .
The more tobacco a person smoked , the greater their risk of developing lung cancer and other cancers of the head and neck .
But people who smoked more marijuana were not at increased risk compared with people who smoked less and people who did n’t smoke at all .
I want to look at 3 main problems with comparing cannabis to tobacco :
Tobacco smoke is known to be carcinogenic , aided and abetted by nicotine .
Specifically , nicotine appears to encourage the growth of neoplasms .
Cannabis has shown repeatedly that it slows and discourages the growth of neoplasms
While there are tars and other nasty things in cannabis smoke ( stuff ya make fuels and plastics with .... ) the cannabinoids and THC appear to work to discourage cancer development .
[ See more @ Web - MD ]
Tobacco - smokers - generally - smoke 10 to 20 time more tobacco than pot smokers smoke pot .
Especially with the " strong pot " we are now supposed to fear .
Let 's compare tobacco smoking and marijuana smoking , shall we ?
At approximately 1 gram of tobacco per cigarette , the average pack - a- day smoker smokes 20 grams of tobacco per day ; 140 grams in a week .
An ounce is 28 gm .
The pack - a- day smoker smokes about 5 ounces a week ; the common 2 pack - a - day person , cited in the study above as at huge risk of cancer , smokes over half a pound of tobacco EACH WEEK .
I smoke pot .
I do n't drink , use tobacco or other hard drugs .
I smoke pot only .
I do n't gamble or play the lottery either .
I do love coffee .
I am a boring SOB .
But I do smoke pot .
Depending on quality an ounce will last me 2 - 3 weeks of relatively frequent smoking .
I might smoke 3 - 4 grams on a Saturday or Sunday if it 's the cheap stuff I normally can get .
I smoke a lot less of the good stuff that Walters want to scare you about .
When I am busy , I smoke a lot less , when I am free to relax , I smoke more .
When I run out , which happens frequently , I curse republicans and the government , feel resentful , and move on .
I will sometimes go weeks without any , though that 's rare .
Ask a 2 pack - a - day smoker to stop for just one week .
All marijuana prohibition does is make it difficult and dangerous and expensive for me to have a little pot around for when I want it .
Thus I say the cigarette analogy just shows how stupid prohibitionists are , how stupid they think you are , and how fucking worthless the media is .
And do note that it dovetails beautifully with the GOP / Conservative hatred of science and their love of prisons .
The facts are that tobacco is addictive , causes cancer , causes lung diseases , and kills 350000 Americans each year while cannabis does not kill anbody , does not cause cancer , and does n't demonstrate the raw physical addiction witnessed in tobacco smokers and some drinkers .
It 's just not there .
Face it : cannabis is even safer than our food supply - you do n't hear any stories about people dying from e.coli contamination .
Do you ?
While smoking anything may be a questionable choice , tobacco is extremely bad for your health while cannabis is not .
Yet , tobacco is legal and cannabis is not .
This is a fundamental and chronic problem .
And with police spending their manhours and resources arresting 750000 people each year for touching marijuana , it is a political opportunity for crafty politicians .
More about that in a moment .
Do n't listen to John Walters .
He 's a highly paid professional liar who represents nothing but republican and corporate interests ( yes , I repeat myself ) .
He has zero credibility and his official efforts support and exacerbate the ongoing disaster in the War on Drugs .
Just forget anything he 's ever told you that you still remember .
Walters ,
Tandy ,
The DEA , the ONDCP , the UNDCP - full of shit one and all .
Their collective goal is to reinforce cannabis propaganda , maintain ignorance of the realities , and , apparently , stump for the tobacco companies .
And please do n't be stupid .
Nobody told anybody to go smoke pot .
A few people will raise this objection .
It 's ok - they are just good citizens - doing as they have been trained to do .
This effort to educate people about cannabis prohibition is about ending an unmitigated failure and about freeing up massive police resources to do some real work .
Your government lies to you through its teeth about marijuana for a variety of reasons and now I suggest that you have a chat with your Democratic representative about talking about cannabis reform .
When people can hear people talking about cannabis reform like sane adults on television things will change .
The Democratic party needs to support medical cannabis and reform of the war on drugs .
All they need to do is talk about it .
This will help crack the mainstream media blockade against rational cannabis reform discourse and start the movement towards healthier solutions .

Advertising executive Rachel North , who had survived a horrific rape , was a commuter at King 's Cross when a suicide bomber stepped onto her train and killed 26 people .
Rachel , 36 , survived , but came under attack yet again - this time by a cyberstalker who terrorised her for over a year .
Now , a week after her stalker was jailed , Rachel , who lives in North London , tells her story of survival , recovery and hope .
Thursday , July 7 , 2005 , began with me waking , curled into my boyfriend 's back .
I showered , dressed , we kissed and he wished me good luck .
I did n't know then how much luck I would need that day .
I headed out to the kiosk at Finsbury Park station to buy Marie Claire magazine before boarding the train to work .
The magazine , published that day , contained a story about me , and I was nervous and excited to read it .
Scroll down for more ...
I hurried on to the Piccadilly line platform , and the crush of people and noise of the train faded away as I started to read the story of the rape ordeal that nearly cost me my life .
As I read it , I relived it all again .
My heart beat faster and my breathing was shallow .
The next Tube arrived and I decided to board at the front of the train , where I might have a little more space to read that article again .
I got onto the train and stood by the yellow pole in the centre of the standing area .
At King 's Cross , the doors slid open , and I was pushed towards the centre of the carriage .
Though I did n't know it at the time , somewhere behind me , boarding through the middle set of doors was a young Jamaicanborn British man with a rucksack .
It contained 10lb of explosives .
Germaine Lindsay , 19 years old , had chosen this rush - hour morning at King 's Cross station , and this carriage in which to die .
The train started to move .
I took a deep breath and unclenched my fists .
It was impossible to read any more , so I read the adverts on the train walls .
Suddenly , I felt rather than heard an explosion ; it was as if I had been punched violently in both ears .
The world went black , and it felt like I had been plunged underwater .
Everything had changed in a heartbeat .
And the thought flashed through me .
' Not again .
Not bloody again .'
It was almost exactly three years since the early hours of Friday July 17 , 2002 , when I had forced my way out of my North London flat , naked and covered in blood , with my hands bound behind my back and a wire noose around my neck , screaming as I threw my body across the bonnet of a police car .
I had arrived home earlier that night to our empty ground - floor flat - my boyfriend ( whom I prefer to keep anonymous , but known as Jay ) was working late .
I went straight to sleep but was woken by the doorbell .
I pulled a dressing gown around me and got out of bed , thinking Jay must have forgotten his key .
As I stepped into the communal hall , I could see a figure through the fluted glass of the front door .
A voice said : " It 's your neighbour - there 's been an accident . "
I opened the door cautiously .
But it was wrenched from my hands and a stranger pushed me back through the door of my flat .
He punched me in the face as hard as he could , my nose poured blood , and the world whirled .
I was on the floor , and he kicked me in the chest .
Then in the ribs , then he aimed at my face , and I curled into a ball , trying to protect myself .
I could only whimper " please do n't , please do n't " .
He grabbed a fistful of my hair , and I could see he was tearing off his T - shirt .
He forced it over my head as a hood and the beating began again .
My top lip burst like a ripe tomato .
The punch on the nose made me want to vomit .
I felt my dressing gown being torn off me and I realised he was raping me , muttering : " Bitch .
Whore . "
I kept very still .
I felt him yanking my arms behind my back and tying my wrists .
He went into the bathroom and tied something round my neck .
I could feel myself losing hope that I would survive .
The blows were coming harder and angrier .
Then it occurred to me to play dead .
I waited for a blow to the head , collapsed , gurgled and held my breath .
There was a hiss .
He stubbed his cigarette out on my face .
The wetness of my blood extinguished it at once .
I continued to pretend to be dead , hardly breathing .
But I was losing consciousness .
Perhaps two hours later I started to come round , lying on the floor with my arms tied behind me .
I was naked with something hanging around my neck .
The front door of the flat was open into the communal hall .
I stumbled down the outside steps as a police car screeched to a halt .
I did n't know it but my neighbours had heard me try to get out of my flat and dialled 999 .
I threw myself across the bonnet .
The two officers stared at me in shock .
I screamed at them to cut the noose off my neck .
It was the lead from my electric toothbrush charger .
An ambulance took me to hospital .
The police doctor noted 40 injuries and took swabs .
My head was stitched and at last Jay was brought in , and the first words he said were : " Oh , honey . "
He wanted to take my hand , but they made him put on rubber gloves first .
That was when I cried , because he was the first one to treat me like a person that night - not as a crime scene or prey - and they would n't let him touch me .
It was five months before police arrested an itinerant mugger who had come over illegally from Jamaica in May 2002 .
He had beaten and robbed many other women .
He was 17 .
I had been 31 at the time of the attack .
The love of Jay and my family and friends helped me slowly recover from the ordeal , something which was part of a savage world which had no relation to the one I had been brought in .
I had grown up in a Norfolk vicarage with my brother and sister .
I studied English and Theology at university and settled into a career in advertising in London .
Before the rape , my life was ordinary , sometimes stressful , generally good .
But my anger afterwards helped me from sinking into total despair .
In January 2004 , I faced my attacker in a courtroom and saw him sentenced to 15 years .
A year later , I talked to Marie Claire about my story , because I wanted to do something to help other rape victims .
This was the story I was reading and reliving on the Piccadilly line three years later in the minutes before I was blown up .
The bomb was detonated seven to ten feet away from me .
I was once more on the floor , in darkness , struggling under a heavy , gasping body .
Once more the overwhelming blow to the head , the utter darkness , the blindness , the struggling for breath .
In a flash , I was transported back to the horror of the rape .
But this time I was prepared .
Because I had just read my own near - death story , I was full of adrenaline .
And this time I was not alone .
There was choking , lung - filling dust .
I breathed tiny shards of glass and thick , heavy smoke .
It made my tongue swell and crack like leather .
There was a metallic wet taste in my mouth - blood .
My lips were wet with it .
The walls dripped with it .
There was an acrid smell of chemicals and burning rubber and burning hair .
Then I heard the screams .
They did not sound human .
I realised that I was on the floor and there were squirming bodies lying on top of me .
Other people 's bodies had protected me from the worst of the blast .
I hissed air out , patted my legs , arms - they were still here .
I heard a voice , far away , say : " Are you all right ?
Stay calm . "
It was my own voice .
I saw the shapes of bodies moving in the darkness .
Some more passengers were standing up now and appealing for calm , listening for the injured .
Some of us used our mobile phone LED screens for light .
Something bad beyond words had happened behind us - but we could not see it , only hear it .
I looked back into what remained of my carriage and caught a glimpse of bodies on the floor , and of something else so horrific I could n't bear to see it .
It was hard to hear the injured people 's fainter cries , because of the terrified screaming .
As the temperature rose , it became extremely hard not to panic .
It seemed likely that we would die trapped underground .
It took everything I had not to join in the screams .
Only the thought that I refused to die screaming and clawing like a trapped animal held me back .
The driver was telling us we must leave the train .
Hands helped me down the ladder of the driver 's cab .
The screams were fading as we walked down the narrow tracks .
There were groans of a seriously injured man being carried behind me .
The women walking near me listened , talked and we tried to make jokes .
It took 15 minutes to walk down the tunnel to Russell Square and I saw something shiny poking out of my wrist , jammed into the bone .
It was bleeding everywhere and I staggered , but a woman caught me .
Hands were lifting me off the tracks and onto the platform .
They pulled my split wrist and I screamed .
A small piece of metal was jerked out of the bone and it fell onto the tracks .
In the lift , people were falling sideways , eyes staring with shock .
Some were covered in blood .
All of them were filthy , with black faces like chimney sweeps .
I staggered onto the pavement outside and rang Jay , leaving a message .
I was terrified that he was travelling on the train behind me and that he was dead .
I realised I was covered in a sticky black film of chemicals and blood .
Not all of the blood was mine .
I was in deep shock .
I rang a colleague , Jenna , who arrived in a taxi and bandaged my wrist as we headed for hospital .
It was nearly 9.45 am .
As we drove past Tavistock Square there was a dull ' crump ' that made the taxi windows rattle .
Later , I found out that it was the bus , targeted by another of the bombers , exploding on the other side of the trees .
We arrived at University College Hospital and they picked glass out of my arm .
Every time I moved , small pieces of glass fell off me .
I started to get angry with myself because I thought I had somehow failed the passengers and done the wrong thing in leaving the train .
The phone beeped with a message from Jay .
He was in his office at the law firm he works for , and he was alive .
Finally , I was allowed to leave hospital and I saw Jay loping calmly across the road , smiling at me .
I threw myself into his arms .
" I can always trust you to end up in trouble , " he told me , squeezing my hand .
I could n't stop smiling ; I was starting to feel invincible .
When we got home , I had a shower and the water ran black for five minutes .
We went to bed but I could n't sleep - there was still the smell of smoke and blood in my nose and throat .
I got up , turned on my computer and slivers of glass still stuck in my hair fell onto the keyboard .
I started writing , posting my story and my thoughts on an internet bulletin board for thousands of Londoners giving their accounts of what happened that day .
As I wrote , I realised my face was wet with tears and sweat .
Other people started messaging back immediately , give their support .
Finally , I fell asleep in the early hours .
When I opened my eyes on July 8 , there was a sickly fire taste in my mouth .
My ears were still ringing , and they ached .
I wondered how many more people were waking up and wondering what had happened to them yesterday .
I went to the study and switched on the computer , logging onto the message board where I had posted my story the night before .
There were now dozens of messages posted in response to my account .
I started to cry with gratitude that all these people were thinking of me .
Over the next few weeks , I had trouble sleeping and threw myself into work as adrenaline kept me going .
I organised a gathering with other survivors , and we decided to call ourselves King 's Cross United .
I had counselling , but the flashbacks continued .
Sitting in a hairdresser 's , I suddenly caught a whiff of scorched hair and a smell of chemicals , and had to rush outside .
I knew it was a posttraumatic shock reaction .
I wanted to be the confident , cheerful woman I had been before , but I had changed in those months .
I did not feel lucky : I felt cursed .
Six months to day after the bomb had exploded , King 's Cross United gathered at King 's Cross station , about 30 of us including the driver of the train , for our own private service .
Then we walked to St Pancras church , where I laid 26 white roses , one for each person who had died .
Walking away , I felt the release of emotion as I linked arms with the others .
We went to the pub , and I looked at the smiling faces of the men and women around me and we raised a toast .
" Take that , terrorists . "
Cheers .
But my story was n't over .
While I was writing up these memories , feeling happy about my new life and impending wedding - Jay asked me to marry him seven months after the blast - a third stranger attacked me .
This time , there was no physical violence .
Instead , a woman whom I had never met began to write to and about me on an almost daily basis , making the most hurtful allegations .
Felicity Lowde accused me - through postings on internet message boards - of lying about the rape and not being a real bomb victim .
She claimed my efforts to help myself and other victims by campaigning for an inquiry , setting up support groups and raising awareness of post - traumatic stress , were " making a living on the backs of the dead " .
After I posted online blogs telling of nights where I would wake crying from nightmares about the screams on the train , and my continuing ' survivor guilt ' , she cruelly asked me : " Why did you not stay and help the dying ? "
It was psychological war , and in some ways it was worse than the rape and the bomb , because the rapist and bomber were strangers who unleashed brutal violence knowing nothing about me , even my name .
This woman used psychological violence to try to destroy everything I had re-built after the rape and bombing : my new work as a writercampaigner , and my happiness as a bride - to - be .
It was devastating .
I was terrified , because having been the victim of stranger hatred twice already , I found that my symptoms of nightmares , exhaustion , depression , guilt and despair , already triggered by writing the book , were becoming almost unbearable .
I stopped working at home and moved into an office in order to finish the book I was writing about my experiences , because I felt she was attacking me in my home , my safe place .
I work online , and I get many anonymous e-mails from trauma victims asking for my help .
So I could n't switch my computer , and her , off .
Last month , she was sentenced in court after having been found guilty of harassment .
She had gone on the run for two months while continuing to escalate her hate campaign .
The district judge gave her the maximum sentence , but my tormentor has already announced she intends to appeal and put me through giving evidence all over again .
So lightning has struck me three times .
Three strangers have sought to destroy me using weapons of malice .
Do I feel cursed ?
No , I feel lucky .
Lucky to have such support , from Jay , who is now my husband , family , friends and from hundreds of strangers - readers of my web diary and fellow passengers whom I have met since 7/7 and are now my friends .
I 've learned how strong and kind most people are , and I feel blessed that I 'm still here , still living , still learning , feeling proud and privileged to share my story .
I hope that telling it helps other people .
I am out of the tunnel now , and I raise a glass to the light that I have seen in other people , that has kept me going through the darkest of days .

U.S. Government Threatens Retaliation Against States who Reject REAL ID
REAL ID is the U.S. government plan to impose uniform regulations on state driver ’s licenses .
It ’s a national ID card , in all but cosmetic form .
( Here is my essay on the security costs and benefits .
These two sites are also good resources . )
Most states hate it : 17 have passed legislation rejecting REAL ID , and many others have such legislation somewhere in process .
Now it looks like the federal government is upping the ante , and threatening retaliation against those states that do n’t implement REAL ID :
The cards would be mandatory for all “ federal purposes , ” which include boarding an airplane or walking into a federal building , nuclear facility or national park , Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff told the National Conference of State Legislatures last week .
Citizens in states that do n’t comply with the new rules will have to use passports for federal purposes .
This sounds tough , but it ’s a lot of bluster .
The states that have passed anti-REAL - ID legislation lean both Republican and Democrat .
The federal government just ca n’t say that citizens of — for example — Georgia ( which passed a bill in May authorizing the Governor to delay implementation of REAL ID ) can’t walk into a federal courthouse without a passport .
Or ca n’t board an airplane without a passport — imagine the lobbying by Delta Airlines here .
They just can’t .

He should go to Washington more often .
Gordon Brown may have been dreading his encounter with George Bush , knowing that every appearance Tony Blair made alongside the American president cost him votes by the crateload , but Monday 's joint press conference at Camp David actually did Brown a favour .
There was Bush , alternating between two of his least appealing personas : either frat - boy , mocking Nick Robinson 's baldness , or cowboy , vowing his determination to track down the " cold - blooded killers " who do " evil " .
By turns he was condescending , telling Brown he had " proved his worthiness as a leader " during June 's thwarted terror attacks , and rambling , eventually admitting that he was going on " too long " .
Next to Bush , Brown had only to read his script to look like a master communicator .
That 's not all that went well .
Brown wanted his Washington debut to look nothing like the Bush - Blair love-ins of the past , and he succeeded .
Out went the groin - squeezingly tight jeans , in came the suits .
No more " George " , now it was Mr President .
No more hugs between Laura and Cherie ; this time the wives stayed at home .
The backslaps were gone too , replaced by a shake of the hand .
Every sign spelled out the same message : strictly business .
To the naked eye it may have seemed as if these superficial matters of body language and costume were all that had changed .
But a close reading of Brown 's words at Camp David , and indeed the content of his entire trip to the US , including his appearance at the United Nations yesterday , suggest otherwise .
They indicate a shift not only in the so - called special relationship , but a deeper , strategic rethink in what Brown pointedly does not call " the war on terror " .
That much was visible in the wide cracks of daylight the prime minister opened up between himself and the president .
Yes , there were multiple avowals of shared purpose and common values .
But while the president said the west confronted " an ideology of darkness " , Brown declared that " terrorism is not a cause ; it is a crime " .
That immediately denies the terrorist the dignity of an enemy and casts him instead as a mere criminal , to be hunted down chiefly by policework and intelligence .
Noticeable too was Brown 's desire to be specific : the conflict was not with " terror " - an abstract noun - but " al - Qaida - inspired terrorism " .
The differences were even clearer on Iraq .
Bush still speaks with righteous zeal for the mission , but Brown offered only the flat statement that Britain had " duties to discharge and responsibilities to keep . "
It was left to Bush to say that " Gordon Brown understands that failure in Iraq would be a disaster for the security of our countries " , but the prime minister said nothing to confirm that statement of his views .
Bush still refers to Iraq as the " central front " in the war on terror , but Brown named Afghanistan as the " frontline " .
Above all , Brown put the US on notice for an eventual withdrawal of British troops from Iraq , dependent on the word of military commanders on the ground .
Since that is the same formulation Bush himself uses , he could hardly object .
It 's not quite Hugh Grant sticking it to Billy Bob Thornton in Love Actually , but this is about as far as a British prime minister could reasonably be expected to go in putting an American president at arms length .
No , he did n't call Bush a deranged Texan gunslinger but nor did he return a single one of Bush 's copious personal compliments .
While the president tried to warm the air with talk of the " humorous Scotsman " , Brown said their talks had been " full and frank " - icy diplomatese for a row .
If breaking the clammy hug Blair and Bush shared was the goal , it certainly worked .
A headline in yesterday 's Washington Post declared of Brown : " More bulldog than poodle . "
The Brown team would love to see that verdict repeated on every British front page , but this is about more than political positioning , fleeing an American president whose embrace has proved so toxic .
It conceals a deep shift in what has been the central geopolitical question since September 2001 .
Put simply , Brown sees the struggle against radical Islamism entirely differently from Bush , and therefore Blair .
While their focus was on rogue regimes that posed a threat to the west , and the use of force to remove them , Brown sees a battle for the hearts and minds of the Muslim world .
While the favoured comparison of the Bush - Blair era was the second world war against Hitler and fascism , Brown looks to the cold war with Soviet communism .
That conflict was long and , of course , had a military dimension extending to a nuclear arms race and proxy conflicts across the globe .
But no less important , Brown believes , was the defeat of the intellectual case for communism .
In an article in Monday 's Washington Post , Brown recalled the educational and cultural links and exchanges between the west and those behind the iron curtain that steadily eroded the latter 's faith in the Soviet system .
This leads to an intriguing possibility , that Brown is advocating a process of systematic cultural engagement with the civil societies of the Arab and Muslim world - involving the " schools , universities , museums , churches , trade unions " whose engagement in the cold war he invokes so warmly .
Perhaps more importantly , Brown wants the west to regain the moral high ground he believes is essential to victory in any ideological struggle .
He 's long been an advocate on Aids , poverty and debt .
But now there 's an added urgency .
If the west is seen to be acting justly , then it will be that much harder for Osama bin Laden to rail against wicked western imperialism .
This is the right context to judge Brown 's activity at the UN yesterday .
With more passion than he ever showed at Camp David , he called for a " coalition of conscience " to implement the millennium development goals and for the deployment of more than 19,000 blue - helmeted UN troops in Darfur , because he believes in those moves - but also because he reckons they will blunt al - Qaida 's rhetorical blade .
As he wrote in the Post : " We must expose the contrast between great objectives to tackle global poverty and honour human dignity and the evils of terrorists who would bomb and maim people ... indifferent to the very existence of human life . "
This amounts to a new philosophy in the conflict against jihadism .
Instead of simply installing new regimes in the Muslim world , it seeks to prove itself the moral superior of violent Islamism .
That would have enormous implications , invalidating almost every aspect of the " war on terror " as it has so far been conducted , from Guantánamo to Abu Ghraib to the invasion of Iraq itself .
( It might also count against some of Brown 's own ideas , such as extending to 56 days the period of detention without charge . )
Artfully , Brown has so far brought Bush with him , winning his backing on Darfur , for example .
But he will need other allies , which is why his praise at Camp David was for America rather than the Bush administration , and why he made a point of visiting congressional leaders on Capitol Hill .
From now on , the special relationship will be with the US , not the Bush White House .
If only because Brown knows that Bush will be gone in 18 months - and he has every intention of staying in office much longer .

List of Best and Worst practices for designing a high traffic website
Here is a checklist of the factors that affect your rankings with Google , Bing , Yahoo ! and the other search engines .
The list contains positive , negative and neutral factors because all of them exist .
Most of the factors in the checklist apply mainly to Google and partially to Bing , Yahoo ! and all the other search engines of lesser importance .
If you need more information on particular sections of the checklist , you may want to read our SEO tutorial , which gives more detailed explanations of Keywords , Links , Metatags , Visual Extras , etc .
Keywords 1 Keywords in < title > tag
This is one of the most important places to have a keyword because what is written inside the < title > tag shows in search results as your page title .
The title tag must be short ( 6 or 7 words at most ) and the the keyword must be near the beginning .
+3 2 Keywords in URL Keywords in URLs help a lot - e.g. - http://domainname.com/seo-services.html, where “ SEO services ” is the keyword phrase you attempt to rank well for .
But if you do n't have the keywords in other parts of the document , do n't rely on having them in the URL .
+3 3 Keyword density in document text Another very important factor you need to check .
3 - 7 % for major keywords is best , 1 - 2 for minor .
Keyword density of over 10 % is suspicious and looks more like keyword stuffing , than a naturally written text .
+3 4 Keywords in anchor text
Also very important , especially for the anchor text of inbound links , because if you have the keyword in the anchor text in a link from another site , this is regarded as getting a vote from this site not only about your site in general , but about the keyword in particular .
+3 5 Keywords in headings (< H1 > , < H2 > , etc. tags )
One more place where keywords count a lot .
But beware that your page has actual text about the particular keyword .
+3 6 Keywords in the beginning of a document Also counts , though not as much as anchor text , title tag or headings .
However , have in mind that the beginning of a document does not necessarily mean the first paragraph – for instance if you use tables , the first paragraph of text might be in the second half of the table .
+2 7 Keywords in < alt > tags Spiders do n't read images but they do read their textual descriptions in the < alt > tag , so if you have images on your page , fill in the < alt > tag with some keywords about them .
+2 8 Keywords in metatags Less and less important , especially for Google .
Yahoo ! and Bing still rely on them , so if you are optimizing for Yahoo ! or Bing , fill these tags properly .
In any case , filling these tags properly will not hurt , so do it .
+1 9 Keyword proximity Keyword proximity measures how close in the text the keywords are .
It is best if they are immediately one after the other ( e.g. “ dog food ” ) , with no other words between them .
For instance , if you have “ dog ” in the first paragraph and “ food ” in the third paragraph , this also counts but not as much as having the phrase “ dog food ” without any other words in between .
Keyword proximity is applicable for keyword phrases that consist of 2 or more words .
+1 10 Keyword phrases
In addition to keywords , you can optimize for keyword phrases that consist of several words – e.g. “ SEO services ” .
It is best when the keyword phrases you optimize for are popular ones , so you can get a lot of exact matches of the search string but sometimes it makes sense to optimize for 2 or 3 separate keywords ( “ SEO ” and “ services ” ) than for one phrase that might occasionally get an exact match .
+1 11 Secondary keywords
Optimizing for secondary keywords can be a golden mine because when everybody else is optimizing for the most popular keywords , there will be less competition ( and probably more hits ) for pages that are optimized for the minor words .
For instance , “ real estate new jersey ” might have thousand times less hits than “ real estate ” only but if you are operating in New Jersey , you will get less but considerably better targeted traffic .
+1 12 Keyword stemming For English this is not so much of a factor because words that stem from the same root ( e.g. dog , dogs , doggy , etc. ) are considered related and if you have “ dog ” on your page , you will get hits for “ dogs ” and “ doggy ” as well , but for other languages keywords stemming could be an issue because different words that stem from the same root are considered as not related and you might need to optimize for all of them .
+1 13 Synonyms
Optimizing for synonyms of the target keywords , in addition to the main keywords .
This is good for sites in English , for which search engines are smart enough to use synonyms as well , when ranking sites but for many other languages synonyms are not taken into account , when calculating rankings and relevancy .
+1 14 Keyword Mistypes
Spelling errors are very frequent and if you know that your target keywords have popular misspellings or alternative spellings ( i.e. Christmas and Xmas ) , you might be tempted to optimize for them .
Yes , this might get you some more traffic but having spelling mistakes on your site does not make a good impression , so you 'd better do n't do it , or do it only in the metatags .
0 15 Keyword dilution
When you are optimizing for an excessive amount of keywords , especially unrelated ones , this will affect the performance of all your keywords and even the major ones will be lost ( diluted ) in the text .
- 2 16 Keyword stuffing
Any artificially inflated keyword density ( 10 % and over ) is keyword stuffing and you risk getting banned from search engines .
- 3
Links - internal , inbound , outbound 17 Anchor text of inbound links
As discussed in the Keywords section , this is one of the most important factors for good rankings .
It is best if you have a keyword in the anchor text but even if you do n't , it is still OK .
However , do n't use the same anchor text all the time because this is also penalized by Google .
Try to use synonyms , keyword stemming , or simply the name of your site instead +3 18 Origin of inbound links Besides the anchor text , it is important if the site that links to you is a reputable one or not .
Generally sites with greater Google PR are considered reputable .
Links from poor sites and link farms can do real harm to you , so avoid them at all costs .
+3 19 Links from similar sites Generally the more , the better .
But the reputation of the sites that link to you is more important than their number .
Also important is their anchor text ( and its diversity ) , the lack / presence of keyword (s ) in it , the link age , etc. +3 20 Links from .edu and .gov sites
These links are precious because .edu and .gov sites are more reputable than .com .
.biz , .info , etc. domains .
Additionally , such links are hard to obtain .
+3 21 Number of backlinks Generally the more , the better .
But the reputation of the sites that link to you is more important than their number .
Also important is their anchor text , is there a keyword in it , how old are they , etc. +3 22 Anchor text of internal links
This also matters , though not as much as the anchor text of inbound links .
+2 23 Around - the - anchor text
The text that is immediately before and after the anchor text also matters because it further indicates the relevance of the link – i.e. if the link is artificial or it naturally flows in the text .
+2 24 Age of inbound links
The older , the better .
Getting many new links in a short time suggests buying them .
+2 25 Links from directories Could work , though it strongly depends on which directories .
Being listed in DMOZ , Yahoo Directory and similar directories is a great boost for your ranking but having tons of links from PR0 directories is useless or even harmful because it can even be regarded as link spamming , if you have hundreds or thousands of such links .
+2 26 Number of outgoing links on the page that links to you The fewer , the better for you because this way your link looks more important .
+1 27 Named anchors Named anchors ( the target place of internal links ) are useful for internal navigation but are also useful for SEO because you stress additionally that a particular page , paragraph or text is important .
In the code , named anchors look like this : < A href= “ #dogs ” > Read about dogs </ A> and “ # dogs ” is the named anchor .
+1 28 IP address of inbound link Google denies that they discriminate against links that come from the same IP address or C class of addresses , so for Google the IP address can be considered neutral to the weight of inbound links .
However , Bing and Yahoo ! may discard links from the same IPs or IP classes , so it is always better to get links from different IPs .
+1 29 Inbound links from link farms and other suspicious sites Presumably , this does not affect you , provided the links are not reciprocal .
The idea is that it is beyond your control to define what a link farm links to , so you do n't get penalized when such sites link to you because this is not your fault .
However , some recent changes to the Google algorithm suggest the opposite .
This is why , you must always stay away from link farms and other suspicious sites or if you see they link to you , contact their webmaster and ask the link to be removed .
0 30 Many outgoing links
Google does not like pages that consists mainly of links , so you 'd better keep them under 100 per page .
Having many outgoing links does not get you any benefits in terms of ranking and could even make your situation worse .
- 1 31 Excessive linking , link spamming
It is bad for your rankings , when you have many links to / from the same sites ( even if it is not a cross - linking scheme or links to bad neighbors ) because it suggests link buying or at least spamming .
In the best case only some of the links are taken into account for SEO rankings .
- 1 32 Outbound links to link farms and other suspicious sites Unlike inbound links from link farms and other suspicious sites , outbound links to bad neighbors can drown you .
You need periodically to check the status of the sites you link to because sometimes good sites become bad neighbors and vice versa .
- 3 33 Cross - linking Cross - linking occurs when site A links to site B , site B links to site C and site C links back to site A .
This is the simplest example but more complex schemes are possible .
Cross - linking looks like disguised reciprocal link trading and is penalized .
- 3 34 Single pixel links when you have a link that is a pixel or so wide it is invisible for humans , so nobody will click on it and it is obvious that this link is an attempt to manipulate search engines .
-3
Metatags 35 < Description > metatag Metatags are becoming less and less important but if there are metatags that still matter , these are the < description > and < keywords > ones .
Use the < Description > metatag to write the description of your site .
Besides the fact that metatags still rock on Bing and Yahoo ! , the < Description > metatag has one more advantage – it sometimes pops in the description of your site in search results .
+1 36 < Keywords > metatag
The < Keywords > metatag also matters , though as all metatags it gets almost no attention from Google and some attention from Bing and Yahoo !
Keep the metatag reasonably long – 10 to 20 keywords at most .
Do n't stuff the < Keywords > tag with keywords that you do n't have on the page , this is bad for your rankings .
+1 37 < Language > metatag
If your site is language - specific , do n't leave this tag empty .
Search engines have more sophisticated ways of determining the language of a page than relying on the < language > metatag but they still consider it .
+1 38 < Refresh > metatag
The < Refresh > metatag is one way to redirect visitors from your site to another .
Only do it if you have recently migrated your site to a new domain and you need to temporarily redirect visitors .
When used for a long time , the < refresh > metatag is regarded as unethical practice and this can hurt your ratings .
In any case , redirecting through 301 is much better .
- 1
Content 39 Unique content Having more content ( relevant content , which is different from the content on other sites both in wording and topics ) is a real boost for your site 's rankings .
+3 40 Frequency of content change Frequent changes are favored .
It is great when you constantly add new content but it is not so great when you only make small updates to existing content .
+3 41 Keywords font size
When a keyword in the document text is in a larger font size in comparison to other on - page text , this makes it more noticeable , so therefore it is more important than the rest of the text .
The same applies to headings ( < h1 > , < h2 > , etc. ) , which generally are in larger font size than the rest of the text .
+2 42 Keywords formatting Bold and italic are another way to emphasize important words and phrases .
However , use bold , italic and larger font sizes within reason because otherwise you might achieve just the opposite effect .
+2 43
Age of document Recent documents ( or at least regularly updated ones ) are favored .
+2 44 File size Generally long pages ( i.e. 1,500 - 2,000 words or more ) are not favored , or at least you can achieve better rankings if you have 3 short ( 500 - 1,000 words ) rather than 1 long page on a given topic , so split long pages into multiple smaller ones .
On the other hand , pages with 100 - 200 words of text or less are also disliked by Google .
+1 45 Content separation
From a marketing point of view content separation ( based on IP , browser type , etc. ) might be great but for SEO it is bad because when you have one URL and differing content , search engines get confused what the actual content of the page is .
- 2 46 Poor coding and design Search engines say that they do not want poorly designed and coded sites , though there are hardly sites that are banned because of messy code or ugly images but when the design and / or coding of a site is poor , the site might not be indexable at all , so in this sense poor code and design can harm you a lot .
- 2 47 Illegal Content Using other people 's copyrighted content without their permission or using content that promotes legal violations can get you kicked out of search engines .
- 3 48 Invisible text
This is a black hat SEO practice and when spiders discover that you have text specially for them but not for humans , do n't be surprised by the penalty .
- 3 49 Cloaking Cloaking is another illegal technique , which partially involves content separation because spiders see one page ( highly - optimized , of course ) , and everybody else is presented with another version of the same page .
- 3 50 Doorway pages
Creating pages that aim to trick spiders that your site is a highly - relevant one when it is not , is another way to get the kick from search engines .
- 3 51 Duplicate content
When you have the same content on several pages on the site , this will not make your site look larger because the duplicate content penalty kicks in .
To a lesser degree duplicate content applies to pages that reside on other sites but obviously these cases are not always banned – i.e. article directories or mirror sites do exist and prosper . - 3
Visual Extras and SEO 52 JavaScript
If used wisely , it will not hurt .
But if your main content is displayed through JavaScript , this makes it more difficult for spiders to follow and if JavaScript code is a mess and spiders can't follow it , this will definitely hurt your ratings .
0 53 Images in text Having a text - only site is so boring but having many images and no text is a SEO sin .
Always provide in the < alt > tag a meaningful description of an image but do n't stuff it with keywords or irrelevant information .
0 54 Podcasts and videos Podcasts and videos are becoming more and more popular but as with all non-textual goodies , search engines can't read them , so if you do n't have the tapescript of the podcast or the video , it is as if the podcast or movie is not there because it will not be indexed by search engines .
0 55 Images instead of text links
Using images instead of text links is bad , especially when you do n't fill in the < alt > tag .
But even if you fill in the < alt > tag , it is not the same as having a bold , underlined , 16 - pt. link , so use images for navigation only if this is really vital for the graphic layout of your site .
- 1 56 Frames Frames are very , very bad for SEO .
Avoid using them unless really necessary .
- 2 57 Flash Spiders do n't index the content of Flash movies , so if you use Flash on your site , do n't forget to give it an alternative textual description .
- 2 58 A Flash home page Fortunately this epidemic disease seems to have come to an end .
Having a Flash home page ( and sometimes whole sections of your site ) and no HTML version , is a SEO suicide . -3
Domains , URLs , Web Mastery 59 Keyword - rich URLs and filenames A very important factor , especially for Yahoo ! and Bing. +3 60 Site Accessibility
Another fundamental issue , which that is often neglected .
If the site ( or separate pages ) is unaccessible because of broken links , 404 errors , password - protected areas and other similar reasons , then the site simply can't be indexed .
+3 61 Sitemap
It is great to have a complete and up - to - date sitemap , spiders love it , no matter if it is a plain old HTML sitemap or the special Google sitemap format .
+2 62 Site size Spiders love large sites , so generally it is the bigger , the better .
However , big sites become user - unfriendly and difficult to navigate , so sometimes it makes sense to separate a big site into a couple of smaller ones .
On the other hand , there are hardly sites that are penalized because they are 10,000 + pages , so do n't split your size in pieces only because it is getting larger and larger .
+2 63 Site age Similarly to wine , older sites are respected more .
The idea is that an old , established site is more trustworthy ( they have been around and are here to stay ) than a new site that has just poped up and might soon disappear .
+2 64 Site theme
It is not only keywords in URLs and on page that matter .
The site theme is even more important for good ranking because when the site fits into one theme , this boosts the rankings of all its pages that are related to this theme .
+2 65 File Location on Site File location is important and files that are located in the root directory or near it tend to rank better than files that are buried 5 or more levels below .
+1 66 Domains versus subdomains , separate domains Having a separate domain is better – i.e. instead of having blablabla .
blogspot.com , register a separate blablabla.com domain .
+1 67 Top - level domains ( TLDs ) Not all TLDs are equal .
There are TLDs that are better than others .
For instance , the most popular TLD – .com – is much better than .ws , .biz , or .info domains but ( all equal ) nothing beats an old .edu or .org domain .
+1 68 Hyphens in URLs
Hyphens between the words in an URL increase readability and help with SEO rankings .
This applies both to hyphens in domain names and in the rest of the URL .
+1 69 URL length Generally does n't matter but if it is a very long URL-s , this starts to look spammy , so avoid having more than 10 words in the URL ( 3 or 4 for the domain name itself and 6 or 7 for the rest of address is acceptable ) .
0 70 IP address Could matter only for shared hosting or when a site is hosted with a free hosting provider , when the IP or the whole C - class of IP addresses is blacklisted due to spamming or other illegal practices .
0 71 Adsense will boost your ranking Adsense is not related in any way to SEO ranking .
Google will definitely not give you a ranking bonus because of hosting Adsense ads .
Adsense might boost your income but this has nothing to do with your search rankings .
0 72 Adwords will boost your ranking Similarly to Adsense , Adwords has nothing to do with your search rankings .
Adwords will bring more traffic to your site but this will not affect your rankings in whatsoever way .
0 73 Hosting downtime Hosting downtime is directly related to accessibility because if a site is frequently down , it can't be indexed .
But in practice this is a factor only if your hosting provider is really unreliable and has less than 97 - 98 % uptime .
Try using a reputed hosting provider such as Hostgator for hosting .
- 1 74 Dynamic URLs Spiders prefer static URLs , though you will see many dynamic pages on top positions .
Long dynamic URLs ( over 100 characters ) are really bad and in any case you 'd better use a tool to rewrite dynamic URLs in something more human - and SEO - friendly .
- 1 75 Session IDs
This is even worse than dynamic URLs .
Do n't use session IDs for information that you 'd like to be indexed by spiders .
- 2 76 Bans in robots .
txt
If indexing of a considerable portion of the site is banned , this is likely to affect the nonbanned part as well because spiders will come less frequently to a “ noindex ” site .
- 2 77 Redirects ( 301 and 302 )
When not applied properly , redirects can hurt a lot – the target page might not open , or worse – a redirect can be regarded as a black hat technique , when the visitor is immediately taken to a different page .

SAN FRANCISCO --
Dozens of drivers waited for hours on end today to take advantage of a rare sight : gas in San Francisco for less than $ 3 a gallon .
The going - out - of - business deal -- $ 2.99 a gallon for regular , a penny more for higher octane -- happened at the Shell station at Sixth and Harrison streets , which closed for good around 5 p.m. after its tanks ran dry .
The lower cost gas prompted drivers from near and far to come to the South of Market station , where they waited in lines that snaked a block down Harrison Street and lasted up to three hours for some drivers .
The Chevron station across the street was selling regular gas for $ 3.57 a gallon -- for once , a steeper price than its competitor across the street .
Bob Oyster , the Shell station 's owner , had been in the news before .
He garnered national attention earlier this month when he raised the price of gas at his station to more than $ 4 a gallon in what he said was a protest of Shell .
He said that the company charges independent owners high prices , cutting his profits .
But on Wednesday -- one day before his station would close for good -- Oyster changed tack , lowered his prices and said he would pump gas until the last 6,000 gallons were gone .
He plans to turn over the station keys to Shell on Friday .
The lines started early this morning and were still going strong around 1 p.m. when attendant Si Wong hung up an " All Out " sign in the window .
Wong said the gas station still had about 4,000 gallons of regular unleaded gas left -- premium had run out an hour - and - a half earlier -- but that the computer network had gone down .
Wong was unsure when the problem would be fixed but was advising customers to move along .
Earlier , customers like Avon Curtis said it was well worth it for her to wait for 90 minutes to save $ 4 to fill up her Ford Focus .
Many of the people waiting in line said they had heard about the deal in The Chronicle or on the morning news ; some drove all the way from the East Bay and Peninsula .
" I have to think smart , I 'm a single parent so I have to budget my money , " said Curtis , a San Francisco resident and mother of six , who just bought a home in Oakland and said she has been driving back and forth a lot .
" I fill up every five days . "
Microsoft Outlaws Dzongkha
According to the Tibet News
Microsoft has barred the use of the Bhutanese government 's official term for the Bhutanese language , Dzongkha , in any of its products , citing that the term had affiliations with the Dalai Lama .
In an internal memorandum , Microsoft employees were told not to use the term Dzongkha in any Microsoft software , language lists or promotional materials since " Doing so implies affiliation with the Dalai Lama , which is not acceptable to the government of China .
In this instance , replace " Dzongkha " with ' Tibetan - Bhutan ' . "
What adds insult to injury is that , according to the Bhutanese news site Kuenselonline , the government of Bhutan , with the assistance of the Swiss Development Corporation , paid US $ 523,000 to add support for Dzongkha .
It did n't cost Microsoft a penny .
Bhutan should have spent its money on free software .
It would probably have been much cheaper , and they would have control over it .
It simply is n't true that Dzongkha is a dialect of Tibetan in the sense in which dialect is usually used .
It is n't particularly closely related .
There 's more information about Dzongkha at the Himalayan Languages Project .
The Ethnologue provides this family tree .
Nor is there any relationship between Dzongkha and the Dalai Lama .
A reader 's comment on the Pinyin News post on this topic contains this explanation by Dr. George van Driem , Director of the Himalayan Languages Project , Department of Comparative Linguistics at Leiden Universiy :
The language Dzongkha , literally " language of the fortress " , is a South Bodish language related to Dränjoke [ a language of Sikkim ] and , more distantly , to Tibetan .
Tibetan , however , belongs to a distinct sub - branch and is a Central Bodish language .
The word rDzong ( pronounced Dzong ) denotes the citadels which served as the centres of military power and higher learning throughout Bhutan since the mediaeval period .
The word rDzong has nothing to do with the name Tsong - kha - pa , literally " man from the onion district " ( 1357-1419 ) , who founded the dGe- lugs - pa ( pronounced Gelukpa or Gelup ) school of Tibetan Buddhism currently headed by the Dalai Lama .
Such confusion could only arise in the minds of speakers of Mandarin Chinese or Tibetan who are not literate in either Tibetan or Dzongkha .
Neither Mandarin Chinese nor Tibetan distinguishes phonologically between voiced and voiceless obstruent initials , unlike Dzongkha and , for example , English .
Why is it that China would object to a term that they mistakenly associate with the Dalai Lama , one of the great men in the world today , recipient of the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize ?
It is because as head of the legitimate government of Tibet he is the symbol of Tibetan resistance to the colonial rule initiated by the Chinese invasion of 1950 .
In other words , Microsoft is refusing to recognize the existence of the national language of Bhutan so as not to offend China 's sensibilities over its colonization of Tibet .
Now , I know from previous experience that I 'm going to get outraged email and comments elsewhere from apologists for colonialism complaining that I do n't know what I 'm talking about , that Tibet has been part of China for thousands of years , that when China invaded in 1950 it was merely repossessing a part of China , and that Tibetans are much better off under enlightened Chinese rule , so I 'll say a few words about this issue here in an attempt to forestall this .
If you 're not familiar with it , you can get a good idea of the Chinese government 's position here .
Some of the arguments might be valid if the underlying facts were true , but others are simply infantile .
One argument is that prior to the Chinese invasion Tibet was an oppressive , feudal society .
That was , in many ways true , but it hardly justifies colonization .
Here 's an identical argument : in the nineteenth century , China was an oppressive , corrupt , feudal society .
The European powers would therefore have been justified in invading China and incorporating it permanently into their countries .
The people who take the opposite view include the Nobel Prize Committee .
Here are a couple of excerpts from the Dalai Lama 's Nobel Prize citation , with my emphasis added :
The Norwegian Nobel Committee has decided to award the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize to the 14th Dalai Lama , Tenzin Gyatso , the religious and political leader of the Tibetan people .
The Committee wants to emphasize the fact that the Dalai Lama in his struggle for the liberation of Tibet consistently has opposed the use of violence .
He has instead advocated peaceful solutions based upon tolerance and mutual respect in order to preserve the historical and cultural heritage of his people .
There are actually two issues here .
First , has Tibet historically been a part of China , and second , even if Tibet has been part of China , are Tibetans entitled to national self - determination ?
As for the first issue , the claim that Tibet has been part of China since time immemorial , or even for the past seven hundred years , is utter nonsense .
Tibet has been independent of China for most of its history .
Imperial China claimed nominal sovereignty over every state with which it had diplomatic relations , on the theory that the Emperor could only enter into the relationship of master to vassal , including Japan , Okinawa ( an independent country until 1609 ) , Korea , and Vietnam .
If you are n't familiar with Chinese history , you can get an idea of the Imperial style from this letter sent in 1839 by Imperial Commissioner 林則徐 Lín Zé Xú to Queen Victoria demanding that she put an end to the opium trade .
In spite of China 's nominal claims of sovereignty over Tibet , Tibet was de facto an independent state and did not acknowledge Chinese sovereignty .
That is why , for example , China under the Manchus attacked Lhasa in 1720 and again in 1910 .
If Tibet were part of China , China would not have attacked it .
Tibet also fought wars with Jammu in 1841 - 1842 and with Nepal in 1854 - 55 .
Making war is of course one of the defining capacities of a sovereign nation .
The first point at which Tibet was actually ruled by the same government as China was during the Yuan dynasty , when both Tibet and China were under Mongol rule .
It was , however , the Mongols who conquered Tibet , not the Chinese .
The Mongols took over Tibet before they took over China , and once they were in power administered the two separately .
In China they exerted direct control , while in Tibet they ruled via the local rulers .
When the Mongol Empire disintegrated , Tibet regained its independence .
In the period leading up to the Chinese invasion , it is clear that as a matter of international law Tibet was an independant state .
It had a distinctive population occupying a well - defined territory under the effective control of its own government .
The government of Tibet issued coins , currency and passports that were internationally recognized .
It entered into diplomatic relations as a sovereign nation with other countries , including Nepal , Mongolia , Great Britain , and Ladakh .
Even the Republic of China negotiated with Tibet as a sovereign nation at the Simla Conference in 1913 - 1914 .
The second issue is whether Tibet is entitled to independence , whatever its prior status may have been .
Surely the answer is yes .
Tibetans have a distinctive language , culture , and sense of identity .
As defined in international law , they are a people with a right to self - determination .
To this China opposes two claims .
First , it claims that the independence of Tibet would violate China 's territorial integrity .
International law does not recognize claims of territorial integrity by illegitimate governments .
Since China does not govern
Tibet with the consent of Tibetans and has engaged in massive violations of human rights in Tibet , China cannot legitimately make any claim of territorial integrity .
The second is the argument already addressed , that Tibet was a backward country in need of enlightenment .
For a detailed examination of the question of Tibetan self - determination I recommend Tibet 's Sovereignty and the Tibetan People 's Right to Self - Determination by Andrew G. Dulaney and Dennis M. Cusack of the Tibet Justice Center and Dr. Michael van Walt van Praag of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization .
You can download the entire document as a PDF file or read it online here .
So there you have it .
China objects to the language name Dzongkha because of an imaginary association with the leader of the legitimate government of its Tibetan colony .
In order to please China , Microsoft refuses to use the generally accepted name for the national language of Bhutan .
Now there 's a company with principles .
Posted by Bill Poser at November 2 , 2005 11:59 PM
I caught an article on ABC News that pointed out that this year was the first significant drop in the poverty rate since 2000 .
Take a look at this little nugget .
The last significant decline in the poverty rate came in 2000 , during the Clinton administration .
In 2005 , the poverty rate dipped from 12.7 percent to 12.6 percent , but Census officials said that change was statistically insignificant .
See , that got me thinking .
If 2000 was the last time the poverty rate declined , how did it do under the entirety of Clinton ’s presidency ?
It ’s time for … a chart .
Let ’s start with 1989 , the year George Bush
Sr took office when poverty rates were at a record low , and move right on to this one .
Source : US Census Bureau
It ’s interesting to note that 1989 was the previous record low according to the USCB ( way to go , Gipper , I suppose ) , and that despite Bush Sr bringing it up to 15.1 % , Clinton still managed to shatter the old record .
But remember , “ tax and spend ” Democrats are bad for the economy , is n’t that right ?
Google Trends is both fascinating science and a dangerous tool .
The following example is lifted from Andrew Sullivan 's blog .
First off , this is a supreme example of turning volumes of data into useful information .
( If you data - mine , you 'll understand the amount of work needed to generate something like this , in automated fashion . )
The chart provides a comparison of the volume of traffic for different search keywords over time .
The lines are sharp , and some well - chosen amount of smoothing is applied so that some spikes are seen but not too many .
The concept of flagging certain " special " points is also admirable .
No wonder this caught the attention of lots of marketers !
However , user beware !
For unexplained reasons , all of the information required to interpret this chart is missing .
The vertical scale is missing , which means that we do not know how many searches include the word " blog " .
While the relative gap between the lines is large , the absolute difference may in fact be tiny .
Also , what sample size was used ?
How were the samples selected ?
This gets even more tricky because Google then categorizes the results by cities , regions and languages .
Do they have enough samples to make meaningful statements at that level of detail ?
Similarly , on the time scale , what kind of smoothing was employed ?
The special flags , while a wonderful concept , fall flat in practice , highlighting the limitations of machine intelligence .
On the right , I copied the headlines for the flags .
You may also be bewildered at the choice : not a one has anything to do with comparing NYT and blogs .
Such half - baked tools are very dangerous indeed , as demonstrated by Andrew 's comment .
Andrew is one of the pioneers of news blogging who eloped from mainstream media , thus his bias is well known .
Using this chart , he proclaimed : " They 're [ NYT ] doomed . "
Not so fast .
It is unfair to " spread their votes " by using " new york times " , " nytimes " and " ny times " as three separate entries .
Besides , NYT is only one publication ; pitting it against a world of blogs is absurd .
Especially when the top 8 regions searching for " blog " are outside North America !
( see the light blue bars on the right )
Meanwhile , this bar chart is also impossible to interpret .
By " normalization " , one assumes they are removing the effect of the total number of searches , or else the US will always end up at the top .
Normalization is forever a double - edged sword : if you are the marketer , even if you see Peru as having the highest % of searches using " blog " , you can't conclude that Peru is the market you should go after , since you may be worried just how widespread Internet / Google penetration is in Peru .
By hiding the scale ( again ) , Google Trends stubbornly remains just a toy .

It was the moment when " wish you were here " became " wish I were anywhere but here " .
This holidaymaker found herself stranded in her deckchair as the tide came in and started lapping at her feet .
The woman , estimated by some onlookers to weigh as much as 20 stone , had been unable to get out of the chair after its legs became firmly wedged in the shingle .

Other day trippers awaking from their afternoon naps nearby had managed to scramble to safety because their deckchairs were resting on firmer foundations .
But it took coastguards in yellow jumpsuits and wellington boots to rescue the turbanwearing tourist , said to be 49 and from Belgium .
Two of them prised her free just as the water came up the beach , watched by a crowd of onlookers .
Ronald Coleman , 74 , one of those who witnessed the distressing scene at Westcliffon - Sea , Essex , said : " The tide was racing in .
She was lucky . "
Productivity , efficiency and effectiveness are the buzzwords fueling the information age .
Entire industries have been created around our obsession with efficiency and productiveness .
We have more and more time for leisure activities but we use less and less of it for “ leisure ” ; there are too many “ work - like ” things to do — maintaining social internet accounts , leveling up in online video games , sorting photos and mp3s …
We forget that time is the only true luxury in life .
Being more productive does n’t make you a better person , the essence of being productive is to put your attention where you get the biggest returns and get more done with less investment of your time .
Use that extra time to get more enjoyment out of your life .

1. Find Your Focus with Less Distractions
Do one thing and get it finished .
Putting up barriers between yourself and distractions is one of the simplest habits for getting more done .
With multitasking we feel so busy that we fool ourselves into thinking we ’re getting more done , but so much time is lost switching between activities .
Minimize interruptions as much as possible .
Turn off all email notification ( only check for email when you ’re taking a break ) .
Forward your phone to voice mail while working .
Block your “ time wasting ” websites when you ’re trying to get something done .
Disable instant messaging applications .
Prioritize and remove sources of information with little value .
Unsubscribe from RSS feeds and email newsletters that give no bang for their buck , and set up quick email filters to delete or de-prioritize the junk that is n’t easy to unsubscribe from .
Avoid information overload .
Curb useless information addiction .
Most news has no long term value .
Mainstream media is bad for focusing on what ’s popular versus what is useful , but niche media like blogs are just as bad for focusing on “ what ’s hot now ” instead of “ what ’s useful tomorrow ” .
Take breaks from being “ always on ” .
No internet , no TV , no cellphone , no video games .
It does wonders for helping you reconnect with your life .

2. Be More Effective By Doing Less
Do n’t confuse being busy with being effective .
Stop and ask yourself if what you are working on is worth the effort .
Is it even bringing you in the same direction as your goals ?
Write down ideas and get back to them later .
Amazing ideas are n’t always so amazing after a night ’s sleep .
If you act on every new idea without finishing the one you ’re working on then you ’ll never complete anything .
Same holds true for programming .
Get it working , then refactor .
Know the opportunity cost of your actions and how long something will really take to do .
All things being equal , the best solution is the one that takes the least amount of total time ( including maintenance time for fixing and support ) .
What might have been a great idea at two hours of work could be a horrible idea if it took two weeks .
Just say no and be willing to do the bare minimum .
Accept imperfections with things that are n’t important — do n’t ignore the forest for the sake of one tree .
Focus on the important and not the urgent .
Feed opportunities and starve problems .

3. Use Technology Efficiently
Learn how to search instead of spending time organizing .
Gmail ’s biggest advance was searching email instead of spending time organizing it into folders .
Knowing the ins and outs of how to search for what you want can free up a time spent organizing and categorizing .
Write first and format later .
Formatting is a very important component of presenting information , but it should be done after you have finished writing as part of the editing process .
Getting the information out of your head and on to the page is the most important step .
Learn keyboard shortcuts .
Your mouse is slowing you down .
Learning one keyboard shortcut a week will let you do more and remove the lost time in moving your hand from the keyboard to your mouse .
Set up multiple Firefox profiles , one for work and one for fun .
Your work profile will be barebones with Google Search and your Intranet / work bookmarks while your fun profile will have stuff like StumbleUpon , Gmail notifier , Google Reader , etc .
Technology is your enemy , not your friend .
The biggest sink in productivity comes from the technological devices of the last century .
Compare the effort between traveling with a book versus trying to travel and read online blogs with a laptop , or using an electronic PDA versus carrying a Hipster PDA .
Technology often creates new problems while solving old .
Sometimes the new problems are worse .
There is a big difference between walking the walk and talking the talk .
It ’s easy to read tips and tricks for being more productive in your life ( lifehacks ) , but it is much harder to make them habits and part of who you are .
But changing your habits so that you have more time to enjoy the other aspects of your life is well worth the effort .
I ’m writing this as part of Instigatorblog ’s “ The Ultimate Guide to Productivity ” group writing project .
This is n’t my first take on productivity tips , around a year ago I wrote a damned good list of tips for programmers and engineers .
The tips I ’m listing here are much more general and are useful to anyone who has a job with an Internet connection .

John Sigler , longtime NRA board member and retired police captain from Delaware replaced Sandra S. Froman as NRA president yesterday .
Of course , you ’d never know it from their website , where Froman ’s President ’s Column is still up .
Or if you read the news .
There were no news stories on Sigler ’s first day , nary a press release .
We heard about the changeover via NRA radio ( they have a nightly show at 9 pm EDT ) :
As you can imagine this is not the way I wanted my presidency to begin , but it is important for our members to understand that we will do everything we can .
If there is any way we can assist with law enforcement or with the families - I have no idea what that would be , it ’s probably a hollow offer at best .
We hope for an early resolution so the families can put this behind them .
The NRA too would surely like to see this incident behind them .
But for now be sure that , yes , they will do everything they can to fight what will surely be a slew of new legislative proposals , on handgun purchases , background checks , concealed weapons , the gamut .
Froman , who was the second female president in the history of the NRA , gave a speech two weeks ago at Harvard Law School where she railed against New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin ’s decision to confiscate guns from residents immediately following Hurricane Katrina .
She said that the New Orleans government was “ profoundly incompetent ” and added that a person having a gun could have served as a safety net :
“ If the government is n’t protecting you , then it ’s an insurance policy . ”
Vigilante justice anyone ?
Shares of electronics maker Apple Inc. bled nearly 4 percent of their value in early morning trading Tuesday after AT&T said it activated just shy of 150,000 iPhones during the handset 's first two days on the market — significantly below some expectations on the Street .
Speaking to analysts and members of the media , AT&T said Tuesday that second - quarter earnings rose 61 percent , helped by its buyout of BellSouth Corp. and , to a lesser extent , gains in wireless subscribers and revenue .
The nation 's largest wireless carrier and exclusive Apple iPhone provider said that net income rose to $ 2.9 billion , or 47 cents per share , from $ 1.81 billion , or 46 cents per share in the prior year 's quarter .
Subscribers rose by 1.5 million to 63.7 million during the quarter , the firm said .
AT&T attributed a portion of its subscriber growth to the introduction of iPhone , which went on sale less than two days before the end of its second fiscal quarter .
In that brief time , however , the carrier said it activated over 146,000 of the Apple handsets , more than 40 percent of which went to new AT&T subscribers .
Still , those numbers proved less appetizing for some on Wall Street , where first - weekend iPhone sales estimates had ranged as high as , and in some cases north of , 500,000 units .
Weary - minded investors quickly dumped shares of the iPhone maker , sending the stock down by as much as 4 percent ( or nearly $ 6 ) in early morning trading to $ 138.05 .
Still , AT&T 's early activation numbers could prove to be slightly misleading , as they represent the total number of the Apple handsets that were activated in the first 36 hours or so , and not necessarily the total number of units sold to customers during that time .
A significant number of early iPhone adopters were seen buying their limit of two handsets at Apple retail stores during the handset 's opening weekend , the second of which may have been activated by recipients after the close of AT&T 's second fiscal quarter .
( Business 2.0 Magazine ) --
If , like me , you 're a fan of Internet radio sites such as Pandora or Live365 , you 'll have to find something else to listen to Tuesday .
Dozens of online broadcasters have stopped playing music , in protest of a new levy the government and the music labels are about to impose .
An overly dramatic gesture ?
A petulant response to a little extra taxation ?
Perhaps -- until you discover that the new fee appears to add up to more than the annual revenue of all Internet radio sites put together .
That ludicrously high bill could well cripple this promising young industry in its crib .
To recap , this brouhaha started at a little - noticed hearing in March before a panel of three retired Washington judges .
Under the Digital Millennium Copyright
Act , this panel must meet every five years to determine how much webcasters -- everyone from Yahoo ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) all the way down to small stations like KCRW -- must pay the record industry in royalties for playing their artists ' songs .
This year the panel determined that these fees would go up by roughly 30 percent both this this year and next .
But that 's not what 's causing the ruckus .
Tucked into the record industry 's request for a fee hike was a suggestion , offered without explanation , that webcasters should cough up a minimum $ 500 " administrative fee " for every channel they broadcast online .
Attorneys for the webcasters thought this was such a patently ludicrous idea that they did n't even bother to respond to it .
After all , " channels " do n't mean the same thing online as they do in the old broadcast world .
I can go to Pandora right now and set up a dozen or so channels in a minute , each one based on a favorite artist or song .
Since it is Pandora 's algorithms that determine which similar songs are played on each channel , rather than any station programmer , the possibilities are practically limitless .
Last year , for example , RealNetworks '
Rhapsody service streamed more than 400,000 channels .
The webcasters ' lack of response was a huge mistake .
The three - judge panel accepted the administrative fee without question , backdated it to January 2006 , and have since flatly refused to return to the subject .
The fee goes into effect July 15 .
Internet radio stations frantically crunched the numbers : it appears that Yahoo , Pandora , and RealNetworks will have to spend $ 1.15 billion per year on the administrative fee alone .
Meanwhile , SoundExchange , an intermediary group set up by the record labels that collected $ 20 million in royalties last year , will soon be able to afford plenty of administration .
" To demand more than 100 % of profits [ for Internet radio operations ] is insanity , " says Tim Quirk , RealNetworks ' vice president of programming .
" It 's worse than our worst - case scenario . "
The revenue that RealNetworks derives from Internet radio would not cover the fees .
Quirk still does n't quite believe the recording industry intends to charge the administrative fee .
He says they 're likely using it as a bargaining chip in exchange for an eventual arrangement that will guarantee more air time for their favored artists .
SoundExchange 's official response : the vast majority of their royalty payments come from the deep - pocketed giants like RealNetworks ( Charts ) , Yahoo , and AOL ; and that webcasters simply want to weasel out of their obligations to artists in order to protect their profits .
( To drive this point home last month , SoundExchange offered slightly lower royalty rates for small web broadcasters ) .
The webcasters have filed for an emergency stay of the ruling with the U.S. Court of Appeals , and a bipartisan bill with 120 sponsors is wending through Congress .
The bill would bring Internet radio royalty fees in line with those for the satellite radio industry , which pays the music industry just 7 % of its total revenue .
Some congressional offices are reporting that this is the topic on which they receive the second - largest amount of mail from constituents , after the Iraq war .
Still , hearings on the bill wo n't get started until later this summer .
So is Tuesday 's day of silence a mere protest , or the sound of things to come in Internet radio ?
Stay tuned .

There are 1.75 million animal species that have been noted and named by our scientific classification system .
Of them , there are 5,800 types of mammal .
All mammals are warm - blooded and have a four - chambered heart , but so do birds .
Most mammals give birth to live young , but there are exceptions to that .
Mammals all have hair , but again they share that trait with other creatures ⁠ — in this case spiders .
In fact there is only one truly defining characteristic of mammals that is unique , and that is the trait for with they are named : the mammary gland .
All mammalian species posses a gland that secretes or oozes milk for the repast of their young .
In most cases the mammary gland becomes enlarged during lactation , and diminishes to almost unnoticeable when the milk is unneeded .
However , amidst all 5,800 mammals , there is only one species that has perpetually swollen mammary glands .
Odds are you are a member of this strangely anomalous , difficult to explain species .
At first glance the human breast defies explanation , but there are those who have spent careers and lifetimes in pursuit of explaining the relative enormity of the bust .
Theories about the abundance abound .
As of yet there is no consensus as to why the human female is so endowed , but staying abreast of the emerging ideas can make for titillating research .
Every variety of mammal has some sort of breast .
The feature that sets the human breast apart is that in relation to the size of the body , there is no other species that retains a breast in such a swollen state .
Cattle teats can be proportionately larger , but only so long as the cow is lactating ; the same is true of many other species .
It seems logical , seeing how lactation can be a drain of resources , that the animal ’s breasts would atrophy when not in use .
Some early thought on the origin of the human breast stated that because of the breast ’s importance in nurturing the young , biology opted to supply extra fatty deposits to the mammary glands to help the race survive lean times of drought or meager foodstuffs .
A fine idea , but it does little to explain the complex psychology surrounding the breast , and one should suppose the same phenomenon would be displayed in other species .
Therefore to handle the riddle of perpetual breasts a zoologist by the name of Desmond Morris attempted to apply gleanings from his animal research .
Morris is probably best known for his 1957 art exhibition of paintings created by monkeys and his documentary series “ The Human Animal ” .
Morris has become a somewhat controversial figure by writing papers expounding on how certain human aspects may have evolved .
Among the tenets that he ’s suggested is a need to exercise our inherent omnivorous heritage by eating everything , and speculation on the development of human breasts .
Morris ’ hypothesis is that the breast is a purely erotic affectation⁠ — a piquing notion .
Most creatures in the animal kingdom tend to have the most success mating in a “ male aft ” sexual position because of the placement of the genitalia .
In quadrupeds such as dogs and cats , all the sexual equipment is right out in plain view framed by large , rounded buttocks .
Humans and their unique propensity to stand and walk erect put an end to that straight away .
Changes to the pelvic region that allowed for all this walking about also causes a “ face to face ” mating position to have a higher effectiveness among bipeds .
Morris ’ contention is that it was more practical for the female to evolve an analog to the buttocks on her front than it was to re-wire the male instinct to desire an alternate sex pose .
The breasts took on the roll of buttocks being the frameset of sexuality .
There is an obvious cleavage of thought regarding the application of animal instincts and behaviors to humans ; some maintain that humans did n’t evolve at all , and some criticize Morris as being unscientific , calling his theories untestable and claiming his methods are too abstract to apply to people .
A related , but more widely held theory is one of sexual selection .
In the bygone days of early human history , the males and females were nearly indistinguishable ; the male possessed small , inconspicuous genitalia much like the gorilla , and the female had no breasts of which to speak except when she was lactating or ovulating .
The increase of hormones during ovulation causes a slight swelling of the breasts .
From there the conclusion is obvious : not only could the male find and easily identify females of the right age , but it was at a time of her peak fertility .
As males were becoming ingrained with mental coding to equate breasts with sex , the females who displayed larger breasts bred more effectively –thus the trait of extra fatty deposits in the breasts was passed to their progeny .
Like Morris ’ theory , there is really no means to disprove this theory of how the breast came about , but it serves to address why females tend to carry around nicely - shaped though otherwise unnecessary blobs of fat , and at the same time address some of the psychological and social issues around the breast .
Cultures around the world tend to view the breast differently , but there seems to be a widespread reluctance to letting it hang loose .
In the twenty - first century we ’re still strapped to some primitive mindsets about the breast .
Many cultures hold that because males do not possess these milk - extreting modified sweat glands , he can bare his chest in public forum whereas a woman cannot .
It ’s true that women generally have more fat in that area , allowing for a greater curved shape , however , there are men who carry fatty tissue in the same area , and display an apparent boob .
Since the glands cannot be seen , what is the difference ?
Such is the question that the Topfree Equal Rights Association attempts to address .
Their wild notion is that the female breast is n’t obscene , vulgar , dangerous , or in any way worse than man-boobs , and that if said male - mounds can be waved free in certain circumstances , then women should at the very least be allowed the same discretion without fear of legal ramifications .
Theories concerning the functional nature of the breast notwithstanding , the breast is certainly emphasized in modern culture as a sexual object .
Would the free display of such enhance or detract from that image ?
It seems that every few weeks there is a news story in the US concerning a nursing mother being ejected from a public place for attempting to nurse a young one , while at the same time Victoria ’s Secret has made a multi-million dollar business of drawing attention to the bust .
Janet Jackson ’s nipple roused the wrath of armchair quarterbacks across the nation , whereas Playboy is the best selling men ’s magazine in the world .
The controversy around the topic is surprising considering that breasts are an ailment suffered by 52 % of the population .
Since records on the subject began in the mid-1800s , the average breast size in the US has increased from a 32 - B to the current average of 36 - C .
This may be a result of better nutrition , healthier lifestyle , or the result of the aforementioned sexual selection .
If the last , however , the current popularity could be an end to natural growth ; if breasts aid a female in successful mating , she no longer needs the genes to acquire the advantage , therefore the graph of breast growth may , alas , flatten .
Faced with assassinations of top police officials , death tolls at historic highs , and beheadings in the most innocuous public spaces , Mexico 's President Felipe Calderón sent an unprecedented 30,000 troops and police across the country to tackle drug - related violence after taking office in December .
But nearly six months later the terror has only gotten worse , as drug cartels battle for smuggling routes into the US .
Officials are now even comparing the violence to the drug wars that plagued Colombia for more than a decade .
More than 1,000 people have been killed this year alone in drug - related violence , according to the Mexican newspaper El Universal .
Reporters have " disappeared , " innocent bystanders have died , the US has issued travel warnings , and locals whisper about the worst violence they 've ever seen .
Yet Mr. Calderón 's popularity has also doubled , with two - thirds of Mexicans now approving of his presidency .
It is not necessarily because they believe he is solving the problem of insecurity , however .
For most Mexicans , analysts say , taking bold action – even if initially unsuccessful – is better than none at all .
" The worst feeling someone can have , when you see a problem , is no one doing anything .
At least Calderón is doing something , " says Jorge Chabat , a drug expert in Mexico City .
Yet many say Calderón 's deployment of troops could risk sparking more violence and wonder how long Mexicans will be patient before there is a backlash .
A survey in March by the polling firm Parametria showed that 85 percent of those surveyed believe that government moves to control drug - related violence will lead to more violence .
And more people have lost faith that authorities can control the situation – 50 percent in March , up from 44 percent in January of 2005 .
" Every time I open the paper I feel fed up , " says Carlos López , a Mexico City resident who approved of the operations at first but now says they will only worsen the situation .
" It seems like the police can't do anything about it . "
Some politicians have even called for troops to be deployed to Mexico City in the same fashion that some 30,000 have spread out around Michoacán , Acapulco , and along the US - Mexican border .
Reality more gruesome than TV
Indeed , watching Mexico 's newscasts these days is like tuning into the latest installment of a grisly TV crime series .
There was the hospital in Tijuana that became the scene of a deadly shootout last month , when gunmen burst through the emergency room doors to free an accomplice injured in an earlier gun battle – leaving two state officers dead and dozens of patients stunned .
Then a video on the website YouTube appeared , in which a man was beheaded next to the message " Do something for your country , kill a Zeta " – a reference to the hit men of the Gulf cartel , who authorities say are fighting the Sinaloa cartel for lucrative drug routes into the US .
And last week the stakes got even higher : the new director of the national anti-drug intelligence force was shot dead in Mexico City , followed by the deadliest gun battle in Calderón 's offensive , which left 22 people dead in a shootout in Sonora state , not far from the Arizona border .
José Arturo Yáñez , a drug expert at Mexico City 's Professional Police Training Institute , says that some 200 police officers have been killed in the past 16 months – the highest number ever .
It is often unclear whether they are killed because of their involvement in combating organized crime or because they are part of it .
Mexico has now become the second deadliest country for journalists after Iraq , according to Reporters Without Borders .
Last year , 2,000 people were killed in drug - related violence .
This year the 1,000 mark came May 15 – two months earlier than the year before and four months earlier than in 2005 .
Calderón says his administration will not be cowed .
At a press conference last week , Secretary of Public Security Genaro García Luna told foreign journalists that drug traffickers are using terror to achieve impunity , much like what happened in Colombia in the late 1980s , but that they will stay on the offensive .
" We are not going to take a step backward , " he said .
Calderón has urged patience and tried to keep expectations low by emphasizing that the war cannot be won easily or quickly .
After five soldiers were killed in a recent shootout , he reiterated " Unfortunately , as we know , this is going to cost us resources , it is going to take time to win this enormous battle , and I repeat , it is going to cost human lives , but it is a battle that with decisive support of the society we are going to win for the good of all Mexicans . "
It is a strategic move , says Mr. Chabat , so that his administration is not seen as weak – a problem that tainted outgoing President Vicente Fox 's administration .
That is why his popularity has not gone down as violence has flared , says Chabat .
" I would say that the fact that Calderón decided to launch these massive operations with the Army and police forces sent a signal to the Mexican and international public that somebody is in charge , " says Chabat .
" At least he is not going to be weak , or hesitant like President Fox . "
Troop deployments questioned
But some , like Mr. Yáñez , dismiss the government line – that violence will get worse as the government clamps down on deeply rooted organized crime networks .
" The government says that the violence and executions are the result of government pressure , " he says .
" [ The drug gangs ] act completely autonomous of the government ; the government does not affect their operations nor their plans for business . "
And the national Human Rights Commission recently condemned the military for human rights abuse claims in Michoacán , Calderón 's home state and the starting point for the military anti-drug initiatives .
" I do n't want the military here , " says Elias Sheinberg , a Mexican architect , reacting to calls for troops to be deployed to the capital .
" I fear the troops .
It reminds me too much of war , and the last thing I want is to be in war . "
That is why many officials say that playing the role of a " wartime president " alone can't solve the problem .
José María Ramos , a security expert at the research institute Colegio de la Frontera Norte in Tijuana , says that preventive action is needed , especially for youths .
" We can jail suspected drug traffickers , but it 's not going to reduce the fundamental problem – the lack of opportunities or the changing values of our youths , " he says .
" We can continue filling our prisons , but the problem will still be there . "

This study relies on numbers from cities , rather than yearly F.B.I. totals , which are typically released in the fall .
The group collected similar numbers last year , and those numbers were largely borne out by the data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation .
Police chiefs say the trends in aggravated assaults are particularly alarming .
They are often considered a better gauge of violence than homicides ; the difference between the two is often poor marksmanship or good medical care .
“ Had we not had some of the trauma rooms we have here in Rochester , our homicide numbers would be higher , ” said Mayor Robert Duffy , who served as a police chief for seven years .
While murder rates hit 11 - year highs in places like Boston , police officials note that they are not seeing the highs of the late 1980s and early 1990s , when crack cocaine fueled spikes , particularly in large cities .
Some cities like Denver and Washington had declines in homicides .
Still , the overall trend is mirrored in other places not covered by the report .
New York City , for example , which had enjoyed remarkable declines and seemed immune to the rising murder rate elsewhere in 2005 , reported a 10 percent increase in homicides in 2006 .
In Chicago , which had been cited as another model of declining violence , homicides rose 4 percent from 2004 to 2006 .
Police officials say the violence tends to happen among young men in their late teens and early to mid-20s .
In some cases , it is random .
But in many cases , it is among people who know one another , or between gangs , as a way to settle disputes .
Arguments that 20 years ago would have led to fistfights , police chiefs say , now lead to guns .
“ There ’s really no rhyme or reason with these homicides , ” said Edward Davis , the police commissioner in Boston .
“ An incident will occur involving disrespect , a fight over a girl .
Then there ’s a retaliation aspect where if someone shoots someone else ; their friends will come back and shoot at the people that did it . ”

Don't let the blond ' do and the pressed shirt fool you : Martha Stewart has DIY in her DNA .
( When was the last time you rewired a lamp or built a lath house ? )
She 's also a gadget freak , buying new digicams and cell phones as fast as manufacturers can spit them out .
And when it comes to making things , she 's been giving instruction since most of us were messing with Play - Doh .
So Stewart seemed perfect to host our 2007 How To issue .
To interview her , we called on Mark Frauenfelder , a Wired correspondent and the editor of Make magazine .
As they sat down in her office , Stewart put her RAZR and BlackBerry on the table in front of her — and then geeked out about home music setups , rude technologies , and Marthapedia .
Wired :
What can geeks learn from Martha Stewart ?
Stewart : First of all , they can learn to prioritize , and they can learn how to make things beautiful .
It 's about using your hands and your mind to make things work better .
Whether you 're a programmer or a seamstress , it 's all about new techniques , simplifying old techniques , and consolidating steps .
Making things go faster — but not worse .
Better .
Wired :
One reason people like projects is because they get a sense of control over their environment and technology .
It gives them ownership .
Stewart :
That 's why I say , " You own it if you made it . "
You do n't own the pie if you buy it .
You just do n't .
Doing projects really gives people self - confidence .
Nothing is better than taking the pie out of the oven .
What it does for you personally , and for your family 's idea of you , is something you can't buy .
Wired :
You 've just relaunched your Web site .
Will your readers become content contributors ?
Stewart : I 'm working on Marthapedia right now , which is my version of Wikipedia .
If you know how to take red wine out of a white cloth napkin better than I do , that 's good to know .
We 'll be editing user content , and it wo n't be as freewheeling as Wikipedia .
Because a lot of this — you have to really monitor it .
Wired : OK , let 's talk tips .
What 's your home music setup ?
How do you keep all the wires and cords to a minimum ?
Stewart : I live in an old house with no closets and no built - ins .
I hate big cupboards .
So , where do you put your stereos and all that stuff ?
The solution is easy : Put an iPod in each room , like in a drawer .
Add wireless speakers and the sound system disappears into the room .
It 's so simple , and you do n't have to buy all that crap .
You know how many years of crap I had ?
Wired :
What did you do with all of it ?
Stewart : I put it on a shelf in a storage barn .
I have the first computer I ever had — my IBM .
Wired :
You saved it ?
Stewart :
Well , not all of it .
I 'm not like Nathan Myhrvold .
He has warehouses full of that stuff .
Wired :
Any simple ideas for charging devices ?
Stewart : I have something called the servery .
It 's a room with two long white marble counters on either side and lots of plugs .
That 's where everything is — I have my cameras , a lot of batteries , everything .
Wired :
Do you have a wireless connection like EV - DO so you can check your email while you 're in the car ?
Stewart : I have this .
[ Points to BlackBerry . ]
I 'm constantly in touch .
Sometimes it 's good ; sometimes it 's bad .
Wired :
There are downsides to everything .
Stewart : I think we are insane .
I used to get 120 to 140 phone calls a day .
And now rarely does the phone ring — other than a few archaic friends who call me — because of the BlackBerry .
Wired :
That 's nice , though .
You can reply at your convenience .
Stewart :
No , I think it 's awful .
My daughter emails me .
When your daughter starts to email you instead of talk to you ...
It 's horrible .
You can not forget human communication .
When the Walkman first came out , I called it the Rudeman : Everybody who 's listening to those is rude to me .
I think part of the reason I got divorced was because of the Rudeman .
Wired : Really ?
Stewart : Oh yeah .
I 'd be in the garden , weeding and chatting away and no answer !
[ Laughs . ]
That was like ... when was the Walkman ?
Wired :
The early ' 80s , I guess .
Stewart : Yeah , that 's it .
He had one .
Boy , he got out of there fast .

Carter , Bush and the Catamite
Former President Jimmy Carter is in the UK and his trip has reconfirmed something my appraisal of him .
He was an awful president but he ’s a decent man unlike the current occupier of the White House is an awful president and an indecent man .
My only quandary about King George is deciding whether the vast amount of evil he does comes out of stupidity or malevolency or perhaps a unique combination of the two .
Tony Blair , on the other hand , cannot excuse his actions on account of being dim -witted .
Blair knew what he was doing and consciously choose evil .
And this brings up back to Mr. Carter and his scathing comments about the nature of Blair .
Carter said Blair 's support of Bush and his ill - conceived , counterproductive , invasion of Iraq as “ abominable , loyal , blind and apparently subservient . ”
Carter said that Blair ’s obedience to Bush as been “ a major tragedy for the world ” because without it the US may have thought twice before blundering into a war without victory possible .
“ " One of the defences of the Bush administration ... has been , okay , we must be more correct in our actions than the world thinks because Great Britain is backing us ....
” There is much truth to the suggestion that a reluctant England might have held back the dogs of war .
Instead Blair was acting as Bush ’s political catamite .
His unquestionable subservience served what I suspect was his real purpose : war was a justification for his creation of a British police state -- although in reality it only heavily policies the innocent .
It is so busy reigning in the liberties of the average Brit it has little time for actual criminals .
Blair left office despised even within his own party .
But every catamite is due his reward .
Now it is being leaked that King George may reward his faithful servant with appointment as the president of the World Bank .
Bush ’s previous appointment stepped down in the midst of a major scandal .
Scandal with Bush appointees ?
No !
The reality is that Bush wants to reward toothless
Tony for always following closely at his heels and “ sitting ” or “ begging ” when master asked .
In addition Bush knows that if there is one man in the Western world more despised than Blair it is King George himself .
If Blair retires into obscurity hiding from the well - earned contempt of his fellow citizens it would bode ill for the dullard from Texas .
If Blair can hold some overpaid , entirely unnecessary office it serves as Bush ’s reminder to the world this is how he expects to be treated when he ’s finally ridden out of Washington -- unfortunately not on a rail .
The reality is that Bush and Blair are war criminals and deserve to be treated as such .
Neither deserves comfort in their retirement though I do believe each is worthy of a cell of their own making in Guantanamo .
The one thing that might persuade me to support appointing Tony to this cushy position is if the World Bank moves its offices to Baghdad .

Monolith is a simple tool that takes two arbitrary binary files ( called a Basis file and an Element file ) and " munges " them together to produce a Mono binary file ( with a .mono extension ) .
Monolith can also reconstruct an Element file from a Basis file and a Mono file .
In most cases , the resulting Mono file will not be statistically related to either file .
If you compare the Mono file to the Element file , the Mono file will contain none of the information present in the Element file .
In other words , the Mono file by itself tells you nothing at all about the data in the Element file .
Only when combined with the Basis file will the Mono file provide information about the Element file .
Monolith can be used for exploring the boundaries of digital copyright , and the rest of this website is devoted to such an exploration .
The core questions :
What happens when we use Monolith to munge copyrighted files ?
What is the copyright status of the resulting . mono file ?
These questions are considered in depth below .
Note :
Monolith was developed on a lark .
It is a philosophical experiment , a curiosity , and perhaps even a hare - brained scheme .
In any case , Monolith is meant to stir debate : a perfect , flawless system would not stir debate very well , would it ?
Monolith exists comfortably in a world of logical gymnastics .
The real world of copyright does not operate in a logical fashion .
Thus , a word of warning : if you apply Monolith in the real world , your legal mileage may vary .
Downloads
You can use Monolith with whatever Basis file you would like .
However , standard practice dictates the use of a particular Basis file , Monolith_7D4.wav , when generating Mono files .
This particular WAV file was created and copyrighted by me ( Jason Rohrer ) , and I have placed this file in the public domain for free and unrestricted distribution .
By following this standard , you can ensure that others can easily interact with your Mono files .
After downloading the basis file , drop it into the base folder found in your Monolith installation .
Download Monolith_7D4.wav here .

Copyright ==> ?
Things get interesting when you apply Monolith to copyrighted files .
For example , munging two copyrighted files will produce a completely new file that , in most cases , contains no information from either file .
In other words , the resulting Mono file is not " owned " by the original copyright holders ( if owned at all , it would be owned by the person who did the munging ) .
Given that the Mono file can be combined with either of the original , copyrighted files to reconstruct the other copyrighted file , this lack of Mono ownership may be seem hard to believe .
Consider this simple fact : for a given Element file and any other file of the same length ( call it fileA ) , it is possible to choose a Basis file that , when munged with the Element , will produce fileA as the resulting Mono file .
Therefore , if a copyright holder claims that she owns the information in all Mono files that are munged from her work , she is also claiming copyright over all possible binary files that are the same length as her work .
For example , suppose that fileA is an MP3 of a Beatles song , and the Element file is an MP3 of a Britney Spears song copyrighted by Jive Records .
It is possible to find a Basis file that , when munged with the Spears song , will produce the Beatles song as the Mono file .
Jive Records certainly cannot claim copyright over the Beatles song ( which is copyrighted by Apple Records ) , nor can they claim copyright over any other Mono files munged from MP3s of their songs .
What does this mean ?
This means that Mono files can be freely distributed .
So what ?
Mono files are useless without their corresponding Basis files , right ?
And the Basis files are copyrighted too , so they cannot be freely distributed , right ?
There is one more twist to this idea .
What happens when we use Basis files that are freely distributable ?
For example , we could use a Basis file that is in the public domain or one that is licensed for free distribution .
Now we are getting somewhere .
None of the aforementioned properties of Mono files change when we use freely distributable Basis files , since the same arguments hold .
Mono files are still not copyrighted by the people who hold the copyrights over the corresponding Element files .
Now we can freely distribute Mono files and Basis files .
Interesting ?
Not really .
But what you can do with these files , in the privacy of your own home , might be interesting , depending on your proclivities .
For example , you can use the Mono files and the Basis files to reconstruct the Element files .
Bring Taping Home
The Internet , despite all of the intellectual freedoms that it bestowed upon us , had an odd side - effect : it moved the " Copyright vs. Home Taping " clash into the public sphere .
Home Taping used to be a private issue , since the act itself ( the Taping ) happened in the privacy of one 's home .
There were laws forbidding Home Taping , but they were unenforceable laws .
The Copyright holders got their " blank media " taxes passed and otherwise gave up on their crusade to stop Home Taping .
However , with the Internet , Home Taping has moved into the public realm , and the laws forbidding such Taping are suddenly enforceable .
Now we have a royal mess : a public that is fond of Home Taping is butting heads with Copyright holders who are trying to enforce laws that have never been enforced before .
Monolith moves Home Taping back into the private sphere .
There are laws that forbid combining a Basis file with a Mono file to produce a copyrighted Element file , but since such combining happens in private , those laws are unenforceable .
To best explain the logic behind Monolith , we need to explore the odd properties of digital information .
Digital Information is Weird
How can something so simple be called " weird ? "
We have our standard grade - school explanation of digital technology : " everything is ones and zeros . "
Nothing weird about that .
The oddities crop up when you try to represent analog ( in other words , " physical " or " non-digital " ) entities digitally .
Copyrightable entities are inherently analog .
Music , painting , sculpture , writing --- all of these must be presented in the physical realm to be consumed by a human audience .
Even mediums that are always created and represented digitally , such as digital photography , must be translated into the physical realm ( for example , into a lighted display on an LCD monitor ) to be consumed .
The bits ( the " ones and zeros " ) used in the representation mean nothing to us by themselves --- we cannot experience or otherwise consume them .
The bits are fully devoted to the representation , not to the presentation .
A digital photograph , represented as a JPEG file , can be presented in many ways --- on a monitor , on an envelope with an ink jet printer , on photo paper , on the side of a building with a projector --- the possibilities are endless .
Furthermore , the same digital photograph can be represented with many different file formats ( JPEG , PNG , TIFF , etc. ) .
Each of these formats might use its own unique bit - level representation of the photograph , though the presentation ( for example , the color of each monitor pixel ) might be identical .
In other words , many different sequences of bits can be used to represent the same photograph .
In fact , if we count all possible formats , including those that have not been ( and may never be ) invented , an infinite number of different bits sequences can be used to represent that same photograph .
We have not even brushed upon the impact of various resolutions and quality settings : there are thousands of ways to represent the same photographic content as a JPEG bit sequence .
But could we not make the same statement about analog representations ?
For example , there are perhaps hundreds of analog audio formats : 45 RPM records , 78 RPM records , reel - to - reel tapes ( of various widths and speeds ) , 8 - tracks , and cassette tapes .
We can certainly imagine an infinite number of possible analog audio formats .
How is this space of possibility any different from the space associated with digital encodings ?
For true analog formats , the difference is in the form of the representation .
Analog formats represent one physical property directly using another physical property .
For example , the intensity of a sound wave is represented directly by the depth of a groove on a record .
As another example , sound wave intensity is represented directly by magnetic intensity on an analog tape .
Though analog formats are representations of content ( a record groove is certainly not the same thing as a sound wave ) , they are not encodings of content , since no " decoding " is necessary to reveal the represented content .
For example , if you drag a sewing needle through a record groove , you can hear a faint rendition of the sound , and this particular operation cannot be described as decoding .
True analog representations are isomorphic to the content they represent ( in other words , they have the same structure as the content ) .
Digital encodings , on the other hand , are generally not isomorphic to the content they represent , especially when examined on the binary level .
Looking at the issue from a slightly different angle , we can see that digitization involves representing something that is infinitely detailed ( an image ) with a format that is inherently finite ( a sequence of bits ) .
Digitization , therefore , is the process of deciding what to keep and what to throw away .
Of course , an infinite amount of information must be discarded in this process , and there are clearly an infinite number of ways to do this .
The point is that , in the digital realm , the content is copyrighted , while the binary representation surely is not , given that there exist an infinite number of representations for the same piece of content .
This point is well - demonstrated in the realm of digital music .
The copyright holders record a physical act ( plucked guitar strings , vibrating vocal chords , etc. ) and eventually give it a digital representation ( as a CD track ) .
In most cases , the copyright holders never translate their content into other formats , like MP3 or OGG files --- those translations are usually made by " unauthorized " third parties for the purpose of exchanging the content online .
There are a myriad of different settings and algorithms that can be used to create an MP3 file , and each of these results in a unique bit sequence .
The copyright holders do not construct any of these bit sequences themselves , so the sequences cannot be rightly called part of their work .
The content , in this case the music , is what is copyrighted .
So , why is this weird ?
Because the Internet cannot be used to exchange content ; it can only exchange bit sequences .
When people download an MP3 file via the Internet , they are downloading a bit sequence , one of an infinite number of possible digital representations for a particular piece of content .
It is only when that representation is rendered , or decoded and played through speakers , that the content itself comes into existence .
Thus , it is the act of playing an MP3 of an unlicensed song that is actually illegal under a true - spirited interpretation of copyright law .
Downloading or otherwise exchanging the bit sequence surely cannot be illegal , unless the copyright holders are ready to lay ownership claims upon an infinite number of different bit sequences for each copyrighted song .
People have been getting sued for sharing MP3 representations of copyrighted files , and its not even illegal , huh ?
That would be pretty weird if it was true , but it is still hard to believe , so I will tackle the issue from yet another angle .
Digital Content is Finite Sorry Britney , but I am going to pick on you .
After all , what kind of digital copyright treatise would this be without an example based around a Britney Spears track ?
Consider the song " Toxic , " which was released on Spears ' album " In the Zone " in 2003 by Jive Records ( an RIAA member ) .
This song has undoubtably been translated many times from CD format into MP3 format .
For all of the various MP3 quality settings and encoders used , there are probably hundreds of different bit sequences being used to represent " Toxic " on peer - to - peer ( p2p ) networks .
None of these bit sequences were created by the people who hold copyright over the song itself ( Jive Records ) , and there are ( as argued earlier ) an infinite number of other bit sequences that could be used to represent the song " Toxic . "
I have a particular MP3 representation here , a particular bit sequence , stored in a file called " britney_spears_-_toxic.mp3 " .
If we believe that all possible bit - level representations of " Toxic " are actually copyrighted by Jive Records ( in other words , if Jive Records holds copyright over this particular MP3 encoding ) , then sub -sequences of bits from these representations must also be copyrighted ( just like a paragraph of a book is copyrighted by the same person who holds copyright over the entire book ) .
Here is a particular bit sequence that occurs in my MP3 file :
1
Obviously , since that particular bit occurs in almost every other binary file , I have not broken the law by " distributing " it .
There is nothing special about that single bit , and it is certainly not " owned " by Jive records .
How many bits must I divulge before I break the law ?
How about 10 bits ?
Jumping into the middle of the file by 1,087,320 bits , we see the following sequence :
1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0
This bit sequence is quite meaningless to us --- it certainly does not resemble any part of the song " Toxic . "
In fact , that particular sequence occurs in the MP3 file more than 60 times .
Undoubtably , it also occurs in almost every other MP3 file : there is nothing special about a sequence of 10 bits .
How about 24 bits ?
Jumping into the middle of the file by 21,442,264 bits , we see the following sequence :
0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1
This 24 - bit sequence occurs only once in the MP3 file , so it might seem like a good candidate for a sequence that is unique to my " Toxic " MP3 file and therefore copyrighted by Jive Records ( if so , I have just broken the law by divulging these bits ) .
Of course , in raw form , these bits look meaningless to us , and they certainly do not resemble any part of the song " Toxic . "
In fact , the sequence is not unique at all , as it is found in the ASCII text encoding of the Bible .
For instance , the sequence occurs in the file genesis.
txt if we jump into the middle of the file by just 968 bits .
Here is the 72 - bit context from the Bible that contains our 24 - bit sequence ( our sequence is in bold ) :
0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1
We can convert this binary sequence into ASCII text , adding a few more characters for the sake of context ( our 24 - bit sequence is in bold ) :
And the earth was without form , and void
Yes , the 24 - bit sequence taken from the " Toxic " MP3 file is actually the word " was " when it is interpreted as ASCII text .
Of course , when interpreted as part of an MP3 file , it has a different meaning , perhaps the loudness of a particular sound frequency at a particular instant in the song .
Again , there is nothing unique about the bits themselves --- only when they are interpreted in a certain way do they really become content .
With one interpretation , the bits are part of the copyrighted song " Toxic , " and with another interpretation , they are part of the Bible , which is in the public domain .
Because digital representations of content are inherently finite ( each representation is made of a finite number of bits ) , these kinds of examples can be extended to cover entire files .
The MP3 encoding of " Toxic " contains only 38,804,992 bits .
Though there are a huge number of possible binary files with this many bits , there are a finite number of them .
There are an infinite number of imaginable binary file formats , and thus an infinite number of possible interpretations for those 38 million bits .
Interpreted one way , these bits represent a song , but interpreted another way , they could represent text or an image .
This all sounds great in theory , but in practice we are using those 38 million bits to represent a song , and if we try to interpret those bits using another existing file format ( for example , if we pretend that the bits are a JPEG file ) , we will certainly get nothing but garbled content as a result .
The point is that the content itself , which is copyrighted , lies only in the interpretation of the bits .
The bits themselves are meaningless to us and uncopyrightable .
So , back to the interesting question :
How many bits must I divulge before I break the law ?
Here are 240 bits taken from a point 80,000 bits into the MP3 file :
1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0
I have divulged quite a few bits here , and we would not be unreasonable to assume that this sequence is unique to the MP3 file for " Toxic " --- this sequence is not likely to occur in any other file , MP3 or not .
Have I broken the law ?
Have I distributed a bit sequence that is copyrighted by Jive Records ?
You would have to be pretty special to be able to hear Britney singing when you stare at those bits , since without interpretation , they are just bits .
This sequence is just one of a finite number of possible 240 - bit sequences , and there is nothing so special about it .
Since Jive Records did not create this particular sequence ( recall that , though they created the song , someone else created the MP3 bit sequence ) , they certainly do not hold copyright over it , so I have not broken the law .
Are you still not convinced ?
Even if Britney 's voice is not jumping out at you , you might claim that I have given you enough information by which you could reconstruct Britney 's voice if you wanted to .
But how many hoops would you have to jump through to carry out this reconstruction ?
You would have to strip the bits out of my HTML layout , pack them into a binary file , fit them into a properly - formatted MP3 file , and finally play the file through your speakers --- all of this work , just to hear only a chirp of sound ( 240 bits do not encode very much audio data ) .
As another example , I could stand on a street corner and recite :
" Here is part of a Britney Spears song : ' one one one one zero one ...' "
and you could stand there with a pencil and paper , scribbling down ones and zeros .
Then you could rush home , pack the bits into an MP3 file , and play them through your speakers .
But who would be breaking the law , me or you ?
I would simply be reciting a sequence of ones and zeros that are meaningless at face value .
You would be the one exerting the effort required to transform those bits into the audio content playing through your speakers .
The " unlicensed copy " of the song " Toxic " would exist only in your living room as it plays out of your speakers , and it certainly would not exist on my street corner .
Thus , you would be breaking the law , while I would simply be annoying passersby with meaningless gibberish .
Legal Interpretations
In the real world , copyright law is interpreted and enforced using a different logic from that presented above .
Thus , certain binary sequences are deemed illegal to distribute because they are explicit representations of copyrighted works .
For example , it is hard to mince words about an MP3 encoding of a copyrighted song .
First of all , an MP3 file represents the song 's sounds in a direct manner .
Second , the method of converting that representation to a presentation is straight - forward , since an algorithm exists that can convert an MP3 file into sound mechanistically without any additional information .
But how far away from direct and explicit representations do we have to go before copyright no longer applies ?
Mono files , given that they contain no information from the original Element files , are not explicit representations .
The binary data in a Mono file cannot be directly interpreted to produce a presentation of the copyrighted content , so they can not be seen as representational at all .
Mono files take the data a step beyond any explicit representations , and I claim that this step goes far enough to leave copyright behind .
A Monolith Example Going out on a legal limb , here is the Mono file for the " Toxic " MP3 mentioned above :
britney_spears_-_toxic.mp3-#-Monolith_7D4.wav-#-.mono
According to standard practice , Monolith_7D4.wav was used as the Basis file to generate this Mono file , and you can see this reflected in the file name .
How Monolith Munging Works
The " munging " done by Monolith is surprisingly simple , given the strong statistical properties that result .
Monolith combines the Basis and Element files by applying the logical XOR function bit - by - bit .
For a pair of bits , the XOR function has the following behavior :
Bit A Bit B Result 0 xor 0 => 0 0 xor 1 => 1 1 xor 0 => 1 1 xor 1 => 0
The XOR function is similar to standard addition , except that the carry is ignored in the case of adding 1 and 1 .
As a concrete example of XOR applied to a sequence of bits , consider the 8 bits that occur after jumping past the first 160,000 bits in the file britney_spears_-_toxic.mp3 .
We can XOR these bits , one - by - one , with the corresponding bits from the Monolith_7D4. wav Basis file .
This operation results in the corresponding bits from the Mono file that is available for download above .
8 bits from toxic MP3 : 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 xor 8 bits from 7D4 WAV : 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 = 8 bits from resulting Mono file : 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 Statistical Analysis Comparing the Toxic MP3 and the resulting Mono file bit - by - bit , the files have the following correlation coefficient :
r = 0.002413
For positive correlations , coefficients fall in the range [ 0,1 ] .
A coefficient of 1 would indicate that two files are identical , while a coefficient of 0 would indicate that the files are completely uncorrelated .
Derivative Works
Some people would argue that , since I used the " Toxic " MP3 to create the Mono file , the Mono file is a derivative work of Spears ' song .
Distributing derivative works without permission is illegal , since US Copyright Code gives copyright holders rights over all derivatives .
For example , Title 17 , Chapter 1 , Section 106 gives the owner of a copyright the exclusive right :
( 1 ) to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords ;
( 2 ) to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work ;
But what constitutes a derivative work ?
Certainly , some part of the original work must be present in a recognizable form .
The munging done by Monolith leaves no part of the original work in place , so Mono files therefore cannot be counted as derivative works .
However , this feature of Mono files is hard to understand fully for sound recordings , since the resulting Mono file is not even a playable sound file at all ( the munging completely obliterates the MP3 header information that would be necessary to even interpret the bits as audio ) .
We can better grasp the derivative status of Mono files by applying Monolith 's munging to text data .
Here are the first 800 characters from the Bible , which is in the public domain :
1:1 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth .
1:2 And the earth was without form , and void ; and darkness was upon the face of the deep .
And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters .
1:3 And God said , Let there be light : and there was light .
1:4 And God saw the light , that it was good : and God divided the light from the darkness .
1:5 And God called the light Day , and the darkness he called Night .
And the evening and the morning were the first day .
1:6 And God said ,
Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters , and let it divide the waters from the waters .
1:7 And God made the firmament , and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament : and it was so .
1:8 And God called the firmament Heaven .
And the eve
Here are the first 800 characters from Thomas Pynchon 's novel The Crying of Lot 49 , which is still protected by copyright :
ONE summer afternoon Mrs Oedipa Maas came home from a Tupperware party whose hostess had put perhaps too much kirsch in the fondue to find that she , Oedipa , had been named executor , or she supposed executrix , of the estate of one Pierce Inverarity , a California real estate mogul who had once lost two million collars in his spare time but still had assets numerous and tangled enough to make the job of sorting it all out more than honorary .
Oedipa stood in the living room , stared at by the greenish dead eye of the TV tube , spoke the name of God , tried to feel as drunk as possible .
But this did not work .
She thought of a hotel room in Mazatlan whose door had just been slammed , it seemed forever , waking up two hundred birds down in the lobby ; a sunrise over the library slope at Cornell Univers
What happens when we munge these two bodies of text together with Monolith ?
Is the result some kind of bizarre Bible / TCOL49 hybrid and therefore a derivative of Pynchon 's work ?
If so , then distributing the derivative would be illegal without Pynchon 's permission .
Here are the first 800 characters from the resulting Mono file ( cleaned up slightly so as not to completely confuse your browser ) :

None of Pynchon 's words are present here in a recognizable form , so this certainly does not qualify as a derivative work .
Though the results are more difficult to inspect , the same logic applies when we munge audio files : since no part of the original work is present , a Mono file does not count as a derivative work .
In fact , US Copyright Code places special limitations on what can be counted as a derivative sound recording .
Title 17 , Chapter 1 , Section 114 , Part B states :
The exclusive right of the owner of copyright in a sound recording under clause ( 1 ) of section 106 is limited to the right to duplicate the sound recording in the form of phonorecords or copies that directly or indirectly recapture the actual sounds fixed in the recording .
The exclusive right of the owner of copyright in a sound recording under clause ( 2 ) of section 106 is limited to the right to prepare a derivative work in which the actual sounds fixed in the sound recording are rearranged , remixed , or otherwise altered in sequence or quality .
Since none of the actual sounds from the original file are present in the Mono file ( the Mono file is not even a playable audio file ) , it can not be seen as a derivative work .

Spiked asked 250 scientists - here we bring you some of the most provocative responses Thursday April 7 , 2005
Guardian
Seth Lloyd Professor of mechanical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
You do not have to be a scientist to do science ; you can be a child , a computer , or an intelligent rat .
As long as you can verify a result , it is part of science .
Freeman Dyson Emeritus professor of physics at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton
Science is about uncertainty .
We do not yet know the answers to most of the important questions — nature is smarter than we are .
But if we are patient , and not in too much of a hurry , then science gives us a good way to find the answers .
Richard Dawkins Charles Simonyi professor of the public understanding of science at the University of Oxford , and a science writer and broadcaster
I wish everyone understood Darwinian natural selection , and its enormous explanatory power , as the only known explanation of " design " .
The world is divided into things that look designed , like birds and airliners ; and things that do not look designed , like rocks and mountains .
Things that look designed are divided into those that really are designed , like submarines and tin openers ; and those that are not really designed , like sharks and hedgehogs .
Darwinian natural selection , although it involves no true design at all , can produce an uncanny simulacrum of true design .
An engineer would be hard put to decide whether a bird or a plane was the more aerodynamically elegant .
Lewis Wolpert Emeritus professor of biology as applied to medicine at University College London
I would teach the world that science is the best way to understand the world , and that for any set of observations , there is only one correct explanation .
Also , science is value - free , as it explains the world as it is .
Ethical issues arise only when science is applied to technology — from medicine to industry .
Kathy Sykes Collier professor of public engagement in science and engineering at the University of Bristol
I would teach the world that science is not about truth , but is about trying to get closer to the truth .
This is important because , too often , people look to scientists as having the " truth " .
What we have is wrapped in uncertainties , caveats and simplifications .
John Gribbin Astrophysicist and science writer
I cannot improve upon the comment of the American physicist Richard Feynman : " The most important information … is the atomic hypothesis … that all things are made of atoms — little particles that move around in perpetual motion , attracting each other when they are a little distance apart , but repelling upon being squeezed into one another . "
Bernard Lovell Astronomer and founder of Jodrell Bank Observatory
I would teach the world that fundamental scientific research is neutral , but the dividing line between good and evil in the eventual use of the results of research is often thin and tenuous .
In the first half of the 20th century , research into the structure of matter led to a detailed knowledge of atomic structure , and to a knowledge that in certain transmutations , there was a loss of mass .
The second world war led to the enormous concentration of tech­nological effort , to convert this knowledge into devastating weapons of mass destruction , instead of providing atomic power for the benefit of humanity .
That contrast between the good and the evil , in the eventual use of research , confronts us today .
Simon Baron - Cohen Professor of developmental psychopathology at the University of Cambridge , and director of the Autism Research Centre
I would teach the world that scientists fall in love — with experiments .
An experiment can be beautifully stunning .
Experiments are not just about proof — some of them have an intrinsic elegance , that you just want to go back to and look at again and again .
Take men with two X chromosomes .
This puzzle of nature just called out for the experiment , conducted in 1990 , to search the two X chromosomes in such individuals — to find a bit of the Y chromosome , that might have broken off and become integrated into one of the X chromosomes .
It just had to be there .
And sure enough , it was .
What we now know to be the SRY gene — the sex - related Y gene — had got into the X chromosome .
And this is the gene that turns on the process to grow testes , and become male .
Antony Hoare Senior researcher at Microsoft Corporation
I would teach the world that scientists start by trying very hard to disprove what they hope is true .
When they fail , they have a good reason for believing what they hope is true , and can even convince others of its truth .
A scientist always acknowledges the possibility of error , and is less likely to be mistaken than one who always claims to be right .
Harry Kroto Professor of chemistry at Sussex University , and joint recipient of the Nobel prize in chemistry
The methods of science are manifestly effective , having made massive humanitarian contributions to society .
It is this very effectiveness which the purveyors of mystical philosophies attack , because they recognise in it the chief threat to the belief - based source of their power and financial reward .
Michael Baum Emeritus professor of surgery and visiting professor of medical humanities at University College London , and chairman of the Psychosocial Oncology Committee of the National Cancer Research Institute
I would teach the world that science = imagination + humility ² .
If only politicians were ruled by the scientific prin­ciples of conjectures ( hypothesis generation ) and refutations ( controlled experimentation ) , then the world would be a better place .
To quote the 19th - century British biologist Thomas Henry Huxley : " The tragedy of science is the slaying of a beautiful hypothesis by an ugly fact . "
Susan Blackmore Science writer and broadcaster , and visiting lecturer at the University of the West of England in Bristol
Frighteningly , most people do not understand Darwin 's great insight .
What people miss is the sheer inevitability of the creative process .
Once you see it — copy , vary , select ; copy , vary , select — you see that design by natural selection simply has to happen .
This is not like Isaac Newton 's laws , or quantum physics , or any of the other great theories in science , where one can ask " why is this so ? "
It simply has to be the case .
Then , the scary implications follow .
If everyone understood evolution , then the tyranny of religious memes would be weakened , and we little humans might find a better way to live in this pointless universe .
John Sulston
One of the leaders of the Human Genome Project , and joint recipient of the Nobel prize in physiology or medicine
We have to accept responsibility for the survival of the human race , instead of praying about it .
The prize , if we can embrace this humanist philosophy , is an infinite and unimaginably exciting journey ahead of us .
Brian Davies Professor of mathematics at King 's College London
Without doubt , the most important single scientific discovery ever made was the connection between electricity and magnetism .
This was discov­ered by the 19th - century British physicist and chemist Michael Faraday , at the Royal Institution in London ; and it was systematised by the 19th - century Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell , at King 's College London .
This discovery led directly to the electric motor and dynamo — the basis of all electrical power — and also to telephones , radio , television , and computers , upon all of which advanced civilisation now depends .
Eric Drexler Founder and emeritus chair of the Foresight Institute , and inventor of the term ' nanotechnology '
Physical technology evolves towards limits set by physical law , and a technology approaching the limits set by physical law must build with atomic precision .
Molecular machinery provides a way to accomplish this .
In today 's biological cells and in future manufacturing , large molecular structures can fit together and work together , forming molecular machine systems .
Marcus du Sautoy Professor of mathematics at Oxford University , presenter of the BBC TV programme Mind Games
I would teach the world how the Greeks proved , more than 2,000 years ago , that there are infinitely many prime numbers .
In my mind , this discovery is the beginning of mathematics — when humankind realised that , by pure thought alone , it could prove eternal truths of the universe .
Prime numbers are the indivisible numbers , numbers that can be divided only by themselves and one .
They are the most important numbers in mathematics , because every number is built by multiplying prime numbers together — for example , 60 = 2 x 2 x 3 x 5 .
They are like the atoms of arithmetic , the hydrogen and oxygen of the world of numbers .
Stanley Feldman Emeritus professor of anaesthesiology at Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School
I would like it to be universally known that whatever we eat , it is broken down into basic building blocks of food in the gut , before it can be absorbed into the blood .
The cholesterol in the food you eat is not the same cholesterol as that in your blood .
Whatever meat you eat — whether it be prime organic Angus , or chopped - up scrag end from an old cow — it ends up as the same amino acids in your blood .
No matter what the source of the fat , it is essentially the same fatty acids that enter the bloodstream .
We are not what we eat .
Richard Fortey Senior paleontologist at the Natural History Museum in London , and science writer
Everyone should know about plate tectonics .
We all relate to our own landscape — it is what gives us our sense of homeland .
Yet the ultimate controls on the shape of the Earth are based upon the slow movement of the tectonic plates .
To understand these geological forces gives us all a new respect for our planet — an awareness of how it has been sewed together over 4,000 m years , and how it continually remakes itself .
Through geology , we understand our identity .
It is sad that geology is sometimes regarded as a " dry " science , for it underlies everything .
Geology is a kind of unconscious mind for the world .
Lynne Frostick Professor of physical geography at the University of Hull , and director of the Hull Environment Research Institute and the Environmental Technologies Centre for Industrial Collaboration
I would like to teach the world about climate change , and the role of every human being in causing it .
This is far and away the biggest threat to our planet .
We will only fight the more serious consequences of climate change if every individual accepts responsibility , and if every individual modifies their behaviour .
Robert Garfinkle Lunar section historian at the British Astronomical Association
I would teach the world the famous quote , attributed to Galileo Galilei , eppur si muove — Latin for " but still it moves " .
It lays the groundwork for understanding the Earth–moon–sun system .
Without this orbiting triangle , life as we know it might not even exist on Earth .
I would want my students of science to understand that from this simple 17th - century quote flows all of our knowledge of our place in the local universe .
Our movement about the sun creates our seasons , and gives us the joy of the changing night sky .
The changing seasons , in conjunction with the movement of the moon around the Earth and — to a lesser extent — around the sun as well , cause the tides , ocean currents , and worldwide temperature and atmospheric pressure variations , thus causing the weather and ocean movements .
This movement helps to promote life in the seas , and the formation of rain clouds — basic building blocks for all life .
Peggy Lemaux Cooperative extension specialist in plant biotechnology at the University of California at Berkeley
I would nominate the basic formula for photosynthesis : CO2 + H2O + sunlight / chlorophyll —>
O2 + C6H12O6 .
Why is this so important ?
Because without this chemistry , life on earth would not be possible .
Glucose ( C6H12O6 ) is the basic energy source for all living organisms .
The oxygen released as a photosynthetic byproduct , principally of phytoplankton , provides most of the atmospheric oxygen vital to respiration in plants and animals .
And animals , in turn , produce carbon dioxide ( C02 ) necessary for plants .
Therefore , photosynthesis is consid­ered the ultimate source of life for nearly all plants and animals , by providing the energy required to drive their metabolic processes .
Without this important reaction , life on this planet would cease .
Dr Robert Maynard Senior medical officer at the UK Department of Health
The principle of refutation put forward by the philosopher Karl Popper , in his books The Logic of Scientific Discovery and Conjectures and Refutations , is my choice .
Popper argued that scientific knowledge advanced most reliably by the development and refutation of hypotheses — much more reliably than by the accretion of evidence in support of theories .
He said you cannot prove that all swans are white by counting white swans , but you can prove that not all swans are white by counting one black swan .
Popper 's approach is now accepted , in principle , by many scientists .
And yet much research is still based upon induction — upon the collection of facts to support our ideas .
Erecting hypotheses that can be falsified , and designing experiments capable of doing so , is the hallmark of the true scientist .
In fact , it distinguishes the scientist from the non-scientist .
John McCarthy Emeritus professor of computer science at Stanford University , and inventor of the term ' artificial intelligence '
Find the numbers , and compare them .
As the physicist Lord Kelvin said in 1883 , in a lecture to the Institution of Civil Engineers , " when you can measure what you are speaking about and express it in numbers , you know something about it ; but when you cannot measure it , when you cannot express it in numbers , your knowledge is of a meagre and unsatisfactory kind " .

I would teach the world not to be afraid of the genetic modification of our crops , and to accept GM crops , as they can help to feed the growing world in an environmentally sustainable manner .
There is much apprehension and confusion about this technology , especially in Europe .
This has led to the needless slowdown of the application of biotechnology in agriculture .
If the world were to embrace GM crops , then we could conquer hunger and poverty much more easily , cut down the use of chemicals on farms , help mitigate the cutting down of tropical forests to expand the area of agriculture , bring more reliability to farming , make farming more profitable , help developing countries through crops that are hardier and tolerant to drought , improve food safety , and improve the nutrition of crops .
GM crops are as safe as conventionally developed crops .
The fear of this technology is unnecessarily holding back progress , and is denying the fruits of that progress to the developing world , where it is needed the most .
Martin Rees Astronomer Royal and professor of cosmology , and astrophysics at the University of Cambridge
I 'd like to widen people 's awareness of the tremendous timespan lying ahead — for our planet , and for life itself .
Most educated people are aware that we 're the outcome of nearly 4bn years of Darwinian selection , but many tend to think that humans are somehow the culmination .
Our sun , however , is less than halfway through its lifespan .
It will not be humans who watch the sun 's demise , 6 bn years from now .
Any creatures that exist then will be as different from us as we are from bacteria or amoebae .
Our concern with Earth 's future is , understandably , focused upon the next 100 years at most — the lifetimes of our children and grandchildren .
But awareness of this longer time horizon , and the immense potential that human actions this century could foreclose , offers an extra motive for proper stewardship of this planet .
Matt Ridley Founding chair of the International Centre for Life
Science is not a catalogue of facts , but a search for new mysteries .
Science increases the store of wonder and mystery in the world ; it does not erode it .
The myth that science gets rid of mysteries , started by the Romantic poets , was well nailed by Albert Einstein — whose thought experiments about relativity are far more otherworldly , elusive , thrilling , and baffling than anything dreamt up by poets .
Isaac Newton showed us the mysteries of deep space , Charles Darwin showed us the mysteries of deep time , and Francis Crick and James D Watson showed us the mysteries of deep encoding .
To get rid of those insights would be to reduce the world 's stock of awe .
Roderich Tumulka Researcher in physics at the Mathematics Institute at the University of Tübingen
Paranormal phenomena do not exist .
Magic , witchcraft , mind - reading , clairvoyance , faith healing and similar practices do not work and never have worked .
It makes a crucial difference whether we imagine ourselves surrounded by supernatural beings and happenings or whether instead we see ourselves in a world that science can help us understand .
Many scientific principles , concepts , or discoveries need not , despite their importance , be understood by the public , but just by the experts .
The question of the paranormal is different in this respect .
Stuart Zola Professor of psychiatry and behavioural sciences at Emory University , and director of the Yerkes National Primate Research Centre
I would teach the world the importance of staying actively intellectually engaged throughout our lives , especially as we become elderly .
There are good data now that point to the fact that continuing to challenge yourself late in life — taking up a new hobby , learning to play a musical instrument , doing crossword puzzles , etc — actually helps to maintain cognitive function , and protects against the onset of cognitive decline .
Gerardus 't Hooft Professor of theoretical physics at Utrecht University and joint recipient of the Nobel prize in physics , for his work on the quantum structure of electroweak interactions
Is it really true that the world wants to hear only one thing about science ?
And then continue after that , with its ongoing religious , superstitious and political disputes ?
Maybe the world wants to hear only one thing from me .
What could that be ?
All the important things that the world has already heard from my colleagues might be incomplete — my colleagues may have forgotten to tell the world something .
What could that be ?
I do not know .

As part of a recent development project , we ’ve assembled pieces from SISCweb , SSAX and SXPath , and some of our own code to build a simple web - development framework we ’ve tentatively named Icing .
Icing , so far , consists of :
* a simple bean - like layer atop raw SQL , with an S - expression based SQL syntax and objects representing table rows ;
* a small library ( not quite the same as SISCweb ’s approach ) to allow pattern - matching on the URLs of incoming requests , and to allow attaching handlers to matched URLs ;
* libraries for using JavaMail to construct and send arbitrary MIME multipart message parts and for using BouncyCastle ‘s PGP implementation with JavaMail to build PGP MIME email bodies and attachments ; and
* a XSLT - template - based Model - View - Controller - plus - Workflow framework for structuring applications .
HTML templates ( with special attributes and with optional embedded XSLT instructions ) form the View ; Scheme code forms the Controller ; the DB layer referred to above forms the core of the Model ; and SISCweb ’s support for continuation - based web programming forms the Workflow .
The software is still being hammered into shape ; we ’re currently in the process of documenting it , packaging it conveniently for use in other applications , and deciding how we want to release it — it could be released as a thing - in - itself , bundling together a collection of third - party libraries , or we could instead take Icing to pieces , and fold some of the parts back into SISCweb ( if SISCweb ’s author , Alessandro Colomba , approves , of course ) .
I ’ve made the slides from the presentation on Icing I gave last week available .
They ’re the only real documentation the code has at present , but ought to give a feel for the kind of approach we ’re taking with it .
