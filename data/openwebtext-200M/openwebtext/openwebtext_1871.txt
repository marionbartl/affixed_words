I was outed in The New York Times over the weekend .
In the crossword , in fact .
As 52 - across , I was ( along with 41 - across , DONNYOSMOND ) part of a mini - theme about famous Mormons .
So , yeah , everyone knew I was Mormon anyway ( even if everyone did n’t assume that a dorky - looking white guy with a Utah address was Mormon , I mentioned it a couple times on Jeopardy ! ) , but still .
My religion is weird enough that it can make me a New York Times crossword theme .
Is yours ?
Nyaah .
For a long time , I sort of felt like Mormons were assimilating pretty well into the fabric of American life .
It was hard to get a grasp on this , living overseas and then in Utah , but that was how I saw it , judging from media treatment and private conversations .
Being LDS made you a minority and a conversation - starter at dinner , maybe , but it was n’t going to curl any lips in disgust .
It was an interesting oddity , like being a vegan or a hockey fan or something .
But that ’s changing .
Maybe it ’s just the general rudeness of the Internet age , but it seems like knowing sneers and pot-shots at Mormonism are actually becoming a currency of cool now .
Did Jon Krakauer ’s Under the Banner of Heaven , which puzzlingly portrays the mild - mannered Mormon West as a seething American underbelly of violence and fundamentalism , start this off ?
Was it the South Park episode ?
( That ’s Mormon founder Joseph Smith at left in the picture above . )
Or Big Love ?
Mitt Romney ’s run for president sure is n’t helping .
If Romney somehow gets the nomination , we ’ll probably start to see more of this anti-Mormon bigotry from the evangelical right , but right now , Mitt ’s taking most of his op - ed heat from the left .
But the bashing is n’t generally politically motivated –Mormon political or social views are n’t getting picked at much ( which would be fair enough ) .
I guess you did get The New Republic raising the laughable JFK - era boogeyman of a Presidential pawn taking his orders straight from Rome Salt Lake City .
( If that ’s the concern , has n’t anyone noticed that the top- ranking Democrat in Washington , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , is a devout Mormon ? )
But substantive political argument in these hit pieces is rare .
Instead , otherwise rational people have straight - facedly taken the position that LDS theology itself is too outlandish to deserve any respect whatsoever .
Religious discrimination is wrong , sure , and people should be allowed to believe what they want .
Unless you ’re Mormon , of course .
Eww .
They ’re just weird .
Take Jacob Weisberg or alcoholic gadfly Christoper Hitchens in Slate , for example .
Or this Boston Globe op - ed.
Andrew Sullivan declared “ Mormon week ” on The Daily Dish a few months ago and spent days guffawing over those dopey Mormons .
Look , I do n’t expect opinion writers to write about the LDS church , or any religion not their own , from a believer ’s point of view .
That would n’t make sense .
But you do n’t get any class points in my book for turning somebody ’s sacred beliefs into punchlines just to jazz up your prose .
I ’m sure we ’re going to see more of these things until the Mitt - ster drops out of the race , so here are a few points of advice to the would - be bashers .
After you get off a particularly good zinger at those gullible Mormons , try recasting your sentence so it refers to “ those gullible Jews ” or “ … Catholics ” or “ … Muslims . ”
If , Wonkette , you think Mormon temple garments should be called “ magic underwear ” throughout your post , try substituting “ magic beanie ” for “ yarmulke ” or “ magic Nilla wafer ” for “ Communion host ” in a similar context and considering whether that ’s journalism , or whether that ’s even funny anymore .
If you ’re horrified by the result , it ’s because bigotry is bigotry , no matter the target .
Mormons are no strangers to religious discrimination–after all , Missouri had its 1838 extermination order against Mormons on the books until 1976 .
Discrimination against Mormons is n’t any more of a laughing matter than anti-Semitism , anti-Islamic feeling , or any other religious prejudice .
Realize that pretty much all religious belief is fundamentally irrational .
Weisberg write that the founding myth of the LDS church–unschooled 19th - century farm boy claims that an angel led him to buried metal plates , which he then translated through miraculous means into a book of scripture –is so a priori stupid that he should be allowed his pot-shots .
Sure , he allows , this is no weirder than what lies beneath any other religion–virgin birth , the parting of the Red Sea , Gabriel ’s delivery of the Qur’an .
“ But a few eons makes a big difference , ” he says , waving his hands .
“ The world ’s greater religions have had time to splinter , moderate , and turn their myths into metaphor . ”
So a patina of age is what makes it okay to laugh at Mitt Romney about Joseph Smith , even though you ’d never make Muhammad jokes to Keith Ellison ?
That ’s just dopey .
I do n’t know how many churchgoing Americans Weisberg hangs out with , but let me assure him : most of them are just as sincere about their faiths ’ improbable divine origins as Mormons are .
Does he think modern Baptists and Catholics and Jews read scripture and think to themselves , “ Wow , I ’m sure glad my splintered , moderated religion does n’t believe these nutty metaphorical miracles ever really happened ” ?
I ’ve always thought the modern American context of Mormonism ’s story is what makes it special and uniquely fascinating .
Weisberg et. al. just seem to think it makes it a better punchline .
Finally , do your @ # $ % research .
Pieces like Weisberg ’s and Hitchens ’ seem to be based on a single viewing of that one South Park and perhaps dim memories of a 1976 undergraduate reading of Fawn Brodie ’s No Man Knows My History .
So they feel no compunction about calling LDS church founder Joseph Smith a “ charlatan ” who whipped up Mormonism L. Ron Hubbard - style as a “ racket ” to gratify his own ego and sexual libertinism .
There ’s only one problem with this caricature : you ’re not going to find too many scholars of Mormonism , believing or not , who buy it anymore .
When it comes to Mormon history , Brodie is out ; Richard Bushman ’s considerably more nuanced Rough Stone Rolling is in .
Smith is still an enigma , and you ’ll find a broad spectrum of scholars willing to explain his remarkable life with varying shades of piety or cynicism ( or , if you ’re talking to a Mormon , as a genuine visionary ) .
But it ’s certainly not good enough anymore to assume in your very first graf that everyone knows Joseph Smith was just a con man and let ’s take it from there .
Again , try this out with “ Buddha ” or “ Joan of Arc ” or “ Muhammad ” and see how your piece sounds .
PBS has just aired a thoughtful four - hour Frontline doc on “ The Mormons ” ( check local listings if you missed it ; maybe it ’ll re-air ) .
Some LDS folks will probably blanch at the series ’ straightforward look at polygamy , the Mountain Meadows Massacre , and other historical controversies of Mormonism .
Nonbelievers might blink at how seriously and respectfully many of the doc ’s talking heads treat the LDS church ’s surprising origins and evolution .
They should n’t be surprised .
Not every look at a major American religion has to be a clueless five - minute hit piece .
Sometimes there ’s more to see .

7 US Troops Killed ;
Iraq Has Two Virginia Techs Every Day ;
Thousands Protest in Basra , Demand Governor ’s Resignation
I keep hearing from US politicians and the US mass media that the “ situation is improving ” in Iraq .
The profound sorrow and alarm produced in the American public by the horrific shootings at Virginia Tech should give us a baseline for what the Iraqis are actually living through .
They have two Virginia Tech - style attacks every single day .
Virginia
Tech will be gone from the headlines and the air waves by next week this time in the US , though the families of the victims will grieve for a lifetime .
But next Tuesday I will come out here and report to you that 64 Iraqis have been killed in political violence .
And those will mainly be the ones killed by bombs and mortars .
They are only 13 % of the total ; most Iraqis killed violently , perhaps 500 a day throughout the country if you count criminal and tribal violence , are just shot down .
Shot down , like the college students and professors at Blacksburg .
We Americans can so easily , with a shudder , imagine the college student trying to barricade himself behind a door against the armed madman without .
But can we put ourselves in the place of Iraqi students ?
I wrote on February 26 ,
‘ A suicide bomber with a bomb belt got into the lobby of the School of Administration and Economy of Mustansiriya University in Baghdad and managed to set it off despite being spotted at the last minute by university security guards .
The blast killed 41 and wounded a similar number according to late reports , with body parts everywhere and big pools of blood in the foyer as students were shredded by the high explosives . ‘
That is n’t “ slow progress ” or just “ progress , ” the way the weasels in Washington keep proclaiming .
It is the most massive manmade human tragedy of the young century .
According to the Non-Governmental Organizations ( NGOs ) actually trying to help the estimated 8 million Iraqis in dire need of aid . . . things are not going that well in Iraq .
Thousands of persons demonstrated Monday against the governor of Basra Province , complaining of poor social services and collapsing security , and demanding his resignation .
Among the demonstrators were followers of Shiite cleric Muqtada al - Sadr .
The Sadrists are not that numerous in Basra , so this demonstration was probably joined by other disgruntled groups , including the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq .
Sawt al - Iraq reports in Arabic that the number of demonstrators totalled 20,000 .
Some Western wire services , however , suggested that there were as few as 3,000 .
Guerrillas killed 5 US GIs on Monday in Baghdad and al - Anbar Province .
The killings of 2 others on Sunday were announced Monday .
Sunni Arab guerrillas kidnapped 11 Shiite Turkmen from a town south of Kirkuk on Monday night .
Such Shiite captives are often killed .
McClatchy reports that police found 11 bodies in Baghdad on Monday , down from Sunday ’s total of 30 .
Several persons were killed by mortar attacks , roadside bombs , and sniping in the capital on Monday .
Police found 6 bodies in the streets of the northern , mostly Sunni Arab city of Mosul ( pop. 1.5 million ) on Monday .
Also , “ police said that 13 Iraqi army soldiers from the second battalion were killed and 4 others were injured when insurgents attacked their check point in Al A’daya village south west Mosul city today . ”
Guerrillas also shot down a lecturer and a dean at Mosul University .
In Tikrit , north of Baghdad , guerrillas killed 3 policemen and wounded 6 civilians with a suicide car bomb attack .
South of Baghdad at Mahmudiya , mortar shells killed 3 and wounded 17 .
Iran condemned Sunday ’s murder of 5 Iranian oil tanker drivers near Baquba .
Al - Sharq al - Awsat reports in Arabic that an official in the Baghdad municipal council told it that there are hundreds of thousands of orphans in Baghdad schools . *
She said that no steps have been taken to provide special services to this sector of schoolchildren , for lack of resources , and that only 2,000 are receiving government aid .
( The Lancet study published last fall found 605,000 excess violent deaths in Iraq since the US invasion .
These were fairly evenly spread around the country , and Baghdad is a fourth of Iraq , population - wise .
So 150,000 excess deaths should have occurred in Baghdad .
If we assume for the sake of argument that 100,000 of those killed were child - rearing adults , and if we assume 5 children per family and assume that in most cases only one parent was killed violently , that would be 500,000 orphans in Baghdad .
Not all would yet be in school .
The official alleged 900,000 orphans , but that strikes me as too high .
I ’m not a demographer , though , and would be interested in knowing what the Public Health people think about this statistic . )
Abu Omar al - Baghdadi , leader of the self - proclaimed “ Islamic State of Iraq ” says that Iraq under American military occupation is a “ university for terror . ”
To illustrate the point , the architect of the three massive bombings in Algiers , Algeria , last Wednesday says that he wants to turn Algeria into another Iraq .
Muslim fundamentalists and the secular military government in Algeria fought a devastating civil war in the 1990s and into the zeroes of this century , which left an estimated 150,000 persons dead .
The radical Salafis ( Sunni revivalists ) , now calling themselves al - Qaeda in North Africa , are threatening to reprise that dirty war , which they lost .
Some Algerian jihadis are getting training in Iraq , where they have gone as volunteers to fight US troops .
The Taliban in Afghanistan are also beginning to adopt the tactics of Iraqi guerrillas which include attacks on civilians in hopes of mobilizing them into the war on one side or another , on the theory that civil conflict is always good for growing an insurgency .
Fred Kaplan at Slate lays into Senator John McCain for admitting that if he is elected president , he ’d quite possibly get out of Iraq , just as the Democrats he is now attacking propose .
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert , speaking in Australia , said he left it to Australia and the US whether to withdraw from Iraq or not .
He said that he did want to stress that if the US and Australia withdrew , they should do so in such a way as to retain their authority and preserve their gains in the region .
The problem with this advice is that it is impossible to follow it .
Any US withdrawal from Iraq will inevitably affect its prestige .
But then , the quagmire is a daily reminder to everyone in the region of the limits of US power .
Olmert made a big deal about ‘ living in the region ’ and therefore ‘ knowing something of its dynamics . ’
I think his war on Lebanon last summer demonstrates the falsity of the latter claim , and my advice to Canberra would be pretty much to keep his track record in mind .
Even in Israel , he is at 14 % in the polls .
Anyway , I think the implication of his statement , despite his beating around the bush , is that he does n’t relish a US and Australian withdrawal from Iraq because he thinks it will adversely affect Israeli security .
Olmert does n’t understand regional dynamics and does n’t seem to see that the longer the US and its two remaining major allies in Iraq try to stay there , the worse the situation gets , which actually is the thing that is threatening to Israel .
The Belgian Minister of Defense has demanded that Israel pay for the clean - up of the 1 million cluster bombs Olmert ordered fired into south Lebanon , mostly in the last 3 days of the war last August .
There was no military purpose to this act of vicious sabotage , and it was clearly a war crime .
The goal was to injure Lebanese civilians returning to South Lebanon , and , since they largely support Hizbullah , to weaken that group in the south .
Kudos to Andre Flahaut for daring stand up on this issue .
Israeli politician Shimon Peres has admitted that deploying the cluster bombs was a “ mistake . ”
So if the Australians know what is good for them , they wo n’t pay too much attention to Olmert , perhaps the most inept prime minister Israel has ever had .
This is the ninth edition of Code Reads , a series of discussions of some of the central essays , documents and texts in the history of software .
You can go straight to the comments and post something if you like .
Here ’s the full Code Reads archive .
The annals of programming include a small but significant number of radical thinkers who propose total overhauls of our basic techniques for making computers perform useful tasks .
One of them is the late John Backus .
Backus was the central figure in the creation of FORTRAN — the archetypal first - generation “ higher level ” programming language — and the devising of the BNF ( “ Backus Naur Form ” or “ Backus Normal Form ” ) , a formal method for specifying programming - language syntax .
In his 1977 Turing Award lecture , however , Backus stepped away from the world he ’d helped shape and asked , “ Can Programming Be Liberated from the Von Neumann Style ? ”
It ’s a question that gets at fundamentals , at breaking free of founding constraints .
It ’s like asking whether psychology could be liberated from Freud , or physics from Einstein .
Backus describes the prevalent Von Neumann paradigm of computing :
In its simplest form a von Neumann computer has three parts : a central processing unit ( or CPU ) , a store , and a connecting tube that can tramsit a single word between the CPU and the store ( and send an address to the store ) .
I propose to call this tube the von Neumann bottleneck .
The task of a program is to change the contents of the store in some major way ; when one considers that this task must be accomplished entirely by pumping single words back and forth through the von Neumann bottleneck , the reason for its name becomes clear … .
Surely there must be a less primitive way of making big changes in the store than by pushing vast numbers of words nback and forth through the von Neumann bottleneck .
Not only is this tube a literal bottleneck for the data traffic of a problem , but , more importantly , it is an intellectual bottleneck that has kept us tied to word - at - a - time thinking instead of encouraging us to think in terms of the larger conceptual units of the task at hand .
( I will pause here to note the presence of that word “ tube . ” Perhaps Senator Ted Stevens , far from being a techno - rube , was actually a student of Backus . )
Taking off from the subtitle of his paper —
“ A Functional Style and Its Algebra of Programs ” — Backus proposes a different approach from the Von Neumann standard : a “ functional programming style ” that , as far as I can tell , involves putting aside the whole concept of variables and data as separate from procedures , and instead concentrating on small functions that can be transformed through algebra - style techniques .
This is where the going gets hairy .
I freely confess that I felt way over my head through much of Backus ’s detailed description of the functional programming approach .
I ca n’t tell whether this is because he is doing a poor job of explaining it , or because , despite my immersion in programming lore , I ’m not much of a programmer and even less a mathematician —
I ’m reasonably willing to examine chunks of program code , but when I see a page full of formulas , my eyes get blurry and my mind wanders .
( That is at least part of the explanation for why this installment of Code Reads is so absurdly tardy ; the rest is just the usual overload . )
My question to you , my self - selecting think - tank and co-Code - Readers , is : Backus ’s paper is 30 years old now .
Was it a total dead end ?
Did some aspects of his idea eventually filter into real - world programming ?
Since I took so long to write this piece I have the opportunity of pointing to some other thoughtful responses to Backus : Google ’s Mark Chu -Carroll offers an in - depth review of the paper and suggests that , ironically , even though Backus ’s functional programming solves many of the problems that distured him , “ it ’s just totally illegible in textual form ” — which defeats one of Backus ’s original purposes , of exposing in readable form the important actions of a program that , in traditional code , get hidden deep in the internals of repetitive loops .
Chu -Carroll also identifies the programming language Haskell ’s concept of monads as a “ reinvention ” of one of Backus ’s concepts .
Cleo Saulnier is even harder on Backus ’s effort to outline a functional programming system :
“ The abrupt transition into hieroglyphs that only serve to confuse is rather curious considering the extensive sections devoted to how simple pure functional programming is supposed to be . ”
( I feel a little better now about my own befuddlement ! )
There is also this review by Edsger Dijsktra ( pointed out in a comment on the Mark Chu - Carroll post ) , who says , “ the article is a progress report on a valid research effort but suffers badly from aggressive overselling of its significance , long before convincing results have been reached . ”
It seems that my effort to honor the recently deceased and give a closer read to a paper I ’d always found intriguing ended up backfiring to a large extent , and what should have been a two - week turnaround ended up taking two months .
Next time we ’ll come up with something more fun — I promise !
UPDATE : I failed to include , in my roundup of other commenters on Backus ’s paper , this entry by Andrew Sacamano , which concludes : “ In the end , I think FP will fade away , except for leaving its name attached to extensions to VNP languages which encourage side - effect free programming for easier application to distributed systems .
These extensions will prove to be very useful , especially as programming for the web , and programming for multicore processors becomes more and more common . ”

Some coffins are twice as wide as the standard size
Expanding waistlines are forcing many councils to spend thousands widening their furnaces , the Local Government Association has warned .
In some cases grieving relatives have to travel hundreds of miles to find crematoria that can accommodate over - sized coffins .
Standard coffins range from 16 - 20 inches , but coffins up to 40 inches are becoming increasingly common .
The LGA , which represents over 400 councils in England and Wales , is warning that local authorities are finding that many of their furnaces are too narrow to deal with these larger coffins .
This is just another demonstration of how the UK 's obesity problem is putting a real strain on public services
Hazel Harding
Around 430,000 cremations take place in Britain each year .
In Lanarkshire , Scotland , a new 41 - inch - wide cremator , has been dealing with the funerals of obese people from all over Scotland .
And Lewisham Council has ordered a special cremator from America , measuring 44 inches in width .
The crematorium has taken coffins from as far away as the West Midlands and Gloucester .
As part of a £ 1.2 m refurbishment , a new furnace at Mintlyn Crematorium in Bawsey was recently installed by King 's Lynn and West Norfolk Council to accommodate coffins a metre wide .
Blackburn with Darwen Council has plans to install a 42 - inch cremator in the next few years to deal with wider coffins .
Growing problem
In 1980 , 8 % of women and 6 % of men were classified as obese .
By 2004 this had increased to 24 % of men and women and by 2010 is expected to rise to a third of all adults .
Hazel Harding from the LGA , said : " As long as the nation keeps on piling on the pounds , pressure will continue to be placed on crematoria .
" This is just another demonstration of how the UK 's obesity problem is putting a real strain on public services . "
" The death of a loved one is always a difficult time and having to decamp to another area for the cremation just adds to the ordeal .
" It is important that grieving relatives get the service they deserve and councils are doing what they can to accommodate larger clients locally . "
Tim Morris , chief executive of the Institute of Cemetery and Crematorium Management said : " The Institute has received calls from funeral directors from all parts of the country whose local crematorium is unable to cremate large coffins .
" The likelihood is that a large number of facilities will be upgraded to meet these requirements with some taking this opportunity to install a larger cremator . "
Dr David Haslam , clinical director of the National Obesity Forum said : " It brings it home how big a problem it is .
" We 've heard of obese people having to use animal MRI scanners and problems with aeroplane seats but this is linking it with death and of course there is an increased risk of premature death with obesity . "
But Dominic Maguire , funeral director in Glasgow and spokesperson for the National Association of Funeral Directors said it was n't a common problem .
" All crematoria can accomodate the overwhelming majority of coffins that are brought to them and only very rarely would a situation arise where there would be a requirement for an outsize crematorium . "
“ This is certainly the worst die - off that I ’ve seen in my experience working with honey bees .
It may be the worst die - off that has ever occurred with honey bees since they ’ve been introduced into the United States since the 1620s . ”
– Maryann Frazier , Honey Bee Specialist , Penn State
Click for Earthfiles Podcast
February 23 , 2007 Pennsylvania – Most people do n’t realize that honey bees pollinate about one - third of our food supply around the world .
Honey bees pollinate apple trees and berry bushes , vegetables , melons , almonds and many other food sources .
Honey bees were originally brought from Europe to the United States in 1620 .
Periodically since then , there have been occasional die - offs of honey bees , mostly attributed to mites .
But according to the scientists , beekeepers and government agency bee specialists I ’ve talked to recently , there have never been so many empty , deserted honey bee hives as there are now .
And no one knows why .
The past year in America , at least 22 states have reported honey bee disappearances .
Government and science authorities are calling it “ Colony Collapse Disorder ( CCD ) . ”
Beekeepers have reported losses ranging from 60 % to 100 % of their bee colonies .
As winter changes to spring and beekeepers in the colder Northeast can open their hives again , it ’s expected there will be many more empty hives .
Strangely , honey bees have also been disappearing in huge numbers in Spain and Poland .
Adding to the European mystery is that Spain has very large commercial beekeeper operations with at least 3 million colonies of honey bees , similar to the United States .
But Poland ’s 400,000 hives are largely raised on individual farms where smaller bee colonies are separated from each other .
If the answer were disease , you would not expect Poland ’s separated hives to be plagued by large numbers of honey bee disappearances as in Spain and the United States .
The two European countries with the largest honey bee populations are France and Italy .
It might be significant that those two countries banned certain pesticides in recent years because beekeepers there became convinced that systemic pesticides were killing off honey bees .
And so far , neither France nor Italy has yet reported the collapse of honey bee hives .
One scientist who has been studying honey bees at Penn State University for the past eighteen years is Maryann Frazier .
I asked her how serious she thinks the honey bee disappearances are .
Interviews :
Maryann Frazier , M. S. , Honey Bee Extension Specialist , Dept. of Etymology , Penn State University , College Park , Pennsylvania : “ I would say this is certainly the worst die - off that I ’ve seen in my experience working with honey bees .
It may be the worst die - off that has ever occurred with honey bees since they ’ve been introduced into the United States since the 1620s .
It ’s characterized by the bees being there in the colony quite healthy and strong on one day and then within a week to two weeks , the beekeeper goes back and the bees have disappeared from the colony .
Sometimes ( there will be ) a queen and a small number of bees – often times there is brood , which is the young , developing bees .
Some how the bees have just gone and we assume died outside the hive .
There is no evidence that the bees have congregated anywhere , or tried to swarm – there is no evidence of that .
The bees are just missing !
A very unusual kind of situation .
WE’RE TALKING THEN ABOUT THE MYSTEROUS DISAPPEARANCE OF BEES IN THE MILLIONS AND THAT MUST PRESENT A PROBLEM IN DOING SOME KIND OF AUTOPSY TO FIND OUT WHAT IS HAPPENING ?
That ’s right .
It is very difficult to find out what is happening .
We do have some strong leads about what might be happening and that has come from beekeepers who we have interviewed at great length and tried to come up with common threads , things these beekeepers might have in common that might explain some of what is happening . ”
Beekeeper Suspects Systemic Pesticides
One of those large American beekeepers is David Hackenberg , owner of Hackenberg Apiaries in Lewisburg , Pennsylvania .
Mr. Hackenberg has been raising honey bees for both commercial honey sales and for pollination in Florida and California crops over the past 45 years .
He trucks his pollinating honey bees to farmers who hire his pollination services .
But in October 2006 , something hit his honey bees hard and by the beginning of 2007 , he has lost at least 60 % of his colonies .
Dave Hackenberg suspects that the culprit in this unprecedented honey bee disappearance is systemic pesticides – poisons designed to stay inside plants and kill off insects that damage crops .
Systemic pesticides are not supposed to kill off honey bees , but David Hackenberg explains why he thinks that ’s the problem .
David Hackenberg , Owner , Hackenberg Apiaries , Lewisburg , Pennsylvania : “ We move bees up and down the East Coast .
We moved the last of our bees in October 2006 .
And a month later , in early November , we went out to look at some bees and the first location we found had disappeared .
It had 400 hives of bees in it and in less than four weeks , they had just disappeared .
Empty boxes .
No dead bees on the ground .
No dead bees anywhere .
SO IT IS REALLY A DISAPPEARANCE MORE THAN A DIE - OFF BECAUSE YOU DON’T HAVE BODIES ?
That ’s absolutely right !
The bees have died – I mean they ’ve died some place , but nobody knows where they are – whether they flew off a mile or two miles or what to die .
I mean , we just do n’t know how far out they are going .
IN THAT FIRST DISAPPEARANCE OF ALL THOSE BEES FROM YOUR HIVES , HOW MANY BEES DID YOU LOSE ?
Those beehives would have had somewhere around 20,000 or 30,000 bees per hive and if you take that times roughly 400 , you ’re talking about millions of bees disappearing .
WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN DISAPPEARING SINCE THE FALL ?
We had 2900 hives of bees here in October 2006 , and we ’re down to less than 1,000 now .
So , we ’ve lost some 60 % of them .
HAVE YOU EVER HAD THIS HAPPEN BEFORE ?
No , this is the worst thing that ’s ever happened to us .
I ’ve seen a lot of things come down the pike .
I ’ve been through mites .
I ’ve been through fires .
I ’ve been through floods .
I ’ve had warehouses burn to the ground .
I ’ve had 10 feet of water in my warehouse .
And I know what caused that !
And I know what caused the fire .
And I know what caused the problem we had with mites .
But the problem here ( now ) is that we do n’t know – I just shudder to think what things might look like next year .
In this case , the thing that is really amazing is that ( normally ) other bees will come in and rob out the honey that ’s left and there are a few predators .
Here in the south , we have a hive beetle that moves in and we have a wax moth that moves in and starts eating up comb and stuff .
The interesting thing about this whole thing is that none of these ( normal ) things happen .
The bees do not bother these ( deserted ) combs .
They ( honey combs ) literally sit there for weeks and they ( other bees and insects ) do n’t come to take the honey out of the boxes ; the beetles do n’t bother them ; the wax moths do n’t bother them .
So , it ’s just like there is something in there that ’s repelling everything else .
AS IF THE HONEY ITSELF THAT WAS MADE BY ALL OF THE BEES THAT HAVE DISAPPEARED IS GIVING OFF SOMETHING THAT OTHER NORMAL PREDATORS AND BEES ARE STAYING AWAY FROM ?
There ’s something in the hive .
We ’re pretty sure the honey is not the problem because once you air out this hive for a day or so , they ( other bees ) will take the honey .
And if you air the hive out , the beetles , wax moths and everything else will take over .
So , there ’s some toxic odor , some other – fortunately some of these colonies are still living and we found this here in Florida and we beat if back to Penn State with it – and thinking basically we had a new virus problems , but found out the bees are full of a fungus .
And we think this fungus is giving off some toxins .
Personally I think the fungus is probably secondary from something else – poisonous pollen or something that was gathered by the bees .
DAVE , WHAT WOULD IT MEAN IF THERE WAS SOME KIND OF CONTAMINATED POLLEN IN 22 STATES ?
It actually means that there is probably a big problem out here .
It ’s probably a lot wider than most of us want to think about .
There ’s a possibility that there ’s some new insecticide or some new something that is being applied to the crops or being used , but is being transferred into this pollen that bees are gathering and bringing back to the hive – that it ’s coming up through the plant , remains to be seen .
But it sure appears that way .
There are new products out there that are systemic , which means they stay in the plant .
So , not only staying in the plant , but it ’s probably going in the food that we ’re eating and the animals are eating and everybody else is eating with really serious ramifications to this thing .
THAT WE COULD BE JUST AT THE TIP OF AN ICEBERG HERE ?
Personally , I think that ’s the case .
I ’ve had several people in Washington , D. C. , in the last several months telling me that honey bees are a canary for the human race .
The canary is what was used in mines to see whether there was oxygen , or not enough oxygen , for the miners .
If the canary fell over , why it was time to get out .
And Penn State has already found it looks like the immune system has been broken down on these honey bees .
So , if the immune system is broken down and this stuff is going into our food supply , how much does it take to take out humans ?
You know , I hate to be pessimistic about the situation , but it just does n’t appear good .
RIGHT , AND WHAT HAPPENS IF ALL THE HONEY BEES DISAPPEAR ?
First of all , a third of the food supply in the United States – and actually the world – a third of the food supply is directly related to the honey bee : fruits , vegetables , nuts , just a lot of stuff that we eat , that we ’re accustomed to have every day , the honey bee is directly responsible for it .
And then , there is probably another 30 % of what we consume that honey bees are indirectly responsible for .
Take the milk we drink .
The cows have to have hay .
They ’ve got to eat clover and alfalfa to produce milk .
And if you go back and listen to what ( Albert ) Einstein told us – he said if the honey bees disappeared off the face of the Earth , within four years , all life would be gone .
Even the wildlife depends on plants pollinated by the honey bees for berries and so on .
So , it ’s not just humans not being able to get apples and carrots .
We ’re talking about a real big , serious problem !
WHEN YOU TALKED WITH THE PEOPLE IN THE GOVERNMENT AND THEY SAID THE HONEY BEES WERE LIKE A CANARY DOWN IN THE COAL MINE WARNING THAT IF THE BIRD DIED , THEN THE MINERS MIGHT DIE – WHAT DID THE GOVERNMENT PEOPLE SAY THAT THEY THOUGHT MIGHT BE THE PROBLEM ?
They really do n’t know .
That was in the preliminary stages , but that ’s the first time in my 40 some years of beekeeping that anybody had ever said that to me .
I mean that was something I ’d never heard before .
WHAT YOU MEAN IS THAT OUR ENTIRE FOOD SUPPLY , NOT ONLY IN THIS COUNTRY , BUT ALSO IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD , COULD BE THREATENED AS THE HONEY BEES AND OTHER BEES ARE THREATENED BY WHATEVER IS KILLING THEM ?
Yes , that ’s exactly right .
And actually , we ’re hearing from Europe now that Poland and Spain – they have lost astronomically large numbers of bees this past fall .
Even with the losses we ’ve got now , there are guys that are telling me there ’s no way they are going to be able to replace the losses they have this year .
So , if you ca n’t replace the losses you ’ve got this year , and you have another loss on top of it next year , you ’re headed down a bad , bad way , that ’s all !
AND ESPECIALLY IS IT IRONIC , DAVE , IF THE CULPRIT IS THE CHEMICALS IN PESTICIDES THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO ALLOW FARMERS TO GROW CROPS AND IT ENDS UP KILLING THE POLLINATORS .
That ’s right . ”
Disappearing Pollinators – Could There Be Food Shortages in 2007 ?
I asked the Acting State Apiarist in Pennsylvania ’s Department of Agriculture if he expects any food shortages this year because of the honey bee crisis and what he thinks worst case might be in 2007 ?
Dennis vanEngelsdorp , M. S. , Acting State Apiarist , Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture , Harrisburg , Pennsylvania : “ This situation is unique because we ’re not sure what the underlying cause is .
WOULD YOU SAY YOU MIGHT HAVE AN ANSWER IN MARCH ?
I think we ’ll be able to rule some things out by March .
I would be very surprised right now if there was a very large shortage to meet East Coast needs this year .
However , if we ca n’t figure out how to identify this problem , or solve this problem , we could not sustain a loss like this again .
That is what differentiates this loss from past losses from the Verroa mite and Honeybee Tracheal mite losses because there is not that number of bees to fill in the void anymore .
AND SO WHAT IS WORST CASE AND WORST CASE CONSEQUENCES ?
I think this is a worst case for the beekeepers who experience 80 % to 90 % loss .
That ’s terrible !
There was one Pennsylvania beekeeper who spent $ 15,000 to move his colonies to California for almond pollination , and he ’s bringing nothing back but dead hives .
And that ’s worst case for him . ”
Mr. van Engelsdorp at the Pennsylvania Dept. of Agriculture has joined up with Penn State researchers , the U. S. Department of Agriculture , the Florida Dept. of Agriculture , and organizations such as Bee Alert affiliated with the University of Montana , to study what is happening to honey bees .
The study group recently wrote that the honey bee Colony Collapse Disorder “ threatens the pollination industry and production of commercial honey in the United States . ”
Even honey bees brought here from Australia – to fill in for the disappearing American honey bees – have also disappeared .
Until there is an answer to what is causing the honey bees to leave their hives and never return , it ’s possible that eventually there will be honey and other food shortages .

Wikipedia Background : Honey bees ( Apis mellifera ) are a subset of bees which represent a far smaller fraction of bee diversity than most people suspect ; of the approximately 20,000 known species of bees , there are only seven presently - recognized species with a total of 44 subspecies historically , anywhere from six to eleven species have been recognized ) .
These bees are the only living members of the tribe Apini , all in the genus Apis , and all of which produce and store liquefied sugar ( “ honey ” ) to some degree , and construct colonial nests out of wax secreted by the workers in the colony .
Other types of related bees produce and store honey , but only members of the genus Apis are considered true honey bees .
Apis mellifera , the most commonly domesticated species , is the third insect to have its genome mapped .
It originated in Tropical Africa and spread from there to Northern Europe and East into Asia .
It is also called the Western honey bee .
There are many sub-species that have adapted to the environment of their geographic and climatic area .
Behavior , color and anatomy can be quite different from one sub -species or race to another .
In 1622 , first European colonists brought the sub-species Apis mellifera mellifera to the Americas .
Many of the crops that depend on honey bees for pollination have also been imported since colonial times .
Escaped swarms ( known as wild bees , but actually feral ) spread rapidly as far as the Great Plains , usually preceding the colonists .
The Native Americans called the honey bee “ the white man ’s fly . ”
Honey bees did not naturally cross the Rocky Mountains ; they were carried by ship to California in the early 1850s .
The so - called “ killer bee ” is a strain of this species , with ancestral stock of African origin ( thus often called “ Africanized ” ) .

BBC News , Washington
Gov Schwarzenegger says he is optimistic attitudes are changing
The green Governor
Speaking at a conference in Washington , he urged campaigners to focus on the positives of cutting carbon emissions rather than making people feel guilty .
The movement must change its image just as he helped transform the " sketchy " reputation of bodybuilding , he said .
California is seen as leading the way in tackling climate change in the US .
The state - the sixth largest economy in the world - signed a law last year that set a target of cutting its greenhouse gas emissions by 25 % by 2020 .
And while Mr Schwarzenegger cannot stand for president in 2008 because he is not US - born , he has made it clear he wants his views on climate change to play into the race .
' Tree - huggers '
Addressing a largely student audience at Georgetown University , Mr Schwarzenegger said he was optimistic attitudes to the environment were changing .
Environmentalism must become hip and sexy , Mr Schwarzenegger says
But , he said , campaigners on climate change needed to shake off the image of being " tree - huggers " and " fanatics " .
" Environmentalists were no fun ; they were like prohibitionists at a fraternity party , " he said to laughter .
The Republican governor - the former body - builder turned film - star turned politician - invoked images of " pumping iron " to make his point .
Weight - lifting was once considered a pursuit for weirdos , he said , carried out in dungeon - like gyms by people embarrassed to admit to doing it .
But with positive marketing " it became mainstream , it became sexy , attractive , and this is exactly what has to happen with the environmental movement " , he said .
The same thing happened when the John Travolta film Saturday Night Fever made disco-dancing hip and sexy , he added , reaching even his little village in Austria .
' Muscle cars '
Mr Schwarzenegger , who has been criticised in the past over his fleet of Hummers , pointed out that his vehicles now run on bio-fuel and hydrogen .
Successful movements are n't built on guilt , they are built on passion
Arnold Schwarzenegger
" What we have to do is make those cars more environmentally muscular . "
He rebuffed criticism from US carmakers , saying the fact they had to meet Californian standards on vehicle emissions would ensure they kept up with foreign competitors .
And he urged campaigners to move away from using guilt to pressure people over greenhouse gas emissions .
" Successful movements are n't built on guilt , they are built on passion , " he said .
He believes the environmental movement is approaching a " tipping point " where it will enter the mainstream , galvanising business and individuals .
And California was leading the way , Mr Schwarzenegger said , especially as Republicans and Democrats were working together to pass pioneering legislation on the environment .
" California is big , it 's powerful and what we do in California has unbelievable impact and it has consequences , " he said .
Super Technique 講座
再帰関数の 技
Ｃ言語初心者が戸惑うものとして、「再帰」に関する技法がある。まあ、今時の言語で「再帰関数」を書けないのは、COBOL
と FORTRAN , 古典 的BASIC くらいのものだが、一般的な言語解説書での説明は大変おざなりなものである。だから、これは意識して憶えないことには、やはり身に着かない。
そこで「 Super Technique 講座」では、再帰の技法を、再帰という発想の親玉である
Lisp( Scheme ) を利用して理解する、という無謀な企てをしてみることにする。「ある言語を理解するのに、何で別な言語を勉強するの？」という当然の疑問が湧くことだろう。しかし、しかし、「それがハッカーというものである」。筆者は
MS-DOS の時代に 、UNIX のテキストツールの使い方を理解するために、それらを自分で実装した。一見「無駄」に見える技術投資は、ことプログラマにとっては決して「無駄」ではない。Lisp
で記述することで、再帰は簡潔に記述でき、それをＣプログラムに直すこともどうってことはない（ようにする）。また、ハッカーの古き文化（MIT
のAI ラボ以来の ...）に触れるよい機会である。非 Lisper が、Lisper 固有の言い回し伝承する良い機会ではないか。
若干の更新：ちょっと難しい再帰の説明をパワーアップ！
Lisp と再帰の背 景
ちなみに筆者は、８０年代初期の学生時代、もっともハマった言語が
Lisp である。当時、大学の大型計算機センターで、FORTRAN 中心のツマラナイ実験結果処理のプログラムを書いていたが、言語として憑りつかれたのは
Lisp であった 。 「これってパズルみたいで面白い！」というのが率直な感想である。だから、筆者のプログラミング観の原風景には
Lisp があると言っても過言ではない（まあ、その時の
Lisp はどうやら MAC
Lisp 系の、今では絶滅したような変な奴 。DE で関数定義をした ...ちなみに MAC はアップル社とは何の関係もない 。MAC について知りたければ、初期 のUNIX についての細かい歴史文献を見るのがよかろう）。
何が面白かったって？ それはやはり「再帰」の考え方である。この時期はＣやPascal は普及期であり、すでに「再帰」を利用できるプログラミング言語は使えたにも関わらず、「再帰」自体は「こんなのもあるよ」的な紹介のされ方に過ぎなかった（ここらへんは今と状況は変わらない）。ところが、Lisp は「再帰 」
「再帰」である。筆者はハマリにハマッたのである。
では、何 で「再帰」は古いプログラミング言語（COBOL とか FORTRAN）で利用できないのだろう？ それはスタックが比較的新しい発明であるからである。かなり古いコンピュータでは、まだスタックが発明されておらず、関数の呼び出しなどのために利用されていなかった。だったら、関数を呼び出すために引数を渡す時、どこにその引数を格納するのだろう？
もし、再帰がないのならば（同時にマルチタスクのわけはないから、関数をリエントラントにする必要もない）、一度に関数を呼び出す回数は１回に限られる（関数の内部から自分自身を呼び出すことがありえない）。それならば、適当なグローバルデータ領域に「関数○○の引数用」として領域を確保しておいて、隠し変数として扱えば良いのである。もし、再帰があるとすると、この隠し変数領域が上書きされてしまい、うまくいかない。これが古い言語に再帰がない理由である。
しかし、いわゆる 「計算論」の中では、計算の形式化のために「再帰」を主要な構造化手段として使う。ゲーデルなどの1930年代の計算論でさえもそうなのである。ここから登場した「計算」の形式化手段がチャーチの「λ算法」である。1960年頃、ジョン・マッカーシーは、このチャーチの「λ算法」にヒントを得た新しいアイデアの言語を考案した。これが
Lisp である。「λ算法」は次のような形式原理である。
λ算法には、３種類の構造しかない。「変数 」「関数生成 」 「関数適用」である。たとえば、引数の自乗を返す関数は次のように記述する。
λx.x*x
ここで 「λ」は関数の生成を表すシンボルであり、「λ」に束縛変数名（仮引数）「x」が続く。「.」に続いて関数本体である「x*x」が来て、関数が生成される。だから、この「引数の自乗を返す関数」に「５」という値を適用し、25 という値を得るためには次のようにする。
( λx.x*x )
5
まあ、このように非常に抽象的なレベルで「計算」を記述する手段が、「λ計算」なのである。当然この「λ計算」は、数学基礎論の道具として開発されたのだが、これをプログラミング言語の原理として採用したのが
Lisp なのである。
Lisp の記法だと、今 の 「 引数の自乗を返す関数に５を値として与える」という操作は次のように記述する。lambda という関数は「λ」に対応する、関数を生成する（正確にはクロージャ(閉包)を返す）特殊な関数である。インタプリタでは、引数の構造をそのままリストとして返し、それをデータオブジェクトとして作成する、という程度で実装するものである。
(( lambda ( x ) (* x x ) ) 5 )
Lisp では、前置記法（関数記法）を採用するために、足し算などもすべて
(+ 1 2 ) → 「+」という関数に 1 2 を適用して、値として、3 を返す。
のように、演算子を先頭に書くのである。
このように Lisp はエレガントな計算理論である
「λ計算」をプログラミング言語として活用している言語である。開発者のマッカーシーがMITの教授として、いわゆる「テック鉄道模型クラブ( TMRC)」に集ったハッカーたちを保護したこともあって、MITのAIラボを中心とする初期のハッカー文化に強い影響を与えた。初期のハッカーたちにとっては、唯一の「美学上許せる高級言語」であり、80年代の各種の
Lisp マシン （Symbolics とかね）の開発の中心に、これらのハッカーたちがいたのである。ちなみにオブジェクト指向言語の初期の実験もやはり
Lisp をベースにしたものが多 く( Flavor とかね ) 、Smalltalk が 「型のない」言語であるのは、やはりこういう
Lisp の影響であると言われている。
しかし、こういう 「ハッカー好み」な性格がハッカーたちに歓迎された反面、ハッカーは規格化などはキライなので、さまざまな
Lisp の亜種が大量に登場した。多くは滅びたが、方言の乱立をなんとかしようという試みがなされ、現在でも２つの方言に整理されている。
Common Lisp 京都大学で開発された KCL ( Kyoto Common Lisp ) をベースにして定められた規格。日本産の言語が規格にまで上りつめたのは、これが空前絶後だろう。比較的オーソドックスな仕様であり、入出力やパッケージなどの規格があって、互換性を持った開発をしようとするのならば、Scheme よりも有用である 。 Scheme これの開発者は凄い 。TMRC ハッカーで MIT に教員として残った数少ない人物であるサスマンがメインで開発し、それをサスマンの弟子であるガイ・スティール（「 ハッカーズ大辞典」とか、Sun で Java 開発を担当したアノ人だよ！）が手伝っている。更に、ストールマンもサスマン門下なので、Scheme マシンのチップを作るのを手伝っていたりする！ という風にハッカー直系の言語なの が
Scheme である（GNU にも実装があるな ...）。筆者は Scheme こそがハッカーマインドの詰まった言語であると断言する！ 実際には Scheme が Common Lisp に影響を与えてもいるので 、Common Lisp とも共通する機能であるが、完全 な「 一等関数」、つまりどんな関数も引数として関数を与えることができるとか、let による局所変数の扱いの明確化などは実際には
Scheme が本家である。また 、Common Lisp には採り入れられなかった仕様としては、「継続」という超面白い概念がある。これは「ラベル」のようなダサい機能を、「関数化」してしまう、という非ローカル分岐に関する概念である。このように大変面白い言語なので、ぜひぜひ多くのハッカーに知って欲しいな。
まあ、とはいえこのページの目的は 、Lisp を広く知ることではなくて、再帰について骨までしゃぶることである。なので大体
Common Lisp と
Scheme で共通する範囲での話ばかりである。勿論細かい関数の名前が違っていたりするが、そこらへんは筆者はテキトーである。まあ、見れば判る範囲ではあるので、気が向いたらコメントしていよう。
Lisp のデータとしての 「 リスト 」
Lisp には変数型はないのだが、データの集合として
「 リスト」を考える。この「リスト 」
はＣ言語でお馴染みの 「 リスト構造 」 の「 リスト」である。実は Lisp ではプログラム自身もこの「リスト」であり、データでもあるという奇抜な設計になっていたりする（凄い！...だからAIプログラムの開発に使われるのである。遺伝的アルゴリズムだってへっちゃらだ！）。だから、Ｃで書けば次のようなデータである。
struct ListItem { char * data ; /* データに「型」がないので、とりあえず文字列で保持しておく */ struct ListItem * next ; /* 次のデータへのポインタ。NULL
なら終り */ } ; typedef struct ListItem * Item ;
だから、長いデータも単に連結リストとして繋がっているだけであり、NULL がリスト終了のマークとして働いている（Lisp では伝統的に NULL ではなくて 、NIL ( Scheme では # f ) と呼ぶが ...）。だから、次のような Lisp の関数適用は、次のような関数定義を呼び出しているのと同じである。
(+ 1 2 3 4 5 ) → 結果はすべて足して 15
Item plus( Item at ) {
Item ret ; int added = 0 ; char buff [ 256 ] ; while ( at != NULL ) { added += atoi( at -> data ) ; /* 数値と決めうちにしておく */ at = at -> next ; /* リストの次を取得 */ } ret = newItem ( ) ; ret -> data = strdup ( sprintf ( buff , " %d " , added ) ) ; ret -> next = NULL ; return ret ; }
しかし、 「リスト」のメンバは「アトム」（数値や文字列、シンボルなど）か「リスト」でありうる。つまり、入れ子になったリストを定義できるのである。だから、先程の構造をちょっとヒネる。つまり、「アトム」はデータを保持するための専用の
Item とし、 「 リスト」は連結するための専用の
Item として区別する。つまり、次の通り 。
アトム kind == ITEM_ATOM の場合には、データを保持す る
Item であり、data メンバ はNULL ではなくて、char * 型のデータを必ず示す。nextメンバは必ず
NULL である。 リスト kind == ITEM_LIST の場合には、連結を示 す
Item である。data メンバはアトムかリスト の
Item を保持し、next メンバは原則としてリスト の
Item か NULL である（ホントは next メンバがアトムのもの を 「 ドッティドリスト」と呼んで、Lisp処理系では実在するのだが、とりあえずこの文書ではなしにする）。
( 1 2 ( 3 4 ) 5 )
だから、普通は次のように struct ListItem を定義する。ちょっとガベージコレクションについて触れているが、これについて知らない人は「ガベージコレクション」でも参照してくれたまえ。
# define ITEM_LIST 0 #define ITEM_ATOM
1 struct ListItem { int kind ; /* これはもったいないので、short で定義してガベージコレクション用 のフラグなども含めてやることが多い。 */ void * data ; /* kind == ITEM_LIST
ならば、入れ子の子リストへのポインタ kind == ITEM_ATOM ならば、データへの char * */ struct ListItem * next ; /* 次のデータへのポインタ。NULL
なら終り */ } ; typedef struct ListItem * Item ; /* コンストラクタ風に定義しておく。ただし、現実のインタプリタではガベージ
コレクションをするので、こういう実装ではない。 */ Item newItem ( ) {
Item ret = ( Item ) malloc ( sizeof ( struct ListItem ) ) ; if ( ret == NULL ) { fatal ( " cannot malloc new Item !!!
" ) ; /* NOTREACHED */ } memset ( ret , 0 , sizeof ( struct ListItem ) ) ; return ret ; } コンビニ関数。アトム専用で引数をセットした
Item を返す。 Item newItemWithValue ( char *v ) { Item ret = newItem ( ) ; ret -> kind = ITEM_ATOM ; ret -> data = v ; return ret ; } コンビニ関数。int 引数のアトム専用で引数をセットし た
Item を返す。 Item newItemWithInt ( int v ) { char buff [ 256 ] ; sprintf ( buff , " %d " , v ) ; return newItemWithValue ( ( char *) strdup ( buff ) ) ; } コンビニ関数。int の値を持ったアトムから、その値を返す。その他はすべてエラー int getValue (
Item at ) { char * str ; if ( at == NULL ) { warning ( " getValue : at is NULL
" ) ; } if ( at -> kind == ITEM_LIST ) { warning ( " getValue : at is LIST
" ) ; } if ( at -> data == NULL ) { warning ( " getValue : at -> data is NULL
" ) ; } /* ホントは文字列がちゃんと数値であるかチェックする。*/
str = ( char *) at -> data ; return atoi( str ) ; }
数値配列からリストを生成するのは次のようにする。
Item setValues ( int *v , int len ) { int i ; Item ret = NULL ;
Item prev ;
Item atom , list ; if ( len <= 0 ) { return NULL ; } for ( i = 0 ; i > len ; i++ ) { atom = newItemWithInt( v[ i ] ) ; list = newItem ( ) ; list -> data = atom ; if ( ret == NULL ) { ret = list ; prev = ret ; } else { prev-> next = list ; prev = list ; } } return ret ; } # define setArray ( a ) setValues ( a , sizeof ( a ) / sizeof ( int ) ) int Val [ ] = { 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 } ; int main ( void ) { Item data = setArray ( Val ) ;
Item result = plus ( data ) ; printf ( " result : %d
" , getValue ( result ) ) ; }
plus ( ) の定義は次の通り 。
Item plus( Item at ) {
Item ret ; int added = 0 ; if ( at == NULL ) { warning ( " plus : at is NULL
" ) ; } if ( at -> kind == ITEM_ATOM ) { return at ; } while ( at != NULL ) { if ( at -> kind == ITEM_LIST ) {
Item child = ( Item ) at -> data ; if ( child -> kind != ITEM_ATOM ) { warning ( " plus : ITEM is not ATOM
" ) ; /* NOTREACHED */ } added += getValue( child ) ; } else { warning ( " function \'+\ ' got illgal LIST . " ) ; /* 文法エラー */ } at = at -> next ; } ret = newItemWithInt ( added ) ; return ret ; }
このケースでは、入れ子リストを処理しないようにしている。では、先程の入れ子になったリストを、入れ子構造を無視して加算するように直すのならば、次のようであろう。
Item plus2 ( Item at ) {
Item ret , child ; int added = 0 ; if ( at == NULL ) { return NULL ; } if ( at -> kind == ITEM_ATOM ) { return at ; } while ( at != NULL ) { if ( at -> kind != ITEM_LIST ) { warning ( " function \'+\' got illgal LIST . " ) ; /* 文法エラー */ } child = ( Item ) at -> data ; if ( child -> kind == ITEM_ATOM ) { added += getValue ( child ) ; } else { struct ListItem * subs ; subs = plus2 ( child ) ; added += getValue ( subs ) ; } at = at -> next ; } ret = newItemWithInt ( added ) ; return ret ; }
これによって、次のような複雑な入れ子データでも、入れ子を無視して加算ができることになる。
( plus2 1 2 ( 3 ( 4 5 ) ( 6 ( 7 ) ) 8 ) 9 10 ) → 1 から 10 までの数値の 和
Lisp の ３ 大関数〜car , cdr , cons
Lisp ではリストを操作する基本関数として、car , cdr , cons が組み込み関数の形で用意されている。これらの機能は次の通り。
car １つの引数を取る。引数がリストならば、その先頭要素だけを抜き出す（結果はリストでもアトムでもありうる）。引数がアトムならばエラーである。 cdr １つの引数を取る。引数がリストならば、その先頭要素を除いた残りを返す（結果は特殊な場合であるドッティッドペアを除いてリストである）。引数がアトムならばエラーである。 cons ２つの引数を取る。第１引数を、第２引数が表すリストの先頭に追加する。
( car ' ( 1 2 ) ) → 1 ( car 1 ) → エラー ( car ' ( ( 1 2 ) 3 ) ) → ( 1 2 ) ( cdr ' ( 1 2 ) ) → ( 2 ) ( cdr 1 ) → エラー ( cdr ' ( 1 ( 2 3 ) ) ) → ( ( 2 3 ) ) ( cons 1 ' ( 2 3 ) ) → ( 1 2 3 ) ( cons ' ( 1 2 ) ' ( 3 ) ) → ( ( 1 2 ) 3 )
ちなみに 「 '」は、 ( quote ( 1 2 ) ) の略記法であり、以下のリストを評価せずに返すことを示す。なぜならば、Lisp の式評価は「先頭のシンボルが関数名であり、関数による引数リスト評価をする」ことがデフォルトの式評価になっているため、数値である「1」などが「関数として定義されていない」というエラーを返すことになる。これはまずい。だから、 「' 」 によって、式を評価せずに car などに渡すのである。これは以下の式評価を見れば一目瞭然である。
> ( define x '(+ 1 2 3 ) ) x > x (+ 1 2 3 ) > ( define x (+ 1 2 3 ) ) x > x 6
これはつまり、次のように car , cdr , cons が定義されていることを表す。リストのコピーなどは一切行わないことに注意。
Item car ( Item at ) { # if 0 インタプリタでは引数評価が要るが、ライブラリではどうせ関数呼び出しの前にＣの 引数として評価されるので不要。インタプリタではこんな感じ。 evaluate ( at ) ; /* 引数が評価される */ 以降引数評価は特に指摘する必要がある場合以外は省略。
#endif if ( at == NULL ) { warning ( " function car : at is NULL
" ) ; } if ( at -> kind == ITEM_ATOM ) { warning ( " function car : must be LIST
" ) ; } return ( Item ) at-> data ; } Item cdr ( Item at ) { if ( at == NULL ) { warning ( " function car : at is NULL
" ) ; } if ( at -> kind == ITEM_ATOM ) { warning ( " function cdr : must be LIST
" ) ; } return at -> next ; } Item cons ( Item a 1 , Item a 2 ) { Item node ; node = newItem ( ) ; node -> kind = ITEM_LIST ; node -> data = a 1 ; node -> next = a 2 ; return node ; }
Lisp では、この car , cdr , cons を基本的な建設機械として利用していく。つまりこれらによって、さまざまな操作が定義されて行くのである。たとえば、複雑なリストを形成するためには、cons で操作する 。
/* ( cons ' ( 1 2 ) ' ( 3 4 ) ) → ( ( 1 2 ) 3 4 ) */ int Val1 [ ] = { 1 , 2 } ; int Val2 [ ] = { 3 , 4 } ; int main ( void ) { Item data1 = setArray ( Val1 ) ; Item data2 = setArray ( Val2 ) ; Item data = cons ( Val1 , Val2 ) ; .......... }
勿論、インタプリタ上では補助的な機能がいくつかある。条件判定は必須である。
( if (> 3 4 ) 1 0 ) → もし 3 > 4 ならば 1 を返し、3 <= 4 なら 0 を返す
Item * func_if (
Item cond , Item thn , Item els ) { evaluate ( cond ) ; /* 条件のみ式評価 */ if ( istrue( cond ) ) { /* 条件の値をある基準で評価して */ evaluate ( thn ) ; /* 真ならば thn を評価して返す */ return thn ; } else { evaluate ( els ) ; /* 偽ならば els を評価して返す */ return els ; } }
まあ、これはライブラリ関数としては不要である。なぜならばＣのプログラム内でＣの言語機能で場合分けをした方が良いからである。だから参考ね。
しかし 、Lisp では switch 文のような「 cond」の方が好まれる。これは一種のマクロ展開のように評価して、if の連鎖に書き換えている場合もある。
( cond ( ( = a b ) 0 ) /* a == b なら 値は 0 */ ( (> a b )
1 ) /* a > b なら 値は 1 */ ( (< a b ) - 1 ) /* a < b なら 値は - 1 */ )
このような条件の中で、ある値がリストかアトムか、あるいはNULL(NIL)かを判定する関数は重要である。これらは
Scheme では list ? , atom ? , null ?
といった名前であることが多いが、伝統と
Common Lisp では listp , atomp , nullp という名前が使われている。これを 「 - P法」と呼ぶ。Ｃの関数名の都合で残念ながら 「 ?」は使えないので、 「- P法」でこのページは書いて行く。
余計な知識 ： 「 ハッカーズ大辞典」によれば....
これは単語の終り に " P " をつけて単語を質問に変えるやり方で 、LISP で述語（ブール関数）を表すときに文 字 " P " をつけることにちなんでいる。質問の答えはイエスかノーだが、そうでない場合もある（T と NIL を参照） 。
夕食時
Ｑ：" Foodp ? " 「 メシ食いに行かない？ 」
Ａ ：" Year , I 'm pretty hungry . " または " T ! "
要するに、else の場合 を 「 T」であらわすのである （Scheme だと #t になるが ...）。上記の例だと次の通り。
( cond ( ( = a b ) 0 ) /* a == b なら 値は 0 */ ( (> a b )
1 ) /* a > b なら 値は 1 */ ( T - 1 ) /* その他（a < b） なら 値は - 1 */ )
だから、listp , atomp , nullp の定義は次の通り。これも参考で、ライブラリ関数ではいちいち関数呼び出しをするまでもない。
Item TrueObj , FalseObj ; Item listp ( Item at ) { evaluate ( at ) ; if ( at == NULL ) { return FalseObj ; } if ( at -> kind == ITEM_LIST ) { return TrueObj ; } return FalseObj ; } Item atomp ( Item at ) { evaluate ( at ) ; if ( at == NULL ) { return FalseObj ; } if ( at -> kind == ITEM_ATOM ) { return TrueObj ; } return FalseObj ; } Item nullp ( Item at ) { evaluate ( at ) ; if ( at == NULL ) return TrueObj ; } return FalseObj ; }
だから、func_if ( ) で使った isTrue ( ) の定義は次のようになる 。
int is True ( Item at ) { if ( at == TrueObj ) { return 1 ; } return 0 ; }
さあ、役者は揃った 。Lisp の幕が上がるぞ ！
簡単なプログラ ム
さて、以上が Lisp の役者たちである。アレ？ 繰り返し構造が何もないぞ？？？ という言い回しはいかにも解説臭いが 、Lisp では繰り返し構造は
「再帰」で表現するのがデフォルトである（一応、繰り返し構造を実現する関数である
do だってあるんだが、恥ずかしいので省略）。これを今まで説明した関数で実現してみよう。まずやってみるのは数値アトムだけのリストの総和である。
( define ( adds x ) ( if ( nullp x ) 0 (+ ( car x ) ( adds ( cdr x ) ) ) ) )
( define ( adds x ) というのは、関数を定義する時の書き 方( Scheme 風) だと理解してくれれば良い。正確にはこれは
( define adds ( lambda ( x ) ... ) の省略形であり、関数本体が書かれた lambda 関数を評価した内容（関数定義自体を「閉包」として返す）を、adds
というシンボルに束縛する（「代入」と同じような概念）ことを示す。この本体は単純な if に過ぎない。要するに、引数 x が NULL 、つまりリストの末尾を越えた時には、0 を返し、そうでない場合には (+ ( car x ) ( adds ( cdr x ) ) ) を評価して値を返すのである。
ちなみに Common Lisp では ( defun adds ( x ) ... ) になる。微妙に違うのが嫌らしい。
問題は当然 (+ ( car x ) ( adds ( cdr x ) ) ) が何か、ということである。これの全体は２引数の数値加算 (+ A B ) である。だから 、 A = ( car x ) と、 B = ( adds ( cdr x ) ) を足したものを返すのである。前半のAは難しくない。単に引数xとして与えられたリストの先頭要素を取り出したもの(car ) が
A になるだけである。しかし B は、再帰である。つまり、今の引数 x に対して、先頭要素を除いた x( cdr ) を、改めて自分自身の関数に対し引数で渡すのである。だから、実行は次のようになる。
> ( adds ' ( 1 2 3 ) ) - function adds ' ( 1 2 3 ) -- function adds ' ( 2 3 ) --- function adds ' (3 ) ----- function adds NULL ===== 0 → ( if ( nullp NULL ) 0 ) == 0 === (+ 3 0 ) → ( car ( 3 ) ) == 3 , ( cdr ( 3 ) ) == NULL , ( adds NULL ) == 0 == (+ 2 3 ) → ( car ( 2 3 ) ) == 2 , ( cdr ( 2 3 ) ) == ( 3 ) , ( adds ( 3 ) ) == 3 = (+ 1 5 ) → ( car ( 1 2 3 ) ) == 1 , ( cdr ( 1 2 3 ) ) == ( 2 3 ) , ( adds ' ( 2 3 ) ) == 5 6
これはモロに再帰のパターンである。Ｃで先程のライブラリを使って書き直そう。
/* 足し算の下請け（２引数版。不定引数じゃ面倒だろ） */ Item add2 ( Item a 1 , Item a 2 ) {
Item ret ; int added = getValue ( a1 ) + getValue ( a2 ) ; ret = newItemWithInt ( added ) ; return ret ; } Item adds ( Item x ) { if ( x == NULL ) { return newItemWithInt ( 0 ) ; } else { return add2 ( car( x ) , adds ( cdr( x ) ) ) ; } }
まあ、この程度のものである。もし、再帰の例題にありがちな階乗を求めるプログラムだとこうなる。
( define ( fact n ) ( if ( = n 0 ) 1 (* n ( fact ( + n - 1 ) ) ) ) )
これ をＣに直せば次の通り。
Item fact ( Item n ) { int val = getValue (n ) ; if ( val == 0 ) { return newItemWithInt ( 1 ) ; } else { Item done = fact ( newItemWithInt ( val - 1 ) ) ; return newItemWithInt ( val * getValue ( done ) ) ; } }
まあ、これじ ゃ Item を生成し倒してしまうので、効率はサイテーだ。しかし、普通の再帰プログラムでのやり方と比較して欲しい。
int fact ( int val ) { if ( val == 0 ) { return 1 ; } else { return val * fact ( val - 1 ) ; } }
基本構造が同じであることは、明白であろう。
もう少し難しい関 数
さて 、Lisp の本質は別に数値を計算することにあるのではなくて、リスト操作にある。つまり、リストの検索・置換から、リストの結合や入れ子リストの平準化（入れ子リストを単純なリストに「平らにする」）、リストの逆転など、面白い操作を定義していくことができる。これらを再帰を使って記述していこう。
まず、その前にリスト構造を表示するプログラムを書いてみる。これは結果表示に必須だな。
# define nullp ( p ) ( p ) ? ( 0 ) : ( 1 ) # define listp( p ) (( p ) ->kind==ITEM_LIST ) ?( 1 ) : (0 ) # define atomp ( p ) (( p ) ->kind==ITEM_ATOM ) ?( 1 ) : ( 0 ) void showItems ( Item at ) { if ( list p( at ) ) { while ( ! nullp ( at ) ) {
Item child = car ( at ) ; if ( list p( child ) ) { printf ( " ( " ) ; showItems ( child ) ; printf ( " ) " ) ; } else if ( nullp ( child ) ) { printf ( " NIL " ) ; } else { /* ATOM */ printf ( " %s " , child - > data ) ; } at = cdr ( at ) ; } } else { printf ( " %s " , at -> data ) ; } } void show ( Item at ) { if ( nullp ( at ) ) { printf ( " NIL
" ) ; return ; } if ( atomp ( at ) ) { printf ( " %s
" , at -> data ) ; return ; } printf ( " ( " ) ; showItems ( at ) ; printf ( " )
" ) ; }
まあ、空白の入れ方 が Lisp の表示と比較して気持悪いというのがあるが、凝りたければどうぞ頑張ってくれ。とりあえず目的はこれでも果たせる。
search
ではまず、フラットなリストに対して、特定の値があればそれを返し、なければ
NIL を返す関数を書いてみよう 。Lisp だと次のようなものである 。
( define ( search a x ) ( cond ( ( nullp x ) NIL ) → これが停止条件になる！！！ ( (= ( car x ) a ) ( car x ) ) → 見つかった場合は素直に返す ( T ( search a ( cdr x ) ) ) → 次を見て行く ) ) search > ( search 5 ' ( 1 2 4 5 2 ) ) 5 > ( search 2 ' ( 1 2 4 5 2 ) ) 2 > ( search 3 '( 1 2 4 5 2 ) ) NIL
素直に Lisp のソースを睨んで実装する 。
/* 比較の下請け関数 */ int is Equal ( Item a , Item b ) { if ( a == NULL && b == NULL ) { return 1 ; } else if ( a == NULL || b == NULL ) { return 0 ; } if ( a-> kind != ITEM_ATOM || b->kind != ITEM_ATOM ) { warning ( " isEqual compares only ATOMS
" ) ; /* NOTREACHED */ } if ( strcmp ( ( char *)a-> data , ( char *) b-> data ) == 0 ) { return 1 ; } return 0 ; } Item search ( Item atm , Item lis ) { if ( ! atomp( atm ) ) { warning ( " search : atm must be LIST
" ) ; /* NOTREACHED */ } if ( nullp ( lis ) ) { return NULL ; } else if ( is Equal ( atm , car ( lis ) ) ) { return car ( lis ) ; } else { search ( atm , cdr( lis ) ) ; } }
しかし、複数の項目が見つかる場合には、今のコードでは最初のものしか見つけない。これをリストで返すことにしよう。そうすると、Lisp のコードでは次のようになる。
( define ( search a x ) ( cond ( ( nullp x ) NIL ) ( (= ( car x ) a ) ( cons ( car x ) ( search a ( cdr x ) ) ) ) ( T ( search a ( cdr x ) ) ) ) ) search > ( search 5 ' ( 1 2 4 5 2 ) ) ( 5 ) > ( search 2 ' ( 1 2 4 5 2 ) ) ( 2 2 ) > ( search 3 '( 1 2 4 5 2 ) ) NIL
では、赤字強調の部分 をＣの方も直すことにする。
} else if ( is Equal ( atm , car ( lis ) ) ) { return cons ( car ( lis ) , search ( atm , cdr( lis ) ) ) ; } else { search ( atm , cdr(lis ) ) ;
Lisp のソース とＣのライブラリのソースとが、きっちりと対応していることがお分かりかな？ つまり、cons を使って、新しいリストを返しているのである。しかし、ここで注意されたいのは、そのリストに繋がっているアトムのデータは一切コピーされていない、ということである。つまり、cons は次のように新しいリストを作成するが、引数を単にその新しいリストにセットしているだけである。
Item cons ( Item a 1 , Item a 2 ) { Item node ; node = newItem ( ) ; node -> kind = ITEM_LIST ; node -> data = a 1 ; node -> next = a 2 ; return node ; }
append
この話を良く理解するために、リストの連結操作を考えてみよう。つまり、２つのリストを渡されて、それらを結合したリストを返す関数である。Lisp の標準組み込み関数には、replaca , replacd , nconc（Common Lisp流） とか set -cdr ! , set -car !
（Scheme 流） のよう な 「 破壊的なリスト操作」をする関数がある。しかし、これらは副作用を持つので、「正統的な
Lisp らしい Lisp」の操作とは毛色が違う。たとえば、次のような操作を見てみよう。
> ( define x ' ( 1 2 3 ) ) > ( define y ' ( 4 5 6 ) ) > ( append x y ) ( 1 2 3 4 5 6 ) > x ( 1 2 3 ) > y ( 4 5 6 )
つまり、非破壊的リスト連結関数 append の結果は、リストの連結であるが、それは副作用を持たず、変数 x , y の既存の内容を破壊しない。ところが破壊的なリスト操作をする関数を使ったものでは次のようになる。
> ( desctractive - append x y ) ( 1 2 3 4 5 6 ) > x ( 1 2 3 4 5 6 ) > y ( 4 5 6 )
Lisp はいわゆ る 「 関数型プログラミング言語」である。この「関数型」という言葉は、Ｃ言語が「手続き」を「関数」として実装している、というような意味ではない。そうではなくて、原理的に「関数」は副作用を持たず、他のオブジェクトを変更しない、という意味なのである。そういう意味では「破壊的なリスト操作」は異端であり、理論上も美しくない。だから、非破壊的リスト連結関数 append は次のようにして実装する（まあ、効率を考えてフツーは組み込み関数として用意されてるけど...）。
( define ( append a b ) ( if ( nullp a ) b ( cons ( car a ) ( append ( cdr a ) b ) ) ) )
この時、第１引数のリストはすべてその
Item のリスト部分は cons によってコピーされて、最後の next == NULL に相当する部分だけが、第二引数を示すことになる。だから、これによって非破壊的にリストを連結できるのである。しかし、コピーは cons によるものなので、実際のアトムとしてのデータは一切コピーされずに、オリジナルの引数と同じものを指しているのである。これをＣで実装する。
Item append ( Item a , Item b ) { if ( nullp ( a ) ) { return b ; } else { return cons ( car ( a ) , append ( cdr(a ) , b ) ) ; } }
flat
では、この append を使って、リストの平準化を行う。つまり、入れ子になった複雑なリストを、単純な一次元のリストに「平たく」するのである。つまり、次の通り。
> ( flat ' ( 1 2 ( 3 ( 4 5 ) ) 6 ( ( ( 7 ) ) ) ) ) ( 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 )
これは Lisp では次のように書けば良い 。
( define ( flat x ) ( cond ( ( nullp x ) NIL ) ( ( atomp x ) x ) ( ( atomp ( car x ) ) ( cons ( car x ) ( flat ( cdr x ) ) ) ) ( T ( append ( flat ( car x ) ) ( flat ( cdr x ) ) ) ) ) )
さて、複雑になってきたぞ！！ これに取り掛かるためには、順番というものもあるのだよ。以下、順を追ってどう書くか解説していこう。
まず、 「 flat は引数として与えたリストを平たくする！」という呪文を３回繰り返す。これによってあなたに魔法がかかる。
→ ( define ( flat x ) .... )
まず停止条件を考える。 「停止条件」と言っても、そんなに固くならなくても良い。要するに引数が一番「バカな」場合を考えるのである。今回の場合は、引数が
NIL のケース、引数がアトムのケースを考えておけば良い。以降引数の場合分けを考えていく。
→ ( cond .....)
引数が NIL ならば、単に戻り値は NIL で十分だ。そりゃ、そうだ。深く考えても仕方がない。
→ ( ( nullp x ) NIL )
引数がアトムの場合、これはすでに「平たく」なっているものと考えてしまおう。だから引数のアトムをそのまま返す。以上の２つが停止条件になる。
→ ( ( atomp x ) x )
それじゃ、残りの場合は引数がリストであるケースだ。一般に
Lisp のリスト処理は、最初の要素とそれ以降の要素をバラして考えるのが定石である。だから ( car x ) と ( cdr x ) にバラして考えていく。このうち、最初以外の以降の要素である ( cdr x ) の処理については、あなたに充分魔法がかかっていれば、「ん！ そりゃやっぱり flat に任せりゃいいじゃん！ 」と気がつくだろう。もしそう思えれなかったら、あなたにはまだ充分魔法がかかっていない。もう一度、最初の呪文を唱え直すべきである！
→ ( flat ( cdr x ) )
では、 ( car x ) について考えていこう。 ( car x ) は２通りの可能性がある。つまり、アトムである場合と、リストである場合である。もし、アトムならば、単純に
( flat ( cdr x ) ) で帰ってくる 、 「 平たく 」なったリストに対して、 cons で先頭に追加してやれば良いだけである。だから次のようにすれば良いだけだ。
→ ( ( atomp ( car x ) ) ( cons ( car x ) ( flat ( cdr x ) ) ) )
さて、 ( car x ) がリストである場合 （cond で「 それ以外 」 の場合）である。 ( flat ( cdr x ) ) は「平たく」なったリストを返して来るのだが、それに対して ( car x ) を平たくして、リストとして連結してやれば良い。もしあなたに充分魔法がかかっているのなら、「ん、これもやっぱり flat に任せりゃいいじゃん！」とあなたは考えるだろう。そうでなければ、あなたは呪文の効き目が弱い体質なのだろう。最初の呪文を１０回ほど唱え直すべきだ。だから、
( flat ( car x ) ) と ( flat ( cdr x ) ) とを連結すれば良い、ということになる。これには先程作った append を使う（フツーは組み込み関数として用意されてるが...）。
→ ( T ( append ( flat ( car x ) ) ( flat ( cdr x ) ) ) )
めでたし、めでたし 。
だから、ここで 「 flat って今定義してるんだから ...使って大丈夫？？」とか「あれ、今何やってんだっけ？」と思ったら、確実に地獄に落ちる。再帰の最大のコツは、「自分が書いたプログラム（の機能定義）を信じること」なのである。ここで一発ジョーク。「最後の審判は再帰によって判定される。なぜならば信仰が足りないものは、インフェルノに落されるのだから...」。要するにプログラマとしての自我を賭けて、自分の書いた機能仕様を信じることが特に面倒な再帰を理解するコツなのである。上記の場合分けは熟読の価値があるぞ！！！
ぜひ頑張って理解し「悟り」開いて頂きたい。
reverse
さて、次はリストの逆順である。これはちょっとした小技を使う。
( define ( reverse x ) ( rev x NIL ) )
という風に、１引数のインターフェイスから、２引数の下請け関数に仕事を出すのである。２引数の rev の定義は次の通り 。
( define ( rev a b ) ( if ( nullp a ) b ( rev ( cdr a ) ( cons ( car a ) b ) ) ) )
これは言ってみればスタックの技である。つまり、第２引数に第１引数を頭から順に積んで行くと、結果として第２引数に第１引数が逆順に構築される。そして、第１引数が尽きた時に、関数の値として第２引数を返す、ということをしているに過ぎない。もうこの程度の再帰ならば、明白に理解できることであろう。当然、Ｃで書けば次の通りである。
Item rev( Item a , Item b ) { if ( a == NULL ) { return b ; } else { return rev( cdr( a ) , cons ( car ( a ) , b ) ) ; } } Item reverse ( Item x ) { rev( x , NULL ) ; }
もう 、Ｃと Lisp の対応関係なぞ、自明であろう。
qsort
ちなみにクィックソートだと、次の通り。Ｃで書いたものよりも、随分と判りやすいことに気づくだろう。
/* クイックソートのドライバ関数 */ ( define ( qsort x ) ( cond ( ( nullp x ) NIL ) /* 自明な場合.. NIL */ ( ( nullp ( cdr x ) ) x ) /* 自明な場合.. 要 素１ つ */ ( T ( qsort2 ( car x ) ( cdr x ) NIL NIL ) ) ) ) /* 実作業を担当する下請け a = ピボット x = ピボット以降のリスト L = 小さい側の結果 R=大きい側の結果 */ ( define ( qsort2 a x L R ) ( cond ( ( nullp x ) /* とりあえず、左右に振り分けたから、R , L それぞれをまたソート */ ( append ( qsort R ) ( cons a ( qsort L ) ) ) ) /* 左右への振り分け */ ( (< ( car x ) a ) /* xの先頭 < ピボット なので、xの先頭は左側へ cons */ ( qsort2 a ( cdr x ) ( cons ( car x ) L ) R ) ) ( T /* xの先頭 >= ピボット なので、xの先頭は右側へ cons */ ( qsort2 a ( cdr x ) L ( cons ( car x ) R ) ) ) ) )
筆者に言わせれば、このクィックソート・プログラムは手続き型言語のものよりも１００倍判りやすいプログラムであると思うよ。
インタプリタ・コンパイラと「構文木 」
実はこのような子持ちの複雑なリスト構造というのは、コンパイラやインタプリタでも重要な役割を果たしている。例えば、次のようなＣ言語の関数を処理するには、lex
と yacc を使った構文解析処理が行われるのだが、その直接の出力は「構文木」と呼ばれるリストである。
char * strncpy ( char * dst , char * src , int n ) { int i ; for ( i = 0 ; i < n ; i++ , src++ ) { * dst++ = * src ; if ( * src == ' \0 ' ) { break ; } } }
たとえば ....
(( char *) strncpy ( ( ( char *) dest ) ( ( char *) src ) ( ( int ) n ) ) ( ( int ) i ) ( for ( ( = i 0 ) (< i n ) ( (++ i ) ( ++ src ) ) ) ( ( = (++ (* dst ) ) (* src ) ) ( if ( == ( * src ) ' \0 ' ) break ) ) ) )
つまり、リスト構造に直すことによって、その演算子の優先順位を明確にし、構文的な構造と入れ子関係を明白にし、Ｃ言語プログラムを扱いやすいデータ構造に変形するのである。このような「構文木」を元にして、そのプログラムが意味するものと同一の機械語プログラムを作成するのがコンパイラであるし、インタプリタならば、これをそのまま
Lisp のように実行してやれば良いのである（勿論作るのは大変だが）。例のＧＮＵのリチャード・ストールマンは、実は
Lisper 出身である（だから emacs のマクロ言語が elisp なのさ！）。そのため、現在デフォルトのコンパイラである gcc は内部で 、Ｃ言語のプログラム を 「 RTL 」 と呼ぶ
Lisp 風言語に変換する。そして、そ の「 RTL 」のプログラム（この時点ではデータであり同時にプログラムである）を、パターンマッチングの技法を使ってターゲットＣＰＵごとに最適なコードを生成する、という技を使っている（ソースの gcc/config/*/*.md
という記述を参照）。たとえば、egcs-1.1.2/gcc/config/i386/i386.md というファイルの中には次のような記述がある。
;;
On a 386 , it is faster to push MEM directly .
( define_insn " " [ ( set ( match_operand : SI 0 " push_operand " " = これは Intel 386 ＣＰＵ の特性として、メモリ内容を直接スタックに
PUSH することができる、という性質を利用することを記述したものである。つまり、Lisp 風のデータ兼プログラムとして 、define_insn で定義されるフォーマットは大体次のようである。 ( define_insn " RTL仮想機械の命 令 " [ RTL で操作の意味を記述 ] " 最終条件 " " * 出力コード " ) という具合である。だから 、Ｃ言語ソースがRTLに変換されて、それが
[ RTLで操作の意味を記述 ] の定義を満たす時に " * 出力コード " に変換されてターゲット用のアセンブリコードが生成されるのである。このような変換ルールが、個別ＣＰＵごとにRTLのかたちで存在し、これを使って最適なコードを生成しているのである。 では具体的なＣ言語プログラムから生成された
RTL はどうすれば見えるのだろう？ これは gcc のコンパイルオプションを使う。man ページなどで見ると、次のようなオプションがある( DEBUGGING OPTIONS の項目 ) 。やたらと多いぞ...
しかし、オプションの順番が処理の順番に対応しているので、コンパイラがどういう流れでコンパイルをしているのかが一目瞭然である。これはホントに勉強になるぞ！（ただし、man はやや古い。info の 方が正確である。） - dr RTL生成部の後のダンプを `file.rtl ' へ出力。 - dj 第 １ジャンプ最適化の後のダンプを file.jump ' へ出力。 - ds 共通部分式削除 部( CSE ) の後のダンプを `file.cse ' へ出力。 - dG 大域共通部分式削除部の後のダンプを ` file.gcse ' へ出力。 - dL ループ最適化の後のダンプを `file.loop ' へ出力。 - dt 第 ２ 共通部分式削除 部( CSE ) の後のダンプを `file.cse2 ' へ出力。 - df フロー解析の後のダンプを `file .

stack ' へ出力。 - da 以上の中間形式をすべてファイルに出力。 では、各最適化処理について、簡単に info からまとめよう。ここらへんの用語について詳しく知りたい読者はぜひAho , Sethi , Ullmanの 「 コンパイラ 」を読みたまえ。いわゆる「 Dragon Book 」であり、ハッカーの必読書の一つである。 構文解析部が 、Ｃプログラムを RTL に変換する。( - dr , *.rtl ) 第１ジャンプ最適化。複雑な多重ジャンプを単純化する。この処理は
RTL への変換の直後、共通部分式削除部の後、最終出力の直前と３回行われうる。このジャンプ最適化の結果として、非到達文が検出されて削除されることがある。(-dj , *.jump ) 第１共通部分式削除。条件ジャンプを厳密に判定し、可能ならば非条件ジャンプに変換する。(-ds , *.cse ) 大域共通部分式削除。グローバルな定数について重複部分を削除する。(-dG , *.gcse ) ループ最適化。ループ内で値の変わらない処理を括り出して、それをループ外に移動する。(-dL , *.loop ) 第２共通部分式削除。ループ最適化の後に、もう一度共通部分式削除をやりなおす。(-dt , *.cse2 ) フロー解析。変数の「使われ方」を検討し、値が使われない変数への値のセットを積極的に削除する。その結果、実質的に使われない自動変数（や使われない関数戻り値）が削除される。(- df , *. flow ) 命令組合せ部。複数の命令によって構成される命令について、より良い単純な命令があればそれに置き換える。(-dc , *.combine ) 第１命令スケジューリング。命令の順番を入れ換えることで、メモリなどの利用効率が上がることがあるので、このような順番の入れ換えを試みる。(-dS , *.sched ) 局所レジスタ割当。基本処理ブロックの範囲内で、使われる変数を実際のＣＰＵのレジスタに割り当てる。(-dl , *.lreg ) 大域レジスタ割当。基本処理ブロックの範囲を越えて、使われる変数を実際のＣＰＵレジスタに割り当てる。(-dg , *.greg ) 第２命令スケジューリング。順番の入れ換えを割り当てられたレジスタに関して可能であるか試みる。(-dR , *.sched2 ) 第２ジャンプ最適化。多重ジャンプを単純なジャンプに変換する。(-dJ , *.jump2 ) 遅延分岐スケジューリング。ジャンプや関数コールの順番を入れ換えることで、より最適化ができないかどうか検討する。(-dd , *.dbr ) 数値演算スタック最適化。これは
Intel 80387 コプロセッサ専用。数値演算コプロセッサが利用するスタックを最適化する。(-dk , *.stack ) ＣＰＵ 依存の「 覗き穴最適化」の後、アセンブリを出力する。
だから、適当なプログラムを - da でコンパイルしてみよう。そうすると、大量のファイルが生成される。その最適化処理が最適化オプションによってスキップされていれば、中身は空なので、-O0（最適化せず）、-O1（ある程度最適化する）、-O2（しっかり最適化する）の最適化オプションを変えてやってみると、次のようになる。

たとえば、次 のＣ言語のコード( simple.c ) は RTL( simple.c.rtl ) では次のようになる 。

見るからに Lisp 風の RTL に変換されているのである。これを最適化すると次のような
RTL に変換するのである( simple.c.stack )。ここでは具体的なレジスタ(%esp, %ebpなど)に割り当てられていることに注意されたい。あとはこれを使って具体的なアセンブリに変換し、それをアセンブラが機械語に変換するだけである。

このように Lisp 風の処理は、コンパイラのような特に高度なプログラムの根底の部分で広く活躍しているのである。
再帰の弱点とその克 服
再帰はこのように、非常にオモシロく、重要なロジックである。再帰の方が、少なくともハッカーには判りやすく、しかもメンテしやすいコードになる場合も多い。先程のクィックソートなどは良い例だ。なぜならば、「現在の状態」から「次の処理」を導き出し、適切な終了条件を設定する、というのが再帰の本質であり、これは実質上「数学的帰納法」なのである。数学的帰納法は数論の基本的な証明手段であり、当然数学では「証明」のために使われるが、これをプログラミングに応用したのが他ならぬ「再帰」であると言っても良い。だから、「計算論」では「再帰」こそがもっとも基本的なプログラミング手段であり、数学センスに溢れた手法なのである（余談：ゲーデルの「不完全性定理」の証明でも、「再帰」を使って四則演算から自動証明のための関数を導き出して証明している。「再帰」は、数学的にはプログラミングの「基礎」の「基礎」なのである）。
しかし、再帰には重大な弱点がある。それはスタックを浪費することである。再帰で呼ばれるたびに、スタックには引数と戻りアドレスが積まれ、ローカル変数が確保される。そのため、再帰が深くなればなるほど、スタックが浪費されるのである。これは MS-DOS ( Intel 8086 ) のようなスタックに限りのある（それもかなり小さい）システムでは重大な問題だった。
昔話 。MS-DOS ( Intel 8086 ) では、セグメント・アーキテクチャと称して、16bit のレジスタによるアドレッシングを基本としていた。そのため、スタックも実質上 16bit で表現可能な 65536byte（32768 word） の上限があったのである。これは大変小さいサイズである。更にデフォルトのメモリモデルであるスモールモデルでは、データセグメントとスタックセグメントを共用していた。だから、リンカオプションで「どれだけのスタックセグメントを確保するか？」という指定が出来、再帰を使うプログラムでは実質上必須（あるいはデータセグメントとスタックセグメントを別セグメントを使うように指定する！）だったのである。そのため、実質上 MS-DOS ( Intel 8086 ) では、再帰プログラムが使いものにならないという現実があったのである。悲しい過去があるのだ....
しかし、計算論の 「再帰定理」と呼ばれる定理では、再帰プログラムが必ず再帰ではないループに書き換えることができる、ということを証明している。このため、コンパイラでは再帰のプログラムを自動的にループに書き換えることができるとウレシイ。実際、gcc
のような賢いコンパイラでは、「末端再帰の最適化」と呼ばれる最適化オプションが存在する。これはつまり、一部の再帰関数をループ構造にコンパイラが書き換えて扱う、というものである。
けど、再帰定理は 「存在する！」ことを証明してくれているだけだよ...一般の場合にどう変換するのか、までは再帰定理の担当ではない。ここらへんが奥深い
「末端再帰関数」とは、再帰関数であるが自分自身を呼び出すだけの単純な再帰関数のことである。今まで紹介して来た再帰関数はすべてこの部類である。勿論、再帰関数として２つの関数が互いに相手を呼び合う、というタイプのものも考えることが出来るし、それらを「再帰定理」の結果としてループ構造に書き換えることも出来るのだが、さすがにこれは重要性が低く、しかもちょっとだけ難しい（ちゃんとフロー解析をして、２つの関数を１つにまとめ上げて「末端再帰の最適化」をする、というあたりの処理が必要）。だから、一番メリットがあり、間違う余地も少ない「末端再帰関数」だけをループ構造に直すオプションが gcc では追加されている。（ただし、Intel386は未実装であり残念。）
これはたとえば次のようになる。リストを逆転する関数 reverse( ) の下請けである rev( ) だと、こんなところである。
Item rev( Item a , Item b ) { if ( a == NULL ) { return b ; } else { return rev( cdr( a ) , cons ( car ( a ) , b ) ) ; } } /* 末端再帰を最適化する！ */
Item rev(
Item a , Item b ) { while ( 1 ) { if ( a == NULL ) { return b ; } else { Item ta , tb ; /* 引数渡しが相互に影響するのを防ぐ */ ta = cdr(a ) ; tb = cons ( car ( a ) , b ) ; a = ta ; b = tb ; /* これで正しく引数が渡る */ } } }
また、複雑な再帰プログラムだと、再帰プログラムが使うスタックセグメントを、自前のスタックデータ構造で模倣した方がやりやすい。この例は「スタック：再帰構造の回避〜ディレクトリの再帰ファイルリスト」にある。

If you 're as tired as we are of looking at the heavens with boggle - eyed disbelief that yet another half - wit has been taken to the cleaners by Nigerian advance fee fraudsters , then take heart at the following story .
It recounts how Clinton of Best Price Computers not only led the scamming ne'er - do - wells well and truly up the garden path , but also took them for £ 171 .
A modest amount , to be sure , but it 's a start .
Read on :
We also exchanged a lot of confidences .
I told him about how I worked for a computer company and that I was n't a rich man .
He told me how God fearing he was and about how often he went to church .
We were becoming good friends .
To my bad luck the deal fell through .
Ajibola needed $ 1500 to pay the bank a bribe , and I do n't really have $ 1500 to spare .
It 's really a shame .
And he was such a nice chap .
We were even addressing each other as " brother " , we had become that close .
I kept worrying about poor Ajibola 's situation .
He had all this money that he wanted to get out of Nigeria .
Surely , I could find some way to help my brother .
It kept bothering me .
Till I had this brilliant idea .
I worked for a PC company that sold expensive PCs .
What if he bought PCs with those funds ?
OK , maybe it was n't such a brilliant idea , but I put it to him anyway .
He liked it .
Apparently he 's got all these sterling cheques & they would be ideal to pay for the goods .
We could ship the goods to his UK contact .
So we agreed a first transaction for ten of our top PCs .
He sent me a cheque for £ 25,427 which arrived exactly as promised .
( This guy really does keep his word ) .
Unfortunately , his UK contact does need the goods urgently and they can't wait for the cheque to clear .
It is a lot of money but I know I can trust Ajibola .
After all , he ’s a very God fearing man .
Accordingly we agreed to ship the PCs urgently for delivery last week .
It ’s a sad fact of life that things never go smoothly when you really want them to .
There was a mix - up with the courier !
( Personally , I do n't think the couriers tried hard enough .
We even asked the police to accompany them to lead them to the address , but the police were too busy ) .
This is a nuisance because we ’ve got to charge £ 145 + VAT to re-attempt delivery of this 400 Kg consignment .
I know it 's not fair to ask Ajibola for this .
It 's not his fault .
It ’s just that my " boss " is away at the moment and I can arrange the re-delivery only if I get £ 170.38 .
It 's company procedure .
The best I can do is take it off his next order .
I think this upset him a bit and I had to smooth his ruffled feathers via email .
He had this idea that we ship nine of the PCs and hold one back as " security " for the £ 170 .
That really offended me .
How can he think that I do n't trust him ?
I explained that it was n't a matter of security .
It ’s that dreaded company red tape and the only person who can waive that charge is the boss who 's on holiday .
Of course we could wait for the boss to return next week to authorise the re-delivery .
By that time the cheque would have cleared as well !
And we 'd all be happy .
But Ajibola reminded me that this delivery was urgent .
He therefore arranged a payment of £ :171 to our account by TT .
The bank confirmed that this was received today and I was about to ship the goods when the bank added that the original £ :25,427 cheque bounced .
Oh dear , oh dear , this does throw a spanner in the works .
I know it 's just some technicality .
I mean , Ajibola is good for $ 15,000,000.00 .
That 's a lot of 0s !
£ : 25 K is small change to him .
But £ : 25 K is a lot to us .
My only option now is to hold on to these goods till Ajibola pays the remaining £ :25,256 .
It is a nuisance .
This time I 'll ask him to wait till the cheque has cleared .
Not that I do n’t trust him or anything , it ’s just company procedure when a cheque has bounced .
I 'm sure Ajibola will understand .
After all , we are family .
Jim Harper works as the Director of Information Policy at the Cato Institute , a libertarian think tank , but in his spare time he also runs the site Washington Watch to help taxpayers understand what government programs and projects will cost each family in the country .
This sounds like fairly uncontroversial stuff , but when Harper recently tried to promote his site by comparing it to an offering from the Library of Congress , he ran into a problem : a Library official asked him to stop using the Library 's name critically .
Here 's what happened : Washington
Watch went wiki ( say that three times fast ) a few weeks ago .
Users can access the site to find out that the Prescription Drug User Fee Amendments of 2007 will cost an American family of three $ 63.13 each and can use that information to decide if the proposed benefits are worth $ 63.13 to them .
But the site now lets people edit " points in favor " and " points against " each bill as well , and Harper 's goal is to make it a central spot for political debate where all sides can put up their best arguments for and against their ideas .
In a press release announcing the update , Harper said that " WashingtonWatch.com provides a more user - friendly and interactive way for the public to learn about legislation than the Library of Congress ' THOMAS site .
It 's all about government transparency . "
Then came the e-mail .
After the announcement , he was contacted by Matt Raymond , the Director of Communications at the Library ( and the author of the Library of Congress ' blog ) .
Raymond said that he possessed " statutory and regulatory authority governing unauthorized use of the Library 's name and logo and those of Library subunits and programs , " and he asked that Harper stop using the names " Library of Congress " and " THOMAS " in his marketing materials .
This did n't sit well with Harper , who basically told Raymond that he was going to use the names whenever he felt like it , and it seemed like such an odd claim for the Library to make that we decided to look into it .
I contacted Raymond about the issue , and he tells Ars that he was acting under Library of Congress Regulation 112 , which says that " the use of the Library 's name , explicitly or implicitly to endorse a product or service , or materials in any publication is prohibited , except as provided for in this Regulation . "
For Raymond , the issue here is that Harper was critical of the Library 's own work in a way which endorsed his own ; as Raymond puts it , " the use of THOMAS in the Washington Watch press release in a negative way is clearly used in the context of endorsement , rather than general criticism . "
Raymond claims that he has no intention of trying to silence critics , and points out that the Library 's blog has opened itself to reader comments , critical or otherwise .
His concern , rather , is " in the context of marketing and endorsement . "
Harper does n't think this sort of reasoning is a good enough to start asking people to stop using the Library 's name , and says he 's " offended that they think they can control my use of their name for comparative purposes . "
" In my day job and in this separate project , " he tells Ars , " the goal is to speak truth to power and do more to make it a government of , by , and for the people . "
Edwards came out fighting early in the debate .
Debating Dems trade blows over Iraq
MANCHESTER , N.H. --
Eight Democrats spent two hours on stage here tonight and spoke memorably on only one topic :
The war in Iraq .
The debate -- the second in preparation for the Democratic primaries next year -- affirmed that Iraq will be the central terrain on which the campaign is fought .
Advertisement
It also affirmed the centrality -- literally , on CNN ’s stage -- of the three leading candidates , Senators Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama and former Senator John Edwards .
They occupied the bulk of CNN ’s airtime , despite running protests from the campaign of Connecticut Senator Chris Dodd .
And it drew into sharp relief the strengths , weaknesses , and tactics of the three leading candidates on the Iraq war .
For Illinois Senator Barack Obama , who appeared more relaxed than in the first Democratic debate and occupied more airtime than any of his rivals , that meant asserting that he opposed the invasion before the war began .
For Senator John Edwards , it meant stressing his currently unflinching anti-war stance , and his refusal to moderate his position in response to apparent political realities .
And for Hillary Clinton , it meant just the opposite :
An attempt to minimize the difference between the Democrats ’ views , and to instead assert her own competence , experience , and onstage command as a qualification in itself .
Litmus test ?
Obama delivered his message with perhaps the night ’s hardest punch : “ I think John -- the fact is that I opposed this war from the start , ” he told Edwards .
“ So you 're about four and a half years late on leadership on this issue . ”
Later , moderator Wolf Blitzer pushed Obama to make the war vote a litmus test -- something his campaign has subtly suggested it should be .
“ Do you think someone who authorized the use of force to go to war in Iraq should be president of the United States ? ” Blitzer asked .
“ I do n't think it 's a disqualifier .
I think that people were making their best judgments at the time , ” Obama demurred .
Edwards , for his part , pressed the difference between his vocal opposition to funding a continuing war in Iraq and Clinton ’s and Obama ’s quiet votes against that funding .
He also drew a round of applause for acknowledging an error in voting for the war -- the very target of Obama ’s attack .
“ Democratic primary voters clearly know how Senator Edwards voted on Iraq , ” shrugged an Edwards advisor , Jonathan Prince , after the debate .
Clinton 's high road
Clinton , for her part , tried to set herself “ above the fray , ” in the words of her pollster , Mark Penn , and several other campaign advisors circulating the post - debate spin-room .
In particular , she tried to rise above the squabbling men and to diminish the difference between herself and the other leaders on the war , both acts enhanced by the vocal presence of two men of the left , Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinich and former Alaska Senator Mike Gravel .
“ I think it 's important particularly to point out :
This is George Bush 's war .
He is responsible for this war , ” she said amid the scrap between Obama and Edwards .
“ What we are trying to do , whether it's by speaking out from the outside or working and casting votes that actually make a difference from the inside , we are trying to end the war .
And each of us has made that very clear .
We have different approaches . ”
Only one candidate in the race voted for the most recent supplemental funding for the Iraq war , Delaware Senator Joseph Biden .
“ As long as there is a single troop in Iraq that I know if I take action by funding them , I increase the prospect they will live or not be injured -- I cannot and will not vote not to fund them , ” he said .
His remarks dragged the candidates briefly into the reality of a general election , and exposed what could become a vulnerability when one contender emerges from the narrow primary audience to face the wider electorate .
A student told me the other day he wanted to be a doctor , so he could help people .
I thought , " What , as opposed to the rest of us who hurt people ? "
Contrary to the smug self - righteousness assumptions of those in " helping " professions , like child care , teaching , counseling , or emergency services , it is far from obvious that these professions are any more helpful than the rest .
Yes , if you choose to be a doctor , you will spend your time providing services that people perceive to have value , sometimes enormous value .
However , you cannot take full credit for this value :
You charge a price for your services , so the help they receive is the difference between the value they gain and the price you charge .
The more you charge the less help is gained , and doctors charge a lot .
If there are a fixed number of slots in medical school , you would just displace someone else .
You then have to ask how much better are your services than that person’s .
And beware of overconfidence .
If there are not a fixed number of slots , then by becoming a doctor you induce between zero and one more doctor ’s worth of patients to be treated .
But these are marginal , not average , cases ; these patients thought their case so mild that they were right on the borderline of not going to a doctor at all .
So you only get to take credit for the value these marginal patients get , not the average patient .
Customers might overestimate the value they get from your services .
Yes , your colleagues might say that people tend to underestimate the value of your service , but they are probably biased .
In fact , the marginal patient seems to get zero health value from medical services .
Part of the value you provide may be relative social status .
By teaching , you might help some students look better to employers than others .
By doctoring , you may help some show they care about their family more than others .
If so , you are helping some by hurting others .
Shame on you .
You may really want a helping job so that you can feel and look morally superior to those in non-helping professions .
If so , you gain value at the expense of others who look worse ; shame on you again .
By participating in a society we all help each other .
The amount you are paid is a ( low ) estimate of the value others place on your services .
This estimate may have biases , but beware of too quickly assuming you know what that bias is .

DANGER ROOM Editor Noah Shachtman is at JFK airport in New York where there 's been a security breach that 's thrown terminal three into chaos .
Gotta love the wild 'n crazy world of TSA , where security breaches mean you trap all the passengers in an enclosed area , leaving them completely vulnerable .
Anyhow , as Noah reports :
I 'm at New York 's JFK airport , waiting to catch a flight to Los Angeles .
And there 's been a major security breach here at the Delta terminal , number three .
According to TSA workers , someone ran through the security checkpoint , maybe an hour ago .
No one has been allowed to pass through , since .
There must be a thousand people here who can't get on their flights .
The TSA workers have no idea what 's going on – " We know as much as you , " one told me .
Passengers are generally calm .
But that could change , quick .
Passengers in the " sterile areas " were just told to " evacuate the building . "
Cell service has been spotty - I 'll try to update as things develop ...
Got another update here :
* The deeply crazy part of this fiasco is that it 's created an even more hazardous situation than any freak rushing through a checkpoint ever could .
God forbid someone should rush into the terminal with explosives strapped to his chest .
The death toll would be in the hundreds .
And if that was n't scary enough , you should hear the soft rock blasting from the airport 's speakers .
And the occasional pre-recorded bromides against smoking in the terminal , handing other people your bags , etc ...
Noah 's heading back to LA , but I 'm betting he 'll be slightly delayed .
Ryan Singel has additional details .
And here 's one more update from Noah :

Good Copy Bad Copy
Documentary film ( Denmark , 2007 )
The war over the ownership of creativity has been fought , sometimes literally , for nearly 1,500 years , but only since the dawn of the digital age has it come to be one of truly global scale .
Making a copy of a piece of writing may have once been relatively laborious , but now an artist can mash up dozens of song samples in a few hours , riding roughshod over the efforts of the original creator .
Or are they ?
What is creativity and how much right can and should actually be held over work by those who have produced it ?
Is it legally or morally justifiable to share the work of others without paying them for it ?
In Good Copy Bad Copy , we attempt to embed with those on both sides of the trenches to find out the current state of play and if there is any hope of a truce in the future .
Whether downloading movies from a college dorm room or filing cease and desist letters from a high - powered law office , it ’s a conflict which affects billions of us .
We are grateful to the many contributors who have given their time to add their thoughts to our story .
We did n’t want this venture to simply be an essay on modern copyright law but an open and objective discussion about the nature and future of creativity in our times .
I can't do my essay .
From Nigeria to Brazil and the US to Sweden , it is one of the key debates of the digital era and one that we believe everyone should be participating in .
When it comes to crash reporting , the mechanism favored by many for globally catching “ crashes ” is the unhandled exception filter ( as set by SetUnhandledExceptionFilter ) .
However , many people tend to go wrong with this mechanism with respect to what actions they take when the unhandled exception filter is called .
To understand what I am talking about , it ’s necessary to define the conditions under which an unhandled exception filter is executed .
The unhandled exception filter is , by definition , called when an unhandled exception occurs in any Win32 thread in a process .
This sort of event is virtually always caused by some sort of corruption of the process state somewhere , such that something eventually probably touched a non-allocated page somewhere and caused an unhandled access violation ( or some other similarly severe problem ) .
In other words , in the context of the unhandled exception filter , you do n’t really know what lead up to the current unhandled exception , and more importantly , you do n’t know what you can rely on in the process .
For example , if you get an AV that bubbles up to your UEF , it might have been caused by corruption in the process heap , which would mean that you probably can’t safely perform heap allocations or you ’re risking running into the same problem that caused the original crash in the first place .
Or perhaps the problem was an unhandled allocation failure , and another attempt by your unhandled exception filter to allocate memory might just similarly fail .
Actually , the problem gets a bit worse , because you are n’t even guaranteed anything about what the other threads in the process are doing when the crash occurs ( in fact , if there are any other threads in the process at the time of the crash , chances are that they ’re still running when your unhandled exception filter is called – there is no magical logic to suspend all other activity in the process while your filter is called ) .
This has a couple of other implications for you :
You ca n’t really rely on the state of synchronization objects in the process .
For all you know , the thread that crashed owned a lock that will cause a deadlock if you try to acquire a second lock , which might be owned by a thread that is waiting on the lock owned by the crashed thread .
You ca n’t with 100 % certainty assume that a secondary failure ( precipitated by the “ original ” crash ) wo n’t occur in a different thread , causing your exception filter to be entered by an additional thread at the same time as it is already processing an event from the “ first ” crash .
In fact , it would be safe to say that there is even less that you can safely do in an unhandled exception filter than under the infamous loader lock in DllMain ( which is saying something indeed ) .
Given these rather harsh conditions , performing actions like heap allocations or writing minidumps from within the current process are likely to fail .
Essentially , as whatever kind of recovery action you take from the UEF grows more complicated , it becomes extremely more likely to fail ( possibly causing secondary failures that obscure the original problem ) as a result of corruption that caused ( or is caused by ) the original crash .
Even something as seemingly innocuous as creating a new process is potentially dangerous ( are you sure that nothing in CreateProcess will ever touch the process heap ?
What about acquire the loader lock ?
I ’ll give you a hint – the latter is definitely not true , such as in the case where Software Restriction Policies are defined ) .
If you ’ve ever taken a look at the kernel32 JIT debugger support in Windows XP , you may have noticed that it does n’t even follow these rules – it calls CreateProcess , after all .
This is part of the reason why sometimes you ’ll have programs silently crash even with a JIT debugger .
For programs where you want truly robust crash reporting , I would recommend putting as much of the crash reporting logic into a separate process that is started before a crash occurs ( e.g. during program initialization ) , instead of following the JIT launch - reporting - process approach .
This “ watchdog process ” can then sit idle until it is signaled by the process it is watching over that a crash has occured .
This signaling mechanism should , ideally , be pre-constructed during initialization so that the actual logic within the unhandled exception filter just signals the watchdog process that an event occurs , with a pointer to the exception / context information .
The filter should then wait for the watchdog process to signal that it is finished before exiting the process .
The mechanism that we use here at work with our programs to communicate between the “ guarded ” process and the watchdog is simply a file mapping that is mapped into both processes ( for passing information between the two , such as the address of the exception record and context record for an active exception event ) and a pair of events that are used to communicate “ exception occured ” and “ dump writing completed ” between the two processes .
With this configuration , all the exception filter needs to do is to store some data in the file mapping view ( already mapped ahead of time ) and call SetEvent to notify the watchdog process to wake up .
It then waits for the watchdog process to signal completion before terminating the process .
( This particular mechanism does not address the issue of multiple crashes occuring at the same time , which is something that I deemed acceptable in this case . )
The watchdog process is responsible for all of the “ heavy lifting ” of the crash reporting process , namely , writing the actual dump with MiniDumpWriteDump .
An alternative to this approach is to have the watchdog process act as a debugger on the guarded process ; however , I do not typically recommend this as acting as a debugger has a number of adverse side effects ( notably , that a great many events cause the process to be suspended entirely while the debugger / watchdog process can inspect the state of the process for a particular debugger event ) .
The watchdog process mechanism is more performant ( if ever so slightly less robust ) , as there is virtually no run-time overhead in the guarded process unless an unhandled exception occurs .
So , the moral of the story is : keep it simple ( at least with respect to your unhandled exception filters ) .
I ’ve dealt with mechanisms that try to do the error reporting logic in - process , and those that punt the hard work off to a watchdog process in a clean state , and the latter is significantly more reliable in real world cases .
The last thing you want to be happening with your crash reporting mechanism is that it causes secondary problems that hide the original crash , so spend the bit of extra work to make your reporting logic that much more reliable and save yourself the headaches later on .
By now , we have made well over $ 100,000,000 off people in the US and Canada .
Thanks for the money !

Murder in New York : Killers and Their Victims in the Five Boroughs Between 2003 and 2005 , 1,662 murders were committed in New York .
Men and boys were responsible for 93 percent of the murders ; their victims tended to be other men and boys ; and in more than half the cases , the killer and victim knew each other .
In addition , an interesting , though uncommon , group of murders involved a handful of victims who died of injuries one or more years after being stabbed , shot , beaten or burned and were counted as murder victims in the year in which they died .

Similarly , the convergence of fresh theoretical ideas in evolution and the coming avalanche of genomic data will profoundly alter our understanding of the biosphere — and is likely to lead to revision of concepts such as species , organism and evolution .
Here we explain why we foresee such a dramatic transformation , and why we believe the molecular reductionism that dominated twentieth - century biology will be superseded by an interdisciplinary approach that embraces collective phenomena .
The place to start is horizontal gene transfer ( HGT ) , the non-genealogical transfer of genetic material from one organism to another — such as from one bacterium to another or from viruses to bacteria .
Among microbes , HGT is pervasive and powerful — for example , in accelerating the spread of antibiotic resistance .
Owing to HGT , it is not a good approximation to regard microbes as organisms dominated by individual characteristics .
In fact , their communications by genetic or quorum - sensing channels indicate that microbial behaviour must be understood as predominantly cooperative .
In the wild , microbes form communities , invade biochemical niches and partake in biogeochemical cycles .
The available studies strongly indicate that microbes absorb and discard genes as needed , in response to their environment .
Rather than discrete genomes , we see a continuum of genomic possibilities , which casts doubt on the validity of the concept of a ' species ' when extended into the microbial realm .
The uselessness of the species concept is inherent in the recent forays into metagenomics — the study of genomes recovered from natural samples as opposed to clonal cultures .
For example , studies of the spatial distribution of rhodopsin genes in marine microbes suggest such genes are ' cosmopolitan ' , wandering among bacteria ( or archaea ) as environmental pressures dictate .
Equally exciting is the realization that viruses have a fundamental role in the biosphere , in both immediate and long - term evolutionary senses .
Recent work suggests that viruses are an important repository and memory of a community 's genetic information , contributing to the system 's evolutionary dynamics and stability .
This is hinted at , for example , by prophage induction , in which viruses latent in cells can become activated by environmental influences .
The ensuing destruction of the cell and viral replication is a potent mechanism for the dispersal of host and viral genes .
It is becoming clear that microorganisms have a remarkable ability to reconstruct their genomes in the face of dire environmental stresses , and that in some cases their collective interactions with viruses may be crucial to this .
In such a situation , how valid is the very concept of an organism in isolation ?
It seems that there is a continuity of energy flux and informational transfer from the genome up through cells , community , virosphere and environment .
We would go so far as to suggest that a defining characteristic of life is the strong dependency on flux from the environment — be it of energy , chemicals , metabolites or genes .
Nowhere are the implications of collective phenomena , mediated by HGT , so pervasive and important as in evolution .
A computer scientist might term the cell 's translational apparatus ( used to convert genetic information to proteins ) an ' operating system ' , by which all innovation is communicated and realized .
The fundamental role of translation , represented in particular by the genetic code , is shown by the clearly documented optimization of the code .
Its special role in any form of life leads to the striking prediction that early life evolved in a lamarckian way , with vertical descent marginalized by the more powerful early forms of HGT .
Refinement through the horizontal sharing of genetic innovations would have triggered an explosion of genetic novelty , until the level of complexity required a transition to the current era of vertical evolution .
Thus , we regard as regrettable the conventional concatenation of Darwin 's name with evolution , because other modalities must also be considered .
This is an extraordinary time for biology , because the perspective we have indicated places biology within a context that must necessarily engage other disciplines more strongly aware of the importance of collective phenomena .
Questions suggested by the generic energy , information and gene flows to which we have alluded will probably require resolution in the spirit of statistical mechanics and dynamical systems theory .
In time , the current approach of post - hoc modelling will be replaced by interplay between quantitative prediction and experimental test , nowadays more characteristic of the physical sciences .
Sometimes , language expresses ignorance rather than knowledge , as in the case of the word ' prokaryote ' , now superseded by the terms archaea and bacteria .
We foresee that in biology , new concepts will require a new language , grounded in mathematics and the discoveries emerging from the data we have highlighted .
During an earlier revolution , Antoine Lavoisier observed that scientific progress , like evolution , must overcome a challenge of communication : “ We can not improve the language of any science without at the same time improving the science itself ; neither can we , on the other hand , improve a science without improving the language or nomenclature which belongs to it . ”
Biology is about to meet this challenge .

Gentoo in crisis
Last week , the Gentoo project entered the lowest point of its 7 - year old existence .
The single most telling statement attesting to this fact is this brief excerpt from the current issue of Gentoo Weekly News :
The following developers recently joined the Gentoo project :
* Daniel Robbins ( drobbins ) AMD64 team
The following developers recently left the Gentoo project :
* Daniel Robbins ( drobbins )
Yes , this is the same Daniel Robbins who founded Gentoo Linux back in the year 2000 and who left the project in 2004 for personal reasons .
He officially re-joined the Gentoo development team two weeks ago - only to resign a few days later .
The reason ?
Strong personal attacks by some of the current developers of the project .
Take this mailing list post by Ciaran McCreesh .
Replying to another developer 's request to treat Daniel Robbins with respect , he resorted to the following tirade :
What kind of response do you think anyone else would have received had they started repeatedly attacking a project when they did n't even know what that project was , repeatedly tried to interfere with the management of a project when they do n't know who is involved with or managing said project , repeatedly posted all kinds of outright lies after having been told that something was untrue and repeatedly resorted to ad hominem attacks in a technical discussion ?
I 'd say that , all things considered , people are showing Daniel an awful lot of respect ...
Now , let 's review the credentials of Daniel Robbins .
After working as a Stampede Linux and FreeBSD developer , he eventually founded his own distribution - Gentoo Linux .
By the time he resigned from the project some four years later , Gentoo had become the fastest growing Linux distribution of all times - a much - loved project with a wealth of original ideas , truly comprehensive documentation and excellent package management system .
At the same time , Daniel Robbins , an expert kernel and Python hacker , contributed nearly a hundred well - written Linux articles to the IBM developerWorks , including various topics covering the Linux Professional Institute certification exams .
Although certainly not without his faults , Daniel Robbins has become one of the best - known personalities the Linux world has ever seen .
Contrast that to the credentials of some of the current Gentoo developers who are so quick to attack the former Chief Architect at every opportunity .
Even if they have written useful code that has improved the distribution , they have a very long way to go before they reach the same status as their former benevolent dictator .
Furthermore , one has to wonder : with the amount of time some of them spend flaming other people on the various mailing lists and planet blogs , do they actually have any time for coding ?
This highlights the complete ineffectiveness of the current power structures at Gentoo Linux .
If a person who repeatedly engages in personal attacks against other developers is permitted to remain with the project , then there is something wrong with the way the distribution is managed .
Yes , disagreeing with other developers on organisational and technical matters is perfectly fine ; launching personal attacks against anybody who has a different idea is not .
We see an awful lot of disagreements on the Debian developers ' mailing lists as well , but rarely , if ever , we see such staunch personal attacks as we 've been seeing on the Gentoo developers ' mailing lists .
Talking about Debian , it 's worth noting another interesting point .
While the Gentoo social contract was loosely modelled on the one written by Debian , the more observant among the readers will notice the lack of any outward statements that would define the goals and priorities of the Gentoo distribution .
As an example , the point 4 of the Debian Social Contract clearly states that : " We will be guided by the needs of our users and the free software community .
We will place their interests first in our priorities .
"
In contrast , Gentoo has no such clause anywhere in its Gentoo Social Contract and the word " user " is hardly ever mentioned .
Conflicts and disagreements are a natural part of any large and democratic organisation .
Ironically , it was Daniel Robbins who first pointed out the dangers of working with " freaks " , as he called them , in his article Making the distribution , where he described some of the events that eventually lead to the collapse of Stampede Linux .
Many other open source software projects also suffer from large scale flame wars from time to time .
However , what distinguishes Gentoo from other such projects is the fact that it does n't have a mechanism to deal with poisonous individuals .
Or to be more precise , the existing mechanism do not work , since the present structures do n't have the necessary powers to be effective in solving conflicts .
As a result , over the last few years Gentoo Linux has degenerated into a loose structure that is increasingly run by a small , power - hungry clique that resents any attempt to change the current status quo .
As such , Gentoo has become a distribution without any clear goals , without the drive to implement new ideas , and without the ability to deliver products that its users want .
Quite a sharp contrast to a few years ago when one could n't take part in an online distro discussion without somebody coming out with a strong recommendation for Gentoo !
Can anything be done to reverse the situation and to return Gentoo on the path of its former glory ?
Without the radical overhaul of the Gentoo power structures , it 's highly unlikely that anything positive will be done to Gentoo in the near future .
With the developer turnover at an all - time high , there is little chance that even the minimum of release and bug - fixing goals will be met .
But since the current project leaders are unable to see the rapid downfall of the distribution and unwilling to take any radical measures to reverse the trend , there is little hope for the project .
Unless they wake up soon , Gentoo Linux , once the most innovative and refreshing of all distributions , will become nothing more than an average , buggy operating system characterised by endless bickering among the few developers that will bother to remain with it .
MEHLMAN : The fact is , what Denny Hastert did is something that we have n’t seen done in thirty years in this town in Washington DC , and that is he said to a member of congress , either you go or we ’re going to make you go .
That happened the moment that Denny Hastert found out about this .
But now the Rovians have turned the timeline completely on its head , and are claiming Hastert demanded Foley 's resignation because of something the Speaker himself says he knew nothing about .
This may seem a trivial matter , given all the other lies , big and small , that have come rattling down the propaganda assembly line over the past six years .
Foley himself is just a sideshow geek compared to the three - ring circus that gave us the war in Iraq .
But if there 's been a more brazen attempt to rewrite history -- last week 's history ! --
I can't remember it .
True , the Rovians are desperate , but this clearly reflects their belief that they can say anything , any fucking thing at all , and not be called on it by the corporate media , at least not in any kind of time frame that matters .
And as far as I can tell , they 're right -- they have n't been called on it , except by Think Progress and the wild - eyed bloggers and the other tattered remnants of the left opposition .
UPDATE
KINGSTON : Well , I think that if there was a staffer or two who decided to maybe protect Mark Foley for reasons unknown , I think the speaker would do to them what basically he did to Mark Foley , which was , " Get out or be fired , " because , you know , the threat to Mark Foley , if he stayed around , he would have been expelled .
I want to return to what I think is an extremely important incident that occurred late in the day last Friday , when events typically get lost in the news cycle .
As Think Progress documented , at some point during the day on Friday , the GOP decided to go on television and tell an outright lie -- namely , that when Denny Hastert learned the previous Friday about the IMs exchanged between Mark Foley and Congressional pages ( as a result of the ABC story ) , Hastert delivered an ultimatum to Foley : either resign or be expelled .
Thereafter , so the new GOP mythology claimed , Foley resigned .
This story is complete fiction .
It never happened .
It was just made up by Republican operatives in order to defend Denny Hastert and make him look like some sort of hard - nosed , no - nonsense tough guy who took extraordinary steps against Mark Foley .
But there is no doubt that this never happened , and anyone who is saying that it did is , by definition , lying -- and is lying clearly and demonstrably .
It was n't just some obscure pundit or GOP backbencher who told this lie .
The Chairman of the Republican National Committee , Ken Mehlman , went on national television and claimed that Hastert did this : Former RNC Chair Ed Gillepse repeated the same story : " As the father of a 16 - year - old son , I appreciate him going to Mark Foley and saying , ' You either resign or you ’re going to be expelled . '
That would be the first time in thirty years .
" This is not a claim that can be debated or spun .
They 're claiming that Hastert threatened Foley with expulsion unless he resigned .
That either happened or it did n't .
And it simply did not happen .
Hastert has made clear from the beginning of this scandal that he only learned of the IMs last Friday when they were reported by ABC .
Hastert has claimed that he would have demanded Foley 's resignation or expulsion had he known about the IMs .
But in fact , Foley resigned before ABC made the IMs public and received no such ultimatum from Hastert .
Should n't it be a huge story in itself that Ken Mehlman went on national television in the middle of one of the largest political scandals and made completely false claims about the key issue -- what Denny Hastert did or did not do about Mark Foley ?
People who make up stories that are n't true and then repeat them in order to defend themselves are just outright lying .
Why is Mehlman able to do so in such a brazen and obvious way without consequences ?
What is even more striking about the whole matter is that Mehlman is lying about extremely recent events that we all remember , including the journalists covering the story .
It is so painfully obvious that if Foley resigned only after receiving a hard - core " resign - or - be - expelled " ultimatum from Hastert , that is something we would have heard about immediately , not after a week of Republicans desperately flailing around for something to say in defense of Hastert .
And we all remember Hastert 's interviews and statements in which he said that he would have taken action against Foley had Foley not resigned .
It is just unbelievably clear that he gave no ultimatum to Foley .
As Billmon put it This scandal is not and has never been exclusively -- or even primarily -- about what GOP House leaders did in 2003 or 2005 regarding Mark Foley .
That is a big part of the story , but bigger still is the blatant lies they have been telling ever since this scandal began .
And there is none more deliberate or obvious than that told by Ken Mehlman on Friday to a national television audience .
However immune we have become to misleading statements from political officials , however low our standards of behavior and expectations for our political leaders may have sunk -- no matter how cynical one has become -- should n't clear , brazen , outright lies of the type which Ken Mehlman told about the Denny Hastert Ultimatum be considered wrong and intolerable and something for which serious consequences are required ?
If we have even the most minimally breathing journalistic life force and the most minimal standards left for behavioral requirements from political officials , this just has to become a huge story .
Why should Ken Mehlman be able to go on national television and blatantly lie to everyone about what happened last week at the center of this scandal and not only get away with it , but have nobody really notice ? : GOP Congressman Jack Kingston , on Fox News with Chris Wallace this weekend , spread the tall tale
If someone wants to call Congressman Kingston 's office and ask if it really is true that Denny Hastert gave this ultimatum to Mark Foley and what the basis is for that claim , the contact information is here

Let there be no doubt that the war on malaria has failed .
It is estimated that 800,000 children in Africa die from the disease every year , and as many as three million people altogether every year .
We know how people contract it : from mosquitoes .
We know how to control it : kill the carrier mosquitoes .
And we know what kills them : DDT .
So why has the war on malaria failed ?
Because governments banned the cure .
Now they claim to wonder why people are sick and dying .
DDT was discovered during World War II to be a great means of stopping infection from typhus and malaria .
Its inventor , Paul Hermann Mueller , won the Nobel Prize in 1948 .
It was used throughout the 1950s and '60s and was on the verge of wiping out mosquito - borne diseases from the planet .
Then something very peculiar came along .
A book called Silent Spring by Rachel Carson was published in 1962 , and it eventually created a fantastic backlash against progress .
The spring was silent supposedly because of the lack of birds , all killed off by DDT .
The only problem is that Carson 's claims were never scientifically validated .
Indeed , it was a hoax .
Studies pumped primates full of DDT with no effect .
Human volunteers ingested the stuff with no effect .
Workers with 600 times the typical exposure to DDT showed no increased side effects .
( Some details here . )
What 's more , she never once mentioned in her book that DDT had saved hundreds of thousands of lives .
Even so , governments acted .
First in Norway and Sweden in 1970 .
The United States banned it in 1972 .
The United Kingdom acted in 1984 .
The Stockholm Convention of 2001 called for the complete elimination of DDT .
Of course , the United States government enforced its opposition through its foreign aid programs .
Here it is 2006 and what happens ?
People are stunned that malaria is back with a vengeance .
Every 30 seconds , someone dies of malaria , and three - quarters of the victims are under the age of 5 .
Survivors can be left with insufferable mental and physical ailments .
So far as I know , neither governments nor greens were ever held liable .
Today , the big bucks are looking to fix the problem .
Nearly $ 1 billion was spent last year alone .
Warren Buffett ( $ 31 billion ) and the Gates Foundation have gotten in on the act .
Where is the money going ?
Only a tiny portion will be spent on DDT spraying , the restrictions on which are only now being slightly loosened , provided it is sprayed in homes and not on crops .
Mostly the money is going to nets .
Nets !
As if this were the 19th century !
It 's obvious that the agencies involved in this struggle are reluctant to reach for the spray can , or even discuss it .
The hidden hand behind this horror is none other than the environmentalists .
The frenzy against DDT launched their movement .
It is what emboldened them , and gave their political agenda momentum .
In some ways , their campaign against DDT perfectly sums up their political bent : using state power to ban products and services that help humans , and thereby cause history to roll backward .
The extent to which the green movement is wrapped up in this history is obvious from the fact that we are living through a genuine silent spring , with the press ignoring the causes of malaria .
The New York Times presents the epidemic as " mystifying , " and most people know nothing about the role of the environmentalists who are responsible for millions of deaths by malaria , and in Africa , of all places , the continent that the Left claims to love to help .
Does no one at the New York Times read back issues ?
The full case is presented in the zillion - word magazine masterpiece from Tina Rosenberg " What the World Needs Now Is DDT " ( April 11 , 2004 ) .
The politics of the environmentalists are increasingly predictable and obvious .
They oppose all forms of capitalistic innovation .
Indeed , they represent a special kind of danger to the human race that socialism never did .
At least the socialists favored human progress , or at least said they did .
These greens are against all that .
They claim that we should be happy to live amidst disease , filth , and death , if only the bugs and birds can be left alone to thrive and kill us .
It 's as if the socialists discovered that their plan creates poverty , so they decided to change their name to environmentalists and make poverty their goal .
And note how their agenda fits so well with the state agenda .
The state hobbles and hinders productivity in millions of ways through its taxing , regulating , and warmongering .
But that makes little difference to the state , which prefers the exercise of power to the good of society .
So too do the environmentalists pursue their agenda without regard to the effects on human society .
Currently , there are many environmental issues alive in the policy world , from the debate over sprawl to the frenzy over global warming .
The environmentalists have the upper hand in all of them , which is a crying shame , given that they 're responsible for millions of lost lives – in just one of their conquests .
More victories for them are sure to make life worse for all of us .
Fellowship is an important part of our faith .
Coming together to support one another is an experience that allows us to learn , gain strength , and show the world exactly what God is .
Fellowship Gives Us a Picture of God
Each of us together shows all of God 's graces to the world .
No one is perfect .
We all sin , but each of us has a purpose here on Earth to show aspects of God to those around us .
Each of us has been given specific spiritual gifts .
When we come together in fellowship , it 's like us as a whole demonstrating God .
Think of it like a cake .
You need the flour , sugar , eggs , oil , and more to make a cake .
The eggs will never be the flour .
None of them make up the cake alone .
Yet together , all those ingredients make a delicious cake .
It is like that will fellowship .
All of us together show the glory of God .
Romans 12:4 - 6
" For just as each of us has one body with many members , and these members do not all have the same function , so in Christ , we though many , form one body , and each member belongs to all the others .
We have different gifts , according to the grace given to each of us .
If your gift is prophesying , then prophesy in accordance with your faith . "
( NIV )
Fellowship Makes Us Stronger
No matter where we are in our faith , fellowship provides us with strength .
Being around other believers gives us the chance to learn and grow in our faith .
It demonstrates to us why we believe and sometimes is the excellent food for our souls .
It 's great to be out in the world evangelizing to others , but it can easily make us hard and eat away at our strength .
When we deal with a hard - hearted world , it can become easy to fall into that hard - heartedness and question our beliefs .
It 's always good to spend some time in fellowship so that we remember that God makes us strong .
Matthew 18:19 - 20 “ Again , truly I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything they ask for , it will be done for them by my Father in heaven .
For where two or three gather in my name , there am I with them . ” ( NIV )
Fellowship Provides Encouragement
We all have bad moments .
Whether it 's the loss of a loved one , a failed exam , money problems , or even a crisis of faith , we can find ourselves down .
If we go too low , it can lead to anger and a feeling of disillusionment with God .
Yet these low times are why fellowship is important .
Spending tie with other believers can often lift us up a little bit .
They help us to keep our eyes on God .
God also works through them to provide us what we need in darker times .
Coming together with others can aid in our healing process and give us the encouragement to move forward .
Hebrews 10:24 -25
" Let us think of ways to motivate one another to acts of love and good works .
And let us not neglect our meeting together , as some people do , but encourage one another , especially now that the day of his return is drawing near . "
( NLT )
Fellowship Reminds Us We 're Not Alone
Coming together with other believers in worship and conversation helps to remind us that we are not alone in this world .
There are believers everywhere .
It 's amazing that no matter where you are in the world when you meet another believer , it 's like you suddenly feel at home .
That 's why God made fellowship so important .
He wanted us to come together so that we always know we 're not alone .
Fellowship allows us to build those lasting relationships so we 're never by ourselves in the world .
1 Corinthians 12:21
" The eye can never say to the hand , ' I do n’t need you . '
The head ca n’t say to the feet , ' I do n’t need you . ' " ( NLT )
Fellowship Helps Us Grow
Coming together is a great way for each of us to grow in our faith .
Reading our Bibles and praying are great ways to get closer to God , but each of us has important lessons to impart to one another .
When we come together in fellowship , we teach each other things .
God gives us a gift of learning and growing when we come together in fellowship we show each other how to live as God wants us to live , and how to walk in His footsteps .
Recently - fired U.S. Attorney for New Mexico , David Iglesias , is set to testify tomorrow before the House Judiciary Committee pursuant to a subpoena .
Iglesias , you 'll recall , alleges that he was called directly by two Republican federal lawmakers and pressured to speed up a case he was pursuing against Democratic state officials -- a definite no -no .
Iglesias says he 's ready to name names .
The suspicion , of course , is that Iglesias was not fired for " performance - related issues , " as the " administration " claims , but rather for " not prosecuting Democrats while ignoring Republican crime - related issues , " as is rumored to be the case with several other mysterious firings .
So tomorrow 's opportunity is good news , at least for those who prefer their Justice Department with a little less corruption .
But are Democrats in Congress ready to open up this Pandora 's Box ?
After voting to issue the subpoenas Thursday , Rep. Linda Sanchez ( D - Calif. ) , who chairs the House Judiciary subcommittee on commercial and administrative law , stressed the importance of a judiciary branch that is separate and independent from the executive branch .
" When the executive branch is interfering in the justice system - in other countries we call that corruption , " she said .
" It 's very troubling to me that there seems to be this undercurrent . "
High praise for the sentiment , certainly .
But remember , Iglesias ' claims do not implicate the independence of the judiciary branch .
Rather , they are a symptom of the way this " administration " runs the executive branch .
U.S. Attorneys are , of course , officers of the court .
But they are employees of the Department of Justice , and as such , members of the executive branch .
So is it just a slip , or is it a troubling indication that we may not be viewing this case in context ?
And whose slip is it ?
Sanchez 's or the reporter's ?
Sanchez 's quoted words are quite correct .
The executive is interfering in the justice system .
The set - up which precedes it -- not a direct quote -- conflates the justice system with the judicial branch .
Ordinarily , I 'd simply say the phrasing -- to whomever it belongs -- is simply a less than 100 % accurate , off - the - cuff remark , and there 's nothing to worry about .
But I 'm a little bit concerned here because I think this case is indicative of an " administration " - wide problem that 's most dangerous in its manifestation in the Justice Department ( simply because of the nature of what they do -- or at least , are supposed to do ) , but by no means limited to that department .
You 'll recall , after all , that this is also the " administration " that fires generals who do n't say Iraq is a success , blows the cover of CIA agents whose spouses do n't keep it to themselves when they catch them lying us into wars , and smears national security staffers and even Treasury Secretaries who confirm that it 's all horrible - but - true .
But these issues are at least arguably confined in - house -- that is , within the executive branch .
While the " administration " may well have corrupt motives in doing what it does , our system of government allows them a tremendous amount of latitude in doing so .
It 's where there are areas of overlap between the branches where our thinking -- and our understanding of the " administration 's " thinking ( if that 's a term I can use here ) -- will have to be at its sharpest .
The White House and the DoJ clearly consider these unprecedentedmass firings of U.S. Attorneys to be routine " personnel matters . "
They clearly know they 're anything but routine , but they also know that by claiming they 're " personnel matters , " they are presumed to be entitled to the shield of the discretion we normally afford law - abiding administrations .
This is of a piece with their , shall we say , " less than orthodox " theories on the extent of the executive 's " inherent powers " and the nature of the " unitary executive . "
Under normal circumstances -- that is , with a law - abiding administration -- the firing of a U.S. Attorney might well be left unquestioned as a " personnel matter . "
But with an " administration " that walks out of Congressional hearings they do n't like , purports to nullify laws by executive fiat , and attempts to intimidate whistleblowers by issuing subpoenas to Congressional investigators , we 're well outside of affording the traditional benefit of the doubt without even reaching the fact that we 're talking about multiple firings -- a brazenness in DoJ " personnel matters " not seen since the Saturday Night Massacre .
That 's going to mean that everyone -- the public , the Congress , and the media -- are going to have to keep a sharp eye out , and not get lazy about assuming that the " administration " is in fact entitled to everything it claims it 's entitled to .
Hard questions have to be asked .
Is the executive entitled to do whatever it wants on " personnel matters ? "
Is this in fact a " personnel matter " at all ?
Is the department chiefly tasked with enforcing the law breaking it instead ?
Is it , as I argue Gonzales has hinted before in other ares of questionable DoJ activity , not really breaking the law , if only because the laws do n't apply to presidents ?
And , we 'll very likely soon be asking , is it within the executive 's prerogative to direct the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia -- to whom the task would fall -- not to prosecute contempt of Congress charges against " administration " officials who defy Congressional subpoenas ?
Same - sex twins were more likely to have babies
Women were 25 % less likely to have children if their twin was male , the study , in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , concluded .
Although other factors could play a part - the women were less likely to marry - the team blamed exposure in the womb to the male hormone testosterone .
Experts have agreed testosterone might potentially damage female fertility .
They said animal work supported this .
But they said more work was needed to look at human mechanisms .
Hormone effects
Both testosterone and the female hormone oestrogen can cross the womb .
A female twin foetus is therefore exposed to a brother 's testosterone and a male twin foetus to a sister 's oestrogen .
However , male and female foetuses have similar oestrogen levels , so a female is more likely to be affected , according to Dr Virpi Lummaa 's team .
Experts already know certain characteristics , including facial features , can be changed by exposure to sex hormones from opposite sex foetuses .
To investigate the effect testosterone might have on fertility , the researchers looked back at Finnish medical records covering the years 1734 to 1888 .
They chose this pre-industrial population because they argue fertility data on modern Western societies would be skewed by advanced healthcare and assisted conception treatments , such as IVF .
Masculinising
Of 754 twins , females with a twin brother were 25 % less likely to have children than females with a twin sister .
Women with a male twin were also 15 % less likely to marry .
Dr Lummaa 's team offer several explanations .
Firstly , females exposed to a male twin can have masculine traits , attitudes and behaviours , therefore affecting their decision to get married or a male 's attractiveness to them .
Secondly , exposure to high levels of testosterone in the womb increases the risk of diseases that compromise fertility , such as reproductive cancers .
Dr Lummaa said : " As a consequence of a male twin 's influence on a female 's fertility , mothers who produce opposite sex twins have fewer grandchildren and hence lower evolutionary fitness . "
Dr Laurence Shaw , a fertility expert at the London Bridge Fertility Centre and spokesman for the British Fertility Society , said : " There is some evidence to support this observation .
" Exposure to testosterone in the womb in sheep recreates a similar syndrome to a condition called PCOS which is a known cause of infertility in humans .
" Work is now needed to explore what mechanisms could explain these observations in humans . "

President Bush says he 'll go along with a higher minimum wage if it 's coupled with tax and regulatory breaks for small businesses .
Raising the minimum wage is definitely popular .
Voters in six states approved higher minimums last Election Day .
State politicians in both parties are practically drooling with eagerness to " help " lower - income workers .
After all , how can you call the current minimum , $ 5.15 an hour , a " living " wage ?
Who can live on that ?
We all want the poor to make more money .
So if government can raise wages by decree , why are the popular proposals so stingy ?
What good is a measly buck or two extra ?
Let 's really do something for the poor .
Let 's raise the minimum wage to $ 20 an hour .
Even better , $ 50 !
Or maybe we should take a deep breath and think like economists for a change .
The law of supply and demand , which operates whether we like it or not , says that when the price of something goes up , people buy less of it .
That 's why environmentalists like higher gasoline taxes , and anti-smoking activists back higher cigarette taxes .
The law of supply and demand works in the labor market , too .
If government mandates a higher minimum wage , some workers will get a raise .
Some .
But something else will happen .
Employers will hire fewer low - skilled workers .
Others will let some current workers go .
Some will choose not to expand their businesses .
A few will close altogether .
If an employer believes a worker creates only about $ 5.15 worth of value on the job , he wo n't pay $ 7 , even if the government demands it .
Only 2.5 percent of all hourly workers make $ 5.15 an hour ( or less ; some jobs are exempt from the law ) , says the Department of Labor .
" Minimum wage workers tend to be young . "
Few of them stay at the minimum wage for long .
As they acquire skills , their productivity rises and they command higher wages .
According to a study done for the Bureau of Labor Statistics , " minimum wages have virtually no effect on the careers of most workers . "
A small percentage of people do get stuck in minimum - wage jobs for a longer time .
Since wages tend to rise with productivity , these are people whose productivity does not improve .
A higher minimum wage will cost some of them their jobs .
How does that help them ?
Legal wage minimums kill all kinds of entry - level jobs , particularly those that would teach young people basic work habits and the benefits of effort .
That 's why there are no kids cleaning your windows at gas stations or working as ushers at movie theaters .
Those jobs are extinct now because they are worth less than the legislated minimum .
Who is helped by that ?
Let 's face it .
The higher minimum wage is a feel - good law .
A slight increase will pass because politicians and poverty activists will be able to say they have " done something " for the poor , while the victims of the policy go unnoticed .
Those who can't find jobs because they produce too little are not likely to blame the law or the politicians who tried to " help " them .
Then the resulting unemployment will justify expansion of the welfare state .
As George Mason University economist Walter Williams says , " It 's tempting to think of higher minimum wages as an anti-poverty weapon , but such an idea does n't even pass the smell test .
After all , if higher minimum wages could cure poverty , we could easily end worldwide poverty simply by telling poor nations to legislate higher minimum wages . "
IN EARLY MAY 1857 -- 150 years ago this month -- the British empire found itself threatened by the largest and bloodiest anti-colonial revolt to face any European empire anywhere in the world during the 19th century .
The British had been trading in India through the East India Co. since the early 1600s .
But in the late 1700s , the dynamic had begun to shift .
A new group of conservatives came to power , determined to radically expand British power abroad and to defend the economic interests of Britain against all threats .
The governor general of India , Lord Wellesley , called his new , aggressive approach the “ forward policy . ”
Wellesley was determined to establish British dominance over all its European rivals , and he firmly believed in removing hostile Muslim regimes preemptively if they presumed to resist the West ’s growing power .
There were many voices in the right - wing press supporting this view .
They argued that the puppet Muslim allies that effectively allowed the empire to run their affairs could stay for the time being , but that those governments that were intent on resisting the advance of the West were simply not to be tolerated .
Nor was there any doubt who would be the first to go : a dictator whose family had usurped power in a military coup .
According to British sources close to government , he was “ a cruel and relentless enemy , ” an “ intolerant bigot , ” a “ furious fanatic ” who had “ perpetually on his tongue the projects of jihad . ”
This dictator was also deemed to be an “ oppressive and unjust ruler ... [ and a ] perfidious negotiator . ”

Wellesley had arrived in India in 1798 with specific instructions to effect regime change and replace this dictator -- Tipu Sultan of Mysore -- with a Western - backed puppet .
First , however , Wellesley had to justify publicly a policy the outcome of which had already been decided in private .
It was only by marshaling a body of apparently persuasive evidence against opponents that the bellyaching anti-imperialists at home -- in this case the coterie that had gathered around the statesman and political theorist Edmund Burke -- could be shut up .
It was with this in mind that Wellesley and his allies began a comprehensive campaign of vilification against Tipu , portraying him as a vicious and aggressive Muslim monster who planned to wipe the British off the map of India .
This essay in imperial villain - making duly opened the way for a lucrative conquest and the installation of a more pliable regime .
The British , however , were not satisfied with removing Tipu .
As the years passed , they slowly progressed from removing threatening Muslim rulers to destabilizing even the most malleable Islamic states and annexing them to British India .
In February 1856 , they annexed the prosperous kingdom of Avadh on the somewhat lame excuse that the Nawab , or provincial governor , was “ excessively debauched . ”
By early 1857 , the East India Co. was directly ruling about two - thirds of the subcontinent .
Moreover , many British officials who believed in the forward policy were nursing plans to impose not just British laws and technology on India but British values as well .
This meant banning the burning of widows , allowing them to remarry and outlawing infanticide .
An evangelical lobby at home also pressed for increased missionary activity , and India in the 1840s and 1850s slowly filled with pious Christian fundamentalists who wanted not just to rule India but to redeem and improve it .

The tracts of the missionaries reinforced Muslim fears , increasing opposition to British rule and creating a constituency for the rapidly multiplying jihadis determined to stop the rule of the kafir infidels .
At the same time , the existence of such “ Wahhabi conspiracies ” to resist the Christians strengthened the conviction of the evangelicals that a “ strong attack ” was needed to take on “ Muslim fanatics . ”
The reaction to this steady crescendo of insensitivity came in 1857 with the Great Mutiny .
On a May morning , 300 mutinous Indian soldiers ( known as “ sepoys ” ) , who had been fighting on behalf of the British , rode into Delhi , massacred every Christian man , woman and child they could find and declared the Mughal emperor to be the leader of a chaotic and officerless army of unpaid peasant soldiers set against the forces of the world ’s greatest military power .
Of the 139,000 sepoys of the Bengal army -- the largest modern army in Asia -- all but 7,796 turned against their British masters .
In some parts of northern India , such as Avadh , the sepoys were joined by a very large proportion of the population .
Atrocities abounded on both sides .
The great Mughal capital , caught in the middle of a remarkable cultural flowering , was turned overnight into a battleground .
Though it had many causes and reflected many deeply held political and economic grievances -- particularly the feeling that heathen foreigners were interfering in a part of the world where they were entirely alien -- the uprising was nevertheless articulated as a war of religion , and especially as a defensive action against the rapid inroads missionaries and Christian ideas were making in India .

Although the great majority of the sepoys were Hindus , a flag of jihad was raised in the principal mosque in Delhi , and many of the insurgents described themselves as “ mujahedin ” or “ jihadis . ”
Indeed , by the end of the siege , the proportion of jihadis in the rebellion ’s storm center of Delhi grew to be about half of the total rebel force and included a regiment of “ suicide ghazis ” who had vowed never to eat again and to fight until they met death at the hands of the kafirs .
Finally , on Sept. 14 , 1857 , the British assaulted and took the city , sacking the Mughal capital and massacring innocent civilians along with the sepoys and the jihadis .
In one neighborhood alone , Kucha Chelan , 1,400 unarmed citizens of Delhi were cut down .
In addition to the obvious historical parallels , there is a direct link between the jihadis of 1857 and those we face today .
The reaction of some of the Islamic scholars after 1857 was to reject the West in favor of a return to pure Islamic roots .
A Wahhabi - like madrasa was founded at Deoband in India that went back to Koranic basics .
One hundred and forty years later , the movement has spread , and it was out of Deobandi madrasas in Pakistan that the Taliban emerged to create the most retrograde Islamic regime in modern history , a regime that in turn provided the crucible out of which emerged Al Qaeda .
So does history repeat itself .
Not only are Westerners again playing their old game of installing puppet regimes , propped up by Western garrisons , for their own political ends , but more alarmingly , the intellectual attitudes that have sustained such adventures remain intact .
Advertisement
Old - style Orientalism is alive and kicking , its prejudices intact , with Mark Steyn , Daniel Pipes , Samuel Huntington and Charles Krauthammer in the role of the new James Mills and Thomas Macaulays .
Through their pens -- blissfully unencumbered by any experience of the Muslim world -- the old colonial idea of the Muslim ruler as the decadent Oriental despot lives on , and , as before , it is effortlessly projected on a credulous public to justify imperial projects .
Today , suicide jihadis fight what they see as a defensive action against their Christian enemies , and West and East again face each other uneasily across a divide that many see as religious war .
As ever , it is innocent civilians who are slaughtered .
As before , Western evangelical politicians are apt to cast their enemies in the role of “ incarnate fiends ” and simplistically conflate resistance to invasion and occupation with “ pure evil . ”
And Western countries , blind to the effects of their foreign policies , feel aggrieved and surprised to be attacked by -- as they see it -- mindless fanatics .
Yet as we have seen in our own time , nothing so easily radicalizes a people against us as aggressive Western intrusion in the East .
The histories of Islamic fundamentalism and Western imperialism have often been closely , and dangerously , intertwined .
There are clear lessons here .
For , in the celebrated words of Edmund Burke , those who fail to learn from history are always destined to repeat it .
Every once in a while , some one shares with me the story of an unimaginably convoluted system .
A system so complex , so twisted that the mere thought of maintaining it has driven many a men insane .
A system so heinous and so evil that the souls it has claimed are outnumbered only by COBOL itself .
So , in hopes that its presentation might offer some consolation to John and its other unfortunate victims , I will share with you the story of The Customer - Friendly System .
The Customer - Friendly System , like so many of its kind , was spawned in the bowels of a behemoth corporation at the hand of a giant consulting company .
Its purpose was to automate the complex processes required to originate , route , approve , underwrite , and fund various types of business and consumer mortgages .
And it was " Customer - Friendly " because the consultants wanted to design it so that " even the most technically unskilled end - user could easily add and modify " its complex workflow modules .
To give you an idea of what " Customer Friendly " means , take a look at this next image .
When I first saw it , I thought it was some sort of circuit diagram .
Actually , it 's a Visio diagram ( 12 of 136 ) that contains one of these complex workflow modules .
Let me rephrase that : the diagram does n't represent the workflow or show how the workflow is coded , it is the workflow .
Let 's take a look at a closeup .
Though it may seem like it , that block is not a standard Visio component .
It 's a " Workflow Action " custom - component that was developed by the consultants .
Each of these Workflow Action blocks is linked - to and linked - by several other Actions , which may be defined in the same Visio diagram , another Visio diagram , or an external J2EE module .
The system core utilizes these Visio diagrams for its business workflow logic and dynamic user interface generation , and it is through these diagrams that the system is " Customer Friendly . "
To add or change functionality to the system , all the " technically unskilled " end user would need to do is modify one of these diagrams .
It was that simple .
Obviously , no end user ever saw or touched these diagrams .
Though the " proof of concept " was simple enough for a " technically unskilled " user , changing the workflow logic on the full - developed system required a highly - trained programmer and a highly - powered desktop ( 2 - 4GB RAM ) .
And that 's where John came in ; he actually managed to make it through the six months of " peer training " required to " program " the diagrams .
The final straw for John was when he was tasked with making a " simple UI change . "
That 's when he learned that , to make the generated UI more usable , the system allowed for developers to incorporate JavaScript " tweak files . "
What ended up happening is that the entire front - end became JavaScript : it did everything from displaying a navigation bar to validating data on the form .
And what was John 's simple UI change ? , you might ask .
It was to " use the [ JavaScript ] HTML Parser ( /inc/p2/v/hparser.js ) to filter out Iowa - specific text before it's passed to the page renderer ( /inc/p2/v/hrenderer.js ) . "

NEW !
mishak
As recently requested by mishak , and in honor of his impending natal day , I have translated into rough Latin an extensive fragment of a much longer popular song .
While providing a literal interlinear translation back into English for the benefit of Latin- less readers , I have , regrettably , made no attempt at rhyme or meter ; alert readers will also notice that by avoiding translating the entire song , I have not only allowed myself more time for other work , but I have also neatly skipped several lines in the second half which are not easily susceptible to translation .
I welcome constructive comments on the Latinity .

To some extent , the divergent indicators reflect the fact that the numbers come from two surveys with different methodologies and , in recent years , differing trends .
The jobs figure comes from a Labor Department survey of establishments and lately it has tended to produce gloomier numbers than the other survey the department performs , in which households are asked which members have jobs .
The trends are expected to be a little different , in that self - employed people would show up with jobs only in the household survey , while a person holding two jobs would be double - counted in the establishment survey .
But the differences in this cycle have been substantial and are not easy to explain .
Even the household survey , with its more positive numbers , indicates that little progress on jobs has been made in this recovery .
There has been almost no increase , by these statistics , in the percentage of working - age Americans who are working .
The decline in the unemployment rate reflects the fact that fewer of those without jobs say they are looking for work , as is required to be counted as unemployed .
The job growth picture is also complicated now by the different nature of work in America .
Back in 1949 , when the first postwar recession ended , slightly fewer than half the jobs were in private - sector service industries .
Now the figure is more than two - thirds .
In the same period , the government share of the civilian work force went up a couple of percentage points , to about a sixth .
The share of employment represented by private - sector goods - producing industries fell by more than half , to less than 17 percent from more than 37 percent .
Employment in that sector peaked at 25.2 million people in 1979 .
Now it is 22.4 million , even though total employment is up 50 percent since 1979 .

I might not actually have free will .
When I raise my arm , I might not have actually done that ; part of my subconscious might have done that and caused me to raise it .
I perceive it is free will but it may not be .
Even though I have perceived there is one me and I think of myself as a single person , there might actually be multiple things behind me that are being integrated into an illusion that I am me .
Now I ’m supposed to talk knowing that I ’m hallucinating an illusion and whatever else .
I have to put all that aside and go back to my normal mode of thinking which is : I am one person with one consciousness .
I do have free will and I am not hallucinating .
I talk to a lot of people and do a lot of stuff that is fun in the way of educating people , such as with the website : How Stuff Works .
One thing I know about talking with the general public is that no one is thinking at the level that is being thought of here and no one is sitting around in their living rooms watching television and thinking , wow , in 20 or 30 years , I can have my brain uploaded .
That is just not in the public consciousness .
I have to work at a little bit different level when trying to help people understand the pace of technological change .
To help people understand the pace of technological change , I ca n’t use computers because most people do n’t have a real good grasp of computers .
I can use airplanes because everybody understands airplanes .
If you look back to 1903 , and at the moment this happened in normal society , there were no skyscrapers and there were not cars yet because the model - T was not invented until 1909 .
Image 1 : Wright Brothers
There was n’t air conditioning , refrigeration , lighting was still - some of it was electrified but a lot of it was kerosene .
The concept of the galaxy had not been invented yet so if people looked at the stars , no one thought of galaxies yet because that does not get invented until 1920 .
This rickety , wooden , fabric thing takes off , off the ground , and flies for 200 feet .
And if you were to say to people in 1903 , hey , we just had the first airplane , now think about this , 50 years from now , there ’s going to be a giant aluminum version of this , except that it ’s going to be about three football fields long and it ’s going to be able to fly faster than the speed of sound and it ’s going to be able to carry 70,000 pounds of bombs around , all the way to the other side of the world , and drop them on foreign nations if it wants to .
That will all happen in 50 years .
They would have just thought you were nuts and yet 50 years later the B - 52 bomber , which is able to fly halfway around the world and drop 70,000 pounds of bombs on people , actually happened .
Image 2 : B - 52 Bomber Now , 15 years , and not 50 , is the pace of technological change .
That is phenomenal and as Ray Kurzweil suggests , the pace is accelerating .
Paradigms are shifting at a faster and faster rate .
It is hard to predict the future , but one thing that I ’m pretty sure of , and something that I try to talk to people about , is that we all are going to want out of our human bodies .
Image 3 : Predicting the Future
We are all inhabiting human bodies right now .
We all , though we do n’t realize it or consciously think about it every moment of every day , we all want out of our bodies .
We would like to discard these vehicles that we currently use for transportation and we would like to replace them with something better .
We can actually look at market forces that will drive us out of our bodies and understand that is a way of understanding a little bit about uploading and what will drive that .
What will drive us out of our bodies ?
I can tell you one thing is travel .
Travel can be inconvenient : flight connections , security probes , and all the things involved with traveling .
The experience of travel is one thing that will drive us out of their bodies but for a lot of people another thing that will drive us out of our bodies is video games , the desire to experience video games much more intimately that we do today .
Here is an image of video game technology in 1982 versus video game technology in 2005 .
In 25 years we went from Pac - Man , which is four colors on a black screen , to an immersive 3 - D environment .
Image 4 : Video Games
What would this screen look like in 2030 ?
If we went that far in 25 years , what will a video game look like in 25 more years ?
And that ’s mind boggling .
What will I look like ?
If we stay inside our bodies , it will not look that much different .
It can get a little higher resolution but you can get much better than HALF Life II in terms of resolution .
They offer us all these different experiences that we would all like to have , but look at some of these experiences , you can play football , you can kill people in realistic battle situations and you can go back to ancient Rome .
Image 5 : Immersive Video Games
There are lots of cool things you can do but the problem is you have to do it with two thumbs and most of us do n’t want to experience football and Ancient Rome with two thumbs .
We want to experience them with our full complement of physical senses and muscles .
We want to actually participate in these events .
This is a rapidly evolving technology .
I believe it is either on the cusp of or already has overtaken the movie industry .
It has nowhere to go but forward except for this problem : the notion that you are going to control and experience with your thumbs is nuts .
That is one thing that will drive us out of our bodies .
And it will drive us out of our bodies in one of two ways .
Either we will install hardware that will let us emulate or connect into these virtual environments and control and feel them or we ’ll realize we do n’t need our bodies anymore .
One way or the other will get us out .
The second reason is porn .
We all see the effects of porn in our society and I can offer you an interesting and sometimes shocking piece of data to show how popular porn is .
I would say we all use Google .
Google represents 2.7 percent of all Web traffic , followed by Yahoo ! and MSN .
Search is about five percent of network Internet traffic and we all use that .
Porn is over three times more Internet traffic than all of search .
It ’s insane how popular porn is and we do n’t realize it , maybe because it ’s not something people talk about .
But that statistic cannot be denied .
That is an astounding statistic .
The way people experience porn right now is through still images or grainy videos and that stinks .
It ’s just not how people want to experience porn .
It is a very , very poor stimulation of what people want out of porn .
That ’s the second thing that will drive us out of our bodies .
The third thing is this horrible problem our bodies create with longevity .
I was on this flight , wishing I was n’t inside my body , and I ’m sitting in my seat , which is the aisle seat .
There is a quite large woman sitting next to me who got there before me and just put up the arm rest .
We ’re squeezed in a two pack on the airplane .
She ’s about 80 years old and she used to work at IBM .
I got to know her very well on this flight .
She lives near Orlando , but is flying up to visit her niece who lives in Burlington , VT .
She said to me at the end of the flight , “ I really appreciate you being here today . ”
And I said , “ Why is that ? ”
And she replied , “ Well , my husband of 53 years passed away and this is the first trip I ’ve ever taken without him . ”
What do you say to that ?
She talked through the whole flight and I talked with her and we had a very nice time , but I did n’t realize I was taking the place of her now deceased husband , That ’s just shocking to think that I was in that role , for one thing .
And for another thing , think how horrible that is , a person she ’s been with for 53 years just vanished out from underneath her for no reason .
Death is an insult ; it ’s just ridiculous .
There are all these different ways for us to die .
We could go to the bathroom and fall down the steps or we could get into an accident as we ’re driving back to a hotel or the hotel could burn down while we ’re sleeping ; there are so many ways for us to die .
When we die we do n’t have a backup system or anything like that .
Getting out of our bodies is one way to improve longevity .
All of these forces , plus having to use the restroom and all of these other things , are going to drive us out of our bodies as soon as we have the opportunity to leave them .
Lots of people would leap at the chance to get out of their bodies if they could go plug into a virtual world .
What is going to happen ?
You can imagine me trying to get through airport security with a toy brain in a soda bottle .
It ’s a fake brain .
It ’s a toy and I actually brought the little packaging so I could show them it was just a toy brain .
This is what the next phase of technology will be , I think .
I do n’t think we ’ll get to uploading fast enough .
I think we will instead just discard our bodies , take our brain , and put them in containers that provide oxygen , nutrients , antibiotics and whatever else to keep us going .
Then later we ’ll get to uploading .
The advantage to putting our brains in bottles is , first of all , we eliminate the whole trauma thing from falling down and getting in car wrecks and stuff .
Next , there will be far less disease exposure because , it can be kept in a sterile facility and our bodies open us up to lots of diseases that our brains do n’t necessarily have to participate in .
The problem is that we will connect to virtual environments by living in bottles and have a lot more fun but the neurons still die .
The estimate is about 30 million of your neurons die every year as you go through life .
We are going to want to store our brain in a permanent medium .
That is where this whole idea of mind uploading [ 1 ] comes from .
Back up our consciousness and run it on another medium where we do n’t have 30 million neurons dying every year .
Here are the basic facts on the brain , it ’s a liter and a half , it consumes 20 watts , it has 100 billion neurons , 100 trillion synapses , it ’s got a lot of atoms , maybe ten to the thirtieth atoms and it uses this basic component called a neuron , for its technology .
Image 6 : Human Brain
The problem is how do you store this and then execute it in some other medium besides the current one ?
How do we take the patterns that are in it ?
The patterns are stored in at least three ways : the connections between the neurons , the formation of new synapses through experiences and then , microtubules .
Image 7 : The Neuron Memory could be stored somehow but I do n’t think we even know how all memories are stored .
We somehow take all that physiology , put it into some kind of computer medium , and then we have to figure out how to execute it , which may happen in two steps .
There are maybe ten to twenty different commonly discussed possible ways to do this .
One is where they take the top of your skull off and they just probe your cortex with an electrode and you get really vivid memories of things that have happened in your life .
Those memories play on your visual cortex and there are memories that play on your auditory cortex .
So , one idea is to somehow probe the brain , basically scan through it memory by memory , and record images and sounds off the visual and auditory , and record it .
That would be low fidelity but it would be a way of capturing the movies out of your brain .
The second way is neuron simulation of some sort .
You have to somehow get inside the brain , probably destructively , and look at every single neuron and see how is it connected to all the other neurons around it , how are the synapses weighted , how are the synapses connected , and somehow tease that out of the structure .
Image 8 : Uploading Approaches
The two main ways of doing that have been proposed is either slicing the brain very gently and just scanning it in some way or injecting some kind of a nanotechnology entities into it that can look at and figure out how to emulate each neuron and either kill off that neuron and replace it , as that opportunity is available , or somehow stand alongside it and eventually have an image of every neuron in the whole brain that ’s being transmitted out by these nanobots .
Or , you go the whole distance and you somehow look at every single atom in this object and you store the type of atom , its location , it ’s bonding to neighboring atoms , someone mentioned ( cork spin ) , and somehow take an atomic image of this .
Then the question is : how would you do that ?
No one has a really good idea right now but this Star Trek transporter room idea does offer one technology for doing that because it is already taking your entire body and turning it into an electromagnetic wave that can be transmitted to a planet surface .
That gives you an example of how speculative the technology is .
No one has a good way of conceiving of how you would take something apart atom by atom and then simulating it into the atomic level and running it .
The thing that is so interesting is that all of these things are probably possible , perhaps within 40 years .
In some form of this in some way within 40 years , that ’s extremely hard to imagine , yet probably true in the same way .
Going from the Wright Brothers ’ airplane to the B - 52 was hard to imagine in 50 years .
I think back to that nice woman who was sitting on the airplane with me .
In perhaps 40 years , that problem wo n’t exist anymore .
That is an amazing thing if it actually happens .

A quick test : how many of you can name the product being advertised in the banner ad at the top of the page ?
Chances are , the ad's presence did n't even register with most seasoned web browsers .
But that 's probably okay , at least according to research that appears in June 's Journal of Consumer Research .
The research concludes that repeated exposure to a product via banner ads generates a positive feeling towards that product .
The good news for consumers is that a critical reevaluation of the product can make these positive feelings vanish .
There is a long history of experiments that show that repeated exposure to a stimulus that 's barely perceptible can enhance a person 's feelings towards what 's otherwise a neutral object .
These feelings can include a liking or more subjective things such as " fame , truth , duration , loudness , stimulus brightness and darkness . "
The authors hypothesized that banner ads should work well as such a stimulus , given that " most viewers pay minimal attention to banner ads . "
To test this , they asked students to read a multipage essay under the assumption that they'd be answering questions on the essay 's content .
Instead , the students were ultimately quizzed about a fictitious brand of camera , Pretec , that had appeared in banner ads on the pages that contained the essay .
Different pools of students were exposed to Pretec ads zero , five , or 20 times .
Afterwards , when asked about their negative feelings towards the brand , the number of exposures made absolutely no difference .
In contrast , those students asked about their positive feelings towards the brand saw those feelings increase in a linear fashion based on the number of exposures .
In fact , the authors noted that the positive vibes still appeared to be going up after 20 exposures , leading them to wonder where this effect might start leveling off .
There are apparently two models competing to explain this phenomenon .
The first proposes that people will more readily assign positive properties to something that they can remember more readily .
The second suggests that the processing of even minimal exposures can create an actual positive evaluation ( for example , the conclusion that the item is not a threat ) .
That positive affect then influences future evaluations .
To determine which of these may be at play , the authors took another pool of students and asked them to make a similar evaluation but attempt to do so without considering the familiarity of Pretec .
In that case , the positive effect vanished , suggesting that the first model was correct .
To nail this point down , the authors played music during the time the students viewed the banner ads .
When asking their feelings , they warned the students ( falsely ) that the music might create a positive impression of Pretec .
This false warning also eliminated the positive effect , suggesting that it was simply based on familiarity and not backed up by any real positive evaluation .
So , the psychologists have a better grip on their theories , and advertisers have a few things to consider .
The first is that banner ads may provide a valuable function in fostering familiarity even if those that view them never click through to the source of the ads .
The downside for advertisers is that any evaluation of the positive impressions that this familiarity creates , even one based on false premises , is enough to make those positive feelings vanish .
This suggests that familiarity - based advertising may work best for impulse buys , where more detailed evaluations are n't likely to occur .
More importantly , this gives us a glimpse into the way our unconscious works with visual stimuli .
I think I have discovered the clinching argument for closing the House of Lords .
It is the presence in that chamber of a peer called Lady Tonge of Kew .
Last week the baroness ( formerly the Liberal Democrat MP Jenny Tonge ) opened a debate about Botswana with an attack on the Gana and Gwi bushmen of the Kalahari .
She suggested they were trying to " stay in the stone age " , described their technology as " primitive " and accused them of " holding the government of Botswana to ransom " by resisting eviction from their ancestral lands .
How did she know ?
In 2002 she had spent half a day as part of a parliamentary delegation visiting one of the resettlement camps into which the bushmen have been forced .
Her guides were officials in the Botswanan government .
Lord Pearson of Rannoch , a man with whom I seldom find myself in sympathy , alleged that something was missing from her account : the trip , he claimed , including first - class air travel , was funded by Debswana .
Debswana , a joint venture between De Beers and the government of Botswana , owns the rights to mine diamonds in the bushmen 's land in the Kalahari .
" I took the precaution , " Pearson reported , " of hiring my own interpreter , so I was able to hear exactly what some of the 200 bushmen and their families who had recently been forcibly resettled in a camp at New Xade were saying .
I heard them describe it as a place of death , where they had nothing to do but drink , take drugs and catch Aids .
Many of them felt that they had been evicted because Debswana wanted their land for its diamonds ... I , for one , came home more convinced than ever that a great injustice was being done . "
He might have added that Debswana was being assisted by Hill and Knowlton , the public - relations company famous for the unsavoury nature of its clients .
It advised the Chinese government in the wake of the Tiananmen massacre , set up lobby groups for the tobacco companies and coached the girl who told the false story about Kuwaiti babies being thrown out of incubators that helped to launch the first Gulf war .
Until recently , Hill and Knowlton provided " administrative services " to the parliamentary group of which Tonge and Pearson are members .
Now this task is discharged by the Botswanan high commission , whose line on the bushmen is identical to Lady Tonge's .
Its work on this issue is coordinated by Dawn Parr , a former employee of Hill and Knowlton .
The PR company boasts on its website about how it " generated support " for Debswana among " UK parliamentarians " .
Tonge 's timing was also unfortunate : she made this speech just six weeks after Survival International launched its campaign to try to discourage people from characterising indigenous people as primitive and living in the stone age .
It has its work cut out .
Three days after Tonge gave her speech , I heard the BBC's Indonesia correspondent telling the World Service that the West Papuans ' " way of life , until recently , had more in common with the stone age than the modern world " .
He was probably not aware that John F Kennedy approved the annexation of West Papua by the Indonesian government with the words : " Those Papuans of yours are some seven hundred thousand and living in the stone age . "
Stone - aged and primitive are what you call people when you want their land .
The animal theme comes up quite often too .
" How can you have a stone - age creature continue to exist in the age of computers ? " asked the man who is now Botswana 's president , Festus Mogae .
" If the bushmen want to survive , they must change , otherwise , like the dodo , they will perish . "
The minister for local government , Margaret Nasha , was more specific .
" You know the issue of Basarwa [ the bushmen ] ? " she asked in 2002 .
" Sometimes I equate it to the elephants .
We once had the same problem when we wanted to cull the elephants and people said no . "
When speaking to an international audience , the government takes a different line .
Like Lady Tonge , it insists that the bushmen must be evicted from the central Kalahari game reserve for their own good .
" It has never been easy for government to extend social services to the sparsely populated remote rural settlements .
People have thus been encouraged to move into settlements with schools , health clinics and other training and vocational opportunities . "
" Encouraged " is an interesting word .
Ten days ago a United Nations committee noted " persistent allegations that residents were forcibly removed , through , in particular , such measures as the termination of basic and essential services inside the reserve , the dismantling of existing infrastructures , the confiscation of livestock , harassment and ill - treatment of some residents by police and wildlife officers , as well as the prohibition of hunting and restrictions on freedom of movement inside the reserve " .
People who have tried to remain in their lands have been tortured , beaten and starved .
Since 2002 the Gana and Gwi have been seeking a court order allowing them to return to their lands .
But the government , aware that eventually the bushmen 's supporters will run out of money , has been dragging out the case for as long as possible .
It has now repealed the section of the constitution to which they were appealing .
When , in the 1960s , the Innu of Canada were evicted from their lands by similar means and for similar purposes , they immediately fell prey to alcoholism , petrol - sniffing and suicide ; 50 % of the population now has diabetes ; 35 % of the Innu children in schools in Labrador have foetal alcohol syndrome .
Suicide rates are around 12 times higher than the national average .
This will be a familiar story to anyone who has witnessed the forcible relocation of indigenous people .
Though the Botswanan government refuses to keep separate statistics for the evicted Gana and Gwi , they appear to be succumbing to the same psychic and physical collapse with extraordinary speed .
Lady
Tonge later explained that she used the word primitive to mean belonging to " another age " .
But the Gana and the Gwi , like indigenous people everywhere , exist today , and what they do belongs to the present as much as anything anyone else does .
There is no scala natura of human validity that places them at the bottom and us at the top .
Faced with a different set of ecological conditions and economic constraints to ours , the bushmen trying to return to their lands see that their traditional practices and technologies - or some of them at any rate - are more likely to ensure their survival than sitting in a tin shed drinking moonshine .
They can also understand the benefits of western healthcare and education , but they want to use them if and as they choose , not as the paternalists in Botswana or the House of Lords determine .
I would like to be able to say that Lady Tonge 's characterisation of the bushmen is itself primitive , meaning it belongs to another age .
But this would not be true .
Not only are indigenous people still widely characterised as savages in order that their land can be seized ; but there is still a House of Lords in which unelected people such as Lady Tonge talk like Victorian missionaries of the need to rescue people from their darkness .
The incumbents of the House of Lords are just as much part of the modern world as the iPod and the bushman 's hunting bow .
Unlike the bushmen , however , they do seem to merit eviction .

' Anti-war ' Iraq veteran fights military over war protests Nick Juliano
Published : Friday June 1 , 2007 Print This Email
This A veteran of the Iraq war is accusing the military of trying to stifle the freedom of speech he volunteered to fight to protect .
After serving his country in Iraq , former Marine Sgt. Adam Kokesh grew disillusioned with US involvement there and became an anti-war activist .
He participated in demonstrations around Washington , including Operation First Casualty , which was organized by Iraq Veterans Against the War in March .
Kokesh 's anti-war activity and his correspondence with Marine investigators has rankled the military enough that it is working to revoke the veteran 's " honorable discharge " designation .
Kokesh will appear before a military hearing in Kansas City , Mo. , Monday to fight the military 's attempt to change his discharge status to " other than honorable . "
The voices of war veterans are the " most relevant " additions to public debate about the war , Kokesh said during a press conference in Washington Friday before leaving for Kansas City .
He called the military 's attempt at giving him a non-honorable discharge a " vindictive act and a waste of taxpayer dollars . "
Kokesh 's attorney 's call the military 's move to change his discharge status unprecedented , and he has the country 's largest veterans organization behind him in his fight to protect vets ' freedom of speech .
" These Marines went to war , did their duty , and were honorably discharged from the active roles .
I may disagree with their message , but I will always defend their right to say it , " said Gary Kurplus , who leads the 2.4 - million - member Veterans of Foreign Wars .
" Trying to hush up and punish fellow Americans for exercising the same democratic right we 're trying to instill in Iraq is not what we 're all about .
Someone in the Marine Corps needs to exercise a little common sense and put an end to this matter before it turns into a circus . "
At the press conference , Kokesh and his supporters said they were heartened by the VFW 's support , which they said shows this case is about free speech rights for all veterans , not just him .
The March demonstration involved Kokesh and other vets performing mock patrols around the nation 's capital to offer Americans a peek at what life is like in Iraq .
Kokesh wore his Marine fatigues with his name , rank and Marine Corps insignia patches removed .
The military told Kokesh that wearing the uniform violated Defense Department regulations , despite the fact that he had been honorably discharged from the service the previous year .
Kokesh is still part of the Inactive Ready Reserve , which allows for discharged troops to be called back to service in case of an emergency .
Kokesh was informed via e-mail that he may be violating regulations , and he did not take the admonishment lightly .
He responded to the officer who had sent the e-mail , advising him not to waste time on " such petty issues , ( while ) our fellow Marines continue to die in futility .... "
" So no , I am not replying to your e-mail in order to acknowledge my understanding of my obligations and responsibilities , " Kokesh wrote , " but rather to ask you to please , kindly , go fuck yourself . "
Knowing what he knows now , Kokesh said he would not change the way he responded to the officer .
" I do n't regret it at all .
Marines do n't pull punches , " Kokesh told RAW STORY following the press conference .
" They messed with the wrong veteran . "

Dear Andrew -
Many thanks for your latest essay .
I 've got too much to say , so permit me to jump right in :
You write that " we are evolutionarily programmed for faith . "
While this claim seems debatable , let 's just accept it as a given .
What can we conclude from this ?
We certainly can't conclude that any specific religious doctrine is true ( or likely to be true ) .
Nor can we say that religious faith is desirable in the 21st century , or even compatible with our long - term survival as a species .
Here is your quotation from Justin Barrett , with a few , minor edits :
" [ Viking ] theology teaches that people were crafted by [ Odin ] to [ rape and pillage ] .
Why would n't [ Odin ] , then , design us in such a way as to find [ raping and pillaging ] quite natural ?
The fact that we have a biological tendency to attribute agency to forces in nature does not suggest that it is wise ( or moral ) to nurture this disposition .
And the fact that we find it difficult to conceive of our own nonexistence does not mean that we are likely to persist in some numinous form after death .
If the history of science tells us anything , it tells us that we should n't rush to draw metaphysical conclusions from our failures of intuition .
We now know a fair amount about how bad our intuitions can be -- with respect to causality , probability , logical dependence , and a wide range of other parameters that determine our commonsense ( and erroneous ) view of the world .
Spend a little time thinking about the Monty Hall problem , and once you understand it , witness how difficult it is to explain to someone who has never thought about it before .
Even profoundly simple situations can confound us .
Even seeing what is plainly before our eyes can be difficult ( or impossible ) .
Consider the following visual illusion ( Roger Shepard 's " Turning the Tables " ) :

Zimbabwean police have cracked down on MDC activities
The activists were taken away in police vans , though the MDC's Nelson Chamisa said police had no search warrant .
Mr Chamisa told the BBC that the meeting was held in party offices to discuss civil issues and insisted the MDC was doing nothing illegal .
The arrests came a day after police extended a ban on political rallies .
' Harassment '
The BBC's Peter Greste , in South Africa , says the police cordoned off a number of blocks around Harvest House and burst into the party headquarters , beating and arresting anyone they found inside .
Mr Chamisa said those inside the building had included the MDC 's youth council and another urban council .
Mr Chamisa said those detained had been taken to the notorious Law and Order division of the Central Police Headquarters .
No senior party leaders were said to be in the building at the time .
In the past , party activists have been arrested for violating a ban on political gatherings and for allegedly planning acts of terrorism .
South Africa is currently trying to negotiate a political solution to Zimbabwe 's escalating crisis .
Diplomats say Zimbabwe is in danger of breaking into open conflict , our correspondent says .
Mr Chamisa said the police raid showed the government 's disdain for the diplomatic efforts .
About The Zfone™ Project
Zfone is a new secure VoIP phone software product and protocol which lets you make encrypted phone calls over the Internet .
It enables you to have a private conversation any time you want with anyone , anywhere - without buying a plane ticket .
The Zfone Project was founded by Phil Zimmermann , the creator of Pretty Good Privacy ( PGP ) , the most widely used email encryption software in the world .
Zfone lets you whisper
in someone 's ear from
a thousand miles away .
Zfone uses a new protocol called ZRTP , which is better than the other approaches to secure VoIP , because it achieves security without reliance on a PKI , key certification , trust models , certificate authorities , or key management complexity that bedevils the email encryption world .
It also does not rely on SIP signaling for the key management , and in fact does not rely on any servers at all .
It performs its key agreements and key management in a purely peer - to - peer manner over the RTP media stream .
It interoperates with any standard SIP phone , but naturally only encrypts the call if you are calling another ZRTP client .
This new protocol has been submitted to the IETF as a proposal for a public standard , to enable interoperability of SIP endpoints from different vendors .
Zfone is available as a universal " plugin " for a wide variety of existing VoIP clients , effectively converting them into secure phones .
It 's also available as an SDK to allow VoIP product vendors to integrate encryption into their products .
A public beta release of the Zfone software is available for download for Windows , Mac OS X , or Linux .

The guy may be the nicest human being on earth , but he is way over his head as AG and needs to go packing .
National Review Online called the testimony " disastrous " :
It has been a disastrous morning for Attorney General Alberto Gonzales at the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing .
The major problem with his testimony is that Gonzales maintains , in essence , that he does n’t know why he fired at least some of the eight dismissed U.S. attorneys .
When , under questioning by Republican Sen. Sam Brownback , Gonzales listed the reasons for each firing , it was clear that in a number of cases , he had reconstructed the reason for the dismissal after the fact .
He did n’t know why he fired them at the time , other than the action was recommended by senior Justice Department staff .
( though they spent most of today arguing about whether or not VA Tech students were pitiful wimpy cowards for not Doing Something about the gunman )
Captain Ed :
What does all of this mean ?
It means that Gonzales is toast .
One can write off Senators like Specter and Graham , but Tom Coburn is part of the conservative backbone in the Senate .
That is a clear message to the White House to start placing ads in the paper for the upcoming opening in senior management .
Even the Freepers are unhappy :
I just do n’t think Gonzales is up to this .
If I were in a court case , I would hope Gonzales were opposing counsel .
He is pathethic , if this is a representation of his legal capabilities .
He is not representing himself nor the post of Attorney General of the US very well .
The panel are using Gonzales ’s own words and positions to chew him up and spit him out .

Gonzales is obviously a boob , and I do n't like having an obvious boob in the AG spot , even setting aside this justice department 's highly questionable border prosecutions .
By the same token , these firings should be a non-issue — though the aforementioned boobness has made them and issue — and I 'm loathe to see the democrats handed a victory on it .
The Freepers were sort of half - hearted , though .
Their whole live - blog thread garnered 270 posts ( I read about half of it ) , or about 30 minutes worth of live - blogging here .
Some other leading lights of the right - wing blogosphere , such as Malkin and Instapundit , are strangely silent on the issue .
Malkin is obsessing ( still ) about rap lyrics ( re : Don Imus ) , and I 'm never sure what Reynolds is babbling about at any given time .
Of course , you can always count on Powerline to support even the most incompetent of Administration officials :
Manufacturers ’ prices do not always include delivery fees , and there can be other costs , including site preparation , foundation work and installation of electric , water and sewer services .
“ You have to go into this with open eyes , ” said Jay Shafer , owner of the Tumbleweed Tiny House Company .
“ Zoning laws , land covenants , building permits , restrictions and codes vary within states and across the country , and these impact what has to be done at the site , and how . ”

For $ 90,000 in 2004 , Scott McGlasson , 40 , owner of Woodsport , a custom furniture design studio in Minneapolis , and his wife , Lisa , a human resources coordinator , bought a 700 - square - foot weeHouse by Alchemy Architects .
It has plumbing , tall glass doors , Andersen windows , laminate flooring , recessed lighting and Ikea cabinets .
It is comfortable and attractive .
“ But people confuse prefab with inexpensive , ” Mr. McGlasson said .
“ On a middle - class budget , this was doable , but not easy . ”
They bought the land — a small lot on Lake Pequaywan in northern Minnesota — in 2002 for $ 80,000 .
It already had a septic system , a well and access to utilities .
One rectangular module serves as the main floor ; above it is an additional square module that serves as a second bedroom , which must be entered from outdoors via a ship ’s ladder .
Guests love it because it ’s separate from the rest of the house .
“ And because they can lock out our three kids , ” Mr. McGlasson said .
Still , it ’s hard to resist doing the math .
Five people sharing about 700 square feet has to present challenges — especially when three of those people are still growing .
To make the most efficient use of the space , Mr. McGlasson designed and built much of the furniture , some with birch from the surrounding forest .
He also added a free - standing sauna and a deck for outdoor living .
“ But when friends come , we ’re pretty packed in , ” he said .
The trade - off is that when the time comes to leave , they just sweep it out and go .
“ We ’re here to swim , fish , hike and cook , ” Mr. McGlasson said .
“ If we wanted all the conveniences of home , we ’d be there . ”
Living tiny , however , does not require deprivation , thanks to modern technology .
Gregory Johnson , president of the Small House Society , who lives in a 140 - square - foot house in Iowa , noted that people once needed “ a stereo system , countless LPs or CDs , photo albums and a small library of books . ”
Now , everything can take up no more space than a laptop or an iPod .
Stephanie Arado , a Minnesota Orchestra violinist , said that it took living in a tiny house to learn how little space she really needed .
For about $ 45,000 , she bought a 392 - square - foot weeHouse with no electricity and no bathroom as the solution to a siting problem on her 32 acres in western Wisconsin .
Ms. Arado , who has two children , planned to use the tiny house as a springboard to building something bigger .
But four years have passed , and she now has no intention of supersizing .
“ Something happened , ” Ms. Arado said .
“ I started to see the beauty in how it works . ”
There is a queen - size bed for her and a bunk for her two children .
When friends visit , sleeping pads and cots are pulled out .
“ The glass walls make the house feel much bigger than it is , ” she said .
“ People are surprised to hear it ’s only 14 feet wide . ”
Despite currently being America ’s most polluted city , Los Angeles is looking to become the country ’s most environmentally - friendly , according to Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa .
During the C40 Large Cities Climate Summit , being held in New York from May 14 â€ “ 17 , Villaraigosa discussed his plan to cut the city ’s emissions by 35 percent by 2030 .
As part of this plan , the L.A. mayor says he wants to change the way residents commute .
To do so , Los Angeles will offer various incentives to commuters who use mass transportation .
The plan also entails the distribution of 50,000 energy - efficient refrigerators to low - income residents .
That ’s a nice opening statement .
He puts the blame for federal inaction on climate change in the lap of the one man responsible for it .
George W. Bush .
If the president wanted , he could be using his power to create so many positive actions to halt and reverse global warming .
Clearly Bush is not up to the task .
That duty now falls to the local powers to take action .
The mayors , the city governments , you and me .
Grass roots have always been better at building lasting change anyway .
This shameful lack of leadership may actually be a blessing .
Because they ’re riding this housing armageddon all the way down …
Mortgage defaults in California near decade high
The number of mortgage default notices sent to California homeowners last quarter rose to its highest in nearly 10 years as home prices stagnated and rates on adjustable loans pushed higher , a report released on Monday said .
Mortgage lenders filed 46,760 notices of default from January through March , marking an increase of 23.1 percent from the previous quarter and 148 percent from the year - earlier period , according to a report by DataQuick Information Systems , a real estate information service .
The first quarter ’s default level was the highest for the most populous U.S. state since the second quarter of 1997 .
It came amid a sharp rise in defaults on mortgages held by subprime borrowers , or borrowers with blemished credit , across the United States .
The low introductory interest rates on the their mortgages have been expiring , replaced by much higher rates that have made monthly mortgage payments too expensive for many households to maintain .
Additionally , their options for refinancing their mortgages have been limited because home prices in many markets have been largely flat or slipping .
California has been a white - hot market for the last 5 - 6 years , and now the time has come for a correction .
I ca n’t say that I have n’t seen this coming , and in fact , a portion of it is playing out exactly like I expected .
I used to live in Irvine , which is dead smack in the middle of Orange County .
I noticed prices in Irvine skyrocketing , but what was really surprising was the prices in the Inland Empire ( Riverside & San Bernardino counties ) going up , while builders were putting homes up as quickly as they could do it .
At the time , I said that when the downturn came , places like Irvine , most of LA , San Diego , and similar towns would n’t get slammed too hard .
After all , people have been fleeing those locales to head inland where they could afford to buy , and people looking to head back to where the jobs are will move back out if prices appear to level off or decline slightly , keeping pressure up .
But for those folks inland , it ’s getting very ugly , very fast :
According to DataQuick , mortgages were least likely to go into default in Marin , San Francisco and San Mateo counties , three affluent coastal markets with a tight supply of housing that has helped prevent home prices from slipping .
The likelihood of default was highest in inland Sacramento , Riverside and San Joaquin counties , where prospective first - time home buyers rushed in during the housing boom in search of relatively affordable housing .
Squeezed from pricey coastal markets , many Californians moved to such interior areas and used adjustable - rate mortgages to purchase houses in scores of new - home developments .
They now are facing higher interest rates on their loans and rising mortgage payments while home values in those markets decline .
Now , you need to watch for the next shoe to drop .
We ’ll enter a recession later this year , as the tight credit market and the downturn in the housing / construction trades push unemployment up , coupled with light consumer spending as interest rates rise .
Irvine , particularly , will be very hard hit due to the high number of subprime lenders located there , much like Silicon Valley was hard hit in the wake of the tech implosion 5 years ago .
When that happens , the pain might spread to those nice beach communities .
It ’s unclear how heavily it will be felt , but it will be felt .
For those of you outside of California , keep your eyes open .
If you ’re in an area that ’s seen both overbuilding and quickly rising prices , this storm is headed your way .
Best get your cowboy hat ready .

They say yachting is like standing in a cold shower tearing up £ 50 notes .
Now , meet the boys who shred MILLIONS in the barmiest race of them all .
There 's no cushion on this seat .
In fact , it 's not really a seat at all .
I 'm trying to squat on a patch of carbon fibre and there is water sloshing around my feet .
Every few minutes , a violent jolt sends me flying to the floor .
There is an appalling groan from a pulley next to my head .
Apparently , it can take 18 tons of strain but it sounds as if it is about to give up the struggle .
A Nelsonian prisoner probably had a more comfortable berth than my slot on this boat .
So why are some people are prepared to pay millions of pounds just to spend an afternoon where I am sitting ?
" It 's like a drug , " says Lara Onorato , the wife of one of Italy 's richest men , Vincenzo Onorato .
He would be a good deal richer if he had not got involved in all this .
" Once you start , you can't stop , " says Lara .
" Every time it 's over , we say ' never again ' and then we do it again . "
Nothing makes much sense when it comes to the America 's Cup , the most exclusive and elusive prize in sport .
It is actually a British yachting trophy which currently belongs to a Swiss multi-billionaire who has chosen to defend it in Spain .
And 11 fellow plutocrats have been battling it out for the right to take him on .
The prize money is zero but the stakes are Olympian .
Thousands of jobs and the fortunes of an entire city depend on the ownership of this gnarled old piece of silver .
Scroll down for more ...
To understand all the rules of the America 's Cup you would need twin degrees in marine engineering and law .
But it 's really very simple .
You make a fortune , you spend a large part of it on building a 24 - metre , 24 - ton yacht plus hiring the finest sailors money can buy .
The sailors can be from any nation you like .
Only the boat needs to be from your own country .
And then you must beat all the other would - be contenders to become the solitary challenger .
Only then can you formally take on whichever billionaire happens to hold the trophy at the time .
If you succeed , you hire a squadron of lawyers and change the rules to make it as hard as possible for anyone else to pinch it .
Anyone can launch a challenge but it is the holder who decides where , when and how .
This may explain why the cup has changed hands only five times in the 156 years since it was first contested .
And it has not been contested in European waters for a century and a half - until now .
This saga goes back to 1851 when the Royal Yacht Squadron put up the 100 Guineas Cup for a race around the Isle of Wight .
It was won at the first attempt by a U.S. yacht called America whose owners took the trophy home and renamed it the America 's Cup .
It took another 132 years before Alan Bond 's Australian boat prised it from the grasp of the New York Yacht Club .
Since then , it has been snatched back by the Americans , grabbed by the New Zealanders and finally seized by the Swiss , of all people .
With no sea of their own , they have moved it to Spain and it continues to drive some of the richest men in the world to distraction .
It is impossible to calculate the combined wealth of the main players here in Valencia .
Some of them make the Duke of Westminster look like a benefits claimant .
Among those shovelling cash into the water is Patrizio Bertelli , whose boat is splattered with the name of the family business - Prada .
Flying the Swedish flag is 26 - year - old super - rich kid Hugo Stenbeck , heir to one of the largest fortunes in Europe ( his London - based sister , Cristina , was recently named as one of Britain 's richest women ) .
None of this lot , though , come close to the reclusive American computer titan Larry Ellison , founder of the Oracle software empire .
In 2000 , he was listed as the richest man in the world , although he is thought to have dropped back to number 15 .
It seems a fairly academic question as I look out to sea at what resembles one of the Balearics .
Is that Majorca ?
No .
It turns out to be Rising Sun , Mr Ellison 's 430 - foot motor yacht .
No one has seen him on dry land for weeks .
When he is not racing , he prefers to sit offshore on his personal liner rather than socialise ashore with fellow billionaires .
" I last saw Larry in New Zealand a few years ago , " says Lara Onorato .
" Sometimes , you wonder if he really exists . "
Her husband Vincenzo , 49 , charismatic owner of Italy 's Moby shipping line , certainly exists .
He is one of the most outspoken tycoons on the block .
He calls his team the " Latin Rascals " and lists his hobbies as " chocolate mousse , blondes ( especially Kim Basinger ) and old Westerns " .
" I only learned to sail because Vincenzo is so jealous that he would not leave me on the shore while he was out sailing , " says mother - of - three Lara , a former television presenter .
Vincenzo is not entirely sure how many yachts he owns .
" Maybe a dozen , " he suggests .
But even he believes that there is now far too much money in this event .
" Some of these teams have a budget of at least 100 million euros ( £ 70 million ) and it is killing the competition , " he says .
" It 's becoming too bloody expensive .
We need to limit costs and get more challengers . "
But the present holder of the America 's Cup is not sympathetic .
Ernesto Bertarelli certainly has a charmed life .
Married to Kirsty , a former Miss United Kingdom , he has just sold his biotech business for £ 7 billion - at the grand old age of 42 .
With no balance sheets to worry about any more , his main focus now is to hang on to his cup .
And he has no plans to make it a poor man 's game .
A Swiss national of Italian lineage , he won the cup from the New Zealanders in 2003 and then had to decide where he would like to defend it .
Lake Geneva was hardly the place .
So he went round Europe to find out which city would make the biggest fuss of his trophy .
It must have been like having your own Olympics and asking who would like to stage it .
In the end , Mr Bertarelli chose the Spanish city of Valencia and it has not let him down .
The locals have spent £ 500 m on a port fit for the Bertarelli party and another £ 500 m on doing up their roads and airport .
They have built a " superyacht " marina for the Midas crowd to park their floating villas , and prices start at £ 50,000 a month .
Mr Bertarelli keeps his moored next to two familiar yachts - one belongs to his mother , the other to his sister .
A canal half a mile long has been dug so that no one has to queue for an old swing bridge to open .
And the Foredeck Club , a panoramic ocean - front hospitality suite , as big as a medium - sized parliament building has gone up .
They have even built a special extra-big quay just for Mr Ellison 's boat , which is a shame as he is refusing to park it there .
In return for its investment , Valencia has enjoyed an invasion of sailors , designers and boffins who have moved entire families here from all over the world .
Any team wishing to challenge for the America 's Cup has to take part in a series of warm - up races , which started here in 2004 .
All 11 challengers - some of them employ over 100 people - have been running huge operations here for three years .
The cost is simply mind - boggling .
Some billionaires , like Ellison or Bertarelli , are competent enough to be part of the racing crew .
Others have to sit quietly at the back .
The racing rules allow for a crew of 17 plus one person who is not allowed to do anything at all and must stay out of the way at the stern .
This is where the tycoon or corporate sponsor sits on a wet floor to find out where their money has been spent .
It is the nautical equivalent of being stuck in the boot of a Formula One car .
I am determined to see what the fuss is all about .
And one of the poorest teams - with a budget of just £ 20 million - kindly agrees to take me on board for the day .
It is one of three Italian entries and is called +39 ( the international dialling code for Italy ) .
Unlike some of the other teams , this one was financed not by a billionaire but by the odd millionaire and some Italian sponsors .
Following various money crises , though , the team has had major problems with kit and supplies .
The result is that they have not won a single race in the final qualifying tournament , the Louis Vuitton Cup , to select the ultimate challenger .
None of their sponsors has shown up so there is an empty slot at the back .
I am in it .
They may lack money and a decent boat but these sailors are some of the best in the world .
A quarter of them are British .
The skipper is Ian Percy , one of our Olympic gold medallists from the 2000 Sydney Olympics .
His tactician is fellow Brit Ian Walker , a double Olympic silver medallist .
The boat also includes rising British stars Chris Brittle , from Leicester , and Andy Simpson , from Surrey .
" It 's very sad that we 've been let down but we are going to fight every last inch of the way , " says Percy , 30 .
And they give it their all .
We are up against the South Africans , whose boat and resources are far superior .
" We are better than them , guys , and you know that , " Percy tells his Italian / British / Polish / Australian / Argentinian / Czech / Croatian crew as we eat our pre-match meal .
Some teams have dieticians and specialist cooks .
The +39 team budget only extends to a tuna and tomato sandwich and a banana .
As we warm up , Percy lets me take the wheel for a few seconds .
It is utterly exhilarating .
The lightest of touches , one way or the other , causes a fierce growl in the £ 50,000 - a- piece sails .
It is impossible to tell what is happening in the turmoil around the start line but Percy times it to perfection and we set off a length or two ahead of the opposition .
For the best part of two hours , we cling on to our lead .
Our bowman leaps around at the front like a man possessed .
At one point I look up to see that he has been hauled up the mast in a sling to prod some obstinate sail into the correct shape .
There is remarkably little shouting .
These men know their jobs .
Some , like Chris Brittle , are called grinders - muscle machines who crank huge winches .
Others are trimmers , fine - tuning the line of every sail .
Each time we change course , everyone leaps to the nearest rope or winch handle and heaves with all their might .
Except me .
I just sit at the back in my puddle of water and watch , thrilled to be a footnote in this epic contest .
We finally beat the South Africans by 50 seconds .
The team are pleased rather than jubilant .
There is a spot of backslapping but no whooping .
We are still at the bottom end of the league table .
These men know they have no chance of lifting yachting 's greatest prize this time .
But they have salvaged some pride .
We return to our base , a basic warehouse .
Nearby , I drop in at the headquarters of Larry Ellison 's team , BMW Oracle .
It is like a five star hotel .
Escalators take me up to a shiny penthouse with a bar and umbrellas and a huge buffet .
The brainpower is awesome , as are the logistics of this operation .
Not only have they built their own wind tunnel but they even have a pre-race meteorologist , who stays on the boat until just before the start when he is thrown overboard to avoid pushing the crew numbers above the 17 - man maximum limit .
It is , plainly , barmy .
But do n't scoff for too long .
A serious British bid is being prepared for the next America 's Cup challenge .
It is led by Sir Keith Mills , one of those who brought the 2012 Olympics to London , and he is seeking a whopping £ 100 million of sponsorship .
If he wins the cup , this circus will be coming to a port somewhere in Britain .
Sadly , though , it is unlikely to be staged in its original home of Cowes .
First , there are not nearly enough five - star hotels in the little Solent town ( in fact , there are n't any ) .
And second , where on earth would Larry Ellison find enough space to park his private kingdom ?
Op - Ed : Republican candidates , base support ' un - American ' policies RAW STORY
Published : Friday May 18 , 2007 Print This Email This New York Times columnist Paul Krugman says the leading Republican presidential candidates would run the country just as President Bush has , pursuing policies in conflict with the rule of law and the rigors of logic , including torturing terror suspects and conflating disparate threats facing Amercia .
" The principles Bush has betrayed are principles today 's GOP , dominated by movement conservatives , no longer honors , " Krugman writes in today 's column .
" In fact , rank - and - file Republicans continue to approve strongly of Bush 's policies -- and the more un -American the policy , the more they support it . "
Krugman cited the enthusiastic response from the crowd at Tuesday 's Republican debate when Rudy Giuliani endorsed waterboarding suspected terrorists and Mitt Romney called for doubling Guantanamo as evidence of the mood within the GOP base .
He also said Romeny , the former Massachusetts Governor , was repeating Bush 's distortions in treating " mutually hostile groups as if they constituted a single enemy . "
Just as Bush worked to convince Americans that Saddam Hussein and al - Qaida were acting in concert , Romney referred to a " global jihadist effot " in which " Shia and Sunni and Hezbollah and Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood and al - Qaida " are joining forces against the US .
" Are n't Sunnies and Shiites killing each other , not coming together ? "
Krugman asked in reference to what many consider a burgeoning civil war in Iraq .
" Nevermind . "
Krugman said the nomination will go to someone who will continue the Bush legacy , " or to a very , very good liar . "
Excerpts from Krugman 's column : # Finally , what about the Bush administration 's trademark incompetence ?
In appointing unqualified loyalists to key positions , Bush was just following the advice of the Heritage Foundation , which urged him back in 2001 to " make appointment decisions based on loyalty first and expertise second . "
And the base does n't mind : The Bernie Kerik affair -- Giuliani's attempt to get his corrupt , possibly mob-connected business partner appointed to head the department of homeland security -- has n't kept Giuliani from becoming the apparent front - runner for the Republican nomination .
What we need to realize is that the infamous " Bush bubble , " the administration 's no-reality zone , extends a long way beyond the White House .
Millions of Americans believe that patriotic torturers are keeping us safe , that there 's a vast Islamic axis of evil , that victory in Iraq is just around the corner , that Bush appointees are doing a heckuva job -- and that news reports contradicting these beliefs reflect liberal media bias .
And the Republican nomination will go either to someone who shares these beliefs , and would therefore run the country the same way Bush has , or to a very , very good liar .

Romancing the snow
IN 1999 , Washington launched " Plan Colombia , " with the promise that the anti-drug program would halve Colombian cocaine production .
The law of unintended consequences rules in this drug war .
Plan Colombia has not delivered .
U.S. crop dusters have sprayed an area the size of Delaware and Rhode Island .
U.S. taxpayers have forked over some $ 4.7 billion .
Yet cocaine is abundant and cheap on the streets of America .
As Ken Dermota wrote in the July / August issue of the Atlantic , the price of a gram of cocaine in Los Angeles fell from $ 50 to $ 100 per gram in 1999 to $ 30 - $ 50 in 2005 .
Prices are down in New York , Seattle and Atlanta .
White House Drug Czar John Walters recently admitted that street cocaine prices fell by 11 percent from February 2005 to October 2006 .
Demand is n't the issue .
Demand remains steady .
Supply is the issue : Growers produce far more cocaine than the world consumes .
Despite Plan Colombia , Colombian cocaine farming grew 9 percent in 2006 , the Los Angeles Times reported , the third straight year with an increase .
Peru produced an estimated 165 tons of cocaine in 2005 , Bolivia another 70 tons , according to The Atlantic .
It 's almost as if America is spending billions to eradicate weeds -- the coca just comes back , bigger and more abundant than before .
Congressional Democrats are considering decreasing the program 's annual $ 700 - million budget by 10 percent .
But why only 10 percent ?
John Jay College criminal justice professor Richard Curtis said of the program , " I think it 's a tremendous waste of taxpayer money ; money down a rat hole . "
Why are n't all those billions and all those pesticides paying off ?
" Why ? " Colombian Vice President Francisco Santos answered during an editorial board meeting with The Chronicle Monday .
" We do n't know . "
And : " We do n't have the answer . "
From Santos ' perspective , Plan Colombia is a " real success story . "
Santos credits the program with helping to cut his country 's homicide rate nearly in half .
Kidnappings are down even more -- a personal issue for Santos , whom cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar kidnapped in 1990 .
Go after Plan Colombia , Santos warned , and , " You might be making a huge mistake in making the problem worse . "
" How would it be worse ? " Curtis wondered .
" There would be more cocaine ?
Would the price go down to $ 25 rather than ( the New York going rate of ) $ 35 a gram ?
You can argue that 's worse , but $ 35 a gram is pretty cheap already .
Would they be giving it away ?
I think we could get a lot more bang for our buck . "
The New York Times reported last year that anti-drug planes have to fumigate three times as much land as they did in 2002 to kill the same amount of coca .
And for what ?
An endgame that produces more cocaine than the world wants -- and at cheaper prices ?
Bill Piper of the Drug Policy Alliance observed , " This is what 's been going on for 30 years .
They say we need a little bit more money and then we 'll solve this . "
Maybe it makes some Americans feel good to target Colombian cocaine , but it 's not working .
After burning $ 4.7 billion , cocaine is plentiful and cheap in America .
If there is a way to fight this front in the drug war , Plan Colombia is not the ticket .
" Imagine Colombia as a failed state , " Santos argued .
South America would tilt further left .
Migrants would move further north .
But that argument has nothing to do with the War on Drugs in America .
It is an economic argument with national security overtones -- or a national security argument with economic overtones .
It argues for aid to Colombia , not a failed drug policy that does not serve American families .
" Can you tell me any other product that has gone down in price in the last few years ? "
Curtis asked -- and you can't include technological products that change .
Think milk or bread or beef .
Those consumer prices are not falling .
It takes a Washington - born government program -- designed to drive up the price of cocaine -- to drive down the cost of cocaine .
The one thing drug warriors never demand of an American anti-drug program is that it actually work .
Activists clashed with police for a second night in Copenhagen
The street protests
Officers in riot gear used tear gas to disperse demonstrators , as cars were set alight and petrol bombs thrown .
The clashes have centred on the Youth House ( Ungdomshuset ) building in the Noerrebro district of Copenhagen .
Left - wing activists have occupied the building since 1982 but it was sold by the city in 2000 to a Christian group .
The group , called Faderhuset , obtained a court eviction order - but the activists vowed not to leave , saying the council had no right to sell the building while it was still in use .
' Dramatic evening '
Hundreds of police officers were deployed in Copenhagen 's Noerrebro district and the enclave of Christiana on Friday in an attempt to prevent renewed violence .
Police spokesman Flemming Steen Munch said at least 100 people had been arrested in the Noerrebro and Christianshavn districts .
" It has been a dramatic evening , " he said , quoted by the Associated Press news agency .
He warned that further violence could flare up over the weekend , when two authorised demonstrations are due to take place .
Extra police have been drafted into the capital .
Jan , a spokesman for the youth centre , told Reuters news agency that activists planned to disrupt traffic .
He said : " The struggle will continue for a long time .
As long as there is no Youth House in Copenhagen , there will be a fight to get one . "
' War zone '
Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen has condemned the rioters .
Protesters set fire to makeshift barricades on Thursday
Thursday 's operation to evict the squatters resulted in some 217 arrests , injuries to 25 people and scenes described by the Danish media as a " war zone " .
Police in riot gear blocked the streets as an anti-terror squad dropped from helicopters onto the building 's roof in a dawn raid .
Youths then gathered behind protest lines , yelling at police and throwing missiles .
Among those arrested were foreigners from France , Germany , Norway , Poland , Lithuania , New Zealand and the US .
There were further protests by sympathisers of the activists outside Danish diplomatic missions in Germany , Sweden , Norway and Austria .
Last December , a protest in Copenhagen against the eviction plans turned violent , and more than 300 people were arrested .

A lot of verbal arrows have been loosed around here about the candidacy of Ron Paul .
Some people think he ’s the greatest thing since sliced bread Patrick Henry .
Others worry he ’s not “ libertarian enough ” , or point out his anti-immigration stances as if that may be a reason to disqualify him from receiving our votes .
In fact , Ron Paul has become a bit of an blogosphere superhero , winning straw polls and igniting excitement that far outstrips even what Howard Dean had .
While Dean was a firebrand who could change the pulse of a crowd , he did n’t have a quarter of the experience in government or the intellectual and ideological heft that Ron Paul carries .
But the question is , does Ron Paul have a chance of getting the nomination ?
If he does , does he have a chance of beating the Democrat candidate he ’ll be facing ?
And , as libertarians , what should we do to reconcile his anti-immigration policies with his normally consistent pro-freedom policies ?
Well , the prognosticators have weighed in , and as usual , left a situation clear as mud .
Some say Paul has a chance to be a dark horse candidate amongst the big heavies , and will only gain as their records and baggage weigh against their personalities and name recognition .
Others say Paul might make for a good sideshow , bringing topics that big - government Republicans do n’t want to address into the debates .
He ’ll drag the whole field back towards libertarian ideals ; but those prognosticators do n’t think he ’ll manage to get the nomination .
If he does manage to get the nomination , some folks think he ’ll pull huge groups of Democrats over to him for his stances on the Iraq war ( particularly if he ’s against Hillary ) and the War on ( Some ) Drugs .
Others worry that his small - government policies scaring off those same Democrats , and that he may hemorrhage votes from Republicans with his policies on the Iraq War and the War on ( Some ) Drugs .
That ’s even leaving out the whole issue of age .
In essence , the prognosticators can’t tell us whether he ’ll win the nomination , and if he wins the nomination , whether he ’d have a chance at winning the presidency .
Considering that a guy like Giuliani polls well against the big Democrats , and is largely loved ( despite his personal life ) by Republicans , would it be smarter to like Ron Paul on a personal level but put our weight behind Giuliani or another politician who can win , and who will at least be better for liberty and low taxes than a President Obama , Clinton , or Edwards ?
Personally , I say no .
I ’m going to support Ron Paul for as long as he ’s in the field .
I have my concerns about a few of his positions , but he is far and away better than any other Republican or Democrat currently under discussion .
Most candidates will force us to hold our noses simply to keep from retching if we vote for them ; Ron Paul ’s odorous positions are like mild B.O. in comparison .
If he ’s running when the primaries come to my state , I ’ll vote for Paul .
If he manages to secure the nomination , I ’ll vote for him in the general election .
And I ’m not doing so simply to vote for the “ best ” Republican over other Republicans , because I will likely vote Libertarian if Ron Paul is out of the race .
I ’d rather vote for Ron Paul , a 95 % libertarian running as a Republican , than vote for a 100 % Libertarian Party candidate who does n’t have a chance of even being invited to the debates .
But , alas , reality must set in eventually .
The polls currently have Ron Paul as a 1 % candidate .
He ’s up against a behemoth in Giuliani , and the only “ major ” candidate I see him pulling support from would be Gingrich ; if Gingrich does n’t run or is marginalized early .
Giuliani and McCain , who currently hold 65 % of the poll votes , are not known for being small - government civil libertarians , so if one of them starts to really knock off the other , that candidate will take the nomination with ease .
Of course , polls are ridiculously inaccurate in a lot of cases .
So I decided to check out Intrade , a prediction market .
I tend to trust what people will put their money behind more than I would trust what they “ say ” they support .
So if Paul was pulling 2 - 3 % in the prediction market , a point or two ahead of his actual poll result , I would think that folks may be putting stock in the idea that he ’ll do much better once his name recognition grows .
However , Intrade has him at 0.2 % , not even 1 % .
When someone is polling higher than the prediction market , one gets the impression that he might be a slight “ fan favorite ” , but that everyone knows he does n’t have a shot .
This is trailing Huckabee , Brownback , and Hagel .
This even trails Condeleeza Rice by a point , who is almost a lock NOT to run .
The numbers may change , of course .
It ’s possible that Ron Paul ’s internet success will catapult his name and his policies into the spotlight , and Americans will magically lose their tendency to worry more about what their neighbors are doing than what is happening in their own families .
Should that happen , I ’ll be one of the first cheerleaders .
But I ’m not confident enough to put my money where my mouth is .
The conservative pundits are now referring to Ron Paul as a " crackpot . "
Hannity predictably savaged him last night ( see above ) .
The Hewitt site has an image of a man in a tin-foil hat ; Dean Barnett and Hugh Hewitt both call for removing Paul from the debates , when he has been the best thing about them so far .
Bill Benett wants him out .
I 'm getting the usual ridicule for taking him seriously from the usual GOP apparatchiks .
They 're scared , are n't they ?
The Internet polls show real support for him .
Fox News ' own internet poll placed him a close second , with 25 percent of the votes from Fox News viewers .
We have a real phenomenon here - because someone has to stand up for what conservatism once stood for .
Whether you agree with him or not ( and I know few outside doctrinaire libertarians who agree with everything he says ) , he has already elevated the debates by injecting into them a legitimate , if now suppressed , strain of conservatism that is actually deeper in this country than the neoconservative aggression that now captures the party elite and has trapped the US in the Iraq nightmare .
Last night , Fox News tried to destroy him .
Today the right - wing blogs will .
My view is that the Beltway has this wrong again , as Byron York is finding out .
Paul is saying things many Americans and many Republicans believe .
On the war and spending , he is venting a vital part of conservative opinion - and , in my view , the conservative critique of this war and these Republicans is more damning than any liberal one .
I may not agree with him on everything and he is far from a smooth operator .
But he has more balls than most of them put together .
Check this video montage from the first debate and this exchange from the second .

I have rated a number of schools and I reckon the best place is the Dante Alighieri school in Mondavio .
There are a couple of other great places that I have checked out :
http://www.my-italy-piedmont-marche-and-more.com/l...
You need to be careful though as I first studied Italian in Florence and learnt nothing - huge classes and in a city where everyone spoke English .
In Mondavio virtually no one speaks English so you are forced to speak Italian and the school is fantastic .
It will definitely remain forever with you as an experience of a lifetime .

WASHINGTON , May 7 — A committee of World Bank directors has formally notified Paul D. Wolfowitz that they found him to be guilty of a conflict of interest in arranging for a pay raise and promotion for Shaha Ali Riza , his companion , in 2005 .
The findings stepped up the pressure on Mr. Wolfowitz to resign .
The contents of the panel ’s findings were not made public .
People who are familiar with the panel ’s report said that it reviewed extensive documents and testimony before concluding that Mr. Wolfowitz breached his obligations in arranging for Ms. Riza ’s reassignment from the bank to the State Department .
The report , as transmitted to Mr. Wolfowitz , did not recommend a punishment for Mr. Wolfowitz .
Bank officials , speaking anonymously because the proceedings are supposed to be confidential , said that the special committee was still working today on what to recommend .
It was not clear whether the committee , consisting of 7 of the bank ’s 24 board members , would remove Mr. Wolfowitz from his post or , more likely , express a loss of confidence in his leadership in a manner that might persuade him to resign .
Bank officials say that a majority of the bank board has concluded that he should go .
The secret of the gecko's climbing prowess was recently discovered
The plastic , known as Synthetic Gecko , has been developed by researchers at aerospace and defence firm BAE Systems .
Like the reptile 's foot , the reusable polymer is covered in millions of tiny mushroom - like hairs that provide grip .
Future applications could include an adhesive to repair aircraft , skin grafts or even a Spiderman - style suit .
" It would mean that your local window cleaner could dispense with his ladders and climb up the side of your house , " says Dr Sajad Haq , a principal research scientist at the company 's Advanced Technology Centre in Filton , Bristol .
" There 's a whole host of applications .
It 's just a question of your imagination . "
Tiny forces
Synthetic Gecko is not the first material to draw inspiration from the cold - blooded creatures .
In 2003 , a team from the University of Manchester created a sticky tape based on a gecko's foot .
Synthetic Gecko is composed of millions of mushroom - shaped hairs
The invention followed the discovery by US scientists of how geckos perform their extraordinary climbing feats .
The University of California team showed that the adhesion was due to very weak intermolecular forces produced by the billions of hair - like structures , known as setae , on each gecko foot .
The so called van der Waals forces arise when unbalanced electrical charges around molecules attract one another .
The cumulative attractive force of billions of setae allows geckos to scurry up walls and even hang upside down on polished glass .
The grip is only released when the animal peels its foot off the surface .
The material we have made so far will hold a family car to a roof , or an elephant if you wish
Dr Sajad Haq
The BAE team have created a material that mimics the gecko's setae .
The adhesive is made of a polyamide , like Nylon , and is covered with millions of mushroom - shaped stalks .
Stronger glues are available but unlike conventional adhesives Synthetic Gecko is reusable and does not leave any residues .
The material also does not feel sticky .
" It 's only when you press the material to the substrate that it actually sticks , " says Dr Haq .
" It 's the molecular interaction that causes it to stick . "
Optimal ' stickiness '
It is manufactured by a modified version of a technique known as photo - lithography , commonly used to make silicon chips .
The new material can stick to almost any surface
The technique uses light to etch three - dimensional patterns into a material .
" The processes we use are modifications of standard electronic fabrication processes , " says Dr Haq .
" They 're cheap , well known , well understood and can be scaled up to very large areas cheaply . "
Previous attempts at making " gecko materials " relied on more intricate techniques such as electron - beam lithography , which is expensive and difficult to scale - up to produce vast quantities of the material .
So far , the team have manufactured several different materials with different sized mushrooms to try to optimise its " stickiness " .
They have produced several samples up to 100 mm in diameter which stick to almost any surface , including those covered in dirt .
However the team cannot quite match the performance of the nimble footed reptile .
" The material we have made so far will hold a family car to a roof , or an elephant if you wish " says Dr Haq .
" We 're not quite at the level of mimicking the sticking power of the gecko . "
Which has more leverage in the marketplace  A ) disclosure or B ) secrecy ?
Which is more supportive of growing markets  A ) public infrastructure or B ) private platforms ?
Which is better for inventive entrepreneurs 
A ) sharing one 's great ideas to drive development and adoption , or B ) patenting and keeping secret one 's " intellectual property " ?
I 'm sure most Linux Journal readers would answer " A " to each of those questions , plus other questions like them .
Yet I suspect that most venture capitalists would rather fund the " B " choices .
VCs may talk about loving open source and free markets and opening code to spread adoption and derive first mover advantages ; but in far too many cases they still do n't understand the leverage to be found in disclosure , in building public infrastructure , in growing development communities that exceed the dimensions of the paid coding team .
Or course , the entrepreneurs follow the money .
" What 's your lock - in " , the VCs ask , and the entrepreneurs come up with an answer .
Or they wo n't get funded .
And the cycle continues .
I bring this up because right now I 'm engaged in an email dialog with an entrepreneur who is in exactly this trap .
On the one hand , he has an Idea That Will Change The World .
He has n't told me what it is yet ( I can already hear the NDA papers rustling ) , but he says it 's in alignment with values I 've espoused for years .
On the other hand he 's telling me , without irony , that he 's working with patent attorneys and thinking about how to protect his intellectual property .
So I 'm taking a break from the back - and - forth , to practice what I 've been preaching .
Here are ten ideas I have about Ideas .
I think they 're good ideas , of course ; but I also think they can be improved .
In faith that others will improve or replace them , here they are :
Ideas are n't physical .
Regardless of the legalities , treating ideas as possessions insults their vast combustive power .
Jefferson put it best :
The moment [ an idea ] is divulged , it forces itself into the possession of everyone , and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it .
He who receives an idea from me , receives instruction himself without lessening mine ; as he who lights his taper at mine , receives light without darkening me .
Ideas are n't worth jack unless other people can put them to use .
Ideas wo n't change the world unless others can improve on them .
Ideas grow by participation , not isolation .
Ideas change as they grow .
Their core remains the same , but their scope enlarges with successful use .
Ideas have unexpected results .
No one person can begin to imagine all the results of a good idea .
That 's another reason to welcome participation .
Nobody 's going to " steal " your ideas , any more than they can steal your cerebrum .
You 're the source .
Authority over the idea begins with you .
Authority derives from originality and respect .
You can't get respect for your original ideas unless those ideas prove useful to others .
There are two reasons other people are going to " steal " your ideas .
First , the only people qualified to steal your ideas are too busy trying to get their own ideas to work .
Second , they already do n't like your idea because it 's not their idea .
( But if your idea gets traction , maybe then they 'll start to respect it . )
In the software world , patents are hand - held nuclear weapons .
They may have some deterrent or " defensive " purposes , but they tend to hurt those who use them at least as much as they hurt others .
Where would Linux be if Linus Tovalds decided to make it a proprietary OS ?
Where would RSS , blogging , podcasting or outlining be today if Dave Winer had locked his ideas behind patents ?
On the patent issue , two source documents might prove useful .
The first is John Perry Barlow 's The Economy of Ideas .
One excerpt :
Since we do n't have a solution to what is a profoundly new kind of challenge , and are apparently unable to delay the galloping digitization of everything not obstinately physical , we are sailing into the future on a sinking ship .
This vessel , the accumulated canon of copyright and patent law , was developed to convey forms and methods of expression entirely different from the vaporous cargo it is now being asked to carry .
It is leaking as much from within as from without .
Legal efforts to keep the old boat floating are taking three forms : a frenzy of deck chair rearrangement , stern warnings to the passengers that if she goes down , they will face harsh criminal penalties , and serene , glassy - eyed denial .
Intellectual property law cannot be patched , retrofitted , or expanded to contain digitized expression any more than real estate law might be revised to cover the allocation of broadcasting spectrum ( which , in fact , rather resembles what is being attempted here ) .
We will need to develop an entirely new set of methods as befits this entirely new set of circumstances .
Most of the people who actually create soft property - the programmers , hackers , and Net surfers - already know this .
Unfortunately , neither the companies they work for nor the lawyers these companies hire have enough direct experience with nonmaterial goods to understand why they are so problematic .
They are proceeding as though the old laws can somehow be made to work , either by grotesque expansion or by force .
They are wrong .
That was published in March 1994 : more than twelve years ago .
Yet it remains depressingly relevant today .
The second is Patent Absurdities , which I wrote for Linux Journal seven years ago .
An excerpt :
The great irony here is that this utopia [ the Net ] was not built like an empire , or by people who were , in Walt Whit man 's words , ``consumed with the mania of owning things ' ' .
It was built like an Amish barn by hackers who made it because they needed it , and it sure was n't going to come from the old software industry .
The result was a second world  one made with code rather than matter  that embodied and expressed the long - overlooked virtues of the first :
No one owns it .
Everyone can use it .
Anyone can improve it .
These principles are so basic , they undermine all efforts to deny them .
The gears of the old patent system can't get a purchase on this new world , even though the Supreme Court decided in 1998 that software and ``business methods '' were patentable .
It has been amazing to watch the patent stampede that followed this wacky decision .
Thousands of patents were filed to stake out claims in empty space .
Now that the first of these patents are getting approved , we 're starting to see lawsuits .
The Amazon and Priceline suits are only the most familiar ones .
There will be many more .
There will also be much garment - rending and teeth - gnashing over the ``threats '' these patents and lawsuits pose to our new ``World of Code ' ' .
These new patents are patently outrageous , but they are also futile .
Nature will take care of business .
Markets are conversations .
You have to talk with them .
If you try to command and control them the old - fashioned way , they 'll get bored and move on .
The rules of Darwin still apply : if you want to evolve , you have to adapt or else you die .
Approaching markets with proprietary intentions  to " own " them , or parts of them  is a fatal mistake .
Better to look for how your ideas can make markets .
If you do that , you 'll get credit for your ideas .
And that credit will sell far more of your goods and services than anything you file with the Patent Office .

listPrimes :: Integer -> [ Integer ] -> Integer -> [ Integer ] list Primes n knownPrimes m | m > n = knownPrimes | not ( any ( == 0 ) ( map ( m `mod` ) known Primes ) ) = list Primes n ( m:knownPrimes ) ( m+2 ) | otherwise = list Primes n known Primes ( m+2 )
This generates all primes less than the number n , starting at the number m , and using the initial list of primes given in the " knownPrimes " list .
m is assumed to be odd and greater than 2 , and only odd numbers less than n are checked for primality .
The full list of generated primes is returned .
For example , list Primes 100 [ 2 ] 3 gives [ 97,89,83,79,73,71,67,61,59,53,47,43,41,3 7,31,29,23,19,17,13,11,7,5,3,2 ] .
( 1 is not on the list , because we 're assuming that you already know that every number is evenly divisible by one . )
The ( map ( m `mod` ) knownPrimes ) ) bit is probably a little baffling to anyone without experience in a functional language .
map is one of those things that is very common in the functional paradigm , but imperative programmers have rarely seen anything similiar .
In functional languages , functions are first - class objects , which means you can use them in many of the same ways you use data values .
In particular , you can create a temporary function , and pass it into a subroutine , just like you would with an int or pointer .
The subroutine can then use the passed in function however it wants .
( If you 've ever used C's qsort ( ) , you may have seen this in action . ) map makes extensive use of the ability to pass in a function as a parameter to a function .
Map takes two parameters : a function , and a list .
It applies the function to each item in the list , thus computing a new value for each item .
Then the new values are put into a list and returned .
So in imperative syntax , what it 's saying is : " for each item on the known Primes list , compute m mod list item , and return me a list of resulting values . "
Now , you may ask , how does this help us ?
Well , the whole idea behind the Seive of Erastosthenes is that a number M is prime if and only if it is NOT evenly divisible by any prime number smaller than sqrt ( M ) .
So , if M mod ( any item in known Primes ) == 0 , then M is evenly divisible by one of the primes on the list , and therefore M is not prime .
And finally , the ( any ( == 0 ) ) thing is similiar in concept to map .
It uses the given function ( " equals 0 " ) , upon each item in the list ( each one an " M mod known Prime " value ) and sees if any of the values on the list are 0 .
If so , the number is NOT prime .
So in order to see if the number IS prime , we need to not the value of the any " M mod known Prime " == 0 computation .
If the number M is prime , we add it to our list of primes with the " newNum : previousList " syntax , and go on the the next M. Otherwise , we just go on to the next M without adding anything to the list of known Primes .
The Sieve of Erastosthenes is supposed to be a very efficient way to generate prime numbers , as prime number generation algorithms go .
So I was surprised at how slow it was when I tested the new code .
You may remember that after a few elementary optimizations , the old , naive , " check possible prime against every odd number < sqrt( possible prime ) " code ran pretty quickly on numbers less than 15 digits .
The new code - which in theory is much smarter for generating all primes less than sqrt( possible prime ) , and then testing the possible prime only against those - is actually about an order of magnitude slower .
And I suppose that 's not too surprising , if you think about it .
" Check every number < sqrt ( n ) " has roughly a O ( sqrt ( n ) ) runtime .
But generating the entire list of primes less than sqrt(n ) with the Sieve of Erastosthenes means that we have to check every odd number from 3 to sqrt ( n ) against ln(n ) items that are already on the prime list .
So it turns out to be about O ( sqrt ( n ) * ln(n ) ) runtime , and with much larger constant factors on every computation due to running down the list , cons'ing a new item onto the list occasionally , and so on .
Here are the actual performance tests :
62615533 - 7 secs confirm non-prime .
( Previously - before my finger came off the enter key )
15485863 - 2 secs confirm prime .
( Previously - before my finger came off the enter key )
101364623 - 7 secs confirm non-prime .
( Not previously tested . )
275604541 - 16 secs confirm prime .
( Previously - maybe 200 ms . )
6092426891 - 5 mins confirm non-prime .

5915587277 - 7 mins confirm prime .

10967535067 - 10 mins confirm non-prime .
( Previously - 4 seconds . )
10113352331 - 9 mins confirm prime .
( Not previously tested . )
All in all , very interesting results .
Also , I 'd like to say thanks to all the smart folks over at irc.freenode.net
After my last adventure in prime testing , I decided that I should implement the Sieve of Erastosthenes and give that a whirl .
There 's full code at the Haskell pastebin if you 're morbidly curious .
But most of it is the Newton - Rapheson approximate square root routines .
The entire Sieve of Erastosthenes function is only 5 lines long :
This generates all primes less than the number n , starting at the number m , and using the initial list of primes given in the " knownPrimes " list .
m is assumed to be odd and greater than 2 , and only odd numbers less than n are checked for primality .
The full list of generated primes is returned .

You might want to check the primes benchmark , http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/code/nobench/spectral/primes/
for some ideas for other sieves .

Thanks , I 'll check that out .
Be interesting to see how other people have done it .
I suspect , however , that I 'm done with prime testing ... about time I started playing with monads and IO .

I was sceptical that you had somehow unearthed a flaw in one of the most ancient algorithms so I did some poking around and found this [ 1 ] paper on how people who think that they are implementing the Sieve in Haskell typically are not .
I typed in the algorithm from the paper and got the speedup I expected .

Excellent link , thanks !
As soon as I 'm done moving ( probably monday ) I 'll go back and make the changes .
Still not sure if I need to make a list with all the numbers 4 - sqrt (n ) and then sieve it or what , but the paper will probably tell me ...

You can probably gain a bit of time by not calculating the square root .
I imagine your condition looks something like
filter (< ( sqrt x ) ) [ 1.. ]
or so , but you could use something like this instead :
filter ( \y -> y * y < x ) [ 1 .. ]
That way , you 're doing one fast operation -- multiplication -- instead of a square root approximation .
Saves some on the code , too .

I only calculate the sqrt once per invocation of is Prime , and The Newton - Rapheson approximate sqrt I coded up is extremely light weight .
approximateSqrt only runs for numDigits N `div` 2 iterations , and each iter is only three ops : an Integer div , an Integer add , and an Integer div by 2 ( which I assume GHCI is optimizing to a shift ) .
So , on a 15 digit prime , I 'm doing something on the order of 7 * 3 integer ops to get my estimated sqrt .
And no , I 'm not using sqrt in a filter anywhere .
In fact , my code does n't even use filter .
Someone told me that I could potentially break out of a list traversal way early if I used not .
any instead of filter .
So that 's exactly what I did .

Lazing on a hammock is a great way to relax , but what if you hung it over a freeway overpass ?
That ’s exactly what this person did , and in many other extreme places .
by
In July — when The New Yorker ran a long and relatively positive piece about Wikipedia — I argued that the old - media method of laboriously checking each fact was superior to the wiki model , where assertions have to be judged based on their plausibility .
I claimed that personal experience as a journalist gave me special insight into such matters , and concluded : “ the expensive , arguably old fashioned approach of The New Yorker and other magazines still delivers a level of quality I have n’t found , and do not expect to find , in the world of community - created content . ”
Apparently , I was wrong .
It turns out that EssJay , one of the Wikipedia users described in The New Yorker article , is not the “ tenured professor of religion at a private university ” that he claimed he was , and that The New Yorker reported him to be .
He ’s actually a 24 - year - old , sans doctorate , named Ryan Jordan .
Jimmy Wales , who is as close to being in charge of Wikipedia as anybody is , has had an intricate progression of thought on the matter , ably chronicled by Seth Finklestein .
His ultimate reaction ( or at any rate , his current public stance as of this writing ) is on his personal page in Wikipedia
I only learned this morning that EssJay used his false credentials in content disputes …
I understood this to be primarily the matter of a pseudonymous identity ( something very mild and completely understandable given the personal dangers possible on the Internet ) and not a matter of violation of people ’s trust .
As Seth points out , this is an odd reaction since it seems simultaneously to forgive EssJay for lying to The New Yorker ( “ something very mild ” ) and to hold him much more strongly to account for lying to other Wikipedia users .
One could argue that lying to The New Yorker — and by extension to its hundreds of thousands of subscribers — was in the aggregate much worse than lying to the Wikipedians .
One could also argue that Mr. Jordan ’s appeal to institutional authority , which was as successful as it was dishonest , raises profound questions about the Wikipedia model .
But I wo n’t make either of those arguments .
Instead , I ’ll return to the issue that has me putting my foot in my mouth :
How can a reader decide what to trust ?
I predicted you could trust The New Yorker , and as it turns out , you could n’t .
Philip Tetlock , a long - time student of the human penchant for making predictions , has found ( in a book whose text I ca n’t link to , but which I encourage you to read ) that people whose predictions are falsified typically react by making excuses .
They typically claim that they are off the hook because the conditions based on which they predicted a certain result were actually not as they seemed at the time of the inaccurate prediction .
This defense is available to me :
The New Yorker fell short of its own standards , and took EssJay at his word without verifying his identity or even learning his name .
He had , as all con men do , a plausible - sounding story , related in this case to a putative fear of professional retribution that in hindsight sits rather uneasily with his claim that he had tenure .
If the magazine had n’t broken its own rules , this would n’t have gotten into print .
But that response would be too facile , as Tetlock rightly observes of the general case .
Granted that perfect fact checking makes for a trustworthy story ; how do you know when the fact checking is perfect and when it is not ?
You do n’t .
More generally , predictions are only as good as someone ’s ability to figure out whether or not the conditions are right to trigger the predicted outcome .
So what about this case :
On the one hand , incidents like this are rare and tend to lead the fact checkers to redouble their meticulousness .
On the other , the fact claims in a story that are hardest to check are often for the same reason the likeliest ones to be false .
Should you trust the sometimes - imperfect fact checking that actually goes on ?
My answer is yes .
In the wake of this episode The New Yorker looks very bad ( and Wikipedia only moderately so ) because people regard an error in The New Yorker to be exceptional in a way the exact same error in Wikipedia is not .
This expectations gap tells me that The New Yorker , warts and all , still gives people something they cannot find at Wikipedia : a greater , though conspicuously not total , degree of confidence in what they read .
Desperate to obtain their U.S. passports , world travelers have been flying to Seattle , where the passport office is considered one of the nation ’s most efficient .
But even there , more than 110,000 backlogged applications are piled in closets , the supervisor ’s office and the break room .
Many wo n’t be touched for months .
Half of the staff is trying to help the crowds jamming the lobby and spilling out the door .
How did it get this bad ?
Federal officials in Washington acknowledge that they failed to anticipate just how much the post - Sept. 11 travel regulations would fuel demand for passports ; did not hire enough workers to handle the increase ; and neglected to notice or react to signs early this spring of a burgeoning problem .

The State Department estimates that the number of Americans seeking passports this year will reach 17.5 million , up from 12 million in 2005 -- the result of new rules requiring such documentation for air travelers returning from Mexico , Canada , Bermuda and the Caribbean .
Applicants ’ average wait time has swelled from six weeks to 12 weeks or more .
For nearly two years , federal officials knew the revised rules were coming , along with a crush of applications .
And Tuesday , during a packed subcommittee hearing on the passport backlog , senators assailed Maura Harty , assistant secretary of State for consular affairs .
“ We want to know who is accountable , why this mess happened , ” said Sen. Bill Nelson ( D - Fla. ) , the panel ’s chairman , who spent Monday with irate travelers in Tampa .
Acknowledging the department ’s miscalculation , Harty said that employees had been swamped by “ a record - setting demand in a compressed period of time . ”

Some officials , however , have described the delays as a reasonable price to pay for added national security .
“ Yes , there may be some delays involved and some personal inconvenience , but this effort is a righteous effort , and it will make our country more secure , ” Russ Knocke , chief spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security , said last week .
But unsuspecting travelers like Brenda Newport of North Canton , Ohio , found the stress nearly too much to bear .
Newport , after learning she had breast cancer , had been planning a dream trip with her sister to Scotland , but her sister ’s passport was held up for months .
Passport workers said she would have to travel to Chicago and pay $ 60 for expedited processing .
Instead , Newport ’s son called the local TV stations and Sen. George V. Voinovich ( R - Ohio ) .
Newport ’s sister received the document barely in time to catch her plane .
“ It ’s disappointing it took 15 weeks and an act of a ... senator to get that done , ” said Newport ’s son , Daniel Matea .
“ That ’s just ridiculous . ”

In a letter Monday , 56 senators called on Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to step in to resolve the passport problems before they worsened .
In an effort to ease the backlog , the State Department announced earlier this month that it would waive the new rules -- which took effect in January -- through Sept. 30 for travelers who already had applied for passports .
Under current plans , the requirements for airline passengers will apply to travelers arriving by land and sea as well in January 2008 .
The regulations grew out of recommendations made by the Sept. 11 commission , which in 2004 called for a standardized form of identification for all U.S. travelers to boost border security .
In April 2005 , the Homeland Security and State departments unveiled the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative , which required passports , rather than simply driver ’s licenses or birth certificates , for travelers returning from nearby countries .
Almost immediately , congressional leaders voiced concern that Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff had set overly ambitious deadlines for the program .
President Bush , who signed a raft of post - Sept. 11 security legislation into law , also questioned the plan , saying it could impede travel .

By last spring , skepticism had increased .
A May 2006 report by the Government Accountability Office concluded that neither Homeland Security nor the State Department was fully prepared .
“ They have a long way to go to implement their proposed plans , and the time to get the job done is slipping by , ” the report said .
State Department officials disputed that finding , noting that they planned to hire 130 additional passport workers and to expand the number of locations that accept applications , mostly post offices , from 7,500 to 9,500 .
Yet when the requirement took effect Jan. 23 , a backlog began to develop almost instantly .
Even as calls to Congress from irate travelers turned from a trickle to a stream over the next month , Chertoff reassured the Senate Homeland Security Committee that the initiative was working well .
“ All the doom and gloom turned out not to come out , ” he said .
“ And that ’s because we stuck to the program . ”

But already the average turnaround time to process a passport fee had grown from 24 hours to three weeks , as 2.1 million applications arrived in January -- 600,000 more than expected .
Citicorp , which processes the fees under a contract with the Treasury Department , added 400 workers to its already expanded staff of 800 to clear the backlog .
Instead of fixing the problem , however , that sent a tidal wave of paperwork downstream .
“ They were not handing [ the applications ] over on time , and then they dumped them on us all at once ” in May , said Janelle Hironimus , a State Department spokeswoman .
Sheryl Morrow , director for the revenue collection group at the Treasury Department ’s Financial Management Service , countered that the State Department was well - aware of the backlog .
“ They get daily reports from the bank .
They knew what was coming , ” she said .
Analysts at the State Department initially forecast that passport applications would increase from 12 million to 15 million annually under the new system , then upped the projection in 2006 to 16 million .
Those estimates , Harty said Tuesday , were based on a study by BearingPoint , a consulting firm in McLean , Va .

When a heavier volume of applications came in -- at the current pace of 17.5 million annually -- the system was temporarily swamped , said Ann Barrett , deputy assistant secretary of State for passport services .
“ None of us has a crystal ball , ” she said .
According to the National Federation of Federal Employees , which represents passport office workers , the department had planned to almost double the number of employees , from 480 to 945 .
But only 218 new workers had been hired since 2005 , the union said .
Barrett disputed those numbers , saying her office hired more than 250 employees and never promised more .
Officials within the travel industry -- beset for months by panicked vacationers -- say the State Department ’s miscalculation was drastic .
“ Clearly , they did n’t hire enough , ” said Rick Webster , chief Washington lobbyist for the Travel Industry Assn. of America .
“ They simply asked for too little in terms of resources .
They admit that , but they almost talk about it as if it was a factor of degrees .
But it was a bigger miss than that . ”

Barrett announced plans this month to hire 400 more workers by October at a cost of $ 37 million , but screening and training them could take several months .
In the meantime , travelers are turning to their representatives and senators , hoping their intervention can help .
The office of Sen. Norm Coleman ( R - Minn. ) has handled more than 1,500 such requests since January .
“ The most frustrating thing for the constituents we talk to is that they are doing what the government told them ” to do , said Luke Friedrich , Coleman ’s spokesman .
“ They applied early , following the guidelines the government set out for getting their passports on time .
And the government , for some reason , was n’t ready . ”
If they can get an appointment , travelers scheduled to leave within two weeks or who need a foreign visa -- and who have hours to devote to standing in line -- can bring their applications to one of 14 passport agencies around the country .
Even then , delays abound .

Carmen Diaz of Germantown , Md. , applied weeks ago for passports for herself , her son and her daughter , whose soccer team is traveling to Brazil .
With a deadline approaching for obtaining visas , she gave up checking the status of their applications online and came to Washington on Friday .
“ They could n’t help me , because I was n’t leaving in the next 24 hours and they were only helping people who were leaving the next day or over the weekend , ” she said .
After hours in line , she got an appointment for Tuesday .
But because the passport agency could not find some of her paperwork , she had to redo her three applications -- including making a trip out of state to get a copy of her son ’s birth certificate .
California , with a large concentration of naturalized U.S. citizens , has been one of the areas hit hardest .
Some of the longest lines have been at passport agencies in Los Angeles and San Francisco .

In addition to the staffing issue , the State Department also has faced questions about the planned expansion of its passport facilities .
In advance of the stricter travel regulations , the department opened one new passport agency in Aurora , Colo. , in August 2005 and one new processing center in Hot Springs , Ark. , this March .
The Hot Springs center is expected to handle 10 million passports a year ; so far , Harty said , it has processed 150,000 .
Once the passport requirements are extended to land and sea travel , the State Department expects to receive 26 million applications -- a 50 % increase over the 2007 projection .
Last week , the House and Senate inserted provisions into the Homeland Security budget that would postpone the passport requirement for land and sea travel from January 2008 to June 2009 , and would require the department to demonstrate that it had a workable plan for processing passports on time .
Another GAO report on the travel initiative is expected in August .

On Friday , Barrett came to the Capitol with Homeland Security officials to brief congressional staffers on the travel initiative ’s progress , saying her office was prepared to meet the original January 2008 deadline .
The staffers laughed .

Adobe Illustrator CS6 has been available since late April 2012 , so more and more users were starting to wonder when Scriptographer for CS6 will finally be released .
Aware that it is time for an official answer , I am finally taking time to formulate one .
It was far from easy , but a decision has been made : I am not able to spend more time on making CS6 a reality , and instead will focus my time on creating a very decent alternative and escape route with Paper.js , a JavaScript library for the open web and the HTML5 canvas element that Jonathan Puckey and I have launched in 2011 and are very actively developing since .
The idea for Paper.js grew out of a research and teaching project at ECAL that we have been conducting during 2008 - 2011 , in which we used Scriptographer to teach programming to visually thinking students in blocks of one - week workshops .
In parallel to these workshops , as part of the research project we continuously improved , streamlined and simplified Scriptographer 's API , added new functionality based on observations from the classes and wrote many tutorials and materials to facilitate the teaching .
All this material has partly lead to Paper.js ' success , since it allowed us to provide great documentation from day one .
Based on these experiences , we are now in the process of planning an online coding environment using Paper.js that sports a subset of the features that the Illustrator interface is offering , which was so beneficial when teaching programming since it allowed the inspection of the visual elements that the code produces .
I am currently using an early version of this environment for teaching at UCLA in Los Angeles , and results are so encouraging that we believe in a couple of months we will not be looking back anymore , and will be able to offer a decent replacement to the environment you came to love working with , with plenty of options to import and export graphics .
Since CS3 , I have been regularly reaching out to Adobe , proposing to join forces in some way , as I thought they should be interested in our efforts .
Unfortunately , they did not seem to be , or did not have the resources to spare .
And with their own scripting environments based on automatic wrapping of native API still not receiving the love and attention to detail it deserves ( their API is unstructured and hard to use ) , I just do n't think that Adobe sees the necessity to invest energy there at this time .
Personally I believe that is a mistake , and I have been trying to tell them so on multiple occasions .
But given the quite fundamental changes that many of their applications have been undergoing in the past revisions , it is understandable that there were many more pressing issues .
For example , during the last decade , Illustrator for Mac went from OS 9 to OS X Carbon ( yes , early versions of Scriptographer still run on Classic Mac OS ! ) , from CodeWarrior to XCode , and now finally from 32 bit Carbon to 64 bit Cocoa .
In CS5 , the coordinate system was vertically flipped .
All these changes meant that with each new version , there was an increasing amount of time and effort to be spent to get Scriptographer functioning again .
And unfortunately , the changes required to make Illustrator CS6 work on 64 bit Cocoa lead to the complete removal of ADM ( Adobe Dialog Manager ) , the API that Scriptographer 's whole user interface is built with .
Even worse , there is no new API to replace it , developers are encouraged to either build UI in Flash , or use another cross- platform framework of their choice , and figure out how to integrate it in Illustrator , which is far from trivial .
So a large amount of time would have to be spent to port Scriptographer to CS6 , work that will neither be pretty nor fun .
Many people have suggested launching a Kickstarter campaign to raise the funds to facilitate such a transition .
I considered doing so for a while , but then realised that with all other projects and commitments , I simply do not have the time to spare to do so , even with sufficient funds , as employing a programmer and coordinating it all would still be a huge effort .
But with all the source code open - sourced and available over at GitHub , anyone with the energy and time at hands to do so should feel free to take on the project and make it live on .
I would be more than happy and willing to outline the changes required for CS6 which I have pretty much mapped out in my head already , and assist the process .
Developing Scriptographer has often been painful and more hard labor than anticipated , due to its ever changing host .
While working on Paper.js with Jonathan , I came to realise again how much fun programming can and should be .
While it is hard to abandon one of my darlings , the benefits from doing so simply overweight the downsides , and it is with an unburdened heart that I look forward to the new endeavours .
Many thanks to all of you who supported this platform over the years !
We hope we are not losing you as users .
Why do n't you move along with us to the new platform that is shaping with Paper.js !
To those who now feel betrayed or see the base for their work in danger :
There is nothing wrong with using CS5 for the time being , which is what we will have to do as well , since many of our own works depend on it to function .
I apologize for the bad news , and hope you can all appreciate this decision .
PS : I have removed the donation button from this website now .
If anybody has recently donated money in the hope of fueling the transition to CS6 , please get in touch and I will send you a refund .

1 : If you do n’t need to go out , then do n’t .
Why do you feel the need to run to the store during a storm ?
Did you not hear or see the forecast ?
Are you that low on bread , milk , smokes and beer that you have to risk your life and the lives of others ?
2 : If you must go out , stay the fuck out of my way , if you see a truck in a shopping center with a plow on the front , and a flashing yellow light on the roof , do n’t try to pass the truck when its plowing , do n’t pull up in a fire lane , park the vehicle , get out , and “ run into the store for a second ” , your in the fucking way , not to mention parked illegally , have n’t you figured out that im trying to clear the parking lot so morons like you can shop there ?
3 : When you pull into a parking lot where a truck is plowing , ( I know I can speak for most plow contractors when I say that we try to clear spaces close to the building first so vehicles may park ) pull into a space that has already been cleared , do n’t park your piece of shit halfway up the lot that im trying to plow .
If you cant tell the difference between parking spaces that have been cleared and ones that have n’t , the plowed spaces are black , the unplowed spaces are white .
4 : Do n’t pull into a large parking lot that im plowing , get out , tie a sled to the back of your Subaru and pull your kids around at 25 mph , anyone who does this is a fucking idiot , and should n’t be allowed to have kids .
Your father should have pulled out .
5 : SUV’s , …… I do n’t care what the salesman told you , your sport - utility - vehicle WILL GET STUCK , and it ’s usually in my way , stop flailing your arms and jumping up and down like you just won the lottery , trying to get me to stop to helpI could care less , im not breaking up my truck trying to pull your junk out of a snow bank just because you do n’t know how to drive , stay the fuck home .
6 : Property managers ; most of you people understand what were trying to do , but there are a few of you who need to be shot , stop calling and asking the same questions you already know the answers to , here ’s the # 1 question “ when are you coming ? ” , and here is the # 1 response : “ When I pull into the fucking lot , I have arrived ” And another thing , when we do a good job we do n’t expect praise , we just want you to pay the god damn bill , stop picking apart the job because your to cheap to pay , just send in a check and shut the fuck up .
If you cant do this , then find your SIGNED CONTRACT and bring it to court .7 : Crabby people :
Lets get one thing straight right now , I DID NOT CAUSE IT TO SNOW , ok ?
Its not my fault , do n’t yell obscenities at me , do n’t throw shit at my truck , do n’t threaten to kick my ass unless your fat , half - drunk ass can do it .
And to the guy behind the K - Mart a few years back who would n’t step aside so I could continue plowing , when I asked you kindly to step aside , and you started playing with your buck knife , giving me shit , you need to know that you came within 2 seconds of having a 9 mm auto in your face , have you never heard the joke about the guy who brought a knife to a gunfight ?
Dumb ass .
You were n’t worth a 10 - cent bullet .8 : I also want to take time to thank the police officers and firefighters who have to deal with idiots in bad weather , after seeing a guy in a SUV pull RIGHT OUT in front of a fire engine with the siren screaming .
And finally to the guy in the blue BMW that flipped me off and walked away , ….. you should be able to find your car sometime in mid May .
The reason Iraq needs to pass a new oil law , President Bush has said , is to " share oil revenues among all of Iraq 's citizens " – Sunnis , Shiites , and Kurds – and to help unify the country .
It 's a goal broadly supported in the US Congress and by the Iraq Study Group , whose 2006 report said such an oil law was needed , too , to " create a fiscal and legal framework for investment " in the industry .
But now the oil law 's status as a US " benchmark " for progress in Iraq is emerging as a flash point in both Baghdad and Washington .
So far , the frustration on Capitol Hill is mainly over the Iraqi government 's perceived foot - dragging in finishing the oil law , which US advisers had a hand in crafting .
But resistance is also surfacing to the substance of the oil bill , especially whether its main effect will be to ensure international companies a lucrative role in Iraq 's rich oil fields .
With House and Senate conferees about to put their heads together on a new war - funding bill that includes benchmarks for progress in Iraq , the proposed oil legislation is beginning to come under closer scrutiny .
" While we can't confirm it , there are enough reports out there that appear to indicate that undue , unfair preference and the influence of our oil companies are part of the Iraqi hydrocarbon law , and if that is true , that is not correct , " says Rep. Joe Sestak ( D ) of Pennsylvania , a former admiral and defense adviser to the Clinton administration .
" The aim of benchmarks is to help the process along , but we need benchmarks that are appropriate for the Iraqis and the Americans – not just our economy but our ideals . "
US firms as the major beneficiary ?
Fueling new resistance to the oil benchmark are reports that the draft law in fact says little about sharing oil revenues among Iraqi groups and a lot about setting up a framework for investment that may be disadvantageous to Iraqis over the long term .
On the flip side : Iraq 's oil industry badly needs new investment , and oil companies are reluctant to go into Iraq without a legal framework that ensures that the contracts they sign will be respected by future Iraqi governments .
Last week , Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D ) of Ohio , who is a presidential candidate , led off opposition to the draft law in a letter to Democratic colleagues .
On Thursday , a coalition of oil industry watchdog groups and peace activists called on Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Reid to drop the Iraqi oil law as a benchmark for progress in Iraq .
" If Democrats are perceived to be advocating withdrawal [ of US troops ] only after access to Iraqi oil has been assured , this will do little to reassure critics , " says Steve Kretzmann , executive director of Oil Change International , a watchdog group that drafted the letter .
In an open letter to Democrats in the US Congress last week , Hasan Jum 'a Awwad , head of the Iraqi Federation of Oil Unions , echoed that view .
He urged that lawmakers " not link withdrawal [ of US troops ] with the oil law , especially since the USA claimed that it came to Iraq as a liberator and not in order to control Iraq 's resources . "
For most US lawmakers , the delay in passing the oil law shows that Iraq 's new leaders are n't making tough political choices about their country 's future , such as how to fairly distribute Iraq 's oil wealth among all Iraqi groups .
" The Iraqi government remains in a dangerous stalemate : No oil law , " Senate majority leader Harry Reid said during a debate on war policy on Wednesday .
Why Iraqis do n't want to rush
But in Baghdad , some Iraqi lawmakers say the oil issue is too vast and complex to rush .
It should be the last issue – not one of the first – to be resolved , they say .
Moreover , Iraqi critics of the current draft law say it does not address the issues that US lawmakers think it does .
" The actual draft law has nothing to do with sharing the oil revenue , " says former Iraqi oil minister Issam Al Chalabi , in a phone interview from Amman , Jordan .
The law aims to set a framework for investment by outside oil companies , including favorable production - sharing agreements that are typically used to reward companies for taking on risk , he says .
" We know the oil is there .
Geological studies have been made for decades on these oil fields , so why would we let them [ international firms ] have a share of the oil ? " he adds .
" Iraqis will say this is solid proof that Americans have staged the war ... because of this law . "
On Feb. 26 , Iraq 's Cabinet approved the draft oil law , which was to be sent to parliament by March 15 – along with four annexes that provide the fine print , draft oil contracts , and a draft oil revenue - sharing law .
The Bush administration wanted Iraq 's parliament to approve the entire oil package by the end of May .
But as of this week , not even the draft oil law has been submitted to parliament .
" The US talks about the sovereignty of Iraq , but why are they getting involved in this oil law ? " asks Mohammed al - Dynee , member of parliament representing the Iraqi Front for National Dialogue , a Sunni group .
He is in Washington to try to persuade Congress to drop calls for the oil law .
" Even if this law can pass , which I doubt , it will remain ink on paper and will not be implemented on the ground . "
An unofficial English translation of the draft law was first released on the website of the Kurdish Regional Government and has since been carried on oil industry watchdog sites such as www.priceofoil.org.
At least one 'red flag '
In New York , oil industry analyst Fadel Gheit of Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. has reviewed both the official Arabic version of the draft law and the unofficial English translation and says they are ambiguous and seem to be written in haste .
" The law did not strike me as something that was explicitly designed to favor American companies , although I 'm not ruling that out , " he says .
But the stipulation that a new Federal Oil and Gas Council must include foreign participation did " raise a red flag , " he says .
Under the draft law , the council would carry out Iraqi oil policies and set criteria for foreign companies working in the industry .
" Why should n't Iraq use Iraqi nationals to decide how the contracts will be awarded ?
They have oil engineers .
Use the best brains in the country and , hopefully .
they will do what is in the best interest of the country , " he says .
" Otherwise , there 's an impression that American companies are telling Iraqis what to do . "
Foreign investment needed in Iraq
With the world 's second - largest oil reserves after Saudi Arabia , Iraq is the top prize in the international oil business .
Iraq needs new foreign investment to help modernize its oil industry , which has been closed to new technology for the past 25 years , says Mr. Gheit .
But even with a new draft oil law , international oil companies wo n't be eager to send engineers into a nation in turmoil .
" It 's very difficult for oil companies to recruit people willing to work in the Iraqi oil fields .
It 's mayhem , " he says .
" If the idea of the law is to expedite getting international oil [ firms ] to ... set up shop and invest money , they 're mistaken , " Gheit adds .
" I doubt very much that any oil company will be willing to send geologists , engineers to be shot at , kidnapped , or beheaded . "
In the 1990s , Saddam Hussein shifted Iraq 's oil industry from production - sharing agreements , which gave foreign investors a substantial share in revenues , to service agreements , which limit such investors ' profits .
" It 's very important , as we said in the [ Iraq Study Group ] report , that the US not be seen as trying to seek control of that oil , " says Lee Hamilton , a cochairman of the Iraq Study Group .
" But that will be very difficult to achieve because of the mind - set in much of the region today that we went in because of the oil ....
Most of the critics will not be persuaded by any rhetoric of the US but by a law that is drafted and implemented fairly . "
This may sound like an exaggeration , but our understanding of evolution has become a life - or - death issue for a number of health workers imprisoned in Libya .
In the late 90s , poor hygienic conditions had allowed the spread of HIV and other pathogens among children in a Libyan hospital .
A group of six foreign health workers — five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor now known as the Tripoli Six — were arrested for knowingly infecting the victims .
Following confessions that they claim were induced by torture , the six were convicted and sentenced to execution by firing squad .
The international outcry that followed compelled the Libyan supreme court to order a retrial , and the verdict from that retrial has now been handed down : death again , with a single remaining chance of appeal .
Nothing unusual about the slow and sometimes unfair motion of the wheels of justice , right ?
In this case , wrong : there is clear scientific evidence that these health workers have not been directly responsible for the infections .
It has been made available to the court , which chose to ignore it in handing down this most recent death sentence .
Perhaps the disturbing aspect of this evidence , however , is that it is based on standard evolutionary and epidemiological evidence — two fields that have become the target of frequent attacks in the culture wars that are engulfing the US .
The journal Nature has been instrumental in leading the efforts against these charges , providing open access to to editorials and scientific discussion of the HIV strains involved in the infections and the course of the epidemic .
They have now published what may be the definitive analysis of the HIV outbreak that resulted in these death sentences .
It turns out that over half the infected children wound up in European hospitals at one point or another , and viral samples were obtained from them .
Sequencing of these viruses followed by standard building of an inheritance tree based on common descent reveal that all of the viruses are derived from a single , and typical , ancestral virus .
That ancestral virus was a member of the strains active in sub-Saharan Africa , which provides migrant workers to Libya .
All statistical tests indicate that the virus was already spreading within the patient population prior to the arrival of the foreign health workers at the hospital .
Many of the HIV victims were also infected with Hepatitis C while at the hospital ; examination of the phylogeny of this virus indicated that the hospital had at least three independent HepC infections active prior to the arrival of the Tripoli Six .
The authors clearly state that these results " suggest that Al - Fateh Hospital had a long - standing infection - control problem .
"
The verdict is a clear indication that Libya does n't respect scientific evidence and is more comfortable believing President Gaddafi 's allegations that the health workers were part of a plot by the CIA and Mossad .
For those of you outraged by this verdict , a collection of contact information for people and organizations that are actively helping or can provide diplomatic pressure is available .
I would just add that , whatever country you are in , doing what you can to promote a respect for the strength of scientific evidence can prevent a travesty such as this from happening closer to home .
A study conducted by the Consumer Electronics Association ( CEA ) has determined that the average American household spends approximately $ 1,200 annually on electronics products .
The study , which also provides insight into the popularity of various kinds of consumer electronics products , was devised and conducted by CEA Market Research in February .
According to the study , televisions are the most popular consumer electronics product , and can be found in 92 percent of American households .
HDTVs , which significantly increased in popularity this past year , can already be found in 25 percent of American households .
Mobile phones , which are owned by 76 percent of American households , are also amongst the most common consumer electronics devices .
In the past year , the largest growth was seen in network hardware ( e.g. , wireless access points , routers ) and digital video recorders , both of which increased by 8 percent .
A quarter of American households now own a DVR and 30 percent own network hardware .
Digital audio players ( owned by 32 percent of American households ) and digital cameras ( owned by 62 percent of American households ) also saw tremendous growth in the past year .
" Many of the top owned products have enjoyed mass - market saturation for years and will likely see growth based on upgrade and replacement sales , " said CEA senior research analyst Elena Caudle .
" Some of the more intriguing categories are those that still occupy niche markets , such as mobile CE devices like GPS systems and satellite radio , which have seen healthy growth in the past few years . "
The study also determined that the average teen spends approximately half of their total discretionary income on consumer electronics products , and households with teenagers and children typically exceed the national average expenditure of $ 1,200 by up to $ 500 , likely due to digital audio player and cell phone purchases .
The CEA 's study does not segment the statistics into categories such as early adopters and technophiles like us .
A quick survey of the staff here at Ars showed that almost all of us had surpassed the $ 1,200 figure by a good deal during 2006 .
It 's not too difficult to do it : a cell phone upgrade , an iPod , a console , a handful of games , and a GPS unit is enough to push one past the national average .
How close to the national average are you ?
So I had another encounter with AppleCare tonight and what a memorable one it was too !
I was trying to get my external microphone working with my MacBook Pro and failing miserably , I googled and found some articles about setting it up in System Preferences and also in the Audio MIDI Setup but nothing I did seemed to work so I figured I would use the AppleCare plan that I paid so much money for and ask a genius !
I got through to a guy on the phone and he did n’t have the slightest clue what he was doing , I had to tell him about the System Preferences with the audio input panel and suggested it might be something to do with that , at which point started to leaf through the manual in front of him , let out a big sigh and said …
“ You would n’t have this problem if you had a Windows PC , everything would just work ”
Err… … …
I could n’t stop myself laughing :)
He obviously has n’t been drinking the Kool - Aid about “ Everything just working with a Mac ” .
Now this guy obviously did n’t care about what he was doing in the slightest and just kept trying to get me off the phone , at one point I asked if there was anyone else I could speak to who knew slightly more about audio on the Mac and his best suggestion was to put the phone down and keep calling until I got through to someone who knew something .
Fabulous customer support , I only wish I had been taping it ( I might have been if my microphone had worked !!! :) anyway I did n’t get it fixed and gave up in the end but the phone call was n’t wasted because it did make me chuckle a lot ;)
Sort it out Apple .
Update 1 : Some comments are suggesting that I made this story up , I can not prove it of course but I assure you that it is true and not exaggerated .
I have nothing to gain from making Apple look bad and I do not mention that they are worse than any of their competitors .
The thing with this is its a funny story and I wanted to share it !
ALL call centers have pissed off people working for them and I certainly got on the phone with one of them tonight , I may have been unlucky but it is true …
P.S. I do n’t actually think it was Bill who answered the phone tonight , unless he was putting on the accent of a bored british teenager ;)

The argument between the sides is similar to the classic debate between the hardworking ants and lazy grasshoppers of Aesop ’s fable .
The financial planning industry says saving , even too much , provides a safety net and peace of mind , and possibly a gift to heirs at the end .
The economists answer that people would get more out of their money by using it when they are younger .
“ There is risk in saving too much , ” Mr. Kotlikoff said .
“ You could end up squandering your youth rather than your money . ”
Mr. Scholz said he and his co-authors of a study , “ Are Americans Saving ‘ Optimally ’ for Retirement ? ” found oversaving across all economic and education levels and most ethnic or racial groups as well .
( It found that Hispanics tended to save less . )
Those who were not saving enough were usually missing their target by only a small amount .
The one exception to this optimism involves people who enter retirement single , either because their spouse died early , they divorced , or they never married .
The studies found this group did not save enough .
“ If they are worried about end - of - life medical expenses or they do n’t mind leaving money to their heirs , ” Mr. Scholz said , “ then oversaving is fine . ”
The dispute revolves around how financial planners determine how much a person should save .
That amount will vary depending on age , income and assets .
To simplify the calculations , computer programs resort to rules of thumb .
The starting point for most retirement plans is the so - called replacement rate .
It says an American needs an annual income in retirement equal to 75 percent to 86 percent of what he or she earned in the final year of employment .
Someone making $ 100,000 would typically plan for about $ 85,000 a year in retirement .
Coupling that with a second industry rule of thumb that says retirees should spend no more than about 4 percent of their assets each year to make them last , a typical couple with that level of income should enter retirement with at least $ 2.1 million in assets , including 401 ( k ) s , I.R.A. ’s , stocks and bonds , real estate , cash value life insurance , pensions and Social Security benefits .
The traditional " Movie Ewok , " with fluffy hair , clothing , and tools .
While ewoks are often mawkishly portrayed on film as cute , curious little urchins that live in tree houses and coo adorably , the reality of wild ewoks is an entirely different story .
I live near the redwood forests of Northern California , so I ’ve been around ewoks all my life ; every hike , picnic , or camping trip I ’ve ever been on has been marred by their unwelcome presence .
Are ewoks cute ?
Not at all .
That ’s pure Hollywood magic .
In fact , ewoks are some of the most disgusting wild animals in North America .
The dandy little chaps you ’ve seen on the silver screen are just midgets in ewok suits ; real ewoks do n’t have smooth , clean fur , and no sane human would be inclined to pet one .
They ’re so plagued by lice , fleas , dander and mange that their coats are spotted with huge bald patches and pocked with weeping sores .
Touching one would likely net you a fistful of loose fur , matted with pus and crawling with ticks .
A skulking , drooling menace .
I have no idea how ewoks manage to stay alive , because they are the filthiest and sickliest animals I ’ve ever seen .
They do n’t fastidiously groom themselves like cats or raccoons , and they have a natural aversion to water ; consequently , they languish in feculence and disease .
Their eyes and noses are constantly weepy from illness , and they have little concern for hygiene , so their faces become slick with mucous and brownish eye discharge .
They wheeze and gurgle as they breathe , their lips and noses bubble , and their watery , bloodshot eyes stare unfocused into the distance , betraying no glimmer of intelligence .
Their unique combination of poor health and listlessness is often so overpowering that they leave their membranous inner eyelids halfway closed , like anesthetized cats .
I ’m particularly amused that Hollywood ewoks are always clad in little leather outfits .
I do n’t blame producers for demanding that ewoks be clad , because the sight of an ewok in its natural state of nudity would certainly overpower a child .
Ewoks have one of the highest genital - size - to - body - size ratios in the wild kingdom , and they have no shame about public autoeroticism .
While the sight of a male ewok languidly fiddling with his massive purple sex characteristics is ghastly enough , ewok mating season is worse still .
It ’s a sickening spectacle ; the females develop sagging , gristly teats and gigantic engorged vulvas , and when they ’re in heat they will “ present ” them to any living thing around them ( they are particularly fond of trying to initiate sexual acts with human children , who are of a similar size and build ) .
Watching those old made - for - television “ Ewok Adventure ” movies is a nerve - wracking ordeal for those familiar with wild ewoks , because we are instinctively vigilant about keeping children away from ewoks at all times , lest they be courted or even raped by the lust - crazed vermin .
A REAL Ewok Adventure is prying a lust - crazed ewok in heat off of your daughter .
Of course , children and adults alike tend to steer clear of ewoks .
Not only do ewoks have powerful scent glands which emit a nauseating , eye - stinging , sulfuric aroma , but their odor is further invigorated by their feces - encrusted hindquarters .
Keeping them away can be a difficult task , though .
Ewoks have no fear of man , and those who live near parks almost always rely on tourists to feed them .
If they ever had any skill at hunting , it ’s been lost for generations .
Most of them simply hang out around campsites screaming for food ( they do n’t chirp and chortle ; hey have a high - pitched , keening screech like fingernails on a chalkboard ) .
If you do n’t feed them , they screech louder , tug at your clothing , and sometimes even throw stones .
They break into cars and tents and rip apart people ’s belongings , stealing anything edible or shiny they can find .
Ewoks in popular national parks inevitably become grossly obese , since timid tourists are easily menaced into giving up food .
Obese ewoks are an almost comical sight .
They waddle from camp to camp breathing heavily and rubbing their distended bellies , moaning like pathetic wretches for another bite of food .
The levity is undercut by the fact that they tend to develop intestinal problems , which lead to loose bowels .
Predictably , they are unashamed ; they just stand around gawking at nothing , gorging themselves on ill - gotten food and shitting down their own legs without embarrassment .
If you showed this to a real ewok , it would smash it to bits seeing if there was food inside .
They do n’t have chiefs and tree houses and little societies , either .
They ’re vicious , primitive and territorial , and campers in the redwoods are often treated to screaming disputes between competing males .
Unlucky campers who book sites during ewok rutting season might even see ewoks savagely ripping each other apart with their teeth and claws , or be kept awake at night by the shrill , gurgling cries of a half - disemboweled juvenile who tried to challenge an older buck .
However , even the horrific din of ewok violence is preferable to the fevered , slurping yowls of seasonal ewok mating pairs , which sound like the cries of napalmed children being dragged over a salt flat .
Filmmakers do us a great disservice by portraying these animals as anything but dumb , repulsive hooligans of the forest .
Moviegoers who had never been within a hundred miles of an ewok were so swayed by the pleasant portrayal of ewoks in Return of the Jedi that they successfully lobbied to have the awful creatures put on the endangered species list , meaning hefty fines or jail time for any man who shoots the ewok that destroyed his tent or raped his child .
Since their inclusion on the list of protected species , ewoks have become so populous in the redwood forests that they ’ve begun to encroach on human - inhabited lands .
Thanks to George Lucas , Northern Californians are now faced with upturned trashcans , broken windows , sleepless nights , and the hundred - pound carcasses of ewok - roadkill .

Virender Sehwag and Rahul Dravid set the best - ever partnership for any wicket for India against Pakistan on day four of the first Test in Lahore on Monday .
They eclipsed the 336 - run stand set by Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar at Multan in the first Test of the last series in Pakistan in 2004 .
Sehwag had then scored 309 while Tendulkar was unbeaten with 194 .
The makeshift opening pair is now on the threshold of eclipsing the highest opening partnership -- Pankaj Roy and Vinoo Mankad 's 413 , set against New Zealand , in Chennai in 1955 / 56 .
By close on day 4 of the ongoing Test , they were engaged in an unfinished partnership of 403 .
Sehwag was batting on 247 while skipper Dravid was unbeaten on 128 .

Wycliffe Hall is a permanent private hall of the University of Oxford .
It was founded in 1877 for the training of " godly ministers " for the Church of England within the evangelical tradition .
Giles referred to Wycliffe " drawing upon a long - standing tradition of evangelical anti-intellectualism " , and said " the low esteem in which many evangelicals hold academic inquiry is a function of fear " .
This comment lacks the very academic rigour the author complains is missing from evangelical scholars .
The faculty at Wycliffe has a long record of academic publication , with a regular flow of books and articles and our students winning multiple university prizes .
As a historian of the evangelical movement I am very aware of the complex nuances of its history .
Indeed there are some radical emphases on the transformation of society , not just the individual .
Three - quarters of the social reforms of the 19th century have been directly attributed to evangelical Christianity .
There is in fact a long history of both intellectual and social engagement .
It wo n't do to simply associate the evangelical tradition with anti-intellectualism .
I know of no homophobia or misogyny at Wycliffe .
If there is any evidence then it must be produced .
For Giles to say that I believe 95 % of people will " burn in hell " is a misrepresentation when the rest of my sentence , " unless the message of the gospel is brought to them " , is excluded .
Nor does my deputy believe it's " wrong for women to teach men " .
He believes , as I do , that in our college women can and should teach and preach .
There are various views on practices in local churches .
Completeness is important .
We do not control the admissions policy to university courses .
If the complaint is of intellectual engagement with complex matters on which Christians may disagree then the plea is guilty .
Why these attacks ?
The permanent private halls have welcomed the university 's review .
Wycliffe contributes significantly to the life of the university , to the teaching of theology and to research .
Giles said that the Church of England should " stop using colleges like this " .
Note the plural .
As a former chair of the general synod 's business committee I am more than aware of the importance of the comprehensiveness of the Church of England - a comprehensiveness that is also important for the academy .
Every theological college is subject to regular inspection .
Prior to my appointment , and in follow - up visits , the inspectors at Wycliffe have all sought , in particular , the reform of management and structure and more strategic planning .
We have not shied away from essential reforms designed to fit the college for the 21st century .
It is true that not all have welcomed this .
However , at the heart of Wycliffe 's purposes lie both the intellectual enterprise and the passion for effective training .
They are not incompatible .

February 22 , 2007 — jao
Emacs - w3 m comes with an excellent tab mode , which you can enable with ( setq w3 m - use - tab t ) in your .emacs .
C - cC -t creates new tabs , C - cC - w closes them and you can navigate then with C - cC - [ np ] , or , my favourite , using a tab list via C - cC -s ( if you did n’t know about this one , give it a try : it ’s very useful ) .
But i quickly find myself with lots of open tabs that happen to be in the wrong order , and i wanted something akin to Firefox ’s ability to move and reorder them around .
I did n’t find a way change a tab ’s position in a vanilla emacs - w3 m , but it was n’t that difficult to cook up my own solution .
This function :
( defun jao - w3 m - switch - buffers ( dist ) ( interactive " p " ) ( let* ( ( dist ( if ( zerop dist ) 1 dist ) ) ( current ( current - buffer ) ) ( current - no ( w3 m - buffer - number current ) ) ( next ( progn ( w3 m - next - buffer dist ) ( current - buffer ) ) ) ( next - no ( w3 m - buffer - number next ) ) ) ( with - current - buffer current ( rename - buffer " * w3 m * <* > " ) ( w3 m - buffer - set - number next current - no ) ( w3 m - buffer - set - number current next - no ) ( w3m-pack -buffer-numbers ) ) ( switch - to - buffer current ) ) )
switches the current tab with the one to its right ( cyclically ) , or to the n-th to its right if you provide a numerical argument ( e.g. M - 3 ) .
I ’ve got this function bound to C - cC - f :
( define - key w3 m - mode - map ( kbd " C- cC-f " ) ' jao-w3m-switch - buffers )
Alternatively , one could define a function that moves the current tab to the right a number of times .
We can take advantage of the above function for a quick hack :
( defun jao - w3 m - move - buffer ( dist ) ( interactive " p " ) ( let ( ( dist ( if ( zerop dist ) 1 dist ) ) ( while (> dist 0 ) ( jao - w3 m - switch - buffers 1 ) ( setq dist ( 1- dist ) ) ) ) )
and bind that to a shortcut of your choice .
There you go : easy tab shuffling .

The frozen chicken missiles have damaged several homes
Residents in the city of Newcastle believe the birds may have fallen from an aircraft or been fired by pranksters using a slingshot .
Two homes have been damaged since the mystery began .
When a headless chicken crashed on to a suburban house in Newcastle last month , most people thought it had fallen from a low - flying aircraft .
It 's raining hen
Newspaper headline
Such was the damage to the roof that experts are convinced the carcass must have plummeted at least 1,600 feet ( 490 metres ) .
A physics professor at Newcastle University has pointed the finger at local wags , armed with a giant slingshot or catapult .
The mystery has delighted headline writers around Australia .
Among the gems were " It 's raining hen " and " Crashing chooks ruffle residents ' feathers " !
The police have admitted they do not have much to go on - apart from two very squashed chickens .
SMART FOLKS are a dime a dozen .
What truly matters is creativity .
As Albert Einstein put it , “ Imagination is more important than knowledge . ”
Given our increased focus on science and math , and our newly increased emphasis on testing in schools , we need to make sure we do n’t forget this .
We tend to teach by drilling in knowledge rather than stimulating imagination .
Einstein rebelled against rote learning , and that attitude helped make him the genius that he was .
Likewise , our success as a nation will be determined not just by how well our schools teach the multiplication and periodic tables but by how well they promote imagination and creativity .
The oft - made assertion that Einstein failed math as a child is , to the disappointment of bad students and those of us who savor irony in history , not true .
But he was slow in learning to talk .
That was combined with a cheeky rebelliousness toward authority , which led one schoolmaster to send him packing and another to amuse history by declaring that he would never amount to much .
Advertisement
These traits made Einstein the patron saint of distracted schoolkids everywhere .
But they also helped to make him the most creative scientific genius of modern times .
His cocky contempt for authority led him to question received wisdom .
And as for his slow verbal development , it led him to think in pictures and to observe with wonder the everyday phenomena that others took for granted .
One evening I was helping my daughter with her math homework , and I explained that an equation she had produced was clearly wrong because the calculations involved would not result in a line that swooped upward so rapidly .
She looked quizzical .
I explained that math was a language that nature used to describe her wonders , and she should try to picture the underlying reality of an equation just as she would do when she encountered a phrase such as Homer ’s “ rosy - fingered dawn . ”
I wish , she said , that they would teach us that in school .
Einstein intuitively understood that math was nature ’s playbook .
So , at age 16 , being a bit more advanced than my daughter , he was imagining and picturing Maxwell ’s equations , which describe electromagnetic waves .
Advertisement
How would these equations be manifest , he wondered , to someone who was riding alongside a light beam ?
If you caught up , the waves should seem stationary relative to you , but Maxwell ’s equations did n’t allow for that .
It worried Einstein mightily for the next 10 years .
His impudence and lack of deference to authority meant that he alienated all of his professors at Zurich Polytechnic .
As a result , he was the only graduate in his section who was not offered a junior professorship .
He struggled to find work , finally landing on a stool at the Swiss patent office in Bern as a third - class examiner .
But lest we feel sorry for him , the job allowed him to do thought - experiments and encouraged him to be skeptical about conventional wisdom , unlike the well - heeled acolytes in the academy .
Among his thought - experiments was one in which he imagined two lightning bolts , one striking at each end of a fast - moving train .
For someone standing halfway between them on the embankment , they would appear to be simultaneous .
But for someone standing halfway between them on the moving train , the strike in front would seem to come first because the observer would be racing closer to it as the light beams traveled from each strike .
Advertisement
It was a simple insight :
Two events that appeared simultaneous to one observer would not appear simultaneous to someone moving relative to him .
So time itself was not absolute but was relative for people in different states of motion .
For a boy racing alongside a light beam , Maxwell ’s equations would remain the same , but time would slow down as he approached the speed of light .
Others had come close to that insight , including Henri Poincare and Hendrik Lorentz .
But Einstein had a rebelliousness , a willingness not to conform , that they lacked .
He alone was willing to discard the notion of absolute time , which had been a sacred tenet of classical physics for 216 years , ever since Sir Issac Newton in his “ Principia ” had declared that it tick - tocked along “ without relation to anything external . ”
“ Long live impudence , ” Einstein proclaimed as a young man .
“ It ’s my guardian angel in the world . ”
If we ’re going to succeed in training a new generation of Einsteins , we have to be careful to nurture the imagination -- even the impudence and rebelliousness -- that was the wellspring of his genius .

Ever been at a friend 's house and wanted to show off a photo you left saved on your home computer ?
Ever wanted to check from the office that your daughter 's doing homework and not instant messaging with friends at home ?
Ever need to grab a file on your home hard drive when you 're miles away ?
An age - old protocol called VNC and some free software lets you control your home computer from anywhere .
Advertisement
In this tutorial , we 'll set up a VNC ( Virtual Network Computing ) server on your home computer , which will let you connect to your desktop and drive it from any Internet - connected computer .
Notes and warnings : Running a server and opening up a port on your home computer to the Internet is a risky undertaking .
Make sure your computer has all the latest security patches , has been checked for spyware and viruses and that you 're using strong passwords .
The VNC protocol is not inherently secure .
This how - to assumes you 're comfortable with basic networking concepts .
If you 're scared off by the fine print , check out an easier alternative [ 1 ] to VNC .
Still with me ?
Read on .

The Virtual Network Computing ( VNC ) protocol remotely controls another computer over a network .
Think of it as a window into your home computer 's desktop from any other computer .
Your key presses and mouse clicks get transferred over the network and happen on the remote computer in real time , and anyone at the remote computer can watch the action as it happens .
A few things you can do with a VNC server running at home :
Start a downloading a large file , like a movie , in the morning so it 's there when you get home in the evening
Search your home computer 's IM logs , address book or file system for important information
Help Mom figure out why Microsoft Word does n't start without having to go to her house ( even though Mom would like to see you more often )
Control a headless ( monitor - less ) machine like a media center or file server in another room in the house from the laptop on the couch
VNC requires two components for a successful connection : the server on your home computer , and the viewer on the remote computer .
Let 's set up each component to get going .
Here 's how .
Step 1 . Install the VNC server .
Windows users : TightVNC is free Windows VNC server and client software .
TightVNC is a nice choice because it also allows for file transfers and high compression levels for slow connections .
Download TightVNC from here and run the installation on your home computer .
Start the server , and set a password for incoming connections .

TightVNC can be set to run as a Windows service , which means your Windows usernames and passwords can be used to authenticate on the VNC server connection .
Be sure all your Windows passwords are set and strong , and that any passwordless guest accounts are disabled .
Mac users : OSXvnc is a free Mac VNC server .
Download , install , set up a password and start the server .

If your VNC server is connected directly to the Internet , it is now listening for Internet requests [ 2 ] on port 5900 , VNC 's default port ( which is also configurable ) .
Visit WhatIsMyIP from your home computer to determine its IP address and write it down .
Step 2 . Install the VNC client .
On the remote Windows computer , also download and install TightVNC , but this time , start the viewer , NOT the server .
If you 're on a Mac , download the free Chicken of the VNC Mac viewer to connect to your home PC .
Enter your home computer 's IP address [ 3 ] and password to connect .

And that 's that !
You 're virtually sitting at your home desktop from anywhere in the world .
A few extra VNC tips to chew on :
For slower network connections , set the compression to " best . "
The window image quality will be lower , but the connection response will be snappier .
Bring a VNC viewer with you on a USB memory stick so you do n't have to download and install on every computer you want to use to connect to your server .
Avoid having to install a server on Mom 's computer ; email her the 166K self - extracting SingleClick UltraVNC server

[ 1 ] LogMeIn is a web - based application that also provides this remote desktop control and may be a better option for some folks .
I prefer VNC because it's more of a challenge and does n't require third party intervention .

If your home computer is behind a home network router with a firewall , remote computers will not be able to connect .
You must open up a port on your router 's firewall and forward requests to it to your computer , a how - to that 's beyond the scope of this article but will be covered in an upcoming Lifehacker feature is covered in the Lifehacker feature

Alternately , you can enter your home computer 's domain name .
For more information on setting that up , see previous Lifehacker feature Assign a domain name to your home server .
This way , when connecting using the VNC viewer , you can enter an address like mycomputer .
dyndns.org instead of an IP address .

Democrats call Tony Snow's Clinton - era White House e-mail allegations ' untrue ' Michael Roston
Published : Wednesday June 20 , 2007 Print This Email This
When asked Monday whether officials in the Bush White House had destroyed presidential records by failing to archive e-mails sent over Republican National Committee accounts , Press Secretary Tony Snow said that the current administration 's preservation efforts were no different from those used by the administration of Bill Clinton .
However , the Democratic National Committee begged to differ .
" That 's simply untrue , " Stacie Paxton , a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee , told RAW STORY in a Tuesday phone call .
" Clinton White House officials did not have DNC e-mail accounts . "
Paxton was contradicting Tony Snow 's remarks in his Monday press conference .
" Those email accounts were set up ... on a model based on the prior administration , which had done it the same way , in order to try to avoid Hatch Act violations , " Snow said in his Monday press briefing .
The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform published a study on Monday that showed that 88 White House officials had used Republican National Committee - supplied e-mail accounts , and that all e-mail from 51 of those accounts had been destroyed .
The RNC 's policy was to archive e-mails for only 30 days .
White House Deputy Chief of Staff and top Bush adviser Karl Rove is one official who has heavily used his RNC e-mail account .
" The RNC has preserved only 130 e-mails sent to Mr. Rove during the entire first term , " the House Oversight Committee report noted .
Contrasted with Rove 's reported e-mail use , the report pointed to ' extensive ' destruction of presidential records .
" Mr. Rove frequently sent more than 100 e-mails per day through his RNC e-mail account and received more than 200 per day , " it said .
One former Clinton employee argued that Snow 's suggestion that the Bush administration 's e-mail policy is on par with the presidential records preservation of the previous White House did n't hold up .
" If we received a phone call and took notes , that was a presidential record , and you could n't throw it out .
That 's the simplest , most easy standard , and that approach was taken , I think , throughout , " said Jonathan Gill , who helped spearhead the Clinton White House 's electronic publishing efforts from 1993 - 95 .
Gill acknowledged that he could n't speak directly to e-mail preservation other than his own under President Clinton 's White House , but said there was a heavy awareness of documents preservation in those years .
" If they were concerned enough to advise mid-level employees like me , if they were concerned enough to give explicit instructions about pink phone message slips , I think it reflects the level of care and attention to detail that we tried to maintain , " the former Clinton White House employee argued .
" I 'm sure we had lapses , everyone does , but we sure tried hard . "
On Wednesday , Amanda Terkel of Think Progress published a memo written by former Clinton Chief of Staff John Podesta in 1993 which ordered the preservation of all electronic records as well .
" No word processing or e-mail document that is a Presidential record should be deleted unless it has been ( a ) printed and placed in an appropriate file , or ( b ) preserved in an appropriate electronic system , " the memo states .
The policy of the Bush White House appears to have gone beyond Podesta 's orders , accounting for the possibility that non-White House e-mail accounts might be used by White House employees for official business .
" [ I ] f you happen to receive an e-mail on a personal e-mail account that otherwise qualifies as a Presidential record , it is your duty to ensure that it is preserved and filed as such by printing it out and saving it or by forwarding it to your White House e-mail account , " wrote then - White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales in a February 2001 memo excerpted by the Oversight Committee in Monday 's report .
Snow 's reference to the Clinton administration 's e-mail preservation policies was not the first effort by Republicans to shift attention away from the destroyed RNC e-mail records and onto the previous White House .
In an April 25 hearing of the Oversight Committee reported on by RAW STORY , Rep. Darrell Issa ( R - CA ) sought to subpoena Clinton - era e-mails from the Democratic National Committee .
The subpoena was not approved by the committee .
Daily Show : ' Do n't they know we 're all recording this stuff ? '
David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday June 15 , 2007 Print This Email This On Thursday 's Daily Show , Jon Stewart reported that , in discussing the US Attorney firings , " Tony Snow , the White House lip - mover guy , was adamant months ago that the dismissal of these attorneys had nothing to do with politics . "
Stewart played a March 15 clip of Snow saying , " These things were based on performance and not on , sort of , attempts to do political retaliation . "
" They were incompetent , " said Stewart firmly , " and clearly there 's no place for that in the Bush administration . "
Stewart then played a June 13 clip of Snow being asked by a reporter about the White House 's claim that the firings were performance - based and responding , " No , that is something we have never said . "
Stewart concluded , " That 's the beauty of these guys , you can't even make them listen to themselves . "
Stewart turned from Snow to an apparent misrepresentation by Mitt Romney of his past positions .
" Do n't they know we 're all recording this stuff ? " he asked incredulously , before announcing a new segment on candidate websites , http.//.indecision.2008.net/[email protected ] #k.html .
Stewart showed " John McCain 's McCainSpace -- it 's just like MySpace , except here , the only friend you have is John McCain . "
At Rudy Giuliani's site you can " snap up some Rudy Gear . "
Or , if " you 're looking for a slightly more intimate encounter , may I recommend Dinner with Barack . "
" But there is such a thing as getting too close to a candidate , " Stewart concluded .
" For instance , Democrat Mike Gravel 's web video , ' Rock , ' starts with him staring into the camera -- and continuing to stare for a full minute before throwing a rock into a pond and walking away real slow . "
The following video is from The Daily Show with Jon Stewart , broadcast on June 14 .

Congress Bans Genital Rite
Congress outlawed the rite of female genital cutting in the United States just before it recessed two weeks ago .
It directed federal authorities to inform new immigrants from countries where it is commonly practiced that parents who arrange for their children to be cut here , as well as people who perform the cutting , face up to five years in prison .
The new law also requires United States representatives to the World Bank and other international financial institutions that have lent billions of dollars to the 28 African countries where the practice exists to oppose loans to governments that have not carried out educational programs to prevent it .
Support for these measures -- included in an end - of - session spending bill -- built this year as the case of Fauziya Kassindja , a young woman who fled Togo to avoid having her genitals cut off and sought asylum here , gained attention in the American media , government officials said .
" You keep trying to explain that this is not circumcision , " said Rep. Patricia Schroeder , D - Colo. , who along with Sen. Harry Reid , D - Nev. , has repeatedly introduced bills in past sessions to outlaw the practice .
" This is more like Lorena Bobbit .
Once they really find out it goes on and is not some victim fantasy we 're having , they 're horrified . "
Experts say there is no way to measure how many girls are being genitally cut in the United States since the rite is usually performed privately .
But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently estimated that more than 150,000 women and girls of African origin or ancestry in the United States may be at risk of the rite or have already been cut .
Researchers developed these rough estimates by matching 1990 Census Bureau population data on the number of girls and women whose families came from the African countries where the practice is customary with estimates of the prevalence of the rite in those countries .
New York and Newark , N.J. , as well as Los Angeles and Washington , are among the metropolitan areas where the largest number of these at - risk girls and women live , according to the estimates .
The data was gathered in response to an April directive from Congress .
At that time , Congress also told federal health officials to develop a program to educate immigrants about the dangers of the practice , which they are now doing .
The federal ban on genital cutting , which takes effect six months after the law 's passage on Sept. 30 , comes when states and health workers are increasingly debating how to respond to a cultural practice that is a highly valued rite of passage among some African immigrants , but is abhorred by many Americans .
California , Minnesota , Tennessee , Rhode Island and North Dakota are among the states that have outlawed the practice in the past two years , congressional researchers say .
A group of physicians at the the Harborview Medical Center , a public hospital in Seattle , have taken a different view .
After Somali mothers repeatedly requested that their daughters be genitally cut in the hospital , the doctors proposed what they considered a largely symbolic form of the ritual : nicking the tip of a girl 's clitoris , with her consent , under a local anesthetic .
No tissue would be removed , they said .
The proposal has stirred an emotionally charged debate there .
" I think that this is an issue that should be decided by a physician , the family and the child , " Abraham Bergman , chief of pediatrics at the hospital , said .
" Privacy should prevail and the brouhaha is inappropriate . "
It is not clear whether the procedure being proposed in Seattle would violate the new law against what Congress termed " female genital mutilation , " government officials said .
The Federal law provides for the prosecution of anyone who " circumcises , excises , or infibulates the whole or any part of the labia majora or labia minora or clitoris of another person who has not attained the age of 18 . "
Infibulation involves stitching together the labia to largely cover the vagina .
Members of Congress say they believe the United States needs to send a forceful , clear message to immigrants here that female genital cutting is a practice they must abandon .
They say the United States should follow the example of the French , who over the past 10 to 15 years have criminally prosecuted parents in more than 30 families from Mali , Mauritania , the Gambia and Senegal for the excision of daughters .
Such cases are usually reported to the police by doctors , who detect the practice while examining the girls .
Usually , the convicted parents have been given suspended sentences , though occasionally they get prison time .
" At first the doctors hesitated , saying , ' We cannot betray families , " ' said Linda Weil - Curiel , a lawyer who is France 's leading crusader against the practice .
" I said , ' Your first obligation is to the child .
If you do not report a family when you notice they practice excision , then the next child born will be excised , too .
You bear the responsibility . " '
The congressional push to outlaw genital cutting in the United States was led by a handful of senators and representatives .
Reid , the point man in the Senate , said he first lost sleep over this issue in 1994 after CNN broadcast a video of a 10 - year - old Egyptian girl being cut .
" They grab her and hold her down and rip out her genitalia with a razor blade , " Reid said , adding that he thought at the time of his two young granddaughters .
" I said , ' What am I going to do about this ? '
All my staff advised me to stay away from it .
You have to be careful on issues like this .
Is this something a man should be involved in ?
The first time I talked about it on the floor , I felt very uncomfortable .
You 're talking about a little girl 's vagina . "
Representative Schroeder , who is retiring from the House of Representatives this year , has been working on the issue for more than 20 years .
Both said in recent years that they have been unable to get a ban through Congress .
They said some members simply could not believe that the practice actually goes on .
And some were worried that it would lead to proposals to abolish male circumcision .
This year , they said , their years of pestering their fellow members , combined with greater press attention to the issue , including a series of articles in The New York Times , and the Republican - controlled Congress 's desire to counter the tendency of female voters to support Democrats , led to passage of the law .
A separate measure to pressure African governments to take action in their own countries had another important ally in the Senate , Patrick Leahy , the ranking Democrat on the foreign operations subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee .
The provision , which takes effect a year from now , made United States support for loans from international financial institutions dependent on foreign governments carrying out educational campaigns against genital cutting .
It charges the secretary of the treasury with deciding whether U.S. representatives to the lending institutions will oppose or support loans and grants to countries .
" Some in the World Bank bureaucracy have always taken the position that if the United States suggests another country do something differently , the client countries will react against it , " Leahy said .
" In fact , it is through this kind of pressure that we 've had changes necessary in a number of countries , ranging from privatization in the former Soviet Union to female education in developing countries .
This requires diplomacy on the part of the international financial institution , but they have a lot of people paid a great deal of money to practice that diplomacy . "
Officials in such financial institutions as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund say that the success of the new American strategy will depend on how diplomatically it is carried out .
" If it highlights the problem , it will be constructive , " said Eric Chinje , external affairs officer for Africa at the World Bank .
" If it provides an instrument for fingerpointing , it will be counterproductive . "

The International Olympic Committee is considering lifting its previous blanket ban on athletes blogging , now considering blogs as a “ grey area ” that warrant further review .
Athletes have previously been banned from blogging under a rule in the Olympic charter which forbids them from partaking in journalism whilst competing at the Olympics , a rule which previously gained attention after the Japanese Olympic Committee forbid its athletes from blogging during the 2006 Turin Winter Olympics .
The SMH reports that IOC Athletes Commission Chairman Sergei Bubka has stated that “ In principle , the commission is not against [ blogging ] , but it ’s quite a delicate issue that we decided to investigate a little bit more ” .
Bubka went on to say that although blogging is a modern way for people to express their opinions , he did n’t believe that athletes should be able to blog without “ certain rules ” , and that blogs raised questions of privacy and potential conflicts with media and television rights …. getting to the real heart of the matter , it ’s really about the money .

Newsweek : Bush approval hits all time low of 28 percent RAW STORY
Published : Saturday May 5 , 2007 Print This Email This FROM A RELEASE .
NEWSWEEK Poll : Bush Hits All - Time Low - George W. Bush has the lowest presidential approval rating in a generation , and the leading Dems beat every major ' 08 Republican .
Coincidence ?
WEB EXCLUSIVE By Marcus Mabry , Newsweek May 5 , 2007 - It s hard to say which is worse news for Republicans : that George W. Bush now has the worst approval rating of an American president in a generation , or that he seems to be dragging every 08 Republican presidential candidate down with him .
But According to the new NEWSWEEK
Poll , the publics approval of Bush has sunk to 28 percent , an all - time low for this president in our poll , and a point lower than Gallup recorded for his father at Bush Sr.s nadir .
The last president to be this unpopular was Jimmy Carter who also scored a 28 percent approval in 1979 .
This remarkably low rating seems to be casting a dark shadow over the GOPs chances for victory in 08 .
The NEWSWEEK Poll finds each of the leading Democratic contenders beating the Republican frontrunners in head - to - head matchups .
Perhaps that explains why Republican candidates , participating in their first major debate this week , mentioned Bushs name only once , but Ronald Reagans 19 times .
( The debate was held at Reagans presidential library . )
When the NEWSWEEK Poll asked more than 1,000 adults on Wednesday and Thursday night ( before and during the GOP debate ) which president showed the greatest political courage -- meaning being brave enough to make the right decisions for the country , even if it jeopardized his popularity -- more respondents volunteered Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton ( 18 percent each ) than any other president .
Fourteen percent of adults named John F. Kennedy and 10 percent said Abraham Lincoln .
Only four percent mentioned George W. Bush .
( Then again , only five percent volunteered Franklin Roosevelt and only three percent said George Washington . )
A majority of Americans believe Bush is not politically courageous : 55 percent vs. 40 percent .
And nearly two out of three Americans ( 62 percent ) believe his recent actions in Iraq show he is stubborn and unwilling to admit his mistakes ,  compared to 30 percent who say Bushs actions demonstrate that he is willing to take political risks to do whats right .
Former New York City major Rudolph Giuliani receives the highest marks for having shown political courage in the past among the current major candidates from either party ( 48 percent of registered voters say he has ) , followed by Hillary Clinton at 43 percent , John McCain at 42 , John Edwards at 33 and Barack Obama at 30 .
Mitt Romney comes in last among the six leading candidates at 11 percent .
Clinton receives the highest marks for showing political courage in the current campaign , though , with 34 percent of voters saying she has , followed by 33 percent for Obama , 30 percent for Edwards , 28 for McCain , 25 for Giuliani and 11 for Romney .
Obama is seen as the most optimistic candidate ( a consistent measure of electability ) in either party : 51 percent of registered voters say the Illinois senator is optimistic , compared to 47 percent who say Edwards is , 46 percent for Clinton , 45 percent for Giuliani , 40 percent for McCain , and 27 for Romney .
While the poll has some high marks for Clinton , its not all good news .
Though the New York senator and former first lady aims to project an aura of inevitability that she will win the Democratic nomination , Obama beats the leading Republicans by larger margins than any other Democrat : besting Giuliani 50 to 43 percent , among registered voters ; beating McCain 52 to 39 percent , and defeating Romney 58 percent to 29 percent .
Like Obama , Edwards defeats the Republicans by larger margins than Clinton does : the former Democratic vice - presidential nominee outdistances Giuliani by six points , McCain by 10 and Romney by 37 , the largest lead in any of the head - to - head matchups .
Meanwhile , Sen. Clinton wins 49 percent to 46 percent against Giuliani , well within the polls margin of error ; 50 to 44 against McCain ; and 57 to 35 against Romney .
Where Clinton remains the undisputed champ is among Democrats .
When matched against her main rivals for the Democratic nomination , Clinton is the choice of 51 percent of Democratic and Democratic - leaning voters over Obamas 39 percent ; and she defeats Edwards 57 percent to 38 percent .
Obama has not substantially narrowed Clintons lead since the early March NEWSWEEK poll , where he trailed Clinton by 14 points .
Edwards has narrowed Clintons lead over him though .
Back in March Edwards trailed Clinton by 31 points ; now her lead is down to 19 points .
Giuliani , the Republican frontrunner , might want to look over his shoulder too .
Among Republicans and Republican - leaning voters , Giuliani leads McCain 56 percent to 41 percent ( 15 points ) .
But two months ago in the NEWSWEEK Poll , Giuliani held a 25 - point lead .
Both candidates trounce Romney , despite his placing first in the first - quarter fundraising sweepstakes .
Giuliani holds a staggering 51 - point lead over Romney and McCain holds a 41 - point lead over the former Massachusetts governor .
With 38 percent of Republicans dissatisfied with their partys field , things could get interesting if former Tennessee Sen .
Fred Thompson joins the race ; 46 percent of Republicans who are dissatisfied with their candidates say he should ( 34 percent say he shouldnt ) .
Of the much smaller 14 percent of Democrats who are dissatisfied with their candidates , 60 percent say they want former vice president and Democratic nominee Al Gore to join the fray .
Current New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg , a Democrat who changed parties shortly before running for mayor , receives unenthusiastic support from both Republicans and Democrats : 18 percent of dissatisfied Democrats would like to see Bloomberg join the Democratic field , and an even more anemic 14 percent of Republicans would like to see him join theirs .
All of the candidates can perhaps take some solace in Americans  dissatisfaction with the way things are going in the United States at this time ( only 25 percent are satisfied ; 71 percent dissatisfied ) .
American dissatisfaction ratings last hit 71 in the NEWSWEEK poll in May 2006 , at the height of the scandal over secret government wiretapping inside the United States .
The last time that even half of our survey respondents were happy with the direction of the country was in April 2003 , shortly after the start of the Iraq war .
With that many unhappy Americans , the nation should have a strong appetite for new leaders and new ideas .
The NEWSWEEK Poll was conducted by Princeton Survey Research Associates International May 2 - 3 .
Telephone interviews were conducted with 1,001 adults , age 18 and older ; the overall margin of error is plus or minus 4 percentage points .

In 2005 , the world ’s largest all - wood treehouse was built amongst the lime trees of the non-profit Alnwick Garden in Northumberland County , UK .
This 6,000 square foot treehouse is comprised of walkways , cottages , shops , a restaurant , and play areas .
It is even wheelchair accessible , and holds close to 1,000 people , so everyone can play .
The Treehouse from Outside :
The treehouse ’s wooden suspension bridge :
Inside the treehouse ( fireplace , gift shop , restaurant ) :
It takes a lot of support to hold up the treehouse :
If you have kids , you may want to wait until they ’re older and tired of treehouses to take them to Alnwick .
Otherwise , you can be certain their current playset or treehouse will never be used again .
Thanks to Alnwick Garden , Chung - tung Yeh and fatcontroller for most of these pictures .
LATE UPDATE :
Since a lot of you feel strongly about the definition of a treehouse , I ’ve added a quick poll .
My vote is that it ’s a treehouse since it ’s suspended off the ground and amongst the trees , but I ’m looking forward to your votes :
DIGG THIS
I judge from the applause at the most recent Republican presidential debate that the people in the audience at least still equate patriotism with supporting the war of the day .
Rep . Ron Paul of Texas , the only intellectually honest candidate in the bunch , correctly pointed out that it was our policy of interventionism that caused the attack on 9/11 .
Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani , intensely uncomfortable at having been forced to talk about his liberal positions on abortion , gun control and gay rights , leaped at the opportunity to reprimand Paul for suggesting that we had invited the attack .
" I ’ve never heard that , " Giuliani snapped , showing that he is ignorant even on matters of security , and demanded that Paul retract it .
He did n’t , of course .
But Giuliani got a big round of applause , as if he had come to the defense of America rather than just cleverly change the subject .
Osama bin Laden , the author of those attacks , has said quite plainly , publicly and explicitly that the attack was prompted by our intervention in the Muslim world .
It is outrageous that Giuliani claims not to know that , given that his whole campaign is based on his claim of being the best - qualified leader in matters of security and the so - called war on terror .
Actually , Giuliani is n’t an expert on security .
He ’s a lawyer and a political hack .
The attack on 9/11 was a political gift of the gods to him .
He walked up and down the street in front of the television cameras , gave speeches and went to funerals , and for that he received the accolades of the press .
Giuliani is not a leader .
He is a cynical exploiter .
He exploited the attack the day it happened , and he ’s exploited it since to make a fortune posing as an expert security consultant .
Now he hopes to exploit the tragedy , which , like the president , he had done nothing to prevent , to get the Republican nomination for the presidency .
By demonstrating his ignorance of the cause of the attack , he has disqualified himself from consideration .
Sad to say , Sen .
John McCain of Arizona is not the man he was seven years ago .
He ’s gotten old , and in his old age has become an evader and an equivocator .
He makes the same tired prediction of terrible consequences if we get out of Iraq , but he has no solutions except to do more of the same .
If he were elected , he would be older than Ronald Reagan when he took office .
And Reagan was too old , in my opinion .
As for al - Qaida taking root in Iraq , he is apparently unaware of how the tribal sheiks in the western part of the country have annihilated al - Qaida in their region .
One of the sheiks boasted recently , " We did in three months what the Americans have n’t been able to do in four years . "
Trust me , al - Qaida will not survive our departure from Iraq , which is why al - Qaida , above all , wants us to stay .
The only ones who impressed me were Paul , former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Rep. Duncan Hunter of California .
Rep. Tom Tancredo of Colorado came up with the best line of the night .
Remarking on the liberals trying to become conservatives , he quipped , " There have been a lot of conversions tonight , but the only conversion I trust was the conversion on the road to Damascus , not the conversions on the road to Des Moines . "
It got a good laugh .
Our presidential election system is broken .
By front - loading the primaries , only multimillionaires can raise the money necessary to get well known .
The lesser - known — and this year the more - qualified — men have an uphill struggle .

Es gibt nicht nur Guantanamo Florian Rötzer
Auch in anderen Gefängnissen wie in Bagram werden Hunderte von " feindlichen Kämpfern " unbegrenzt und ohne Rechte willkürlich festgehalten
Die Berichterstattung hat sich wie die deutsche Bundeskanzlerin auf Guantanamo eingeschossen .
Angela Merkel ist aber wohl der Meinung , dass der symbolischen Kritik Genüge getan ist , wenn sie einmal Guantanamo erwähnt .
Gleichermaßen verfährt die deutsche Regierung , die auch kein Interesse daran zu haben scheint , dem Fall al - Masri sowie den Gefangenentransporten und den Gefangenenlagern nachzugehen , die der CIA zugeschrieben werden .
Gerade al - Masri wäre auch deswegen interessant , weil dieser nach seiner Verschleppung monatelang in Afghanistan festgehalten wurde .
Dort – und anderswo – gibt es noch weitere „ Guantanamos “ .
Auf das größte Gefangenenlager in Afghanistan hat nun die New York Times in einem Artikel wieder einmal aufmerksam gemacht .
Auch Afghanistan ist wie der Irak ein befreites Land , wenn es nach dem Weißen Haus geht – und es droht wie der Irak im blutigen Chaos zu versinken .
Das neu gewählte Parlament ist zu guten Teilen in den Händen von Warlords und Islamisten , die Taliban breiten sich erneut aus , während es nur einige halbwegs gesicherte Zonen gibt , es werden vermehrt Selbstmordanschläge durchgeführt , der Drogenanbau gedeiht und Armut und Arbeitslosigkeit sind schlimmer denn je .
Und in großen Teilen des Landes hat sich auch nicht die Situation der Frauen verbessert .
Im Grenzgebiet von Afghanistan und Pakistan wurde sogar ein neuer islamischer Staat ausgerufen , in dem es Trainingslager gibt , sich für eine Frühjahrsoffensive Selbstmordattentäter sammeln und öffentlich angebliche Verräter und Kriminelle exekutiert werden .
Die Menschenrechtssituation und die Rechtsstaatlichkeit in einem solchen „ failed state “ sind gering .
Kein Vorbild sind hier wiederum die USA , aber auch nicht andere Staaten wie Deutschland , die Truppen stationiert haben , aber die systematischen Menschenrechtsverletzungen der Gefangenenlager stillschweigend billigen .
Das größte US - Gefängnis befindet sich in Bagram , in dem bekanntlich Gefangene auch gefoltert wurden , einzelne bis zum Tod.
Ebenso wie in Guantanamo und anderen Lagern werden hier Menschen , mutmaßliche „ feindliche Kämpfer “ , die von der US - Regierung zu Outlaws erklärt wurden , ohne alle Rechte und ohne Anklage teils über Jahre festgehalten .
Während nach Abu Ghraib vor allem die Verhältnisse in Guantanamo zum Gegenstand öffentlicher Diskussionen und rechtlicher Prozeduren wurden , sind die Hunderten von Gefangenen , die alleine in Bagram eingesperrt sind , dem Vergessen überlassen .
Weil Guantanamo zum Symbol wurde , werden die Missstände dort und das menschenrechtswidrige Vorgehen der US - Regierung im Umgang mit verschleppten Verdächtigen auch symbolisch diskutiert und abgehandelt .
Sollte Guantanamo , wie Bundeskanzlerin Merkel zaghaft forderte , tatsächlich geschlossen werden , wozu es keine Anzeichen bei der US - Regierung gibt , wäre der Unrechtszustand im „ globalen Krieg gegen den Terror “ seitens der US - Regierung , die diesen im Namen von Freiheit , Demokratie und Rechtsstaatlichkeit führt , keineswegs beendet .
Die US - Regierung scheint im Augenblick dazu zu neigen , möglichst viele der Gefangenen , gegen die nie eine Anklage erhoben wurde und niemals werden wird , abzuschieben und keine neuen Gefangenen mehr nach Guantanamo zu schaffen .
Der National Security Council habe dies bereits Ende 2004 beschlossen .
Damit würden auch die Flüge über befreundete Länder und die damit verbundene Kritik vermieden werden .
Bagram war zuvor eine Sammelstelle für Menschen , die in der Region gefangen genommen und mitunter auch nach Guantanamo überstellt wurden .
Nun werden diese Gefangenen , so die New York Times , in Bagram auf unbegrenzte Zeit festgehalten .
Bis zu 600 Menschen seien hier letztes Jahr eingesperrt gewesen , darunter auch Gefangene der CIA .
Durchschnittlich werden die Gefangenen über 14 Monate festgehalten .
Gegenüber Guantanamo , das nach und nach aus- und umgebaut wurde , sind die Bedingungen in Bagram sehr viel schlechter .
Während in Guantanamo unter strengen Auflagen Kongressabgeordnete und Journalisten herumgeführt werden , ist Bagram ein jeder Öffentlichkeit verschlossener
Ort geblieben .
Menschenrechtsgruppen sagen , so die New York Times , dass sich die Situation seit 2003 verbessert habe , Militärs beteuern nur , dass sie versuchen , die Gefangenen menschlich zu behandeln .
Zwar gibt es in Bagram „ Enemy Combatant Review Boards “ , bei denen wie in Guantanamo die Grundlage der Inhaftierung jährlich überprüft wird , aber hier werden nicht einmal die Gefangenen gehört .
Viele der Gefangenen aus Bagram , aber auch aus Guantanamo , sollen schließlich in das größte afghanische Gefängnis bei Kabul , Pul - e - Charkhi , kommen .
Hier werden neben gewöhnlichen Kriminellen auch mutmaßliche Taliban - und al - Qaida - Angehörige festgehalten .
Gerade wurde ein Trakt in dem großen Komplex abgeschlossen , nachdem dort Hunderte von Gefangenen revoltierten .

下記資料 はWHOが2000 年に公開した 『自殺の回避 : メディア・プロフェッショナルのためのリソース』の抄訳です。
本書は実質2～3ページの小冊子です。 第一に、 「 メディアでの不適切な取り上げ方が、 自殺行動を増加させる」という研究結果を示し、
第二に、ではどのようなニュースの扱い方をすればいいのかを説明しています。
ここでは序文、研究史などは省き、実際的な指針の部分をほぼ全訳しました。
現代においては、 私的なニュースサイト、ブログなども重要なメディアであることを念頭に置いてください。
テレビや新聞は広告収入で成り立つメディアであり、
過酷な視聴率・販売部数競争にさらされているため、
どうしても扇情主義やその場しのぎの単純化に走る面があります。 個人のブログなどは、 完全に独自財源を確保して、小さな問題でも長く静かに追えるという意味で、
最もプロフェッショナルなメディアとも言えるのです。

メディアの報道の自殺への影響
Philipsらによれば、 自殺についてのメディア露出と後続する自殺の数は直接に相関する
（ Philips DP , Lesnya K , Paight DJ . Suicide and media .
In : Maris RW , Berman AL , Maltsberger JT , eds.
Assessment and prediction of suicide .
New York , Guilford , 1992 : 499-519 .）。 有名人が関係する自殺の場合特に顕著な影響がある
（ Wasserman D. Imitation and suicide : a re-examination of the Werther effect .
American sociological review , 1984 , 49 : 427-436.）。
フィクション作品に描かれた自殺が影響を持つかどうかは、
対立する報告があり、結論が出ていない
（ Hawton K et al .
Effects of a drug overdose in a television drama on presentations to hospital for self - poisoning : time series and questionnaire study .
British medical journal , 1999 , 318 : 972-977.）。
最近ではインターネットによって新しい状況が生まれている。
自殺を支援するウェブサイトがある一方、自殺を防ごうとするサイトもある。
現時点（2000年）で、自殺に対するインターネットの影響の系統的研究はない。
概して、テレビ・新聞などによるノンフィクションのニュース報道の悪影響については、
統計的に有意と認められる十分な証拠がある。
臨床医と研究者は、 自殺についてのニュースそれ自体が自殺を増加させるわけではなく、 ある種の報道の仕方がその要因になると認めている。 逆に言えば、別の種類の報道の仕方であれば、模倣自殺防止に役立つこともありうる。 ただ、 自殺について伝えることには、 常に自殺 が
「普通」のことであるかのような印象をもたらす可能性がつきまとう。
反復的・継続的な取り上げ方をすると、特に思春期の者や若い成人が自殺について思い詰める傾向がある。
意識の高いメディアが適切で啓発的な取り上げ方をするのであれば、 ニュースは役立つ。
自殺一般についてのニュースの扱い方
自殺率の国際比較は非常に難しい。 データを記録する方法が国によって大きく異なるからである。
統計値は過小である傾向があり、実数との誤差は国によって異なる。
その主な原因は自殺と断定する基準の違いである。
名誉感情、社会的・政治的要因、保険の制限も関係する。
結果として、自殺が事故または原因不明の死として伝えられることがありうる。
このような誤差は高齢者では20-25%、それ以外では6-12%と考えられる。
自殺未遂を記録する国際基準は存在しない。
未遂者の約25%しか医療機関を訪れないため、未遂も含めた場合、
ほとんどの自殺は報告も記録もされていない。
したがって、以下の注意が必要である。
統計値は慎重に正確に解釈する。
真正で信頼できるソースを使う。
たとえ時間がなくても、即興的になされたコメントは慎重に扱う。
少数のデータによる一般化は特に注意。 「 相次ぐ自殺 」 「世界でも自殺率の最も高い場所」といった表現は避けなければならない。
自殺行動を社会・文化の変化・悪化と関係づけようとするのは慎むべき。
特定の自殺についてのニュースの扱い方
センセーショナルな取り上げ方は絶対にしてはいけない。
有名人が関係しているときはなおさらである。
ニュースで取り上げるのは可能な範囲で最小限にとどめる。 誇張は避ける。 死体や自殺の方法・場所に関する写真は避ける。
表紙ページのトップなどは自殺についての記事の場所として絶対に望ましくない。
自殺方法の詳細には触れない。 研究によると、自殺の手段や頻度はメディアの取り上げ方から重大な影響を受けることが分かっている。
特定の場所（橋・崖・高層建築物・鉄道など）は伝統的に自殺に使われるが、
その事実を広めると使用者がさらに増えるリスクがある。
自殺を謎めいたものとして報道してはいけないし、単純化し過ぎてもいけない。
自殺は決して単一の要因や出来事の結果ではない。
通例、心身の疾患、中毒性のある製品の過度の使用、家族の不和、対人関係の摩擦、
ストレスなどの多くの要因の複雑な相互作用の結果である。
多くの要因が絡んでいることを伝えるのなら有益である。
自殺は破産・受験失敗・性的虐待などの個人的問題への対処法として伝えられてはならない。
家族や生存者の名誉感情や心理的苦悩に配慮しなければならない。
自殺者を 「理念に殉ずる」などと美化したり、崇拝することは、
多感な人々に対して「自分たちの社会は自殺行動を名誉とみなす」と示唆する結果につながりかねない。
そうではなく、人の死への悲嘆に重点が置かれなければならない。
自殺未遂者の身体障害（脳障害、 まひなど）の記述は、抑止力として働きうる。
利用できるヘルプについての情報提供
メディアは、自殺についてのニュースとともに下記の情報を伝えることによって、
自殺回避に貢献することができる。
利用可能な精神保健サービスやヘルプラインについての、最新の電話番号と住所のリスト
自殺行動の前兆としてどのようなものがあるかの周知
うつがしばしば自殺行動と関係すること、うつは治療可能な状態であることを伝える
未遂者に対する同情のメッセージと、あれば未遂者の支援グループの電話番号を提供
まとめ
すべきこ と
事実の公表にあたって専門家の助言を得る
「 既遂 」 「 未遂 」と表現 し 「 成功 」 「 失敗」と表現しな い
関係あるデータだけを表紙以外に掲載
ヘルプラインや公共リソースの情報提供
リスクの指標・兆候の周知
すべきでないこ と
写真や遺書は公開してはいけない
使用された手段の詳細を伝えてはいけない
原因を単純化してはいけない
美化したり扇情的に扱ってはいけない
宗教的・文化的類型化をしてはいけない
いかなる非難もしな い

日本のヘルプラインの例
前兆
それまでそんなことを考えていなかった人が衝動的に自殺することはまずなく、
普通は、前から悩んでいるものです。 そして、そのことは何らかの行動として表れることがあります。例えば、
悩んでいる言動。 アディクション。 開き直りの言動。 「 もうどうでもいいよ、何もかも」など。 日記や見られたくないものを捨てたり、身辺の整理をする。 態度や言動の急激な変化。 自傷行為 。
家族や友人がこれらに気付き手を差し伸べることができれば一番ですが、
人間は繊細・複雑であり、 往々気付いてほしいと思いつつ同時に「気付かれたくない」と隠すことがあります。
「サインに気付いてあげられなかった」のように他者や自分を責めるべきではありません。
「サイン」どころかハッキリと「死にたい」と言ってる人を、
プロフェッショナルのベテランが助けられないこともあります。
逆に、友人の何気ない優しさで救われることもあるかもしれません。
いくつかのコメン ト
死にたい場 合
死ぬと決めたら慎重に計画しないと、 死にきれず、動けず、善後策も取れないという今より悪い事態になる。
死ぬのが絶対にいけない、ということはない。 言えるのは、多くの場合、死は目的でなく、
手段として選択されるというコト。 （＝別のもっとラクでうまい解決法があるかもしれない。）
人間は思い詰めてようやく五分五分。 「 死にたい」という言葉は「生きたい」が半分以上入ってる。
生きる意欲も持っているから苦悩する。
一般に
手に負えないと思ったら、助けを求める。 歯が痛くなったら歯医者に行くのと同じこと。
「 救い商法」にだまされない 。

Researchers look beyond the birth of the Universe
PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY NEWS RELEASE
Posted : May 15 , 2006
According to Einstein 's general theory of relativity , the Big Bang represents The Beginning , the grand event at which not only matter but space - time itself was born .
While classical theories offer no clues about existence before that moment , a research team at Penn State has used quantum gravitational calculations to find threads that lead to an earlier time .
" General relativity can be used to describe the universe back to a point at which matter becomes so dense that its equations do n't hold up , " says Abhay Ashtekar , Holder of the Eberly Family Chair in Physics and Director of the Institute for Gravitational Physics and Geometry at Penn State .
" Beyond that point , we needed to apply quantum tools that were not available to Einstein . "
By combining quantum physics with general relativity , Ashtekar and two of his post - doctoral researchers , Tomasz Pawlowski and Parmpreet Singh , were able to develop a model that traces through the Big Bang to a shrinking universe that exhibits physics similar to ours .
In research reported in the current issue of Physical Review Letters , the team shows that , prior to the Big Bang , there was a contracting universe with space - time geometry that otherwise is similar to that of our current expanding universe .
As gravitational forces pulled this previous universe inward , it reached a point at which the quantum properties of space - time cause gravity to become repulsive , rather than attractive .
" Using quantum modifications of Einstein 's cosmological equations , we have shown that in place of a classical Big Bang there is in fact a quantum Bounce , " says Ashtekar .
" We were so surprised by the finding that there is another classical , pre-Big Bang universe that we repeated the simulations with different parameter values over several months , but we found that the Big Bounce scenario is robust . "
While the general idea of another universe existing prior to the Big Bang has been proposed before , this is the first mathematical description that systematically establishes its existence and deduces properties of space - time geometry in that universe .
The research team used loop quantum gravity , a leading approach to the problem of the unification of general relativity with quantum physics , which also was pioneered at the Penn State Institute of Gravitational Physics and Geometry .
In this theory , space - time geometry itself has a discrete ' atomic ' structure and the familiar continuum is only an approximation .
The fabric of space is literally woven by one - dimensional quantum threads .
Near the Big - Bang , this fabric is violently torn and the quantum nature of geometry becomes important .
It makes gravity strongly repulsive , giving rise to the Big Bounce .
" Our initial work assumes a homogenous model of our universe , " says Ashtekar .
" However , it has given us confidence in the underlying ideas of loop quantum gravity .
We will continue to refine the model to better portray the universe as we know it and to better understand the features of quantum gravity . "
The research was sponsored by the National Science Foundation , Alexander von Humboldt Foundation , and the Penn State Eberly College of Science .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President George W. Bush won a battle over nearly $ 100 billion to fund the Iraq war as congressional Democrats on Tuesday abandoned troop withdrawal efforts for now but pledged to try again in July .
Instead of setting schedules for withdrawing U.S. troops , it appeared the Democratic - run Congress and the Republican White House agreed for the first time to include conditions prodding Baghdad to make better progress toward quelling violence or risk losing some U.S. reconstruction aid .
“ We ’ve been led to believe that that is the language that is likely to be in the final version , ” Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky told reporters .
That provision passed the Senate last week , with a few Democrats supporting it .
At the time , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada said of the language crafted by Virginia Republican Sen. John Warner : “ If you look in the dictionary under ‘ weak ’ the Warner amendment would be listed under it . ”
White House spokesman Tony Snow said the measure would provide “ the funding and flexibility the forces need .
That ’s what we ’ve wanted all along . ”
On May 1 , Bush vetoed Congress ’ first version of this year ’s emergency war funds bill because it set an October 1 deadline for starting to pull most of the 147,000 soldiers out of Iraq , a goal of anti-war Democrats .
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer , a Maryland Democrat , said lawmakers were putting the finishing touches on a new bill , and acknowledged the political realities .

“ The president has made it very clear he ’s not going to sign timelines ( for withdrawing troops ) .
We ca n’t pass timelines over his veto , ” he told reporters .
DISAPPOINTMENT FOR SOME DEMOCRATS
That will be a disappointment for some Democrats who say they won control of Congress last November largely because voters wanted to see an end to the 4 - year - old war in Iraq .
But it was welcome news for Republican leaders who have argued Congress should not be “ micro - managing ” the war .
“ Democrats have finally conceded defeat in their effort to include mandatory surrender dates in a funding bill for the troops , ” said House Minority Leader John Boehner of Ohio .
Some Democrats have predicted for months that it would take longer to force troop withdrawals .
They argue that even with a weaker bill , they have ended four years of “ rubber stamp ” war funding bills of the previous Republican - run Congress .
Hoyer and Reid said Democrats would continue pushing for a “ change in direction ” in Iraq , where at least 3,420 U.S. soldiers have been killed and more than 34,000 wounded .
“ Certainly we ’ll do it in July when Mr. Murtha ’s bill is on the floor , ” Hoyer said .
In the meantime , Democrats are fully funding Bush ’s war financing request .
Pennsylvania Democratic Rep. John Murtha has led efforts in the House of Representatives to end U.S. combat in the Iraq war .
In July , Murtha will shepherd a military funding bill through the House for the next fiscal year , starting October 1 .
Bush and most Republicans have argued that setting dates for withdrawing U.S. troops would rob military commanders of the flexibility they need to conduct the war .
Despite those charges , even some congressional Republicans , Boehner among them , have spoken of autumn as the timeframe for reassessing progress in Iraq and possibly producing “ Plan B . ”
Under the Democrats ’ latest strategy , the war funding bill will pay for combat in Iraq and Afghanistan through September .
Aides said there would be benchmarks for measuring Iraq ’s progress toward stability and setting up a competent army .
There would also be consequences for Iraq not meeting the benchmarks , the aides said -- likely to be limits on about $ 1.6 billion in reconstruction aid , as in Warner ’s proposal .
The Astra 1L satellite weighed about 4,500 kg at launch
Rocket blasts off
The immense , 50 m - long vehicle powered away from Kourou in French Guiana at 1929 local time ( 2229 GMT ) .
The Astra 1L and Galaxy 17 platforms it put in space will deliver TV and other services to Europe and North America .
Friday 's mission represented the second launch of the year for the Ariane 5 and its 32nd flight overall .
The launch was delayed by a day because of poor weather over the spaceport on Thursday .
The rocket is the workhorse of Europe 's commercial launch service , operated by the French - based Arianespace company .
In its heavy - lift , or ECA , configuration , the vehicle produces 13,000 kilonewtons of thrust at launch - equivalent to 20 Concorde jets at take - off .
Watching the launch in Kourou was US space agency ( Nasa ) Administrator Dr Mike Griffin .
The Nasa chief came to see the rocket that will begin to supply the International Space Station later this year .
Europe is preparing a new cargo ship called the Automated Transfer Vehicle ( ATV ) , which will carry 7.5 tonnes of experimental equipment , spare parts , food , air and water to astronauts working on the orbiting outpost .
The ATV is designed to ride into space on top of an Ariane 5 .

Cigarette smoking among American teens continues 8 - year decline

Overall teen drug use continues gradual decline , but use of inhalants rises >
Smoking rates among American teens continue to decline , with the proportion who are current smokers in 2004 down from recent peak levels in the mid-1990s by one - half among the nation ’s 8th and 10th graders and by a third among 12th graders .
“ That ’s the good news , and it is good news indeed , ” says Lloyd Johnston , the researcher who is principal investigator of the Monitoring the Future study .
“ The bad news is that the decline has decelerated sharply in the past two years , though it still continues for the most part . ”
And the number of teen smokers is still substantial : 25 percent of 12th graders reported smoking in the prior 30 days , along with 16 percent of 10th graders and 9 percent of 8th graders .
The study has been funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse under a series of investigator - initiated , competitive research grants made to U - M .
The authors of the forthcoming report on the 2004 findings are Johnston , Patrick O’Malley , Jerald Bachman and John Schulenberg — all psychologists and research professors at the Institute for Social Research .
After a sharp increase in teen smoking rates in the early 1990s , there was a turnaround after 1996 in the lower grades and after 1997 among 12th graders .
The investigators conjecture that a number of factors contributed to that turnaround and to the substantial decline that followed it , including :
The intense adverse publicity suffered by the tobacco industry during the 1990s , as their practices were brought under public scrutiny ;
The master settlement agreement between the state attorneys general and the tobacco industry that led to a number of changes in marketing practices ;
A sharp rise in cigarette prices , partly as a result of the industry ’s need to recoup monies lost in the settlement ;
The ending of the Joe Camel logo ;
The cessation of billboard advertising as part of the settlement ;
The initiation of anti-smoking ads by a number of states and nationally by the American Legacy Foundation , which was created and funded under the settlement .
“ We know that young people have come to see cigarette smoking as more dangerous , while they also have become less accepting of cigarette use , and these changes continued into 2004 , ” Johnston says .
A number of attitudes about smoking shifted in a negative direction .
For example , the proportion of 12th graders who say that they prefer to date people who do not smoke rose from 64 percent in 1977 to 72 percent in 2002 , where it remains in 2004 .
There are some important subgroup differences in teen smoking .
The gender differences in smoking are quite small at present , but the differences associated with planning to go to college , or not , are very large .
Students who plan to complete a four - year college education are much less likely to smoke than those who do not have such plans .
Youth living in rural areas and small town areas are considerably more likely to smoke than those living in metropolitan areas .
Those students with more educated parents are less likely to smoke , particularly at younger ages .
Finally , African American youngsters continue to have a substantially lower rate of smoking than do whites or Hispanics , and whites tend to have the highest rates of the three groups .
Students ’ perceptions about how easy it would be to get cigarettes if they wanted some have shown a considerable decline in the lower grades since the mid-1990s , perhaps in part because of the sharp decline in the number of active smokers .
Most of the decline in perceived access , however , has occurred among those who have never smoked and among past smokers .
Active smokers seem to know where to find access .
“ Whether we will see teen smoking continue to decline in the future is likely to depend on what actions society and the tobacco companies take , ” Johnston says .

So goes the evolving political wisdom about whether a third - party presidential bid by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg would be viable .
On Tuesday , when the billionaire businessman turned politician announced he was formally leaving the GOP to become an independent , he sent tremors through the nation 's political chattering classes .
No third - party presidential candidate has ever won the White House , let alone a former mayor of New York .
Yet no other third party candidate has ever had Mr. Bloomberg 's unique combination of qualities : $ 4 billion to $ 5 billion in the bank , a solid record in high elective office , and a penchant for doing the seemingly impossible .
" At some point in American history – I 'll be dead probably – ... we are going to have an independent president , " says Larry Sabato , political analyst at the University of Virginia .
" The conditions necessary are present for 2008 : a very unhappy electorate with neither party producing a candidate who can bring people together .
So it 's not impossible . "
But it is improbable , he adds .
And other political analysts agree .
It is n't because Bloomberg does n't have charisma .
The short , divorced , Jewish father of two has proven he has plenty of that , winning fans in working - class Queens and on the upscale Upper East Side .
The CEO turned top city executive has governed with a no - nonsense , nonpartisan , and results - oriented politics .
In his statement announcing the severance of his ties with the GOP , Bloomberg made it clear that he'd like to bring his brand of pragmatic politics to a national level .
" Any successful elected executive knows that real results are more important than partisan battles , and that good ideas should take precedence over rigid adherence to any particular political ideology , " the statement said .
" Working together , there 's no limit to what we can do . "
But , of course , there are the numbers to consider – in the electoral college .
To win , Bloomberg would need 270 votes .
" How does he win 270 ?
I could eat my hat , but I think it 's as close to impossible a thing in politics where everything is possible , " says Doug Muzzio , political analyst at Baruch College in New York .
So , if it is unlikely that this man who likes to win is setting himself up to lose , could Bloomberg have other motives for leaving the GOP ?
He insists that he 's not planning a presidential announcement .
Some pundits say Bloomberg 's real aim in making such a national splash is to keep his political clout in New York .
He 's technically a lame duck .
He 'll be out of office in exactly 924 days .
Yet another motive for Bloomberg 's decision could be to create a new national platform , Mr. Muzzio and others say .
" Number one , he 's articulating a national agenda that in Bloomberg 's sense is nonpartisan that bridges ideology and goes for practical results , and he's the spokesman for that agenda , " says Muzzio .
" The second thing is that he creates an organization to move that agenda , and the third step would be to become the candidate to lead that organization .
He 's certainly at stage one , and he 's done it very consciously . "
Did you start to hear here and there songs flowing in the streets ?
Yes it is christmas .
Olivier Théreaux and Jean - Guilhem Rouel ( W3C ) , and Peter Zhelezniakov ( Sun Microsystems ) worked hard with help from users , translators , developers to offer a new version of the CSS validator just in time for the 10 years anniversary of CSS .
This new layout was designed a few months ago , and you may have seen it already if you have used the preview of Unicorn , the future swiss - knife for all your Web documents checking needs .
The mountain showing in the banner is the Mont Fuji as we can see it from the W3C Office in Japan , hosted by Keio University .
It is barely visible during summer time , but every winter morning , it shines on the horizon line , covered with snow .
Real - World CSS : CSS 2.1
Until now , the CSS validator was able to check stylesheets in all flavours of CSS including CSS 3 and SVG stylesheets , but by default , it would validate against CSS 2.0 , the latest fully standardized CSS .
While CSS 2.1 is still under development , it is already the stylesheet language of choices for real world Web designers .
CSS 2.1 is also reflecting the current state of implementations in browsers .
Therefore , the validator now by default checks stylesheets against the CSS 2.1 specification .
Warnings and Errors
The CSS validator does not only check for mistakes in CSS syntax , it also tries to warn its users upon finding constructs that are deprecated , dangerous , or potentially inaccessible .
For these checks , the validator issues warnings .
The warnings were never very well explained or introduced , and some of the warnings about potential accessibility issues such as the lack of background color declaration were confusing .
We made these warnings less visible ( one can still trigger them with the “ show all warnings ” option ) and we will be working to make the tests smarter .
We have redesigned results layouts , adopting a similar style for errors and warnings .
The validator now displays the warnings in the following fashion :
the first column gives the line number where the warning has been triggered in the stylesheet ;
the second column gives the context of the warning , usually the selector if any ;
finally the third column is the associated message with the type of warning .
There are three levels of warnings identified by shades of light red : more important ( darker ) to less important ( lighter ) .
Errors unlike warnings have no levels .
They have to be fixed in any cases .
A World Wide Tool for a World Wide Web
English only tools are impossible to use for the majority of people .
Warnings or error messages , or even a user interface in a foreign language slow down the adoption of good practices .
With the tremendous efforts of volunteers , the user interface and documentation as well as error and warning messages have been translated in the following languages : German , Spanish , French , Dutch , Japanese , Chinese , and now also in Polish and Italian .
The more , the merrier : if you want to volunteer for another language , please visit the wiki page for translations .
What ’s next ?
We need you !
The CSS Validator is one of the many open source tools developed by W3C and led by the enthusiasm of the Web community .

A friend of mine living here in Japan wrote this to me yesterday .
Read it right to the end .
It will chill you to the bone .
You wo n’t be disappointed , and may even rethink a few things in your own life , or maybe make a different New Year ’s resolution than the one you had in mind .
〜★〜
Well it ’s coming up on another year here in Japan ; hard to believe seven or eight years have gone by already .
2006 was a great year as was 1999 - 2005 here in Tokyo .
I ’ve got a great life here .
Great friends , great job , great fiancée ( oh yeah I got engaged to Kyoko last month in Italy ) and low - stress which is key to having a great life !
Tokyo continues to be a fabulous city .
Sure it lacks in architectural finesse ( I suspect it was much cooler looking before the Yanks burned it to a cinder 60 years back ) , but it more than makes up for it in entertainment opportunities , quality of life and the bizarre .
Where else can you have thousands of people lining up for the opening day of Japan ’s debut of Krispy Kreme !?
There are already two huge chains of donut shops in Japan .
Why another ?
And this one is even more fattening !
Or canned oden ( Japanese chunky soup ) from a vending machine - a camera crew and a snaking line 20 people deep waiting for their turn at the machine ( these people are so patient ! ) , or a 500 - person Japanese orgy flick that is circling the internet ( not one of them wearing a condom ) .
I was n’t in it !
Next time .
This past weekend Kyoko and I took the Shinkansen ( bullet train ) for about 4 hours southwest of Tokyo to Fukuyama , near Hiroshima .
We were visiting Kyoko ’s family ( also visited some of the dead relatives ’ graves ) whom I have met on a number of occasions , and to meet the father ’s side of the family whom I had n’t met before .
Our first stop was at one of her uncles ’ house .
The Japanese tend to really take to foreigners for the most part and are quite accommodating to them in their homes .
We all hit it off right away and had an enjoyable time .
Prior to eating , Kyoko prayed in front of the family ’s Buddhist shrine ( 仏壇 , butsudan ) where the deceased members of the immediate family are honored .
These shrines are found in most Japanese homes and are incredibly beautiful , ornate fixtures that are often built into the wall like a niche .
There is usually some fresh fruit offered up for their souls and in this case a couple of large red and green apples and a pack of OREOS sat on a metal tray which really got my mouth watering .
We had an enormous feast .
Temaki zushi , which is kind of a Japanese burrito minus the beans and gas ; basically sashimi ( raw fish ) that you roll into a sheet of dried seaweed along with rice and maybe some salmon eggs , sprouts , etc. also had oden atsukan ( which is HOT sake – by the way the bad quality sake is usually heated up ) and all kinds of other goodies .
I was seated next to Kyoko ’s uncle whose name escapes me … we ’ll call him Jessie .
Simple man , has a farm that he tends , filthy fingernails , ( his thumbnails looked like small inverted teaspoons absolutely caked with dried dirt from the garden ) a dog tied - up in the front with muddy paws and mine - like excrement piles surrounding his limited tether ( I ’m assuming this was the dog ’s excrement and not Uncle Jessie ’s , after all he is pretty outdoorsy ) , a wife and three grown children , and two grand children that he just ca n’t get enough of .
Crazy about his grandkids !
For some things there just are n’t any cultural divides .
Oh and he would n’t be seated at my mother ’s table thats for sure !
We immediately became drinking buddies and I could hardly get one gulp of atsukan down before he filled my glass back up .
Granted , sake glasses are thimble - sized but nonetheless it was always spilling over the edge .
The more he drank the funnier he got and the more embarrassed his wife looked .
But I thought it was great .
It was a very memorable time with my future in - laws ( wow that gives me the chills ) and after we said our goodbyes we were off to see MORE relatives … dead and alive .
Basically the entire day was spent going from house to house to grave to rest home making introductions , offering up prayers for dead folks I ’ve only seen black and white photos of , and chatting .
Towards the end of the day while in the car I received an e-mail on my phone from an old girlfriend from a few years ago .
We ’ll call her Keiko .
Scratch that , that ’s her real name , uh … Kumiko .
It was a short message .
‘ Hi how have you been ? ’
I had n’t heard from her in probably a year and a half or so ; we occasionally mail one another to touch base .
I wrote back with my regards .
And then she wrote back again with a message that rattled my inner core .
‘ I have really bad news , I ’m 6 months pregnant and I found out I have HIV ’ .
This ca n’t be real I thought .
I mean Kumiko is an office lady who is 26 , educated , barely drinks alcohol let alone take drugs , and does n’t sleep around .
She has only had a handful of boyfriends with whom she was monogamous while she dated them .
She does n’t fit the profile .
She said she was trying to determine where she got infected .
I then began to fear the worst .
My God , I might have it .
We did n’t always practice safe sex , in fact I think we rarely did .
She then said she ’s already checked with her other boyfriends who all said they were tested and are HIV negative .
I ’d never had a test before .
It was this that really made me take pause .
I could be the carrier of this death - wish .
I had a very difficult time maintaining my composure for the remainder of the weekend .
I continued to e-mail Kumiko for the next day trading information about her current boyfriend , who is the father of her unborn baby , and as to whether or not he has it .
He does n’t .
Basically I was the only link missing from the ‘ who ’s got it ? ’
I was a mess .
In my mind , life as I knew it was done , finished , in the 9th inning with 2 strikes 2 outs .
My first thought was Kyoko and how could I tell her I have HIV / AIDS .
This would end our marriage plans for sure .
Then my mom – that would absolutely break her heart .
Then the thought of calling the other old girlfriends and telling them they may have been exposed was horrifying .
Then me .
Lifespan with the currently available drugs for treating HIV is 24 years .
From the time of infection .
So that would mean I have a max of 20 years left on big blue , if I contracted this evil from Kumiko 4 years ago .
I started to rethink my life ’s direction .
Nothing had value in my eyes anymore .
Everything was superfluous .
I started to think about the horrific images we ’ve all seen of people dying of AIDS .
Skeletal , gaunt .
I could n’t sleep at night and had the sweats and shakes .
Literally every waking moment whether I was teaching a class or narrating a job , it has been at the forefront of my thoughts .
We all have to die but this just was n’t in the cards for me , I thought .
George has AIDS .
Mortifying !
I did n’t like the ring of that one bit .
I imagined myself having to clarify every time someone learned about my illness that I ’m NOT gay and I ’m NOT a drug-user .
I got AIDS from unsafe heterosexual sex .
I envied some of the people I saw on the street .
A young mother with her young children in the supermarket ; I ’m sure she ’s safe .
Kids playing in a field near my apartment ; they do n’t know how lucky they are .
But I also thought , jeez they could be HIV positive too .
I went to a Catholic church that is on my way home from work on Monday evening and prayed like there literally was no tomorrow .
This went on for a couple of days ( not the praying but the fear of God ) until I could get an appointment to see a doctor yesterday , the 19th Dec .
I went to an English - speaking clinic here in Tokyo which I usually visit for other life - threatening illnesses like the common cold and having stitches removed .
I had an HIV test done and I figured as long as I was there and as long as the needle was in my arm ( which by the way this was the first time I did n’t get light - headed or completely faint from a blood test ) I may as well get some more blood drawn and have some other general check - up tests done as well .
Never thought it would come to the tune of 50,000 yen !
There are free AIDS clinics in town but the wait ( one or two weeks ) I think would ’ve killed me .
These results were promised in 24 hours .
After the tests were all done I left the clinic and my blood and fate was in God ’s hands .
I told a friend I hope He ( God ) switches mine with some nun… certainly not a priest !!
The past 24 hours have been nerve - wracking as you can imagine .
I ’ve been absolutely on pins and needles .
The doctor told me to give him a call after 4 which I did at precisely 4:00:01 .
The call was transfered to him and he did n’t even say hello , all he said was ‘ the test is NEGATIVE . ’
He knew how anxious I was about this .
I could ’ve hugged him .
Or at least bought him tea and crumpets .
An enormous weight was lifted from my shoulders .
I never felt the word negative could in fact be so POSITIVE !
I immediately called Kyoko and told her the good news .
She knew I had an AIDS test which I told her was just a ‘ routine check , nothing to worry about . ’
She does n’t know yet just how afraid I was , or the REAL reason for the test .
I ’ll tell her tonight .
I also mailed Kumiko .
She asked that I not call her because she cries on the phone when she talks about her terrible predicament .
She was relieved to hear the news .
She has since pinpointed who she believes gave her the disease and has yet to hear back from him .
He also is a foreigner living here in Japan .
Perhaps he does n’t know he has it ?
Perhaps he refuses to get checked for fear of learning he has it .
Kumiko is also being rejected by her boyfriend now .
They planned to marry after she got pregnant , that was until a month ago when she got the bad news from her doctor .
He does n’t want anything to do with her now that she ’s been diagnosed with HIV .
She told me that she will give birth to the baby and live in Tokyo for a year before moving back to her hometown to live with her father .
She said ‘ what about my life ? ’
I wish I had an answer for her .
I told her to focus on the beautiful baby that she will have in a few months and that will help relieve her of the other pain .
Japan .
It ’s a beautiful place .
The people are beautiful and kind and some of the most generous folks I ’ve ever met .
But these past few days have jaded me a bit .
I used to think of Japan as a special place where the evils are forbidden from entering .
A playground where you can laugh and sing and play along with life in a carefree and careless way – a Disneyland as such .
It ’s not that way .
And I learned this in a very personal and frightening way .
This has been an INCREDIBLY valuable lesson for me and should be for anyone who takes the time to read this .
Sorry , I know it ’s long but it ’s important that we realize just how real HIV / AIDS is !
We read about it in the papers .
We see it on TV , but folks , this is mainstream .
If Kumiko can get it so can I and you and your children and anyone who does n’t practice safe sex !
PERIOD !
Take heed people .
Please feel free to send this on to anyone you feel would benefit from it .
Oh and I almost forgot …
Happy Holidays !
Stay safe .

Skype has been spying on its Windows - based users since the middle of December by secretly accessing their system bios settings and recording the motherboard serial number .
A blog entry made on Skype 's website assures us it 's no big deal .
The snooper agent is the handiwork of a third - party program called EasyBits Software , which Skype uses to manage Skype plug-ins .
Among other things , EasyBits offers DRM features that prevent the unauthorized use or distribution of plug-ins , and that 's why Skype 3.0 has been nosing around in users ' bios .
Reading the serial number allows EasyBits to quickly identify the physical computer the software is running on .
The practice was discontinued on Thursday , when Skype was updated to version 3.0.0.216 .
" It is quite normal to look at indicators that uniquely identify the platform and there is nothing secret about reading hardware parameters from the BIOS , " Skype 's blog author , Kurt Sauer , assured us .
He also says Skype never retrieved any of this data .
We 're not sure that 's the point .
Skype goes to great lengths to assure users they will not be fed spyware , which the eBay - owned VOIP provider defines as " software that becomes installed on computer without the informed consent or knowledge of the computer ’s owner and covertly transmits or receives data to or from a remote host . "
What 's more , we were unable to find terms of service the spells out what EasyBits does with the information it gathers on Skype users .
It 's also hard to take Skype 's nothing - to - see - here notification at face value because of the lengths the software goes to conceal its snooping .
As documented in the Pagetable blog , the Skype snoopware runs a .com file and prevents the more curious users among us from reading it .
Were it not for errors it was giving users of 64 - bit versions , we 'd probably still be in the dark .
Skype 's decision to remove the EasyBits DRM feature is a good start .
Time now for an apology and an explanation of what has been done with the information already collected . ®
Her 29 clips - with titles like I Probably Should n't Post This ... , Boy Problems ... and My Parents Suck ... - have been viewed over 2.3 million times .
And with 23,369 subscribers , Lonelygirl15 's channel has become the second most popular YouTube video feed of all time .
But viewers started to smell a rat .
Was the wide - eyed , 16 - year - old beauty who claimed to have spent time with her parents in a commune in New Zealand the real thing ?
Or was this a clever viral marketing campaign , a masterful hoax that had fooled most of the people , most of the time ?
" She 's just a little too charming , her videos a little too well edited , and her story a little too neatly laid out , " Adam Sternbergh wrote in the New York magazine late last month .
It emerged that the lonelygirl 15.com website had been registered a month before her first video post and , later , that an application to trademark Lonelygirl15 had been lodged by a Los Angeles lawyer .
Finally on Friday a breakthrough .
The Los Angeles Times reported that online sleuths using email tracking software had pinpointed the source of emails sent by lonelygirl15 to a Hollywood talent agency called Creative Artists Agency .
A spokesman for the agency told the paper that he could " neither confirm nor deny " links with lonelygirl15 .
Soon after the report was published on the internet a notice purporting to be from a group of independent filmmakers appeared on one of the Lonelygirl 15 discussion sites .
" To Our Incredible Fans " , it began . " Thank you so much for enjoying our show so far .
We are amazed by the overwhelmingly positive response to our videos ; it has exceeded our wildest expectations .
With your help we believe we are witnessing the birth of a new art form . "
The message went on to explain that Lonelygirl15 was a project to harness the audience to develop and evolved a story and " usher in an era of interactive storytelling where the line between ' fan ' and ' star ' has been removed " .
While not everyone is convinced that the filmmakers ' confession is genuine ( many believe it 's part of the developing mystery ) , it now seems certain now that Lonelygirl15 is a fake - although who is behind the hoax and what is purpose of the elaborate ruse is still unclear .
A clue left in one of the videos suggests it may be another month before we find out .
In a video posted a week ago titled Bree The Cookie Monster , Bree and Daniel rate batches of cookies they said they baked .
Bree 's purple monkey puppet holds up score cards .
The first one gets " 10 " , the second " 12 " and the third one " 06 " .
Why " 06 " and not " 6 " ?
Viewers point out that the sequence makes a date 10/12/06 - or October 12 , 2006 , using the US method of writing dates .
October 12 also happens to be the birth date of the late occultist Aleister Crowley , whose picture can be seen on a wall in Bree 's room .
News of the hoax , however , does appear to have dented Lonelygirl15 's popularity .
" Hi . You are a great actress , " Daniel Gardner said in a message left on Lonelygirl15's YouTube site on Saturday .
" We hate your director and crew ... but ca n't help loving you . "

Turning the Tables
What would you do if you saw abuse , but the gender roles were reversed ?
Dec. 26 , 2006  --
It 's the kind of sweaty summer day when you might expect tempers to be short .
Even so , though , the scene on a park bench in northern New Jersey strikes bystanders as a bit odd .
A young woman with fiery red hair leans over her hapless boyfriend , screaming in his face .
" Nate , stop ignoring me ! , " she implores , just inches from his face .
He all but ignores her .
" You 're not even … "
She pauses and moves her face even closer to his .
" Hello Hello ! " she screams .
At times her rage boils over to physical abuse : she pulls the young man 's hair , slaps the side of his head , and beats him with a rolled - up newspaper .
Fortunately , the troubling scene is n't real .
The abusive woman and her boyfriend are actors , hired by " Primetime " for a hidden camera experiment .
On previous shows , " Primetime " has staged scenes of abuse in which the man is the aggressor , and the woman is the victim .
And in these situations , passersby -- men and women -- often stepped up and intervened .
So producers were curious .
What would happen if the tables were turned , and the man was suddenly the victim ?
Would people be just as willing to come to his defense ?
This staged scenario happens more often in real life than you may think .
According to Colgate University psychology professor Carrie Keating , women abusing , even assaulting their male partners " is a big problem in this country . "
" There are some data that suggest that women actually hit more than men do , " says Keating .
" Men create more damage , but women hit more than men do . "
A report prepared for the Centers for Disease Control estimates that each year there are over 800,000 serious cases of men being physically abused by women .
But the actual figures are believed to be much higher , since many men are often too embarrassed to admit being the victim of abuse by a woman .
Even professional athletes , with their macho reputations , have alleged abuse .
In 2002 , Major League pitcher Chuck Finley 's wife , actress Tawny Kitaen , was arrested and jailed after he accused her of pummeling him , causing bruises and abrasions .
She pleaded not guilty , and charges were dropped after she agreed to attend anger management classes .
' You Go Girl ' ?
Verbal and physical abuse of men by women might be an acknowledged problem , but will people try to stop it when " Primetime " 's hidden cameras are rolling ?
One after another , passersby witnessed the abusive scene … and kept right on going .
Mathilda was one of those bystanders .
She says she did n't think the man was in any physical danger , and could probably take care of himself .
" I did n't immediately think to protect the man at all , " she said .
" It did n't look like any harm was being done . "
The reaction of another woman , Lynda , was stunning .
As our actress continued to heap abuse on her make - believe boyfriend , she walked by the scene and pumped her fist in a show of sisterly solidarity .
" Good for you .
You Go , Girl ! " is how Lynda recalls her reaction .
" I was thinking he probably did something really bad , " she said .
" Maybe she caught him cheating or something like that and [ it ] made her lose it and slap him in the face .
I reacted like , ' Yes. Woman power . ' "
This type of reaction did n't come as a surprise to Keating .
Observers often excuse their " own lack of response by denigrating the victim and making up stories that he really deserved the punishment he was receiving , " Keating says .
She says that perhaps these people have some past frustration in their lives which makes them " actually enjoy vicariously the experience this woman was having by being aggressive " toward her boyfriend .
' Old - Fashioned Views '
Later , a husband and wife out for some exercise observed the abusive situation and continued on their way .
So " Primetime 's " producers stepped in and asked , " Why not stop or at least call 911 ? "
" What they were havin ' there …[ they were ] just havin ' a little tiff .
They 'll be all right , " said the man , a police officer in a nearby community .
His wife told " Primetime " that she would have found it " more upsetting if [ the young man ] had put his hands on " the young woman . "
" Oh , without a doubt , " her husband readily agreed , acknowledging the double standard .
" Call it old - fashioned views .
If you 're raised the way I was raised , you do n't put your hands on a woman , right ? "
Keating says that holding those kinds of values and beliefs " is going to give them a very different lens through which they see the behavior of the actress , the aggressiveness of the woman against the man .
They under -value the potency of her responses . "
What Should You Do ?
Keating says there is no single appropriate response to a situation like this .
" Every individual has to do their own calculus when it comes to whether or not they should step in and help when faced with an ethical dilemma , " she says .
" because there are costs to helping .
There are risks , there is danger , there are time and energy investments . "
Over two days of taping , " Primetime " watched 163 people just walk right by the actors – the abusive woman and her boyfriend .
Of all those who had the chance to step up and get involved , only one group of women stopped .
After taking time to assess the situation , these women -- four of them -- gathered at a distance to assess the situation .
They then sent an emissary to offer the fighting couple some assistance .
But when the actress replied that " this is not your business , " the woman respectfully walked away .
But while the first woman was attempting to engage the couple , one of the other women , Clare , was calling 911 from her cell phone .
" I'm in Leonia Park , and there are two people fighting on a bench , " she reported .
" She 's beatin ' him up and I was wondering if somebody could come and just check it out ? "
( The police were aware of the hidden camera experiment ) .
The fact that the abuser was a woman did not matter to Clare and the other women with her .
They said they just knew they had to do something .
" She was a little out of control , " said Clare .
" I was concerned for both their safety , " another woman said .
Another member of the group , Donna , recalls " trying to assess the situation before we reacted . "
Avoiding Regrets
Keating found this group of concerned women to be " an interesting collective .
In a sense they verify the sort of cognitive steps we all go through whenever we see a situation that conveys some sort of ethical dilemma : ' Should we respond or not ' ? "
" They saw it as requiring intervention , " she said .
" They stepped up to take responsibility .
They collected as a group and tried to figure out what to do and actually put into place a plan of action where they could be of help . "
According to Donna , doing nothing was never an option .
" I 'd rather do the right thing than walk away and go home and regret it , " she said .
And according to Keating , those kinds of regrets can be hurtful .
There is " a risk to not helping , " she says .
" When we fail to help in a situation it does n't make you feel very good about yourself .
And those sorts of memories can last for a long , long time . "
Scott McCausland pleaded guilty today to " conspiracy to commit copyright infringement " and " criminal copyright infringement " .
McCausland was a avid member of the " private " BitTorrent tracker Elitetorrents , that was taken down by the FBI , May 2005 .
This case is the first BitTorrent related criminal enforcement in the US .
24 year old McCAusland could be sent to prison for a maximum of five years .
The plea was announced by Attorney General Fisher of the Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney Buchanan of the Western District of Pennsylvania earlier today .
In a response to this case U.S. Attorney Buchanan stated :
“ This groundbreaking case demonstrates the commitment of the Department of Justice to prosecute individuals who use new technologies to undermine the copyright laws .
It also serves as an example to those who believe that there is anonymity in cyberspace . ”
When Elitetorrents was taken down May last year , the frontpage was replaced by this FBI takehome message .
FBI ’s Operation D - Elite resulted in the permanent shutdown of the Elitetorrents community .
The irony of this case is that it concerns a so called “ private tracker ” that is believed to be “ more anonymous ” than public trackers .
Strange enough , there is no “ we told you so ” press release from the MPAA yet , but I bet it wont take long .
McCausland is scheduled to be sentenced on December 12 , 2006 .

Does size matter ?
Men feel better if they are well - endowed but women do n't always agree that bigger is better .
Men with average - sized penises are much more likely to suffer from small penis syndrome .
And some even use weights or encourage snakes to bite them to make themselves bigger , according to a research review spanning more than 60 years .
Women are much more interested in a man 's personality and looks than the size of his penis , but men can experience real anxiety even if they are average sized , according to a research review published in the June issue of the urology journal BJU International .
Dr Kevan Wylie from the Porterbrook Clinic and Royal Hallamshire Hospital , Sheffield , UK , reports that while men often have a better body image , genital image and sexual confidence if they have a large penis , women do n't necessarily feel that bigger is better .
He teamed up with Mr Ian Eardley from St James ' Hospital in Leeds to bring together the findings of more than 50 international research projects into penile size and small penis syndrome carried out since 1942 .
By drawing together the results of 12 studies that measured the penises of 11,531 men , they discovered that average erect penises ranged from 14 - 16 cms ( 5.5 to 6.2 inches ) in length and 12 - 13 cm ( 4.7 to 5.1 inches ) in girth .
Wylie and Eardley also looked at the bizarre practices used by men worldwide to enhance the size of their penis , including the Topinama of Brazil , who encourage poisonous snakes to bite their penises to enlarge them for six months !

They report that Indian Sadhus men are known to use weights to increase the length of their penis and Dayak men in Borneo pierce the glans of their penis and insert items into the holes to stimulate their partner .
Other key findings of the review include :
A survey of over 50,000 heterosexual men and women found that 66 per cent of men said their penis was average sized , 22 per cent said large and 12 per cent said small .
85 per cent of women were satisfied with their partner 's penile size , but only 55 per cent of men were satisfied .
Two studies reported that 90 per cent of women prefer a wide penis to a long one .
Other studies pointed out that the issue of male attractiveness was complex , but that penile size was not the most important factor for women .
Small penis syndrome is much more common in men with normal sized penises than those with a small micropenis with a flaccid length of less than 7 cm ( 2.7 inches ) .
One study found that 63 per cent of men complaining of small penises said their anxieties started with childhood comparisons and 37 per cent blamed erotic images viewed in their teenage years .
None of the men studied actually had a micropenis .
Another report based on data collected by Kinsey in the 1940s reported that , on average , homosexual men had larger penises than heterosexual men .
The report authors suggest that exposure to male reproductive hormones in the womb may be one explanation .
Individual research studies have also suggested that penis size is smaller in studies focussing on older men , but Wylie and Eardley found no overall differences when they collated the results of various studies .
The review also provided little evidence of racial differences , with the exception of one Korean study where the men had smaller than average - sized penises .
The authors suggest this area needs further investigation .
Evidence on the effectiveness of vacuum devices , penile extenders and traction devices was found to be limited , but the authors noted that patients may experience psychological benefits from some of them .
The review also showed that the results of surgery are poorly documented and significant complications can ensue .
" It is very common for men to worry about the size of their penis and it is important that these concerns are n't dismissed as this can heighten concerns and anxieties " says Dr Wylie .
" It is helpful to normalise the situation and provide as much accurate information as possible , as many men either lack any information or have been misinformed .
" This extensive review aims to provide clinicians with an overarching summary of the many research projects that have been carried out into penile size and small penis syndrome . "
Clinicians who are presented with a man with small penis syndrome need to consider a number of treatment approaches .
advertisement
" The initial approach should be a thorough urological , psychosexual , psychological and psychiatric assessment , possibly with more than one clinician involved " say the authors .
" Conservative approaches to therapy , based on education and self - awareness , as well as short - term structured psychotherapies , are often successful . "
They authors are , however , very cautious when it comes to treating a psychological condition like small penis syndrome with gadgets or surgery .
" There is poorly documented evidence to support the use of penile extenders , and while information is starting to emerge on the success of some surgical techniques , this is not backed up by data on patients ' satisfaction with such procedures " stresses Dr Wylie .

What if poor parents were paid to talk with their kid 's teacher ?
Or to visit a dentist , or get job training ?
New York 's mayor believes such incentives can reduce the nearly 20 percent poverty rate in his city .
Kudos to him for taking a new crack at an old problem .
Mayor Michael Bloomberg 's hope is not just a wispy dream .
Similar incentive programs in other countries have a proven track record and broad political support .
In Mexico , such an approach has helped to raise school attendance , improve nutrition , and reduce extreme poverty .
The World Bank enthusiastically backs the idea , which is being practiced in about 30 countries .
The mayor , a Republican , is not above importing policy , as long as it works ( he plans to copy London 's tax on downtown driving to fight global warming ) .
The city will start the privately funded , anti-poverty experiment in September , measuring it against a control group of nonparticipants .
Those in the pilot plan can earn up to $ 5,000 a year by meeting criteria related to health , education , and work .
That amounts to a 25 percent raise for a family of four living below the poverty line of about $ 20,000 .
If the plan succeeds , the mayor wants to commit public funds to expand it .
It 's no shock that a mayor is reaching for this kind of innovation .
Cities and states are America 's problem - solving laboratories .
What is surprising , and refreshingly so , is new national attention to poverty .
Politicians usually avoid the " P " word .
It does n't sell as a campaign topic .
Nor are the poor big voters .
And in the economic boom years of the 1990s , poverty decreased and the pressure was off .
But in 2005 , hurricane - battered New Orleans exposed American poverty for all to see .
That year , poverty in the US held steady at 12.6 percent , or 37 million people , but it rose in the four previous years .
Next month , a Conference of Mayors task force will meet to draft an anti-poverty agenda .
And presidential candidate John Edwards is making poverty his campaign theme .
Poverty can be a politically polarizing issue , with Democrats traditionally claiming its roots as structural ( loss of manufacturing jobs , poorly funded schools , etc. ) and Republicans seeing the cause as social or personal failures ( teen mothers , absent fathers ) .
The value of Bloomberg 's plan is that its incentives approach reinforces an emerging political consensus on how best to help the poor .
The New Deal and Great Society programs generally did n't require people to change behavior to get assistance – thus the birth of the " welfare queen . "
But the welfare reform of the last decade showed that people really do want to do for themselves ; they just need an incentive , or a consequence .
Not only did plunging welfare rolls prove that point , but so has another incentive - based tool for the poor : the Earned Income Tax Credit .
That direct payout is available only to whose who work .
Studies show it has reduced both family and child poverty .
The poor are just as interested in advancement as anyone .
But a nighttime office cleaner can't spare the hourly wages to attend parent - teacher night , that , say , the daytime salaried worker in that office could .
It will be worth tracking whether Bloomberg 's program really will allow the poor to do that – and many other things to lift themselves up .
“ I just ca n’t see how one can look at this change without believing it ’s political , ” he said .
The termination language was inserted into the bill by Congressional staff members working for Duncan Hunter , the California Republican who is the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee and who declared on Monday that he plans to run for president in 2008 .

Mr. Holly , who is the House Armed Services spokesman as well as a member of Mr. Hunter ’s staff , said that politics played no role and that there had been no direction from the administration or lobbying from the companies whose work in Iraq Mr. Bowen ’s office has severely critiqued .
Three of the companies that have been a particular focus of Mr. Bowen ’s investigations , Halliburton , Parsons and Bechtel , said that they had made no effort to lobby against his office .
The idea , Mr. Holly said , was simply to return to a non-wartime footing in which inspectors general in the State Department , the Pentagon and elsewhere would investigate American programs overseas .
The definite termination date was also seen as helpful for planning future oversight efforts from Bush administration agencies , he said .
But in Congress , particularly on the Democratic side of the aisle , there have long been accusations that agencies controlled by the Bush administration are not inclined to unearth their own shortcomings in the first place .
The criticism came to a head in a hearing a year ago , when Representative Dennis J. Kucinich , an Ohio Democrat , induced the Pentagon ’s acting inspector general , Thomas Gimble , to concede that he had no agents deployed in Iraq , more than two years after the invasion .
A spokesman for the Pentagon inspector general said Thursday that Mr. Gimble had worked to improve that situation , and currently had seven auditors in Baghdad and others working on Iraq - related issues in the United States and elsewhere .
Mr. Gimble was in Iraq on Thursday , the spokesman said .
Mr. Bowen ’s office has 55 auditors and inspectors in Iraq and about 300 reports and investigations already to its credit , far outstripping any other oversight agency in the country .
Retired General : ' War Czar ' position proves Cheney has been ' ineffective ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday May 22 , 2007 Print This Email This In 2003 , Major General Paul Eaton was put in charge of training the new Iraqi army and police force .
He retired from the military in 2006 and has now done a political ad for VoteVets.org in which he tells President Bush , " I was one of those commanders , and you were n't listening when we warned you of the dangers we 'd face invading Iraq . "
In this interview with PBS 's Tavis Smiley , Easton , now retired , explains that it was because the president has not listened to his commanders that VoteVets embarked on its unprecedented series of television ads .
He says the decision to do so was not taken lightly , but the military is not being properly maintained by the current administration and even active duty military personnel are aware of this .
When asked by Smiley about Bush 's decision to appoint a " war czar , " Eaton says that the appointing of any " czar " by an administration indicates a " last ditch effort . "
He calls Lt. General Douglas Lute " a wonderful soldier " but says the function is " really the job of the vice president of the United States . "
According to Eaton , the hiring of a " war czar " " is a demonstration that this office of the vice president has been ineffective in achieving the coordination necessary in the interagency process to get this administration  to get this cabinet  focused on solving the crisis that we 've got right now in Iraq and in Afghanistan . "
" The War Czar is a last ditch effort to make responsible government happen in Washington DC , " Eaton added .
The following video is from PBS 's Tavis Smiley Show :
What fools we mortals be .
Clicking on the picture ’s display properties yields the response : “ What ’s This ? ”
My question exactly .
Going deeper , a file called “ Autumn Properties ” reveals only that it ’s a five - kilobyte Windows Theme File .
When I try to find out what a theme file is , the Windows Help and Support Center suggests , “ Check your spelling . ”
Well , hell , somebody at Microsoft ought to know .
As it turns out , if they do , they ’re not telling .
Curiosity becomes yearning , and yearning becomes obsession .
Several friends are drawn into my search .
I no longer want merely to find Autumn and go there .
I now want to go there and look for a little place to live not far from that leaf - covered path .
Photo editors , editor editors , fact - checkers , researchers , computer guys and computer dolls — my motley , shifting , devoted crew come to be known as Team Autumn .
Every member of Team Autumn begins as I did , confident that finding the location pictured will be a quick and simple matter .
As the months pass , many of my volunteers , rather than admit defeat , resort to the exculpatory “ maybe it ’s a computer - generated picture ” premise and retreat to their real lives .
Queries to Microsoft are redirected to the public - relations firm of Waggener Edstrom .
The following e-mail exchange between a member of Team Autumn and a member of the Waggener Edstrom Rapid Response Team is representative :
“ Hello , I ’m a journalist writing about computer desktop artwork and I have a question — can you tell me the name of the photographer and the location depicted in the wallpaper image that comes with Windows XP entitled Autumn ?
The exact image is attached .
I know this is an unusual request ; any help you can give me will be greatly appreciated . ”
“ I am happy to look into this request .
Please give me a chance to connect with colleagues about your inquiry .
Will this be for an article , and if so , what is your deadline and how will the information be used ? ”
“ Thanks for getting back to me so quickly !
Yes , this is for an article .
My deadline is July 10 .
The article is about the ways in which people ’s desktop wallpaper effects their work habits .
This particular photograph is my personal favorite , and I ’m going to write about the ways in which it has inspired me and stimulated my imagination while writing .
Finding out who took the picture , and , particularly , where this photograph was taken , will be very important elements of the piece .
I will of course acknowledge your assistance on Microsoft ’s behalf and will send tear sheets upon publication .
Thanks again . ”
“ Hi . I am following up per your last e-mail and have connected with colleagues concerning your request .
Unfortunately , we will not be able to participate in this opportunity .
I apologize for the inconvenience .
Best regards . ”
“ Can you tell me why not ?
Thanks . ”
“ Hi . Unfortunately , I was not in the decision process for this request and am not able to comment on my colleagues ’ reasoning .
I apologize for the inconvenience .
I would suggest the Web for more information about the images .
Best regards . ”
I see people in black hoods and robes sitting round a table , bound by blood oath never to divulge the latitude and longitude of Autumn .
Why this wall of silence and secrecy ?
I ’ve never before known a company to resolutely shun good publicity .
The dwindling members of Team Autumn begin making weird comments to me :
“ There are horses nearby .

That ’s a horse fence . ”

It feels like Vermont . ”
Bush will use 9.11.2007 to extend surge , Rich says RAW STORY
Published : Sunday June 24 , 2007 Print This Email
This
The Bush administration has a well established pattern of using the anniversary of the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks to hype an often fictional " threat to America " and sell the war in Iraq , writes the New York Times ' Frank Rich in his Sunday column .
Rich expects this year to be no different .
" When the September ' snapshot ' of the surge shows little change in the overall picture , the White House will say that ' the consequences ' of winding down the war would be even more disastrous : surrender , defeat , apocalypse now .
So we must stay the surge , " says Rich .
Using the September anniversary to push the Iraq war is not a new strategy , according to Rich .
On Sept. 8 , 2002 , three Bush cabinet members and the vice president fanned out across morning talk shows to warn of the threat posed by Saddam Hussein and his alleged nuclear program .
That was the date of Condoleezza Rice 's infamous " mushroom cloud " line .
" Like the war 's rollout in 2002 , the new propaganda offensive to extend and escalate the war will be exquisitely timed to both the anniversary of 9/11 and a high - stakes congressional vote ( the Pentagon appropriations bill ) . "
If the administration wanted to give an accurate assessment of Iraq , they would not be withholding information about increased attacks in the Green Zone , says Rich .
" Apparently the White House is working overtime to ensure that the September ' snapshot ' of Iraq will be an underexposed blur . "
By letting the White House get away with " falsifying reality , sliming its opponents and sowing hyped fears of Armageddon , " a real debate on what to do in Iraq can not not occur , he argues .
" The best way to honor the sixth anniversary of 9/11 will be to at last disarm a president who continues to squander countless lives in the names of those voiceless American dead . "

WASHINGTON – The Smithsonian Institution toned down an exhibit on climate change in the Arctic for fear of angering Congress and the Bush administration , says a former administrator at the museum .
Among other things , the script , or official text , of last year 's exhibit was rewritten to minimize and inject more uncertainty into the relationship between global warming and humans , said Robert Sullivan , who was associate director in charge of exhibitions at the Smithsonian 's National Museum of Natural History .
Also , officials omitted scientists ' interpretation of some research and let visitors draw their own conclusions from the data , he said .
In addition , graphs were altered " to show that global warming could go either way , " Sullivan said .
" It just became tooth - pulling to get solid science out without toning it down , " said Sullivan , who resigned last fall after 16 years at the museum .
He said he left after higher - ups tried to reassign him .
Smithsonian officials denied that political concerns influenced the exhibit , saying the changes were made for reasons of objectivity .
And some scientists who consulted on the project said nothing major was omitted .
Sullivan said that to his knowledge , no one in the Bush administration pressured the Smithsonian , whose $ 1.1 billion ( U.S. ) budget is mostly taxpayer - funded .
Rather , he said , Smithsonian leaders acted on their own .
" The obsession with getting the next allocation and appropriation was so intense that anything that might upset the Congress or the White House was being looked at very carefully , " he said .
The White House had no immediate comment Monday .
In recent months , the White House has been accused of trying to muzzle scientists researching global warming at NASA and other agencies .
The exhibit , " Arctic : A Friend Acting Strangely , " based partly on a report by federal scientists , opened in April 2006 – six months late , because of the Smithsonian 's review – and closed in November , but its content remains available online .
Among other things , it highlighted the Arctic 's shrinking ice and snow and concerns about the effect on people and wildlife .
This is not the first time the Smithsonian has been accused of taking politics into consideration .
The congressionally chartered institution scaled down a 1995 exhibit of the restored Enola Gay , the B - 29 that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima , after veterans complained it focused too much on the damage and deaths .
Amid the oil - drilling debate in 2003 , a photo exhibit of Alaska 's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge was moved to a less prominent space .
Sullivan said the changes in the climate - change exhibit were requested by executives who included then - museum Director Cristian Samper and his boss , former Undersecretary for Science David Evans .
He said several scientists whose work was used in the exhibit objected to the changes .
Samper , now acting Smithsonian secretary , said he was not aware of scientists ' objections , and he emphasized there was no political pressure to change the script .
" Our role as a museum is to present the facts but not advocate a particular point of view , " Samper said in an e-mail .
Evans refused to comment .
Randall Kremer , a spokesman for the natural history museum , said atmospheric science was outside the Smithsonian 's expertise , so the museum avoided the issue of what is causing the Arctic changes .
Many leading scientists have come to believe that human activity is contributing to warming of the planet .
" I see it in some ways as similar to the sort - of debate that has taken place with regard to the science of evolution , " said Professor Michael Mann , director of Pennsylvania State University 's Earth System Science Center .
" Just as I would hope that the Smithsonian would stand firmly behind the science of evolution , it would also be my hope that they would stand firmly behind the science that supports influence on climate .
Politically , they may be controversial , but scientifically they are not . "
Some curators and scientists involved in the project said they believed nothing important was omitted .
But they also said it was apparent that science was not the only concern .
" I remember them telling me there was an attempt to make sure there was nothing in there that would be upsetting to any politicians , " said John Calder , a lead climate scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who consulted on the project .
" They 're not stupid .
They do n't want to upset the people who pay them . "
One consultant , University of Maryland scientist Louis Codispoti , said he would have been less cautious .
" I 've been going to the Arctic since 1963 , and I find some of the changes alarming , " he said .
News Corporation officials in Beijing and Hong Kong declined to comment for this article .
After The New York Times began a two - part series on Monday about how Mr. Murdoch operates his company , the News Corporation issued a statement :
“ News Corp. has consistently cooperated with The New York Times in its coverage of the company .
However , the agenda for this unprecedented series is so blatantly designed to further the Times ’s commercial self interests — by undermining a direct competitor poised to become an even more formidable competitor — that it would be reckless of us to participate in their malicious assault .
Ironically , The Times , by using its news pages to advance its own corporate business agenda , is doing the precise thing they accuse us of doing without any evidence . ”
China has never been a make - or - break proposition for the News Corporation , since its operations here represent a small part of the company , which is valued at $ 68 billion .
But Mr. Murdoch pushed for nearly 15 years to create a satellite television network that would cover every major market in the world , including China .
He coveted the $ 50 billion in ad spending that flows mainly to China ’s state - owned news media whose products , even after years of improvements , still reflect propaganda directives as well as consumer demand .
The News Corporation ’s competitors in television and film , the Walt Disney Company , Viacom and Time Warner , also had to accommodate Chinese demands as the price of admission to the local market .
But Mr. Murdoch gave more , his associates said .
“ The Chinese discovered that Rupert was a real emperor who controlled everything himself , ” said H. S. Liu , who oversaw government relations for the News Corporation in China .
“ His rivals had big , cautious bureaucracies that could not always deliver . ”
China has long meant more than business to the Murdoch clan .
Mr. Murdoch ’s father , Keith , wrote about China as a war correspondent in the 1930s .
As a newspaper proprietor in Australia , he collected Ming dynasty porcelain .

When Rupert Murdoch visited Shanghai in 1997 , Wendi Deng , then a junior News Corporation employee in Hong Kong , flew up to serve as his translator .
Together they explored Shanghai , which was then emerging as a lively center of finance and commerce .

Articles of impeachment were filed on Dick Cheney , probably for the first time for a vice president in American history , and the Los Angeles Times could only muster two paragraphs buried on A15 , while legalizing abortion in Mexico City merited front page coverage .
Kucinich ’s impeachment effort is important not just for Cheney ’s past sins , but for what he and Bush still want to do : bomb Iran .
At best , this would lead to Iran unleashing terrorists on us and Israel .
At worst , it could spark a nuclear war with China and Russia since they have told us to butt the hell out .

as an online menace / hero after posting the photos and come - ons he received from nearly 150 men responding to a fake sex ad he placed on Craig 's List .
He 's started an intense debate about the nature of online privacy and dating .
But beyond the practical effects of the experiment , what kind of man would commit such a dastardly prank ?
Researching that question , I stumbled across Jason Fortuny 's Amazon reviews .
He read and reviewed exactly one book over five years -- and two soundtracks for Star Trek movies .
( " Reviews written : 4 . " Helpful votes : 0 . ) He also awards 5 stars to National Lampoon 's ( " Reviewer Matthew K. Minerd totally needs to get laid .
Dude , relax !
It 's just a movie . " )
He's also been sexually molested by his grandfather " I have n't talked to my parents or the rest of the family in 11 years , " he wrote in a post on his LiveJournal account in May .
It 's one of many suprisingly frank glimpses into the 30 - year - old 's life .
" [ I ] f you had a family where four different members molested you , your mother tended to the prime molestor instead of you , and your stepfather utterly failed to provide for a future , you'd be pretty pissed , too .
" Later he posts that two of the perpetrators are dead , and two were under 18 .
While there 's no guarantee that his LiveJournal posts are true , they offer intriguing glimpses into the personality behind the prank .
When someone suggested in May that he keep his current contact information from his family , he answered , " it 's too late for the contact information .
It 's all available out there .
Part of my online persona is to hide nothing .
Let the psychos come to my door -- I have a pellet gun and a baseball bat and occasional bad breath . "
He jokes in a later comment that " I miss the days when it was just trolling and making fun of fat people .
Life was so easy back then !
" Another poster advises , " just make sure you have someone you trust who you can rant and freak out to if you need to . "
" LiveJournal ? " he answers .
Eight weeks ago he split with his fiancee .
Seven weeks ago he posted about his difficulties with his thyroid and testosterone levels .
( " If it works , one of the first things I should notice is the return of my energy , followed by the return of sexual function , followed by weight gain , followed by increased body hair . " )
He hints at biochemical depression .
In July he began selling his Star Trek trading cards to cover $ 2600 in debt .
" Looks like its time to eBay my stunning collection of original Star Wars and Transformers toys and action figures ... , " he writes .
" There are some heartbreakingly awesome Transformers and Star Wars toys in there .
I am profoundly sad ... "
He also describes a history of malicious pranks .
He apparently once claimed to have put pictures of someone 's children on a child rape site .
In January of 2005 he'd faked a sudden conversion to born - again Christianity , in a post which received 448 comments .
( " I was sitting there , New Year 's Eve , drinking alcohol by myself , in my underclothes , abusing my body to images of Rod Serling on the TV ...
And then , without warning , the flood of emotion I had tried so hard to block forced it 's way into my consciousness ... " )
This June he 'd tried a Livejournal " whoring " project , " friending everyone " .
But on May 8 he posts that a friend commented " I no longer have that annoying ' must be the center of attention ' drive anymore . "
Then adds his own self - analysis about his past motivations .
" ... my ability to keep a crowd entertained and charmed was a major pillar of my self - esteem .
If nothing else , I could rock a party .
I certainly did n't believe in my professional abilities then like I do now .
And , I did n't want to admit that it was annoying .
All I cared was that I got my boost when I did my thing - friends be damned .
" Fortuny 's LiveJournal entries detail everything from his search for his biological father to his recent STD test .
There 's the checklist for the perfect woman , and the poem he 'd written for his fiance in December .
He even jokes about falling for someone else 's prank -- pretending to be fired over a LiveJournal post .
He posts downloadable copies ofand , and in April he was attacked by a mailbox - flooding bot
While it does n't resolve the question of what motivated his sex - ad prank , it at least demonstrates an online persona that can be abrasive and negative .
He complains that " friends ' private entries have been read by psycho womenz .
Psycho womenz that I went out on a date with once and reeled in horror when she bared her five year old and her smoking teeth ... "
He mockingly rants against the Girl Scouts , adding " I swear to god the only reason I do n't shout at every last one of them is that I know all little catholic girls are uninhibited sluts , just waiting to be liberated from oppressive and neglectful fathers and gods , into the arms of a bustling , accepting , healthy porn industry .
" But behind it all are the hints of something much darker .
He writes of zombie nightmares -- and family nightmares .
" While my nightmares of my parents have not returned , " he wrote in June , " I have others that bring up similar feelings of righteous anger .
We 'll see . "

GRASSY KEY , Florida ( Reuters ) - Deep in the heart of the Florida Keys , wildlife officials are laying bait laced with poison to try to wipe out a colony of enormous African rats that could threaten crops and other animals .
U.S. federal and state officials are beginning the final phase of a two - year project to eradicate the Gambian pouched rats , which can grow to the size of a cat and began reproducing in the remote area about eight years ago .
“ This is the only place in the United States where this is occurring , ” said Gary Witmer , a biologist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture ’s National Wildlife Research Center in Fort Collins , Colorado .
“ They do n’t belong here and they need to be controlled . ”
A former exotic pet breeder , living in a small house , bred the species and allowed the critters to escape .
Without eradication , wildlife officials fear the rats could eventually make their way onto the Florida mainland where they could quickly destroy fragile ecosystems .
“ They could cause a lot of damage , ” Witmer said .

In Zimbabwe , for example , ravenous Gambian rats are blamed for damaging nut and young pea crops .
Grassy Key is a 1,500 - acre ( 607 - hectare ) spit of land , lined with subtropical hardwood hammocks and flowering bougainvillea bushes , about 60 miles north of Key West at Florida ’s southern tip .
Streets are named after limes , lemons , peaches and avocados .
Like other islands in the Florida Keys , Grassy Key is a contrast of inland rustic wooden cottages just a stone ’s throw from multimillion - dollar waterfront mansions .
“ Florida ’s become quite the hotbed .
Florida and Hawaii are vying for which state has the most invasive species , ” Witmer said .
That dubious honor is attributed to the region ’s encroaching development , subtropical climate and free - spirited residents who like to keep exotic species , Witmer said .
“ VERY MESSY ANIMALS ”
In mid-April , Florida Keys wildlife officials found another invasive species : an 8 - foot ( 2.4 - metre ) Burmese python .
The first wild Burmese snake to be discovered in the archipelago , officials say , was found in a Key Largo state park .
The snake had swallowed two of an estimated 500 remaining and endangered Key Largo wood rats , one outfitted with a radio - tracking collar .
Unlike the wood rats , the Gambian rats “ do n’t have any real friends , that we can tell , ” said Scott Hardin , the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission ’s exotic species coordinator .
Gambian pouched rats , targeted for eradication during the next six weeks , are not related to the Key Largo wood rat .
The African rats can weigh 6 to 9 pounds ( 2.7 - 4 kg ) , with body shades ranging from brown to gray .
They have large ears , black , beady eyes , hamster - like pouched facial cheeks , sharp teeth and distinctive long , stringy and white - marked tails .
This week , wildlife officials began baiting 1,000 traps laid out in a grid with narrow four - inch ( 10 - cm ) openings .
Peanut butter , almond extract and anise are the lures .
Most of the rats will die quickly in underground burrows after ingesting the bait laced with toxic zinc phosphide .
“ They ’re a big rodent .
They ’re not particularly attractive .
I do n’t understand why anyone would want them as a pet , ” Witmer said .
“ They ’re very messy animals . ”
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) in Atlanta and the Food and Drug Administration have banned importation of Gambian rats since 2003 .
That was after an outbreak of monkey - pox , similar to but milder to humans than smallpox , was linked to Gambian rat contact with prairie dogs in the U.S. Midwest .
The CDC hopes to study the carcasses and fecal samples of Gambian rats from the Grassy Keys to learn about internal parasites , but they have shown no signs of monkey - pox .
“ We ’re lucky that ’s the case , ” Witmer said .
“ They sure can bite . ”
GOP joins No Child Left Behind skeptics
By ROB HOTAKAINEN
Scripps - McClatchy Western Service April 19 , 2007
Thursday
WASHINGTON --
Five years after President Bush got a Republican - led Congress to pass a landmark law that forces schools to give students more tests , his party is leading a revolt .
When Congress signed off on the No Child Left Behind legislation in December 2001 , one Republican , Sen . Sam Brownback of Kansas , said it represented a new era that would benefit students across the country , and he saluted Bush 's leadership .
Now Brownback , who 's seeking the 2008 Republican presidential nomination , would be happy if states could just opt out of the federal testing mandates .
Ditto for Missouri Rep. Roy Blunt , the House 's second - ranking Republican .
After co-sponsoring the legislation , the minority whip now says he regrets voting for it .
Is No Child Left Behind about to get left behind ?
While no one is predicting its immediate demise , discontent is growing on Capitol Hill .
So far , 66 Republicans - 59 in the House and seven in the Senate - have signed on to The A - Plus Act , legislation that would allow states to sidestep the yearly tests .
Many Democrats want to alter the testing requirements , giving states more leeway in how they measure progress , especially for students with disabilities .
Even strong advocates of the law acknowledge that at least some tweaks - and more money for schools - will be required before Congress can renew it this year .
The A - Plus Act is the latest in a string of challenges to No Child Left Behind : - The state of Connecticut sued the federal government two years ago , saying Congress had failed to provide enough financial support to implement the law .
-
The states of Virginia and Arizona have questioned rules dealing with the testing of students with limited English skills .
- Utah has tussled with the Department of Education over a requirement that every teacher have the equivalent of a college degree in the subject that he or she teaches .
In California , education officials embrace the act's requirements for annual testing - the state has had an annual testing program in place since before No Child Left Behind took effect - but are fighting other aspects of the law .
The biggest objection concerns the clash between how California determines whether a school is doing well and how the federal government defines success under No Child Left Behind .
The state gives schools a thumbs - up if student test scores improve from one year to the next .
But No Child Left Behind requires that all schools - and all ethnic groups of students within each school - meet specific performance targets each year .
That 's created a confusing situation for many schools :
They can be labeled a success by the state and a failure by the federal law .
State schools Superintendent Jack O'Connell - a Democrat - has been lobbying for changes to the law that would give schools credit for improving scores , even if they do n't meet the absolute targets now in place .
" It 's all stick and no carrot , " said O'Connell 's deputy superintendent , Rick Miller .
" It does n't offer us ways to make schools better , just to punish them . "
But some California educators say the two systems complement each other .
Katie Curry , principal of Tahoe Elementary School in Sacramento , said the federal law has helped her school improve .
" The purpose behind No Child Left Behind - to make sure we identify achievement of all students - is what has been important and a good change for what we do , " Curry said .
" It 's made us focus on all students , instead of generalities . "
Hers is just the kind of school the law is intended to help : three - quarters of Tahoe Elementary students are nonwhite and 100 percent of them receive subsidized lunch .
In 2001 , critics of No Child Left Behind feared that the law would give Washington too much power over local schools .
Much of that suspicion came from conservative Republicans , who nevertheless bowed to the popular first - term president after he made education an issue in his 2000 campaign .
Bush prevailed by arguing that federally mandated tests would put a spotlight on failing schools and pressure them to improve .
Since then , the president 's popularity has plummeted while teachers and school officials have stepped up their criticism of the law .
Some of the strongest backing for the law on Capitol Hill now comes from Democrats , who charge that Republicans want to abandon the testing requirements while still giving federal money to schools .
Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts , chairman of the Senate Education Committee , said the Republican plan was an attempt " to turn back the clock on reform . "
In 2001 , he worked closely with the Bush administration to craft the law .
He said it had become " a national commitment " and that it would be wrong to abandon it .

In January more than 1,900 people — soldiers , security officers and civilians — were killed in the insurgency in Iraq , up from 800 in January 2006 .
Many corpses showed signs of torture , meaning the victims were probably killed by religious and tribal death squads .
This map , based on data from the American , British and Iraqi governments and from news reports , shows the dates , locations and circumstances of deaths for the first month of the year .
Given the vast size of Iraq and the communications difficulties inherent in war , the information may be incomplete .
Nonetheless , it is our effort to visually depict the continuing human cost of the Iraq war .
Using Dynamic Scripting Languages for Mac OS X Application Development
There ’s been a lot of interesting discussion over the last week regarding the use of dynamic scripting languages for programming desktop applications .
Here ’s some of what caught my eye :
Andrew Shebanow argues that this transition is n’t in the future ; it ’s happening now .
Adobe Lightroom ’s user interface is mostly written in Lua , for example .
He also has a good point that what makes these languages interesting is n’t that they are interpreted , but that they ’re dynamic .
Bill Bumgarner reminds us that the Python - Cocoa PyObjC bridge is n’t new ; it ’s been used in production since the Next era in the mid-90s .
He also has some good insight into why Ruby and Python are such good fits for bridging to frameworks originally designed for use with Objective - C .
He also links to a couple of professional Mac apps that are already written using PyObjC .
Michael Tsai is already writing commercial software using a hybrid approach with Python and Objective - C ; he writes that the most common performance hit comes when crossing the bridge .
Jesper has more on why the Python and Ruby Cocoa bridges are n’t likely to suffer the same fate — irrelevance and eventual obsolescence — that Apple ’s Java Cocoa bridge did .
In a nut : Ruby and Python are both more dynamic than Objective - C ; Java is less dynamic than Objective -C .
Scott Stevenson says not so fast — Objective - C 2.0 ( coming in Leopard ) , which adds garbage collection and some useful new syntax like properties and foreach loops , obviates many of the things that might draw Cocoa developers to Ruby or Python , and has the advantage of being the language Cocoa was specifically written for .

Feb. 19 , 2007  -- Circle your calendar .
April 13th , 2036 could be a really , really bad day on planet Earth .
A group of astronauts and engineers warns that an asteroid may pass uncomfortably close to Earth that day .
The chances it will actually hit are just one in 45,000 , but even at those odds , the scientists warn , the United Nations should consider a response .
Potential Threat
The scientists met this past weekend in San Francisco to discuss the potential threats asteroids pose to the Earth and what can be done to prevent a possible collision .
Most feared is Apophis , a large asteroid that will pass within 10,000 miles of Earth around 2029 and even closer in 2036 .
Dr. Dan Barry , a retired astronaut , told ABC News , " Even if the probability is low of an asteroid hitting Earth , if it has the potential to have a significant impact , then it has to be looked at .
It is the absolutely responsible thing to do .
In fact , it would be irresponsible not to do so . "
Barry said more research is needed so that when a potentially dangerous asteroid is found , there is a plan in place .
He said it is therefore important to start the search for asteroids now , to allow enough time to effectively deal with them .
Scientists believe that if advance warnings of dangerous asteroids like Apophis can be made decades in advance , there will be enough time to try and knock them off course .
Suddenly , Bruce Willis on a mission to stop a devastating asteroid from destroying Earth , as he did in the movie " Armageddon , " does not seem as far - fetched .
What Are The Solutions ?
Nobody knows for sure what it would take to push a massive asteroid off its course , but the theoretical possibilities include detonating weapons on an asteroid 's surface or using gravitational pull to alter a possible collision course .
But it could also break an asteroid into many pieces , all still headed toward Earth .
Some scientists say a better option could be to launch a large satellite to rendezvous with an asteroid .
The mass of the satellite alone could produce enough gravitational pull to change the asteroid 's course .
Another suggestion is to crash a spacecraft into an asteroid in the hopes of changing its direction .
" Done far enough away , only a small deflection would be needed and it is kept in one piece , " said Barry .
In 1996 , NEAR became the first spacecraft launched by NASA to orbit and land on an asteroid .
The purpose of the mission was to determine the asteroid 's mass , structure , gravity and magnetic field .
Scientists hoped this important information would help them understand asteroids .
So , while astronauts blowing up an asteroid may be movie fiction for now , scientists are already thinking about how to save Earth from a massive asteroid possibly on its way .
Harvard political scientist Robert Putnam , author of Bowling Alone , is very nervous about releasing his new research , and understandably so .
His five - year study shows that immigration and ethnic diversity have a devastating short - and medium - term influence on the social capital , fabric of associations , trust , and neighborliness that create and sustain communities .
He fears that his work on the surprisingly negative effects of diversity will become part of the immigration debate , even though he finds that in the long run , people do forge new communities and new ties .
Putnam ’s study reveals that immigration and diversity not only reduce social capital between ethnic groups , but also within the groups themselves .
Trust , even for members of one ’s own race , is lower , altruism and community cooperation rarer , friendships fewer .
The problem is n’t ethnic conflict or troubled racial relations , but withdrawal and isolation .
Putnam writes : “ In colloquial language , people living in ethnically diverse settings appear to ‘ hunker down ’— that is , to pull in like a turtle . ”
In the 41 sites Putnam studied in the U.S. , he found that the more diverse the neighborhood , the less residents trust neighbors .
This proved true in communities large and small , from big cities like Los Angeles , Chicago , Houston , and Boston to tiny Yakima , Washington , rural South Dakota , and the mountains of West Virginia .
In diverse San Francisco and Los Angeles , about 30 percent of people say that they trust neighbors a lot .
In ethnically homogeneous communities in the Dakotas , the figure is 70 percent to 80 percent .
Diversity does not produce “ bad race relations , ” Putnam says .
Rather , people in diverse communities tend “ to withdraw even from close friends , to expect the worst from their community and its leaders , to volunteer less , give less to charity and work on community projects less often , to register to vote less , to agitate for social reform more , but have less faith that they can actually make a difference , and to huddle unhappily in front of the television . ”
Putnam adds a crushing footnote : his findings “ may underestimate the real effect of diversity on social withdrawal . ”
Neither age nor disparities of wealth explain this result .
“ Americans raised in the 1970s , ” he writes , “ seem fully as unnerved by diversity as those raised in the 1920s . ”
And the “ hunkering down ” occurred no matter whether the communities were relatively egalitarian or showed great differences in personal income .
Even when communities are equally poor or rich , equally safe or crime - ridden , diversity correlates with less trust of neighbors , lower confidence in local politicians and news media , less charitable giving and volunteering , fewer close friends , and less happiness .
Putnam has long been aware that his findings could have a big effect on the immigration debate .
Last October , he told the Financial Times that “ he had delayed publishing his research until he could develop proposals to compensate for the negative effects of diversity . ”
He said it “ would have been irresponsible to publish without that , ” a quote that should raise eyebrows .
Academics are n’t supposed to withhold negative data until they can suggest antidotes to their findings .
Nor has Putnam made details of his study available for examination by peers and the public .
So far , he has published only an initial summary of his findings , from a speech he gave after winning an award in Sweden , in the June issue of Scandinavian Political Studies .
His office said Putnam is in Britain , working on a religion project at the University of Manchester , and is currently too busy to grant an interview .
Putnam ’s study does make two positive points : in the long run , increased immigration and diversity are inevitable and desirable , and successful immigrant societies “ dampen the negative effects of diversity ” by constructing new identities .
Social psychologists have long favored the optimistic hypothesis that contact between different ethnic and racial groups increases tolerance and social solidarity .
For instance , white soldiers assigned to units with black soldiers after World War II were more relaxed about desegregation of the army than were soldiers in all - white units .
But Putnam acknowledges that most empirical studies do not support the “ contact hypothesis . ”
In general , they find that the more people are brought into contact with those of another race or ethnicity , the more they stick to their own , and the less they trust others .
Putnam writes : “ Across local areas in the United States , Australia , Sweden Canada and Britain , greater ethnic diversity is associated with lower social trust and , at least in some cases , lower investment in public goods . ”
Though Putnam is wary of what right - wing politicians might do with his findings , the data might give pause to those on the left , and in the center as well .
If he ’s right , heavy immigration will inflict social deterioration for decades to come , harming immigrants as well as the native - born .
Putnam is hopeful that eventually America will forge a new solidarity based on a “ new , broader sense of we . ”
The problem is how to do that in an era of multiculturalism and disdain for assimilation .
It seems we ’re finding that the religious right does n’t speak for the majority of Americans , the majority of Republicans , the majority of conservatives , or even the majority of Christians .
Every group in America , Democrats and Republicans , Christians and non-Christians , Protestants , Catholics , and even self - described conservatives all give their majority support for the adding sexual orientation to the already - existing federal hate crimes law .
That ’s rather amazing data , especially since George Bush ’s staff is threatening a possible veto .
( Is it any coincidence that that Bush ’s approval rating is at 28 % and the percentage of Americans who oppose the bill is 27 % ?
Bush is governing for only 27 % of the American people , for the fringe of his own party . )
These results may be news to a lot of the media , and especially politicians in Washington , who give the religious right far more credit than they deserve .
They are fringe extremists who do n’t even represent most Christians , let alone most Americans .

The sponge crab holds a living sponge on top of its shell to keep hidden , and scientists were shocked to discover the unusual beastie living near Bristol .
When the critter was found off Lundy Island , scientists did n't recognize it at first , and , after taking photos , threw the creepy crustacean back .
The crabs are normally only found off North Wales in the UK .
It 's hoped that the arrival of the crab off Lundy means they are returning to the area , where they were once common .
The odd animals hold onto sponges with their back legs , and are covered in small hairs .
They are so good at camouflaging themselves , they are pretty much impossible to spot unless they move .
If they can't find a suitable sponge to crouch under , the clawed masters of disguise have been known to use bits of rope and even old flip - flops .

Yield to government the monopoly over the issue and supply of money , and government will inflate that supply to its own advantage and to the detriment of the politically powerless .
Once we adopt the distinctively Austrian approach of “ methodological individualism , ” once we realize that government is not a superhuman institution dedicated to the common good and the general welfare , but a group of individuals devoted to furthering their economic interests , then the reason for the inherent inflationism of government as money monopolist becomes crystal clear .
~ Murray Rothbard from " The Austrian Theory of Money " ( .pdf )
As I ( sort of ) expected , my postal competition essay generated a lot of interest .
Wait , I 'm lying .
I never expected it to generate that much interest !
Frankly though , I did ask for it .
The issue seemed basically cut-and - dried and the points I made were largely obvious , or so I thought .
The USPS is protected from competition ( in first - class mail ) by fiat .
This is a direct result of legislation , which has , at its root , a desire to protect the Service from competition .
People such as Lysander Spooner , et al. , have challenged this monopoly more than once , with varying degrees of success .
Generally , when they failed , it was because of the imposition of fines .
In my essay , I wondered what might happen if that " protection " did n't exist , while positing some possible outcomes .
Debating those outcomes is always fun , but it 's not really what we should focus on .
( One point does deserve a quick mention , outside those I discuss below .
In my original piece , I mentioned that mailboxes appear to be positioned at the convenience of the carrier .
This is not true .
They are positioned at the convenience of the Service , which is exactly what one would expect !
Of course , this is still antithetical to what could happen in a free market situation .
Many thanks to the respondent — a postal carrier — who pointed this nuance out . )
We are and should be , focusing on the State , not any of its victims .
The bulk of the feedback to my piece , once I dug a little deeper , and once I got past a couple of ad hominem attacks ( including at least one mention of my apparent mental retardation ) was more about larger — much larger — issues than the post office and whether or not it is well run .
Those larger issues , many of them raised by astute postal employees , were ( and are ) about freedom and what it really means .
It is those larger issues that make Rothbard 's quote above so germane .
While we 're talking about delivering a service versus controlling the currency , we are still talking about a monopoly , and what a government - sponsored monopoly means to freedom .
Let us be clear .
With kudos to Marc Stevens for originally using this metaphor , delivering any service at the barrel of a gun — which is how all government services are delivered — is immoral .
( It does n't matter if the service is delivered directly by a government agency , or by an agency that operates under government authority and / or heavy regulation . )
This issue is morally clear no matter how much anyone likes that service , or how many people ostensibly benefit from that service , or how widespread that service is , or how long that service has existed .
The bottom line is :
If your service is so great , you should be willing to deliver it voluntarily , without government protection or legal requirement .
Furthermore , the fact that something " good " comes of your initial act of aggression is irrelevant .
As I did once before , using an information technology motif , and mining the responses for common themes , I have prepared a " Frequently Asked Questions " ( FAQ ) list .
Question # 1 : What about all the people who live in far - away places ?
Answer # 1 : This excellent question , by far the most often asked , is really about the concept of Universal Service , which while codified in the laws that protect the USPS , also requires it to provide a particular type of service .
Simply put , it is mandated by law that everyone , no matter where they live , must be covered by postal service , at a price that is " equal " to that of all other regions .
Quoting from the USPS Transformation Plan ( .pdf ) , we have :
[ The ] universal service obligation , or USO , as summarized in the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 , requires the Postal Service to " provide prompt , reliable , and efficient services to patrons in all areas and …render postal services to all communities " at " fair and equitable " rates .
The Act further requires the Postal Service to " receive , transmit , and deliver throughout the United States written and printed matter , parcels and like materials … "
A very similar requirement exists in the UK .
Given that so much of the U.S. is rural , this puts a considerable burden upon anyone who would deliver mail .
I could analyze this requirement further , but that strikes me as unnecessary , particularly given the basic premise that any service , no matter how humane , that is funded via theft at the barrel of a gun is immoral and cannot be otherwise .
Where I might choose to live is my decision and my decision alone .
( Well , actually , my wife decided , but I helped . )
Mail delivery is simply another factor in that choice , much like access to water for recreation , access to roads for travel , access to shopping malls for , well , shopping , or the access to plentiful and affordable adult beverage vendors .
If the State cannot offer me a service without infringing upon the rights of others — it never can — then I cannot support that service .
It is also worth noting from where the initial driving forces for the USO arose .
A wonderful historical piece from the Cato Journal , on the economics of the Post Office during the time of 1839  1851 ( .pdf ) , goes into some detail regarding how private companies challenged the Post Office , offered better services , and forced lower prices .
This quote from that piece is instructive :
The subsidy of rural routes excited much controversy .
Living in thinly populated areas entails higher transportation and communication costs .
It is a common government policy to subsidize the higher rural costs .
High - volume routes between the cities and large towns of the Northeast made sizable profits that were partially spent by politicians in creating and maintaining unprofitable low - volume routes for rural voters .
Basically , politicians , looking to " buy " votes from rural voters , used the monopoly of the post office to do so .
( This is about as surprising as finding a roach that likes garbage .
As I 've said many times about the State — second verse same as the first . )
Additionally , one could argue — and many respondents did — that because of the lack of a universal service requirement , competitors of the USPS can enjoy market segments that are high margin and leave the " grunt work " to the USPS .
I have little doubt that this is true , but my suggestions are , have been , and will be , for truly free markets in all things .
Either we want socialism or we want freedom , but we can't have both .
Question # 2 : Do n't you know that the USPS ( i.e. , nationwide mail delivery ) is mandated by the Constitution ?
Answer #
2 : The number of times and the passion with which this was said were truly epic .
While similar to the universal service objection , this point is also different as well .
Certainly opinions differ , even here at LRC , about the Constitution 's applicability to an anarcho - capitalist society .
One particularly astute respondent provided some fascinating information and called upon the hallowed name of Benjamin Franklin , who apparently set up that first post office to " guarantee that people could communicate with each other without worry . "
Here is a pertinent quote from a historical piece on the early post office :
Mr. Franklin was well aware of the importance of post offices and the delivery of mail and saw to it that this vital system to a new government would be protected .
The Constitution of 1789 mandated the establishment of post offices and post roads .
Congress made the U. S. Post Office a part of the federal government .
President Washington appointed Samuel Osgood as the first postmaster general .
I have n't a clue why Franklin believed what he did , but I 'm not sure that matters much in this case .
The Constitution may or may not be a fine document , but again , I 'm not debating that point .
Just by virtue of the fact that something appears ( or does not appear ) in that document says little about its truth or falsehood .
The fact that a Founding Father believed or did not believe something is also largely irrelevant .
As a proponent of market anarchism , my preference is , again , for truly free markets — as driven by universal morality — regardless of what we may have had , what we have , or what certain people seem to enjoy .
Question # 3 : Have n't you heard about all the places that already tried " privatization " with poor results ?
Answer # 3 : This comment probably ranks third , just behind universal service and the Constitution , in passion and the number of e-mails its proponents were willing to send .
There are examples , of differing applicability , on both sides of the question .
One respondent mentioned Sweden , and noted that while the technology had improved , he was unsure that the consumer had really seen any benefits :
If you want to study how such a market changes as private companies are allowed to enter the market one could study the Swedish market , which was first in the world to get rid of the monopoly .
Now , since 97 , we have the “ royal mail ” and CityMail ® who compete for market share .
For business [es ] , the introduction of CityMail ® has meant a lot as the royal mail and CityMail ® now are competing .
There has been great advancement in technique for reaching out to the right customers by using computer programs and information from different institutions ( all information that can be found in the Swedish authorities is public in Sweden , i.e. all IRS information and such ) .
So the introduction of the private company has led to better ways for advertisement to reach the right customers , but this far the consumers have had little or nothing to gain .
Another respondent mentioned New Zealand , and related the relative success they have experienced after government privatization of the postal service :
In New Zealand now , you get a choice of 4 or 5 differently colored mailboxes to use and several postal providers franchise their customer service to retail stores such as cafes .
[ There has been a ] decrease in the cost of a 1st class stamp from 45 to 40 ( 35 US to 30US ) .
Note [ that ] any company or individual can legally operate a business delivering letters .
[ Also note ] the fact that twenty - three ( 23 ) other postal operators were registered [ after privatization . ]
Some of the special services that [ are now ] offered are non-standard mail shapes ( coconut mail , voicemail , i.e. , singing telegrams for the blind ) , scanning and emailing receipt / printing and sending of mail , fax interface to mail etc .
That scenario seems to be playing out to the advantage of the consumer .
Yet another respondent mentioned the Netherlands and gave examples of all the ways the market can respond negatively ( or unexpectedly ) to incentives generated by privatization efforts of the State :
We do have competition in postal services here in the Netherlands ; it [ results in ] several problems you should take into account :
One company starts competing [ by ] delivering post only once a week and takes all profitable parcels ; the other companies lose business , service drops , prices go up ; or ,
One company starts paying not minimum wage but a " by - parcel " system .
Competition has to lower wages [ in response ] or they can't compete ; or ,
New startup companies " pick cherries . " ( Picking Cherries :
Slang for a company competing only in the profitable business sectors while the company with which they compete is forced — usually by government edict — to continue the non-profitable sectors . )
This decreases available services ; more expensive services become unprofitable and are dropped .
: Slang for a company competing only in the profitable business sectors while the company with which they compete is forced — usually by government edict — to continue the non-profitable sectors . )
This decreases available services ; more expensive services become unprofitable and are dropped .
Postal offices lean down , become smaller , and lay off people .
What they can automate is automated , or services are simply no longer offered .
Lines * do* become longer .
All in all , what we [ have ] seen so far is that competition has not been entirely favorable .
It looks like results of competition in basic services are ambiguous .
On the one hand , these results point out a basic truth : if you 've still got government control , you do n't have a truly free market .
( New Zealand still sounds like they 're doing pretty well though ! )
Each of these examples still has varying degrees of government involvement in the delivery of mail .
It is no surprise when the effects of partial - privatization are unexpected or sometimes even negative .
( This is why " deregulation " of energy in California was so bad , not because of the market . )
However , I 'm not suggesting " reform " of the postal laws , or " partial privatization " of the postal service .
I am positing the likely positive effects of a truly free market on that enterprise .
On the other hand , and most likely , many , if not most people , particularly those used to State control , simply do not trust the free market .
This is a common situation .
I attempted to address such mistrust in my third essay ever at LRC when I said :
The market works just fine without help .
This is the one libertarian premise that often gets the most push - back from those who “ know ” that without help , or control , or rules and regulations , some evil person somewhere will take advantage of the unwashed proletariat , make a ton of money , and dump the resulting toxic waste into the nearest aquifer — probably while driving an SUV , twirling his handlebar mustache , and smoking an unfiltered cigarette .
( Snidely Whiplash lives ! )
I openly admit that I believed this until I spent just a few years running my own business .
Few endeavors can put misplaced incentives and ham - handed charity into plain view and perspective like full - contact entrepreneurship — in my case , owning , rehabbing , and managing inner city rental property .
Rather than spend one more moment regaling you with my own hard - learned lessons , I recommend that anyone with any questions in this arena begin by consulting none other than Murray Rothbard via an article entitled , appropriately enough , “ What Is the Free Market ? ”
If Rothbard cannot convince you , then I am , and likely have been , wasting both your time and mine .
Indeed .
I 'll take the free market every time , if given the choice .
Right now , we do n't have that choice .
Question # 4 : What 's so bad about junk mail ?
Answer # 4 : This is another great question .
The analysis from my respondent was so good , I will quote it for all to enjoy .
He began :
I disagree with your analysis about junk mail .
The sender is any postal service ’s customer .
The recipient is simply the service they provide the sender .
The recipient rarely spends anything to receive his mail .
The sender pays the bill .
I think there would be a lot more junk mail as postal services tried to maximize profits by delivering as much mail as possible .
It 's hard to argue with that .
He goes on :
Imagine if a postal service offered a junk mail sorting service .
They would essentially not deliver certain types of mail to customers that did n’t want that type of mail .
There would still be a market for advertisers to get advertisements to these people .
A competitor would offer an unfiltered service at a cheaper price because they would n’t have to sort the mail , and soon you would be getting more junk mail than ever and the first company would go out of business .
Indeed .
The person who sends junk mail is simply a customer , and as such , is paying for the opportunity to send " junk " to any recipient for whom he has an address .
As I told my respondent , that 's good stuff !
Junk mail is simply a need being met by the market .
People want to sell things .
They pay for advertising , which includes mailing circulars to possible customers .
Customers ' reactions provide a response to those mailings .
The fact that the junk mail , including spam , continues to be sent illustrates logically that it works !
Quoting this respondent one last time , " So , as much as I hate to say it …
Long live junk mail . "
I can't argue with that , and little more need be said .
( I still hate spam — and who does n't — but if it did n't work , I likely would n't be getting any . )
Question # 5 : How can you expect the USPS to become private when the IRS , DOJ , and other government agencies use it for free ?
Answer # 5 : This is a subtle point that I had not directly considered .
It actually points to yet another reason why allowing the gubmint to run things always results in additional costs for the consumer .
Allow me to quote my respondent directly :
The postal service will forever remain because of at least two government agencies : the IRS and the US Armed Forces .
The IRS will continue to exclusively use the USPS for tax purposes as it ’s secure and reliable .
US army bases exclusively use the USPS as it is reliable for overseas servicemen to receive mail and correspondence .
He makes a valid point , to be sure .
Here 's the thing though .
I do n't think the IRS , the DOJ , and the Armed Forces , etc. , should exist either !
( Note my previous and oft - repeated stance on market anarchism . )
As such , I 'm not worried that other gubmint teat suckers will lose their " most reliable " method of shipment .
I do n't mean to be flippant , but they 're wasting my money too .
Another somewhat related issue in this area is the ways the appropriations I previously mentioned were actually used .
Various respondents corrected me by saying that any money the USPS receives from Congress generally goes to pay for " franking " of Congressional mail , among other things .
( Franking : Stamping a letter with a special machine , so that it does n't require a stamp to be delivered . )
In essence , the members of Congress get to mail stuff for free , and they eventually ( or occasionally ? ) pay for that service after the fact .
Call me crazy , but since all money spent by the State originates with — is stolen from — taxpayers , what that money might be called on " the books " is largely irrelevant .
Question # 6 : The price hike was only $ .02 — is n't that a bargain ?
Answer # 6 : This question or objection was covered , or so I thought , in my initial essay .
I 'll cover it again , just for completeness .
I have n't a clue what a " reasonable " price is , and neither does anyone else , since we 've only got the legally - mandated options .
( I do find it interesting to note that in almost every historical case , outside competition did drive prices down . )
With apologies for appealing to authority , Mises already wrote pretty extensively regarding the fact that economic calculations are impossible under socialism .
In analyzing another government intervention of the free market — national parks — Manuel Lora explained the economics of this situation quite fully :
Whenever there is an exchange of goods , those who are engaging in it are ex ante better off than they would have been had they not traded ; they expect to benefit from the exchange or they would not be doing it .
If A is buying apples from B for $ 1 , then A must necessarily value the apples more then he values the dollar .
A similar thing happens with B , who thinks that the value of the dollar is greater than the value of the apples .
Free exchange is therefore a double inequality .
Under government intervention , however , the relationship between those exchanging goods is no longer as it is described above .
Instead of two parties freely deciding to exchange goods based on their needs and calculating through prices , the government is the one that gets to set the terms , unilaterally .
It allocates resources according to the political climate , neglecting the needs of everyone by proposing and establishing one - size - fits - all schemes .
Instead of both parties being better off , one ( usually the politician or lobbyist ) becomes better off at the expense of the other .
Indeed .
This type of thinking — that the State can properly set a " good " price — reflects a basic misunderstanding of economics , much like saying that $ X is a " rip- off " for hotdogs at a baseball game .
Here 's a lesson I stole from Gene Callahan 's excellent Austrian economic primer , Economics for Real People :
If you 've a choice then you can't get ripped off .
Conversely , if the buyer has no choice , calling any price a bargain is rather problematic .
Supply and demand drives the seller to set the price at the highest point where sufficient — whatever that means to him — sales will occur .
Conclusion
What an interesting subject !
More importantly , this is a subject that crosses many lines of fact , perception , and belief .
As I mentioned in my opening paragraphs , this issue is morally clear no matter how much anyone likes a government service , or how many people ostensibly benefit from that service , or how widespread that service is , or how long that service has existed .
No one can morally deliver a product or service at the barrel of a gun .
Some may feel that even if the State takes an immoral action , some good can still come of it .
That does n't make it moral .
To use a Walter Block example :
If I kidnap someone , I am a villain , and I have infringed upon his or her life and property .
If it is later found out that as a result of my kidnapping my victim does not die in an accident that would otherwise have claimed their life , am I somehow less of a villain ?
No .
Just because I like the result does n't make the approach with which it was delivered morally justifiable .
Some may feel that if the State uses its overwhelming advantage of force to noble goals , few should complain .
I disagree .
To use a Walter Williams example :
If I approach someone on the street and ask for a donation to help fund a loved one 's surgery , I am submitting myself to his or her charity and any money I receive is moral .
On the other hand , if I approach someone on the street for the same purpose , but I 'm holding out a gun , I really can't call it charity or moral even if it is collected for the same purpose .
Regardless of one 's opinion about the USPS , it must be made clear that the free market drives innovation better than can ever be accomplished by government fiat .
Let us end by consulting the Cato piece again .
The pressure of competition from private firms was responsible for bringing about lower postage rates .
It was also responsible for changing the nature of postal service .
Private companies introduced payment - by - weight , prepayment , postage stamps , and home delivery to the American market .
Those reforms were adopted afterward by the Post Office .
We also find :
Besides driving down Post Office prices , private companies introduced a number of reforms that originated in Great Britain .
Private mail companies first introduced to the United States the practice of charging mail by weight .
Finally we end with :
The effect of private competition went beyond the drop in postage rates .
An equally important effect was the introduction of new techniques into the U.S. market .
The most important innovations were prepayment with stamps and intra-city pickup and delivery .
The Post Office showed no sign of adopting such innovations until they were successfully used by private companies .
Indeed .
The free market is the means by which innovation and cost - effectiveness best occurs .
So it was .
So it is .
So it shall be .

When a fire becomes sufficiently intense , its heat creates a rising column of air so strong that surrounding air is drawn into the void , creating a draft that sustains and intensifies the fire .
It becomes a self - sustaining , self - intensifying organism : a firestorm .
The violence in Nigeria ’s delta region has become a firestorm , and the consequences of this transformation will fundamentally impact that nation ’s ability to export oil .
Recent events in the delta region have transitioned the violence there from a negative - feedback loop where there was a disincentive to militants to shut in too high a portion of Nigeria ’s oil exports to a positive - feedback loop where militants will compete to completely destroy Nigeria ’s capacity to export oil .
MEND & the Ijaw Insurgency : A Negative - Feedback Loop
A little background : Nigeria is a construct of post - colonial cartography .
It is one of history ’s foremost examples of the fiction of the Nation - State , a forced amalgamation of over 250 distinct ethnic groups and numerous religions ( see illustration ) to effect efficient British control of the region .
In the post - colonial era , three dominant ethnic groups , the Hausa - Fulani , Igbo , and Yoruba , continue to joust for control of Nigeria ’s huge oil revenues — and for control of Nigeria itself , though this is truly and ancillary concern to the oil .
One thing has remained constant : the ethnic Ijaw , who inconveniently live where all the oil is , have been almost entirely excluded from sharing in the oil riches in their own backyard .
As a result , the Ijaw resorted to violence to advance their political aims of representation in Nigeria ’s government and a real share in the oil revenues .
Figure 2 : Overview of Nigerian Ethnic Groups
Figure 3 : Overview of Nigerian Oil Infrastructure
MEND , the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta , was the military branch of the Ijaw struggle .
It was relatively easy for the government of Nigeria to reign in the violence in the Niger delta for two reasons : MEND had clearly defined political motivations , and a long - term interest in the viability of Nigeria as an oil exporting state .
Further , as a coherent tribal society , the traditional system of tribal relations and leadership exerted effective control over the actions of MEND .
Because the motivations of the Ijaw power structure were clearly defined ( setting up transparent game rules ) , the Nigerian government and foreign oil companies operating in the Delta had two effective tools to reign in violence when it threatened their profits : offer talks on political issues , or buy peace with aid and development projects .
The situation was violent yet stable — the slow diplomatic dance between parties with predictable motivations acted as a negative feedback loop preventing the violence from escalating out of control .
Free -Market Insurgency : A Positive - Feedback Loop
Over the past year this relatively stable system has rapidly broken down , and the result is the likelihood of a runaway escalation in violence .
MEND fractioned amidst infighting among Ijaw tribal alliances .
Various factions , with various political agendas , neutralized the ability to push for peace through negotiations — there was no single party , nor accession to a single set of demands , that could defuse the motivation to violence .
In addition , the ransom money that foreign oil companies now routinely paid for the return of western employees spawned a market for guerrilla entrepreneurs — actors who were less motivated by traditional Ijaw political goals than by a return on investment .
The lure of easy money has led to a proliferation of militant groups ( now perhaps best characterized as criminal gangs ) and a dramatic increase in attacks .
This infusion of easy money to youthful militants broke down the traditional tribal structure of respect for leadership by elders — much as the infusion of easy drug money makes urban street gangs in the US less accountable to traditional cultural and familial restraints .
Figure 4 : Grim Economic Reality Pushes Ijaw Youth to Crime
Finally , because of the shift from a political motivation to a profit motivation , militants are no longer invested in preserving the long - term viability of Nigeria as an oil exporter .
As a result , the targeting strategy has shifted from the temporary sabotage of infrastructure for political ends to threats of permanent destruction of key infrastructure nodes — targets that can force higher protection payments and therefore higher returns on investment .
All three of these factors are contributing to the rapid tipping of the violence in Nigeria ’s delta from a stable , negative - feedback system to an escalating , positive - feedback system .
Figure 5 : Heavily Armed Youth Gangs in Speedboats Rally in Permissive Terrain
Ramifications
The escalating violence in Nigeria has two important ramifications :
First , the tip from stable violence to perpetual escalation of violence represents a sea change in the level of disruption to Nigeria ’s oil exports .
The controlled Ijaw violence under a unified MEND had a strong disincentive to either shut - in excessive portions of Nigeria ’s oil exports or to inflict long - term damage on that export capability .
The new entrepreneurial violence is comprised of multiple actors , each competing to extort money from a limited target list of oil installations , foreign workers , and foreign oil companies .
Because the actors are now militant youths seeking short - term financial gain , rather than careful elders seeking long - term political concessions , there is a strong market incentive to fill the available market space — in other words , to escalate kidnappings and infrastructure attacks until all Nigerian production is shut in .
Admittedly , these militants will face diminishing marginal returns as the level of Nigeria production approaches 100 % .
But for the disaffected youths of the Niger delta , living amidst broken tribal structures , ballooning populations , and the environmental devastation of the local oil industry , a very small marginal return on investment in violence is still the best economic prospect available .
Figure 6 : A Hostage Surrounded by Ijaw Militants
Second , this transition from ideologically motivated violence to financially motivated violence portends problems for energy infrastructure throughout the world .
As peak oil exacerbates already tight global energy markets , record energy prices will allow energy firms everywhere to accept the kind of ransoms and payoffs that are fuelling the escalation of violence in Nigeria ’s delta region .
There is good reason to believe that today ’s sectarian or ideologically driven violence in Iraq and elsewhere may transition to financially motivated attacks on energy infrastructure .
This transition will be accompanied by the same critical change observed in Nigeria : there will no longer be the motivation to keep the majority of production on - line , or to prevent long - term damage to production capacity .
Instead , as long as marginal returns on investments in energy infrastructure attacks remain positive , there will be a strong incentive to escalate these attacks no matter how completely a region ’s export capacity is destroyed .
If one accepts the proposition that peak oil will lead to global economic hardships , then this incentive will be further increased .
The ability to pay “ protection ” for oil infrastructure is a direct function of the profitability of producing oil , and as such the peaking of world oil production — to the extent that it increases prices faster than production costs — will perpetually increase the incentive to attack energy infrastructure targets .
Figure 7 : Hyperspectral Satellite Image of Oil Installation in Nigeria — Note dense jungle in close proximity to facility perimeter , a result of economics - driven design .
Finally , it is worth considering that energy infrastructure was designed to optimize economic performance , not security and defensibility .
Economic considerations force an infrastructure design methodology consisting of largely centralized structures with multiple single points of failure , and networks vulnerable to cascading failures .
As a result , even in oil producing states with functional security services , there is a high vulnerability to financially motivated infrastructure attacks .
While a Nigerian scenario may seem unthinkable in the United States , consider our nation ’s success in interdicting the drug trade .
The market for energy is significantly larger than the market for drugs — and so is the incentive to militants to conduct financially motivated attacks on energy infrastructure .
If this analysis is correct , the increasing incentives to attack energy infrastructure will become yet another factor accelerating the rate of decline of global energy production .

Depressive disorders make one feel exhausted , worthless , helpless , and hopeless .
Such negative thoughts and feelings make some people feel like giving up .
It is important to realize that these negative views are part of the depression and typically do not accurately reflect the actual circumstances .
Negative thinking fades as treatment begins to take effect .
In the meantime :
Set realistic goals in light of the depression and assume a reasonable amount of responsibility .
Break large tasks into small ones , set some priorities , and do what you can as you can .
Try to be with other people and to confide in someone ; it is usually better than being alone and secretive .
Participate in activities that may make you feel better .
Mild exercise , going to a movie , a ballgame , or participating in religious , social , or other activities may help .
Expect your mood to improve gradually , not immediately .
Feeling better takes time .
It is advisable to postpone important decisions until the depression has lifted .
Before deciding to make a significant transition change jobs , get married or divorced discuss it with others who know you well and have a more objective view of your situation .
People rarely " snap out of " a depression .
But they can feel a little better day - by - day .
Remember , positive thinking will replace the negative thinking that is part of the depression and will disappear as your depression responds to treatment .
Let your family and friends help you .
How Family and Friends Can Help the Depressed Person
The most important thing anyone can do for the depressed person is to help him or her get an appropriate diagnosis and treatment .
This may involve encouraging the individual to stay with treatment until symptoms begin to abate ( several weeks ) , or to seek different treatment if no improvement occurs .
On occasion , it may require making an appointment and accompanying the depressed person to the doctor .
It may also mean monitoring whether the depressed person is taking medication .
The depressed person should be encouraged to obey the doctor 's orders about the use of alcoholic products while on medication .
The second most important thing is to offer emotional support .
This involves understanding , patience , affection , and encouragement .
Engage the depressed person in conversation and listen carefully .
Do not disparage feelings expressed , but point out realities and offer hope .
Do not ignore remarks about suicide .
Report them to the depressed person 's therapist .
Invite the depressed person for walks , outings , to the movies , and other activities .
Be gently insistent if your invitation is refused .
Encourage participation in some activities that once gave pleasure , such as hobbies , sports , religious or cultural activities , but do not push the depressed person to undertake too much too soon .
The depressed person needs diversion and company , but too many demands can increase feelings of failure .
Do not accuse the depressed person of faking illness or of laziness , or expect him or her " to snap out of it . "
Eventually , with treatment , most people do get better .
Keep that in mind , and keep reassuring the depressed person that , with time and help , he or she will feel better .

" What we have announced today is a plan that will deliver to 99 percent of the Australian population very fast and affordable broadband in just two years ' time , " Howard said .
An expert group will also develop a bidding process for the building of a fibre - to - the - node ( FTTN ) broadband network , funded solely by private companies , in major cities .
Communications Minister Helen Coonan said wireless was the best option for rural Australia because it was impossible to install cables which would reach every farm and property across the country .
" It 's been specially developed for rural and regional areas , where ( with ) fixed broadband you 've got to actually run a fibre optic , " she said .
Senator Coonan said the broadband speed of 12 megabits per second could " scale up " to very fast speeds as the technology evolved .
" It will be able to go much faster , up to 70 megabits a second and of course our new high - speed fibre network will be able to go up to 50 , " she said .
But the opposition labour Party attacked the plan , saying it was too little , too late ahead of this year 's election and provided country people with a second - rate service .
" The government proposes a two - tier system -- a good system for the cities , they say , and a second - rate system for rural and regional Australia , " labour leader Kevin Rudd said .
labour has proposed spending 4.7 billion US dollars to build a national fibre optic network which would cover 98 percent of the population .
The National Party , which is part of Howard 's ruling Liberal / National coalition , welcomed the proposal but said it would continue to push for FTTN technology in regional areas .
Nationals Senator Barnaby Joyce said the fact that Australia was a vast country with a small population meant it would always be playing catch - up with other countries when it came to broadband .
" We 'll always be catching up , always , because we are 20 million people in a country ( the size ) of the United States without Alaska , " he said .
Why you should be using disambiguated URLs
Good URLs are important .
The best URLs are readable , reliable and hackable .
One of the nice things about Rails , Django and other modern Web frameworks is that most of them encourage smart URL design .
Rails has relatively smart defaults and a powerful routing system for custom URLs ; Django forces you to think about URL design up front by defining them as regular expressions .
Many of the definitive “ Web 2.0 ” sites such as Flickr and del.icio.us also use well designed URLs .
This is a positive trend , and long may it continue .
There ’s one aspect of URL design that is often ignored .
Good URLs should be unambiguous .
By that , I mean that any logical piece of content should have one and only one definitive URL , with any alternatives acting as a permanent redirect .
This rule is frequently broken .
Here are some examples :
My Flickr photo stream lives at www.flickr.com/photos/simon/ and flickr.com/photos/simon/
and My del.icio.us account is at del.icio.us/simonw and del.icio.us/simonw/
and The YDN Python Developer center lives at both http://developer.yahoo.com/python/ and http://developer.yahoo.com/python/index.html
and The Google AdSense sign - in page is at https://www.google.com/adsense/ and https://google.com/adsense/ .
If you visit the latter you get a scary certificate warning ( they really need to fix that ) .
In each of the above cases , it ’s obvious to regular people that the URLs are the same .
Unfortunately , from a technical point of view they are different and could quite feasibly serve up different content .
This causes all kinds of problems :
Caches ( both browser and intermediate proxies ) can’t improve performance if you request the same content from a different URL .
Browser ca n’t show users their visited links .
Social link sharing sites such as del.icio.us can’t accurately aggregate links to the same resource .
That last one in particular should catch your attention if you care about effectively promoting your site .
Here ’s a random example , plucked from today ’s del.icio.us popular .
convinceme.net is a new online debating site ( tag clouds , gradient fills , rounded corners ) .
It ’s listed in del.icio.us a total of four times !
Combined that ’s 433 saves ; much more impressive , and more likely to end up at the top of a social sharing sites .
Here ’s a useful rule of thumb :
Links to ( and within ) your site should never , ever end with index.php / index.html / default.aspx / any default directory index filename .
The whole point those defaults is that you can link to the containing directory to see their content , resulting in a shorter and prettier URL .
If you ’re linking to them directly you ’re missing out on a golden opportunity to disambiguate your URLs .
Disambiguating your URLs is n’t particularly difficult .
The no - www site offers tips on having one domain name redirect to the other , and there are various mod_rewrite techniques for achieving the desired effect as well .
If mod_rewrite makes your hair stand on end , remember that if you are using a server - side scripting language such as PHP you can implement rewriting logic in your application code by examining the $ _ENV [ ' PATH_INFO ' ] variable or your platform ’s equivalent .
Django sites get this behaviour for free , thanks to some default settings and Django ’s CommonMiddleware .

ROME , May 1 — Even at the Vatican , not all sacred beliefs are absolute :
Thou shalt not kill , but war can be just .
Now , behind the quiet walls , a clash is shaping up involving two poles of near certainty : the church 's long - held ban on condoms and its advocacy of human life .
The issue is AIDS .
Church officials recently confirmed that Pope Benedict XVI had requested a report on whether it might be acceptable for Catholics to use condoms in one narrow circumstance : to protect life inside a marriage when one partner is infected with H.I.V. or is sick with AIDS .
Whatever the pope decides , church officials and other experts broadly agree that it is remarkable that so delicate an issue is being taken up .
But they also agree that such an inquiry is logical , and particularly significant from this pope , who was Pope John Paul II 's strict enforcer of church doctrine .
" In some ways , maybe he has got the greatest capacity to do it because there is no doubt about his orthodoxy , " said the Rev. Jon Fuller , a Jesuit physician who runs an AIDS clinic at the Boston Medical Center .
March 12 , 2007  --
A pair of white jockey underwear sits on a bookshelf in the living room .
Rat traps adorn nooks and crannies of the dilapidated kitchen .
In the refrigerator -- a jar of olives maybe five or six years old .
In the freezer , venison at least twice , if not three times , as old .
Two sagging unmade beds with dingy sheets stand forlornly in opposite corners of the living room .
Believe it or not , this is where four of the most powerful men in the U.S. Congress live when they 're in Washington .
The number two and three leaders of the U.S. Senate -- Majority Whip Sen. Dick Durbin , D - Ill. , and Democratic caucus Vice Chairman Sen. Chuck Schumer , D - N.Y. -- share this house with Rep. Bill Delahunt , D - Mass. , the chairman of a key House subcommittee on human rights , and their landlord , Rep. George Miller , D - Calif. , chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee and the House Democratic Policy Committee .
All four have houses in their home districts , but crash in this two - bedroom townhouse near the Capitol whenever they overnight in the nation 's Capitol , which is quite often .
One March night , the four allowed , for the first time , TV cameras into their humble living quarters -- Delahunt calls it a " hovel " -- to discuss their interesting arrangement over some pizza and beer .
" I 'm sure [ voters ] think we live in big mansions down here with a lot of servants , " Schumer says of their house , which in terms of décor and cleanliness compares unfavorably with the fraternity this reporter belonged to in college .
" There 's just something about living in filth and squalor , " adds Durbin .
" It 's been called ' Animal House . ' "
" Washington is actually a lonely place , " Schumer says .
" Millions of acquaintances , many people want something .
But no friends .
We 're friends . "
" This is probably the closest to a bi-cameral caucus between what 's going on in the Senate and the House , " says Durbin .
" George is very close to the speaker , Nancy Pelosi , and Chuck and I are leadership in the Senate . "
So they have conversations at night that make a difference , Durbin says .
" Bill 's single , so he 's out having a good time , " Schumer laughs .
The four talk politics , families , and have the usual roommate squabbles about chipping in for groceries .
A COSTCO receipt from 1996 hangs by magnet on the refrigerator ; Durbin says he has yet to be repaid for it .
Beneath some vicious teasing -- much of it at the expense of Schumer , who seems perhaps the messiest -- the four seem to genuinely like one another .
Durbin , chipper in a red sweater , shared the tale of the night he confronted a large rat , killing the beast with a golf club .
" I 'm not a good golfer , " Durbin quips .
" I had to three putt . "
Durbin and Schumer are the only members of the Senate who have endorsed a presidential candidate -- Durbin for his fellow Illinoisan , Sen. Barack Obama , D - Ill. , Schumer for his fellow New Yorker , Sen. Hillary Clinton , D - N.Y .
" You are looking at the only two guys in the Senate who have no illusions of running for president , " Schumer says .
Durbin says Obama would n't even entertain the notion of moving in with them .
" He said , ' The idea of seeing Durbin and Schumer in their boxers is too much for me , ' " Durbin says .
" How would you like to wake up every morning at 6 a.m. and see [ Schumer ] in the buff ? "
Delahunt asks .
" We would prefer that he wear a burka , " says Miller .
Miller bought the house in 1977 with his wife , but she soon opted to instead reside in their East Bay district in the San Francisco area .
Other roommates have come and gone based on the fickle whims of politics .
After President Bill Clinton appointed Rep. Leon Panetta , D - Calif. , to be director of the White House 's Office of Management and Budget , White House ethics rules forced Panetta to find new housing , since it was considered inappropriate for an official in the executive branch to be paying rent to one from the legislative branch , Miller recalls with a chuckle .
" So we found Chuck living in a basement somewhere , " Miller recalls .
" He says , ' I can't move because I have to get my things together .
So we looked around the apartment , we picked up his toothbrush and we said , ' We got your things , Chuck , you can come down the street and you can move in with us . ' "
Schumer 's decorating style remains much the same .
His toiletries sit on a nearby bookshelf , what he jokingly calls his " cosmetic cabinet . "
In his closet hang three identical suits , along with charcoal briquettes , shutters and arrows .
Schumer says that he has n't made his bed , wedged right near the entrance , well , ever .
Why make your bed ?
He asks .
You just mess it up again that night .
" Why change your socks ? " asks Durbin .
" Why change your underwear ? " adds Delahunt .
" You wear that suit everyday , " Miller says .
" Why do you get out of it ? "
" They 've been trying to persuade me to make my bed for 32 years , " Schumer laughs .
" No. No . "
The golf shoes of Rep. Marty Russo , D - Ill. , remain in the living room , but he moved out more than 14 years ago after being defeated for reelection in 1992 .
Durbin moved in soon after .
Delahunt replaced former Rep. Sam Gejdensen , D - Conn. , who was defeated in his reelection bid in 2000 .
" On numerous nights , we 'd find [ Delahunt ] banging on the door very late , saying , ' Can I come in ?
Can I come in ? ' "
Miller jokes .
Miller charges $ 750 in rent , per tenant , which " includes utilities and pretzels , " says Delahunt .
" It 's not enough , and all they do is bitch and moan about it , " Miller laughs .
Delahunt arguably has the worst living quarters , wedged in a bed next to the rather fratty kitchen .
Rooms were divvied up based on " seniority , " he says .
" I 'm the rookie .
I 've only served 10 years -- the others are close to 40 . "
" We may be senators , " Schumer says of Miller .
" But he 's the landlord .
We know our place . "

THIS week saw yet another reminder of the awesome power of “ the lobby ” .
The American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) brought more than 6,000 activists to Washington for its annual policy conference .
And they proceeded to live up to their critics ' darkest fears .
They heard from the four most powerful people on Capitol Hill — Nancy Pelosi and John Boehner from the House , Harry Reid and Mitch McConnell from the Senate — as well as the vice - president ( who called his talk “ The United States and Israel : United We Stand ” ) and sundry other power - brokers .
Several first - division presidential candidates held receptions .
The display of muscle was almost equalled by the display of unnerving efficiency .
There were booths for “ congressional check - in ” , booths for “ delegate banquet troubleshooting ” , and booths full of helpful young people .
The only discordant note was sounded by a group of a dozen protesters —
Orthodox Jews in beards , side - curls and heavy black coats — holding up signs saying “ Stop AIPAC ” , “ Torah forbids Jews dictating foreign policy ” , and “ Judaism rejects the state of Israel ” .
The lobbyists had every reason to feel proud of their work .
Congress has more Jewish members than ever before : 30 in the House and a remarkable 13 in the Senate .
( There are now more Jews in Congress than Episcopalians . )
Both parties are competing with each other to be the “ soundest ” on Israel .
About two - thirds of Americans hold a favourable view of the place .
Yet they have reason to feel a bit nervous , too .
The Iraq debacle has produced a fierce backlash against pro-war hawks , of which AIPAC was certainly one .
It has also encouraged serious people to ask awkward questions about America 's alliance with Israel .
And a growing number of people want to push against AIPAC .
One pressure group , the Council for the National Interest — run by two retired congressmen , Paul Findley , a Republican , and James Abourezk , a Democrat — even bills itself as the anti-AIPAC .
The Leviathan may be mightier than ever , but there are more and more Captain Ahabs trying to get their harpoons in .
Some of the most determined are Arab - Americans , who have been growing in numbers and influence for years — there are probably about 3.5 m of them — and who have been in the eye of a political storm since September 11th 2001 .
They are a growing political force in northern Ohio and Michigan , and their institutions , such as the Arab American Institute and the Council on American - Islamic Relations ( CAIR ) , have plenty of access to Middle Eastern money .
But so far their performance has been unimpressive .
James Zogby has been promising a breakthrough for his Arab American Institute for 20 years .
CAIR remains marginal .
Arab - Americans are badly split between Christians ( 63 % ) and Muslims ( 24 % ) .
They have also been late in taking to politics .
Between 1990 and 2004 Arab - Americans donated $ 788,968 to candidates and parties , compared with $ 56.8 m from pro-Israeli groups .
AIPAC 's ace in the hole is the idea that it represents Jewish interests in a country that is generally philo - Semitic .
But liberal Jewish groups retort that it represents only a sliver of Jewish opinion .
A number of more liberal groups have started to use their political muscle — groups such as the Religious Action Centre of Reform Judaism , Americans for Peace Now and the Israel Policy Forum .
These groups scored a significant victory over AIPAC by persuading Congress to water down a particularly uncompromising bit of legislation , the Palestinian Anti-terrorism Act , which would have prevented any American contact with the Palestinian leadership .
This accomplishment led to a flurry of speculation that George Soros might try to institutionalise this successful alliance by creating a liberal version of AIPAC .
It has yet to materialise .
And it is doubtful whether Mr Soros , a left - wing Democrat who has little sympathy with Israel , would be the best patron for such an organisation .
But the growing activism of liberal Jewish groups underlines a worrying fact for AIPAC : most Jews are fairly left - wing .
Fully 77 % of them think that the Iraq war was a mistake compared with 52 % of all Americans .
Eighty - seven per cent of Jews voted for the Democrats in 2006 , and all but four of the Jews in Congress are Democrats .
Dissenting voices
An even bigger threat to AIPAC comes from the general climate of opinion .
It is suddenly becoming possible for serious people — politicians and policymakers as well as academics — to ask hard questions about America 's relationship with Israel .
Is America pursuing its own interests in the Middle East , or Israel's ?
Should America tie itself so closely to the Israeli government 's policies or should it forge other alliances ?
Zbigniew Brzezinski , a former national security adviser , worries that America is seen in the Middle East as “ acting increasingly on behalf of Israel ” .
Condoleezza Rice , the secretary of state , has compared the situation in Palestine to segregation , and argued that there could “ be no greater legacy for America than to help bring into being a Palestinian state ” .
Philip Zelikow , her former counsellor , argues , in diplomatic language , that the only way to create a viable coalition against terrorists that includes Europeans , moderate Arabs and Israelis , is a “ sense that Arab - Israeli issues are being addressed ” .
The biggest challenge facing AIPAC is how to deal with this changing climate .
Its members have been admirably honest about their mission in life .
They boast about passing more than a hundred bits of pro-Israel legislation a year .
But they are too willing to close down the debate with explosive charges of anti-Israel bias when people ask whether this is a good thing .
America needs an open debate about its role in the Middle East — and AIPAC needs to take a positive role in that debate if it is to remain such a mighty force in American politics .

I 'm not sure if you are even still alive as I have n't been by the house since March of 05 , but I hope that you are happy , warm and still catching the beam of sunlight in your favorite spot .
Anyway , just wanted you to know that you were the only cool cat I 've ever known and that I miss you .
" I saw Ron Paul last week in the Republican debates .
He was good , but everybody else ignores what he says . "
This is from an e-mail I received from an economist friend who is a liberal Democrat .
I responded , " Everybody except the viewers .
He won the poll afterward , getting 43 percent .
MSNBC reported it and then dropped it down the memory hole .
I sent him a grand . "
One thing you need to know about me is that I ’m a skinflint .
So for me to send $ 1,000 to Ron Paul for President is a big deal .
Why did I do it ?
Because Ron Paul stood there with the other nine candidates at the Reagan Library " debate " and calmly , yet forcefully , defended the Constitution ( which is the only thing the president swears to defend when he takes the oath ) ; criticized having gone to war with Iraq ( and backed it up by pointing to his " No " vote in 2002 ) ; called for a substantial tax cut ( pointing out that the only way to get such a cut is to roll back the federal government in the lives of both Americans and foreigners ) ; and ended with an impassioned plea to get habeas corpus back .
Not bad for a guy who got less than his one tenth of the time allotted .
Yes , it ’s true , as my economist friend pointed out , that the pundits ignored him .
But the viewers did n’t .
As noted , Paul received a cool 43 percent of the vote in MSNBC ’s 10 - way race , putting him in first place .
Similarly , on conservative Matt Drudge ’s Web site , Ron Paul came in third , with 18 percent of the vote , just two percentage points behind the much - better - funded Rudy Giuliani , although Drudge , like MSNBC , quickly hid the vote .
MSNBC and Drudge were not alone in shredding the data .
As Thomas Woods has pointed out , Dick Morris and Eileen McGann ignored Paul altogether and awarded the prize to John McCain .
Woods quotes historian David Beito as pointing out that Arianna Huffington , on CNN immediately after the " debate , " actually claimed that all 10 Republicans were pro-war .
Was she listening ?
Here was the first question Ron Paul was asked , along with his answer :
" Moderator : Congressman Paul , you voted against the war .
Why are all your fellow Republicans up here wrong ?
" Representative Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) :
That ’s a very good question .
And you might ask the question , why are 70 percent of the American people now wanting us out of there , and why did the Republicans do so poorly last year ?
" So I would suggest that we should look at foreign policy .
I ’m suggesting very strongly that we should have a foreign policy of nonintervention , the traditional American foreign policy and the Republican foreign policy .
" Throughout the 20th century , the Republican Party benefited from a noninterventionist foreign policy .
Think of how Eisenhower came in to stop the Korean War .
Think of how Nixon was elected to stop the mess in Vietnam .
" How did we win the election in the year 2000 ?
We talked about a humble foreign policy :
No nation - building ; do n’t police the world .
That ’s conservative , it ’s Republican , it ’s pro-American  it follows the founding fathers .
And , besides , it follows the Constitution .
" I tried very hard to solve this problem before we went to war by saying , ‘ Declare war if you want to go to war .
Go to war , fight it and win it , but do n’t get into it for political reasons or to enforce UN resolutions or pretend the Iraqis were a national threat to us . ’ "
Does that sound to you like a Republican favoring the war ?
But it ’s possible , just possible , that the pundits do n’t matter much .
They probably mattered more before the Web became so ubiquitous .
Although the Web may not have reduced the pundits ’ power to zero , they are less powerful than they were .
More and more Americans are seeing that they can get valuable information from people who actually engage their brain before speaking .
Which is why it ’s so important for Ron Paul to keep running and speaking and for the rest of us to keep watching , voting , talking , writing , and blogging .
Sometimes , when you see a person say sensible things on TV , further research shows him to be a fraud or at least disappointing .
But I have followed Ron Paul ’s track record over the years , and the more I ’ve looked , the more impressed I ’ve been .
It took a lot of guts for Ron Paul , coming from a congressional district in Texas , to vote against authorizing George W. Bush to make war on Iraq .
But he did it .
It took guts for him to have earlier voted against the USA PATRIOT Act .
But he did that , too .
Ron Paul and I were speakers at an event a few years ago in San Jose .
I told him I was impressed with his voting record and asked him if it was ever hard to show up for work , knowing that his vote in favor of freedom would be outweighed by more than 400 votes against , out of a total of 435 .
He smiled and said no .
Paul gave me a recent example .
After the 2004 Super Bowl halftime show in which Justin Timberlake pulled away Janet Jackson ’s blouse , revealing her breast , the Republicans in Congress introduced a bill to raise the penalties for indecency in broadcasting .
Ron Paul saw the bill as a straightforward violation of the First Amendment and was one of a handful of congressmen to vote against it .
Paul said that he knew he would need to vote no , but that he would have to do more explaining than usual to his constituents .
I found his answer strikingly reassuring .
I ’ve been around a fair number of politicians and their supporters and when I hear them say they " need to " vote a certain way , it ’s typically because they think they should vote the other way but fear that if they vote as they think they should they ’ll be voted out of office or face too much flak .
How refreshing that Congressman Paul made the Constitution , not reelection , the source of his stated need .
I can hardly wait to see him in the May 15 " debate . "
And while I ’m at it , let me say some positive words about former senator Mike Gravel , the most antiwar candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination .
One of the commentators after the Republican debate commented that there had been no comic relief in that debate , unlike in the Democrat debate .
Clearly she had Gravel in mind .
Gravel was humorous at times , but he was also willing to ask hard questions of his rivals , as in the following exchange with Sen. Barack Obama :
" Obama :
There is no contradiction between us taking seriously the need , as you do , to want to strengthen our alliances around the world  but I think it is important for us to also recognize that if we have nuclear proliferators around the world that potentially can place a nuclear weapon into the hands of terrorists , that is a profound security threat for America and one that we have to take seriously .
" Williams : Way , way over on time .
" Senator Gravel , 30 seconds , please .
" Gravel : No , with respect to Iran , we ’ve sanctioned them for 26 years .
We scared the bejesus out of them when the president says , ‘ They ’re evil . ’
" Well , you know something ?
These things do n’t work .
They do n’t work .
We need to recognize them .
" And you know something ?
Who is the greatest violator of the nonproliferation treaty ?
The United States of America .
We signed a pledge that we would begin to disarm , and we ’re not doing it .
We ’re expanding our nukes .
" Who the hell are we going to nuke ?
Tell me , Barack .
Barack , who do you want to nuke ?
" Obama : I ’m not planning to nuke anybody right now , Mike , I promise .
" ( Laughter )
" Gravel : Good .
Good .
We ’re safe then , for a while . "
In short , Gravel called Obama on his willingness to use nuclear weapons on Iran , something none of the official questioners was willing to do .
Moreover , Obama , given a chance , was unwilling to promise not to nuke Iran .
That Mike Gravel .
What a comic .

There was a very interesting discussion on the OpenMP Mailing List last week about a for loop and how to parallelize / optimize it .
I will comment on the problems and solutions presented there and also have an interesting observation to add at the end of this article .
Although the examples are in OpenMP , the problem and solutions are applicable to any threads - based parallel programming system .
But let ’s not get ahead of ourselves and start at the very beginning .
The original mail from Hicham Mouline shows the following code snippet :
const double up = 1.1 ;
double Sn=1000.0 ;
double opt [ N+1 ] ;
int n ;
for ( n=0 ; n< =N ; ++n ) { opt [ n ] =
Sn ; Sn *= up ; } [ / c ]
He wanted to parallelize the for - loop with OpenMP , but could not due to the Sn-variable , which depends on the previous loop iteration , respectively .
This case is so common in parallel programming that it even has a name : Loop Carried Dependency .
I would not have written about it here , if that was the end of the story and there was no way to parallelize the loop , though .
Closely examining it you will notice that the dependency is breakable and helpful as I am , I went and implemented a solution .
After some testing to make sure I get the exact same results , I wanted to submit it to the mailing list , only to realize that I had been beaten by Clay Breshears ( who , by the way also maintains a fine blog about parallel programming – I have been meaning to write about that for some time and will in a future post ) , who had just posted a solution very similar to what I had done – do n’t you just hate it , when that happens ;-) .
This is what he has come up with :
const double up = 1.1 ;
double Sn , origSn=1000.0 ;
double opt [ N+1 ] ;
int n ;
opt [ 0 ] = origSn ;
# pragma omp parallel for private ( n ) lastprivate ( Sn )
for ( n=1 ; n< =N ; ++n ) {
Sn = origSn * pow ( up , n ) ; opt [ n ] = Sn ; } Sn *= up ; [ / c ]
Actually , this is not quite what he posted , as his original solution had a different outcome than the original code – a slight off - by - one error had obviously slipped in ( my old computer science teacher used to say : “ programmers are always off by one ” – and I can support that thesis from my own experience , this happens a lot to me as well ) , which I took the liberty to correct here .
I bet this is why he had his solution faster than I did : P .
The difference between his solution and mine is that he used lastprivate , while I pulled the update of Sn out of the loop entirely .
Does not make a big difference either way , though , therefore I am not posting it here .
Anyways , what ’s important to note here is that with a simple reorganization the loop is suddenly parallelizable and the loop carried dependency has disappeared .
Unfortunately , these dependencies are not always as easy to break as this time , though .
This solution has another problem , though – it uses the power - function quite extensively , for each and every iteration .
Power is an expensive operation , therefore a few posts later a guy called Jakub Jelinek ( from Redhat , judging from his email - address , the very helpful people who have built OpenMP - support into the next gcc-release [ 4.2 ] ) stepped up to post an even better solution , which is sketched below :
const double up = 1.1 ;
double Sn , origSn=1000.0 ;
double opt [ N+1 ] ;
int n , lastn ;
lastn = - 2 ;
# pragma omp parallel for private ( n ) firstprivate ( lastn ) lastprivate ( Sn )
for ( n=0 ; n< =N ; ++n ) { if ( lastn != n - 1 ) {
Sn = origSn * pow ( up , n ) ; } else { Sn *= up ; } opt [ n ] =
Sn ; lastn = n ; } Sn *= up ; [ / c ]
A very nice solution , which divides the iteration space into chunks and avoids recalculating the power function for each iteration this way .
And it even works for all kinds of schedules , although I suspect it is fastest with a static one .
So , are we done now ?
This particular loop carried dependency is done away with , a solution has been posted and the thread petered off after a few more posts .
Unfortunately , I still had some doubts .
I could hear the words of the wise Sanjiv ringing in my head , who had told me in his interview :
Michael :
What is the worst mistake you have ever encountered in an OpenMP program ?
Sanjiv :
The most common mistake : parallelizing loops that are too fine grained or consume a lot of bandwidth and contribute negatively to overall scaling .
Even very experienced OpenMP programmers make this mistake .
Programmers must understand the performance and scaling of every parallel region to avoid such mistakes .
This is one of the worst mistakes because people are just shooting themselves in the foot .
I suspected this may be the case here .
To make a not so long story short , I turned all code snippets into full programs , made N as big as possible ( it wo n’t go much higher than 7000 on the architectures I tried this on before variables start overflowing ) , threw in some well - placed time measurement functionality ( only the actual loop was measured , not the supporting code around it ) , fired up our trusted 4 - way Opteron system and let the horses run , as they say .
Here are the results for 4 Threads :
Clay ’s version : 0.637ms
Jakub ’s version : 0.330ms
Original ( non-parallel ) version : 0.054ms
What a bummer !
I usually try to get well into the seconds when measuring performance , but unfortunately the overflows started much sooner for this example and a millisecond is an eternity for current processors anyways , so these will do .
After I have mentioned Sanjiv ’s quote so prominently , the results should come as no surprise at this point : by parallelizing the code , we have made it an order of magnitude slower .
Even Jakub ’s version ( which is twice as fast as Clay ’s for this architecture and number of threads ) is still way behind the original one .
What are the reasons here ?
I suspect it ’s overhead from creating the threads , coupled with the very expensive power function , that still needs to be calculated for each thread at least once .
But without examining the example more closely e.g. with a parallel profiler , its hard to tell .
Let me summarize the moral of the story : loop carried dependencies look like a show stopper for parallelism , but sometimes they are not and can be worked around .
Unfortunately , that alone is not a guarantee for good performance .
Sometimes the smartest optimization there is when it comes to parallelism – is not to use it .
And this is a lesson well worth learning .
I find it so useful , that sometimes my students get assignments from me where no satisfactory , parallel solution that is faster than a sequential one can be found .
This is always very confusing for them .
After all we have been telling them this much about parallelism and performance , only for them to discover that it is not the cure for everything .
“ Live is not a lollipop ” , as my colleague Bjoern likes to say in moments like these ; ) .
In Michigan , it 's not just the Big 3 automakers who are burdened with the rising legacy costs of providing pensions and lifetime health benefits to a rising number of retirees - Michigan public schools are facing the same financial crisis .
Michigan is the only state that makes its public schools bear the entire burden of retiree pensions and health care .
This year 's bill -- an estimated $ 1,015 per student -- is more than schools spend on books , buses , computer technology and building maintenance combined ( see top graph above ) .
And it 's going to get worse .
The retirement assessment -- set by the state but paid by individual school districts -- is now at a record high of 17.74 % of each district 's payroll .
That rate is expected to jump to 30 % by 2020 -- a level that all sides agree would break the backs of Michigan schools ( see bottom graph above ) .
In many ways , the financial straits of Michigan 's public schools mirror the plight of the Big Three .
Detroit 's automakers and the schools both have offered generous retirement benefits to retirees for decades .
As retirees live longer and health care bills rise , retirement costs have skyrocketed .
Most organizations that offer retiree health care are dealing with rising bills .

When you take the home - office deduction , are you waving a red flag in the eyes of Internal Revenue Service examiners ?
And if you are , what does that mean ?
For years , tax sages have warned that claiming a home office increases your chances of being audited , and the IRS has tacitly gone along with those stories ( maybe even exaggerating them , some suggest , to scare home - office workers out of taking the deduction ) .
In truth , there ’s good reason to believe that the home - office deduction flag is fading , as auditors target more fertile ground looking for hidden tax dollars .
Self - employment income in excess of $ 100,000 can still get you a place on the IRS hit list , for example .
But , as the number of legitimate home - based businesses grows , and according to The Official MBA Guide , the IRS ’s chances of finding fraud wherever it looks have slimmed .
Recent rules and new forms have eliminated a lot of the gray areas that surrounded home - office claims at the same time that many more taxpayers have joined the ranks of home - office workers .
If auditing home offices ever was like fishing in a barrel , the barrel has been washed away by the work - at - home tsunami .
The IRS could waste a lot of energy and resources auditing the more than 20 million home - based businesses and find a lot of careful record keeping , a lot of legitimately deductible home offices , and not a lot of money owed the U.S. Treasury .

There ’s no law against bad office design , but after a talk with Philadelphia - based graphic designer Allan Wright , you ca n’t help but think it ’s a crime .
After a recent visit to a client ’s very corporate , very bland headquarters , he had this to say : “ We found people stuck in little booths with no natural light .
Everything was horrible . ”
His colleague Michele Armstrong agreed : “ I felt like crying when I left the place . ”
Some may accuse Wright and Armstrong of holding non-artist types to lofty standards ; after all , why does an accounting firm , for example , have to be pretty ?

For a long period of time I had been using an android handset because I thought that it was probably one of the better ones on the market .

Americans do n’t like lawyers .
Unfortunately , we need them .
This is especially true if you own your own business , thanks to complicated laws , government red tape , technology issues and the proliferation of lawsuits .
Why do n’t Americans like lawyers ?
( 1 ) Lawyers are expensive .
Depending on your locale , you may pay anywhere from $ 125 to $ 250 per hour for an attorney ’s services .
( 2 ) Lawyers make people uncomfortable , sitting in their high - backed office chairs , behind huge mahogany desks and beneath a dozen framed diplomas . ( 3 ) A few lawyers are incompetent , unethical , or both , and thus many people are afraid of being …

Across the country , millions of home - business owners are forced to lead undercover lives .
They are justifiably fearful that if they operate in the open and inform their neighbors or local authorities of their business , they could run up against local zoning laws that prohibit such enterprises .
This was aptly demonstrated during a recent Home - Based Business Expo , at Elgin Community College , near Chicago .
About 60 entrepreneurs chose to list only their phone numbers–not addresses –in the Expo ’s directory .
“ Some of them are doing business in ‘ no home business ’ zoning districts , ” said Hilma Nelson , a work - at - home graphic designer who lives …
Technological palimpsests are everywhere ; it ’s the normal state of things .
Darfurians are being slaughtered by Janjaweed militia mounted on horses and camels , while their Sudanese - government sponsors chip in with helicopters and Antonov cargo planes retrofitted as bombers .
September 11th was a technological pastiche of new and old technologies ( Boeings and box cutters ) , as was the 2003 Iraq invasion ( stealth fighters , cruise missiles , and laser - guided smart bombs for the “ shock and awe , ” and jury - rigged sandbags and scrap - metal armor for Army Humvees when the Pentagon failed to provide high - tech alternatives ) .
The Iraqi insurgents have revived the use of chlorine gas as a terror agent , a technology pioneered by patriotic German chemists in the First World War , and Saddam Hussein , whose aircraft dropped modern nerve - gas bombs on the Kurdish town of Halabja , was executed by hanging , a technology of judicial killing that goes back to the ancient Persian Empire .
Edgerton calls the tendency to overrate the impact of dramatic new technologies “ futurism . ”
Few things , it turns out , are as passé as past futures .
In the mid-twentieth century , a world was promised in which nuclear power would provide electricity “ too cheap to meter , ” eliminating pollution , forestalling energy crises , and alleviating world poverty ; hypersonic civil air travel would whip masses of us around the globe in an hour or two ; permanent settlements would be established not just on the moon but on the planets ; nuclear weapons would put an end to war .
And so it goes .
The “ paperless office ” was celebrated as long ago as 1975 , in Business Week , but since then we ’ve had avalanches of the stuff : global consumption of paper has tripled in the past three decades , and the average American worker now goes through twelve thousand sheets of paper every year .
In 1987 , Ronald Reagan announced that high - temperature superconductor technology would “ bring us to the threshold of a new age , ” but commercializing that technology has proved much more difficult than the original hype suggested .
In 2000 , Bill Clinton speculated that , as a direct result of the Human Genome Project , “ our children ’s children will know the term ‘ cancer ’ only as a constellation of stars . ”
( That would be nice , if only because it would indicate an improved knowledge of astronomy . )
Predictions like these do n’t inspire great confidence in the utopian futures now being spun around stem - cell research or nanotechnology .
But neither should we have great confidence in the more dire prophesies .
In the middle of the nineteenth century , it was thought that railways would whirl people about the world with such vertiginous speed that their nervous systems could collapse under the strain .
Decades later , it seemed that the telephone would be a socially disruptive force , causing aural communication to take place without any of the rich cues of face - to - face interaction , breaking down the barriers between public and private space , and making it intolerably hard not to be “ at home ” when one was at home .
Learning how to make new technologies is one thing ; learning how , as a society , to use them is another .
Carolyn Marvin ’s illuminating book “ When Old Technologies Were New : Thinking About Electric Communication in the Late Nineteenth Century ” ( 1988 ) notes that , during the early years of the telephone , there was confusion about what codes should regulate faceless and socially clueless speech .
The telephone operator , typically female , often had the responsibility of waking up the master of the house , and so joined the wife as a woman who could talk to the man in bed ; Marvin writes that “ sweet - voiced ” telephone girls at the turn of the century “ were often objects of fantasy . ”
It was also thought that , if just anyone could use the new device , its utility would be completely undermined .
Marvin notes the firm opinion of the British postmaster general in 1895 that “ the telephone could not , and never would be an advantage which could be enjoyed by the large mass of the people . ”
He was wrong , but understandably so .
The story of how we came to terms with the new technology — how we adjusted to it , adapted to it , domesticated it , altered it to suit our purposes — did n’t come with the technical spec sheet .
It never does .
No instruction manual can explain how a technology will evolve , in use , together with the rhythm of our lives .
Old technologies persist ; they even flourish .
In that sense , they ’re as much a part of the present as recently invented technologies .
It is said that we live in a “ new economy , ” yet , of the world ’s top thirty companies ( by revenue ) , only three are mainly in the business of high tech — General Electric ( No. 11 ) , Siemens ( No. 22 ) , and I.B.M. ( No. 29 ) — and all three go back more than a century .
The heights of the early - twenty - first - century corporate world are still occupied — as they have long been — by petroleum companies ( Exxon Mobil , Royal Dutch Shell , and B.P. , Nos. 1 , 3 , and 4 ) , retailing ( Wal - Mart , No. 2 ) , automobiles ( General Motors , No. 5 ) , and finance ( I.N.G. and Citigroup , Nos. 13 and 14 ) .
No Hewlett - Packard ( No. 33 ) ; no Microsoft ( No. 140 ) ; no Merck ( No. 289 ) .
The tendency to exaggerate the impact of technological innovation follows from an artifact of historical consciousness .
When we cannot conceive what life would be like without e-mail , say , we correctly note the pervasiveness of the new technology , but we may incorrectly assume that the things we now do through e-mail could not have been done in other ways .
Of course , we must know that many things now done through e-mail were once done , and to some extent are still done , by telephone , fax , snail mail , or actually stopping by to see someone .
But we can never know how the technologies that existed before electronic communication would have developed had e-mail not become dominant , or what other technologies might have come along whose development was forestalled by e-mail .
In 1897 , to move mail around the city , Manhattan started to equip itself with an island - wide system of underground pneumatic tubes , which soon extended from 125th Street as far as the Brooklyn General Post Office .
Through the nineteenth century , the pneumatic tube had developed roughly in step with the telegraph and then the telephone .
For a long time , indeed , pneumatic tubes seemed promising — perhaps they could shunt people around as well as mail — although , ultimately , it was the telegraph and the telephone that flourished , becoming the ancestors of the electronic communication systems we use today .
Yet , had there been a century of continuous improvement , who knows what benefits a dense and speedy system of message tubes might have brought ?
A man working on Eighty - sixth Street could send a scribbled note , chocolates , and a pair of earrings to his girlfriend on Wall Street .
To have left your wallet at home could be a mistake remedied in seconds .
It ’s a safe guess , anyway , that , while aware of a distant past containing such figures as postmen and delivery boys , we would be unable to imagine life without the pneumatic tube .
This kind of counterfactual history has a credibility handicap — we know how things did turn out but can only imagine how they might have turned out .
Still , there ’s no reason to assume that the technology we have is the only technology we could have had .
The birth - control pill , we say , caused a sexual revolution , and perhaps that ’s true .
But it joined ( and only partly replaced ) many other methods of contraception , some of which — like the condom — have continued to improve in all sorts of ways since the advent of the pill .
And it has been argued that the pill had a dampening effect on the development of other technologies , such as male hormonal contraceptives .
Is the pill the best possible outcome ?
The answer depends on who you are , what you want to do , and the resources you command .
As it turned out , the replacement of the condom as a sexual technology , so frequently announced in past decades , was premature .
The emergence of AIDS caused condom sales to more than double between the early nineteen - eighties and the mid-nineties .
And , for the first time , the old technology of the condom enjoyed an advantage previously monopolized by the new technology of the pill : it could be freely talked about in polite society .
What makes the rats keep racing
A surprising thing happens when a society gets richer .
As material abundance increases , we might think people would be less competitive while still meeting their needs .
In fact , the opposite seems to happen , and they become more competitive than ever .
One explanation for why wealth paradoxically increases competitiveness wealth is that as people grow more prosperous they spend more time working to fulfill desires rather than basic needs , and desires are usually more demanding than needs .
That 's only part of the story , however .
Another reason has to do with the fact that as a society becomes richer , the scale of the competition shifts and people in every part of the society find themselves struggling to meet ever higher standards just to keep pace .
People living on the lower rungs of the economic ladder in rich - world cities today would probably have been reasonably successful in earlier agricultural societies .
The Red Queen principle in evolutionary biology , whose name was taken from Lewis Carroll 's book Through the Looking Glass ( where the Red Queen says " in this place it takes all the running you can do , to keep in the same place " ) says that a species must continue to evolve just to maintain its fitness relative to other species with which it is co-evolving .
In other words , predators and prey run an evolutionary arms race against each other .
When one improves , the other also quickly improves , and so neither is better off relative to the other .
The Red Queen principle seems to apply to societies as they grow richer .
Why would this arms race happen ?
It might seem that rising abundance would mean that predators and prey would all get fed .
Part of the answer to that question might come from a second principle , which here I will name the Bigger Pond principle .
By the Bigger Pond principle I mean that fiercer competition arises when resources become more abundant , because as the supply of resources increases , the population also tends to rise and new predators are attracted to the scene .
A predator , in the case of human societies , could be defined simply as a person whose position in society allows him or her to control a larger share of resources .
The Bigger Pond principle is meaningful because in a larger pond , there 's a chance that at least some of the new competitors will be stronger than any that had been in the pond before .
As the pond grows larger , stronger predators will be attracted to the greater resources that the pond now has .
The larger population is more likely to have a broader spread in variation , with players at further extremes of strength or cleverness .
Because of the bell curve , a larger population will more likely have a fuller representation of different types at all positions along the bell curve , including the extremes , than a smaller one will .
That is part of the truth behind the expression " to be a big fish in a small pond , " after which the Bigger Pond principle is named .
The bigger pond will more likely have players at further extremes of strength or cleverness .
A pond that grows larger and more diverse population is more likely to include predators that are more formidable than any that had existed in the pond when it was smaller .
The predators who had been at the top of the heap will find themselves overwhelmed by the much stronger predators who are now likely to appear in the pond .
Competition is a matter of what scale is used to measure how successful a person is at controlling resources in a society .
When we say that a society becomes more competitive , we mean that the scale shifts " upward " , and people who used to be at the top end of the scale now find themselves closer to the middle , and people who were in the middle before are now closer to the bottom .
Becoming more competitive does not necessarily mean working harder .
In fact , a person sweating in a dusty field may be working harder than an engineer sitting at a computer , even though the engineer 's position is probably more competitive .
The trend toward globalization means that the whole world begins to work as a single , enormous pond .
As a result , a person living in an urban center almost anywhere in the world today is much more likely now than 30 years ago to come into contact with individuals who are overwhelmingly more successful than him or her at whatever form of competition happens to be taking place .
Although technologies such as the " box " ( containers on ships ) and global telecommunications may have driven the acceleration of globalization , those technologies were adopted by a world that was already eager to globalize .
This is a chicken - and - egg situation .
Globalization has led to greater competitiveness , but globalization has itself also been an almost inevitable result of the greater competitiveness and appetite for bigger markets that the rising wealth from industrialization brought about .
With ever Bigger Ponds teeming with ever fiercer predators , where does it all lead ?
Are there limits to how much competition individuals and societies can sustain ?
Where do those limits lie , and how suddenly will we reach them ?
To give an example of how the rules of the game keep changing to make standards harder to meet , at the beginning of the last century only a relatively few fortunate people could attend university in the United States .
By mid-century , rising wealth and changing public policy made universities accessible to many more people .
Today , having a university education has become a kind of bare minimum in the United States .
Now many parents feel that they have to care about which university their children attend , not just about whether they can attend at all .
As competition grows more intense , more aspects of society are being managed like corporations , with a constant eye toward exploiting business and marketing opportunities .
Marketing is a systematic approach to competition , and has become what almost amounts to a new religion .
Many people use marketing as a guiding force in many aspects of life outside of business .
As a result , life for them becomes a contest for popularity .
Competition for public appeal and stardom , just as in Hollywood , is pervasive , even in areas such as science .
That trend has some unhealthy effects .
Many substantial and valuable aspects of life get ignored at the expense of what provokes the right emotional response in the market .
When individuals run their own lives as brands for sale , spiritual impoverishment is an almost inevitable result .
They lose the connection to their inner essence as they push themselves to conform to what they perceive the market to be demanding .
People who used to be at the top end of the scale now find themselves closer to the middle , and people who were in the middle before are now closer to the bottom .
The rising expectations that come with greater wealth are well known : there 's no limit to the appetite for consumption , especially with effective marketing to make the next thing so irresistible .
When everyone around you has things , how can you say no ?
As is also well known , rising demand for consumption stimulates the production of more material wealth , which then grows seemingly without limit .
An interesting aspect of the psychology of personal wealth is that people perceive their own material well - being in relative terms .
They naturally compare themselves to their neighbors .
According to many surveys , people do not actually become more satisfied with their lives as their societies grow wealthier .
One effect of material growth is that it relentlessly raises the competitive bar .
Eventually people feel less well off , even if they successfully maintain or slightly improve their standard of living in absolute terms .
As the scale of competition shifts and more resources move into the hands of fewer people , then even if society as a whole is better off materially , many people may still perceive themselves as worse off because of the huge gap between themselves and those at the top .
Because of the Bigger Pond principle , the gap between ordinary people and those at the top will tend to increase as the pond grows larger .
In an open society with an active media , those gaps will be clearly and painfully visible .
In response , the majority of people can choose either to compete furiously and push themselves into an ever more stratospherically exclusive elite , or they can let themselves slip downward as the competitive scale shifts and they come to be measured as part of the unloved lump in the middle of the bell curve .
Intense focus , extraordinary talent , and a certain degree of opportunity will enable some individuals to improve their skills within a given set of competitive circumstances .
Those individuals may improve their skills rapidly , but probably still only at a linear rate .
The problem is that the scale of the competition will often shift suddenly and dramatically when the pond gets larger .
The wave of non-linear change that comes with each new competitive regime can easily outstrip the best efforts even of the highest - performing individuals in the existing regime .
Eventually societies will run up against psychological limits to advancing elitism and the hollowing out of individual self - worth .
How and when the breaking point will be reached is hard to predict .
Obviously , rats can't keep racing faster forever .
We should at least understand what we 're racing for .

within an hour
hell
Are you associated with a local law enforcement agency ?
How about a national law enforcement agency ?
How about a regional , national or international organization that deals with missing and exploited children ?
Just off the top of my head : I do n't even see the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children or Amber Alert linked to your blog , and let 's be blunt , that alone is a head - scratcher .
Furthermore , I do n't even see links to survivor and support groups concerned with these issues .
I see zero by way of resources .
I find these lack of links on your blog highly suspicious .
See , I ask because I 've known people ( civilians ) who 've volunteered for such programs .
These are people who have received training from the law enforcement agency they 're working with ( even if it 's only a couple of weeks ) , willingly slap IP tracking software on their own computers , and volunteer x-number of hours a week , and only sting those who are actually committing a crime by trolling for prepubescent girls and boys under the age of 16 .
I do not see the following on or linked to your Web site : Code of Conduct ( for yourselves ) , Mission Statement , Q&A , or any other similar Web page that tells people who you are .
I 'm not saying give away personal details on the Web , I 'm just talking about any information at all beyond links to other blogs that are directly connected to this one ( i.e. , your personal blogs ) .
I can't even begin to tell who you 're targeting or even why .
And by the way , any legit organization involved in tracking down online predators would not only have these documents on - hand , but they would have them up and available for inspection by the the general Web trawling public .
Again , the lack of this information makes you highly suspect in my eyes
Where 's your guidelines or standards ?
In short , what , in your mind , makes someone " guilty " or a potential " child predator ? "
See , I know plenty of fandom terms that can easily be taken for " predatory code words " to the uninitiated .
Same goes for several other specialty interests that are outside the purview of child predation ( or the threat thereof ) or abuse survival .
See , I ask again because the people I 've known who 've worked in these programs could actually show me the precise guidelines they operated under .
And in every case , they only turned in the IP address .
The actual investigation and arrest was performed by a law enforcement officer .
It goes without saying that I see no such guidelines or standards on your website .
You should have this information available on request to interested parties , because going by your entries , I can't even begin to tell what your standards are .
If you looked at all around my LJ , you 'll find that I am part of a large subcommunity of LJ .
Part of that is writing fiction or " fan fiction . "
Sometimes fanfiction may depict scenes of abuse , predation , rape , incest , and pedophilia .
Sometimes these issues are handled tastefully , sometimes they are not , and sometimes they are done strictly for titillation purposes .
Going by current campaign against LJ , I can only assume that unless the interests you are targeting are associated with survivor groups , I can only assume that fan fiction writers who lists your " hot button words " in their interests are going to be getting a visit from you and possibly harassed .
this is exactly the case

my LJ
DearI 'm taking you up on your offer to ask you a few questions , mostly because your sudden anonymous comment in my LJ linking to your " Warriors of Innocence " site ( which I 'll get to in a minute ) bothered me quite a lot .
Whatbothered me is that you made it in response to someone explaining where the whole " an outside pressure group is trying to force LJ to dump some users " rumor started .
Since it actually turns out that you may have been the cause of it , and because you unfairly scared half my FList to death over it , let 's just say that I 'm not in a terribly charitable mood when it comes to you , your Web site , or your cause right now .
However , whatbothers me is that you posted your anonymous response ( as opposed to , the owner of this here LJ ) of your organization being mentioned in my comments .
I swear that it was almost like Bloody Mary appearing after someone makes the mistake of looking in the mirror and saying her name three times .
It 's enough to make me wonder if you had been following that particular commenter around from LJ to LJ .
And if you have n't , why thewould you even poke your nose in mine ?
So , let 's just say your timing is seriously making me seriously wonder .
And no .
I have not unscreened your comment .
Nor am I about to unless you answer the following questions :
Here 's the problem I see with your blog : I can't tell who you people are just going by your entries .
Your total lack of linkage to legitimate volunteer organizations and law enforcement concerned with online child safety ; your lack of a FAQ spelling out your mission and your goals ; and the utter lack of transparency for your organization , I can only conclude that your vigilantes who are trying to shut down speech you do n't particularly like , makes you feel uncomfortable , but is not necessarily illegal .
Going by at least one entry , Let me make something clear , I do n't like child predation or pedophilia or child abuse or incest any better than most human beings .
Hell , I wo n't touch any story that does n't treat these themes seriously with a 10 - foot pole , and the more " titillating " those stories are , the more likely I 'm going to complain about them .
Loudly .
And in public .
However , I can tell the difference between " real life " and .
Thetells youabout the person writing it .
Just because they like writing about a subject you find distasteful , it does n't mean that they actuallysaid actions in a real - life situation .
I also need to bring up one other thing : searching for " predators " on LJ on the basis of their interests listed on the user info pagewas a spectacularly stupid idea .
Do you haveidea how fast that information got out and shot around LJ ?
At the speed of light .
Do you haveidea how quickly those lists of interests disappeared from the user info pages and how fast some LJs locked down to only a small , trusted reading list ?
At the speed of sound .
Way to go , guys .
You just not only just gave real predators the heads ' up and drove them deeper underground ( thereby making themfor law enforcement to find ) , you also scared the panties off a whole lot of innocent people and communities .
After looking at your blog , I do n't blame them .
Because no matter how many links I click , I can't find anything resembling a clear statement of your mission , nor can I find your standards , nor can I discover the law enforcement agency you 're allied with .
While I 'm sorry this email turned rather angry towards the end , vigilantism leaves a very , very bad taste in my mouth , especially when you drag it intoIn either case , I look forward to reading your reply to my questions .
Sincerely , Lizbeth Marcs

Trans fats : Infamous but not the only villain
Yes , they 're bad for heart health , but nutritionists say focusing on them could distract from the real devil :
Our diets
Artery - clogging trans fats are the villain of the moment in the enduring story of America 's love affair with food .
New York and Philadelphia have moved to ban trans fats from restaurant foods , forcing chefs to find alternatives to the partially hydrogenated oils that have kept french fries tasty and pastries firm .
Big food companies are squeezing trans fats out of products from Oreos to Cheetos and rushing to find palatable substitute oils .
Even Crisco has been reformulated so it 's trans - fat free .
Fast - food chains such as Wendy's and McDonald 's have scrambled to figure out ways to cook fries without trans fats .
Now , some nutrition and health analysts say the preoccupation with trans fats has gone too far .
They say that in some cases , trans fats simply are being replaced with other unhealthful oils .
And at a time when 66 % of adults in the USA are overweight or obese , the analysts say the nation 's fixation with trans fats is drawing attention away from other important reasons Americans ' diets are so bad for their hearts :
They continue to consume too many calories , too much junk food and not enough fruits and vegetables .
" It is important to remind ourselves that changing oils and removing trans fat does not magically turn a deep - fried food into a health food , " says Dawn Jackson Blatner , a registered dietitian at Northwestern Memorial Wellness Institute in Chicago and spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association .
Robert Eckel , a former president of the American Heart Association , says that " getting rid of trans fats is important " because strong evidence indicates they contribute to higher levels of harmful cholesterol and heart disease .
But , he says , " the idea that this is the most harmful ( type of ) fat is a matter of debate . "
Some companies and restaurants have switched from partially hydrogenated oils to others — such as palm oil and coconut oil — that make the resulting products only marginally healthier .
Palm and coconut oils are high in saturated fat , which contributes to heart disease and has been shown to raise the level of LDL cholesterol ( that 's the bad kind ) in the blood .
" The American Heart Association does not consider it acceptable to substitute saturated fat for trans fats " in food products and restaurant foods , Eckel says .
Trans fats occur naturally in foods such as milk and beef .
In 1897 , scientists began creating such fats by adding hydrogen molecules to vegetable oils , creating stable oils that help foods stay firm and have a longer shelf life .
Today , trans fats account for less than 2.6 % of the calories in Americans ' diets .
But saturated ( animal ) fats make up about 12 % .
Trans fats have been " overemphasized when you consider the big picture , " says Shelley Goldberg of the International Food Information Council , an education group supported by the food , beverage and agricultural industries .
" My concern as a registered dietitian is that with all this focus on trans fats , there 's not enough focus on an overall healthful diet , including fruits , vegetables , whole grains , as well as fish and vegetable oils . "
Trans fats deserve the attention they 're getting as menaces to public health , analysts say .
Consumer advocates such as Michael Jacobson of the Center for Science in the Public Interest say trans fats are so bad that the government should order them extracted from the food supply .
" This is the most harmful fat there is , " Jacobson says .
Trans fats are " a metabolic poison that has no place in human diets , " says Walter Willett , head of the department of nutrition at Harvard School of Public Health and the nation 's leading researcher on the subject .
They " should be eliminated as quickly as possible . "
Willett and other researchers have linked trans fats to heart disease , high cholesterol , obesity and other health problems .
Trans fats were n't always viewed so negatively .
In the 1980s , many food companies and restaurants began using trans fats instead of lard and beef tallow , which are high in saturated fat , because of reports that saturated fat raised levels of LDL cholesterol .
At the time , trans fats were " considered a better choice for heart health , " Goldberg says .
Since then , several studies have indicated that trans fats not only raise LDL cholesterol , but they also may lower HDL ( good ) cholesterol .
Other research has shown that total cholesterol can be lowered when trans fats and saturated fats are replaced with oils that are high in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats , such as canola , corn , soybean , sunflower and olive oils .
So during the past decade , some food companies , fast - food chains and restaurants have switched to those types of oils or mixtures of them .
However , many restaurants and major food companies — such as Kraft , the maker of Oreo cookies — have found that it 's difficult to replace trans fats in baked goods such as muffins , croissants , cakes and cookies .
The partially hydrogenated oils give baked goods firmness and preservative qualities that are difficult to mimic with other fat alternatives , says Robert Reeves , president of the Institute of Shortening and Edible Oils , a trade group based in Washington , D.C .
Jacobson says some food companies that make bakery goods , packaged cookies and crackers are replacing trans fats with palm oil .
Other companies , he says , are using mixtures of palm oil and cottonseed oil , or even butter .
In some cases , the result is a food that is only slightly better for the consumer than one that includes trans fats .
But , Jacobson says , " whatever oil you replace ( trans fats ) with is an improvement — either a great improvement or a modest improvement . "
Kraft has reformulated its recipes to remove or reduce trans fats in more than 650 products , spokeswoman Elisabeth Wenner says .
" It was not simply swapping out one oil for another , " she says .
" In some cases , it was inventing proprietary blends of oils . "
The most challenging products have been sandwich cookies such as Oreos , because both the cookie and its filling had to be reformulated , Wenner says .
She says there were 200 trials done on Oreos .
For most products , Kraft found it could use relatively healthier oils .
But " for a few reformulations , the saturated fat did increase slightly , " Wenner says .
Kraft will not discuss its food formulas in detail .
But according to an analysis by the public interest center , the change in the recipe for Oreos meant this :
• Original Oreos : 7 grams of total fat in a serving ( about three cookies ) , including 2.5 grams of trans fat and 1.5 grams of saturated fat .
• New Oreos : 7 grams of total fat in a serving , with no trans fat and 2 grams of saturated fat .
Bonnie Liebman , a nutritionist with the public interest science center , has studied the move away from trans fats in packaged , processed foods .
She has found that most frozen breaded fish and chicken , salty snacks and tub margarines have been changed and now have little or no trans fats .
Other foods such as frostings , croissants and stick margarines still have trans fats .
" The good news is that the total bad fat ( saturated and trans fat ) is either going down or staying the same , " Liebman says .
" In theory , we 'd like to see all companies switch to non-hydrogenated oils such as canola and soybean , but apparently it 's not possible in some foods . "
Reeves says the makers of various oils continue to try to come up with new oils that have the properties that make trans fats useful to the food industry .
For Kraft and many other businesses , switching to different oils has taken time and research :
• McDonald 's , the nation 's largest restaurant chain and the world 's biggest seller of french fries , says it searched for a trans - fat - free oil for four years .
It tested 18 varieties of oils in an effort to make sure the change did n't affect the taste of its fries and other foods .
The company said last month that it 's replacing its partially hydrogenated soybean oil with a trans - fat - free frying oil made from canola , corn and soybean oils .
The amount of healthier oils in McDonald 's products will increase , but the overall fat content wo n't change .
• Legal Sea Foods , which has 32 restaurants in eight states on the East Coast , switched from frying fish in partially hydrogenated oils to canola oil about seven years ago and found that customers liked the taste better , company owner Roger Berkowitz says .
• In 2003 , Frito - Lay stopped frying Cheetos , Tostitos and Doritos in partially hydrogenated oil and switched to corn oil , which the company was using for Fritos .
There was much research on what substitute would preserve the taste and other properties of the chips , says Charles Nicolas , a spokesman for the company .
The overall fat content of Frito - Lay 's products did n't change .
Although many big companies have made the switch from trans fats , Jacobson says , " there are thousands of smaller companies still using partially hydrogenated oils . "
The Food and Drug Administration continues to categorize trans fats as " generally recognized as safe " ( GRAS ) , a special grouping for chemicals or substances added to food that are considered acceptable by experts .
That status is " crazy at a time when partially hydrogenated oil is generally recognized as dangerous , " Jacobson says .
He has petitioned the agency to remove trans fats ' " safe " status .
Barbara Schneeman , head of the FDA 's office of nutrition , labeling and dietary supplements , says Jacobson 's " petition is under review and the agency is evaluating its scientific merits . "
She says the FDA " has taken a major step " by requiring the listing of trans fats in nutrition information on food containers .
" We are looking at additional steps regarding claims for trans fats , " Schneeman says .
In the meantime , " consumers ca n't look at trans fat by itself .
They have to look at trans fat , saturated fat and cholesterol for reducing cardiovascular disease , " she says .
" All of that information is available through the nutrition facts label . "
Changes are taking time .
" Our industry is moving away from trans fats , " says Sheila Weiss of the National Restaurant Association , a trade organization .
" But we want to make sure we are moving toward a healthy alternative and not just getting a quick fix . "
Goldberg worries that " if we make these changes too quickly , we may put something else in that we do n't know the long - term effects of , and it might be worse . "
FINALLY , AFTER three decades of mutual animosity , outright threats and puerile name - calling , the United States and Iran this week engaged in a constructive dialogue about their common concerns in the Middle East .
Already the optimism that followed those talks has given way to the usual tit - for - tat accusations .
Still , one can’t help but wonder :
After all these years , could the U.S. and Iran slowly be moving toward a more diplomatic relationship or even -- dare I say it -- rapprochement ?
Let ’s not get ahead of ourselves .
For that to happen , Iran will have to meet certain conditions .
It must stop sending arms to Hezbollah .
It must cease meddling in the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
And it must pursue a more constructive role in stabilizing Iraq .
But the U.S. has conditions of its own to meet before it too can be considered a reliable negotiating partner .
Most important , it must once and for all abandon its policy of actively pursuing regime change in Iran .
This policy has only strengthened the hand of Iran ’s clerical regime , accelerated its nuclear program , helped justify its repression of political opposition and fostered its paranoia against internal and external threats .
Advertisement
This policy also accounts for Iran ’s seizure of four Iranian Americans -- a journalist , a social scientist , an academic and a peace activist -- all of whom have been accused of spying for the U.S .
The charges are , no doubt , absurd .
But Iran defends its actions by linking them to President Bush ’s recent decision to employ black - ops -- including the use of Iranian exiles and emigres living in the U.S. -- to foment revolution against the mullahs .
The great irony , of course , is that abandoning regime change in Iran is the surest way to ensure the regime ’s collapse .
This is because , contrary to widespread perception , Iran is already a democracy .
It ’s just not a very successful one .
Unlike most other countries in the Middle East , Iran has a long and deeply embedded democratic tradition that goes back more than a century .
The country boasts what is arguably the most robust political culture in the Muslim world .
Since 1980 , Iran has held more than 20 elections -- all of them freer and fairer than those of any of America ’s Arab allies -- that have drawn 60 % to 80 % of the electorate to the polls .
Despite harsh restrictions on who may run for office , Iran ’s elections offer lively political campaigns and raucous debates between contrasting candidates who do not shy away from any topic of concern .
Iran also boasts one of the most energetic civil societies in the region , with diverse political action groups , a fearless press and dozens of active student organizations that repeatedly stage strikes and sit-ins in defiance of the government .
Thousands of Iranian nongovernmental organizations work to foster ethnic , legal and , most especially , women ’s rights .
Iranian women now hold 60 % of the college degrees in the country and enjoy literacy rates approaching 90 % .

True , all of these civil organizations and democratic movements labor under the autocratic rule of an unelected shadow government .
But when I talk to Iranians about their problems , few cite the restrictions on their freedom posed by the Islamic republic .
Rather , their primary complaint is the country ’s stagnant economy .
Nearly a third of the population is unemployed , almost 40 % live in poverty and the annual rate of inflation is 24 % , so few Iranians have the means to translate their sophisticated political activism into meaningful democratic reform .
If the U.S. engaged Iran the way it engages other “ autocratic democracies ” in Latin America , Eastern Europe and the former Soviet bloc , that would do far more to encourage democratic change than anything tried so far .
The lesson to be learned from America ’s misadventure in Iraq is that democracy cannot be promoted from the top down ; it must be reared from within .
Iran already has the civil and democratic infrastructure necessary for dramatic sociopolitical change .
But these institutions can only exert themselves if Iranians are allowed to emerge from their forced political and economic isolation .
Taking regime change off the table also would allow the U.S. to deal more effectively with Iran ’s nuclear program .
It is likely that Iran ’s leaders do not want nuclear weapons , because of their prohibitive cost and significant security risk .
But they would like to have the option of developing them fairly quickly if necessary .
And why not ?
Iran has learned a valuable lesson from its fellow “ axis of evil ” nations : one did not have nukes and it was obliterated by the U.S. military ; the other has nukes and it is being plied with money to relinquish them .
Advertisement
In any case , the longer the U.S. insists that Iran suspend uranium enrichment before diplomatic negotiations can begin , the more sophisticated and irreversible Iran ’s nuclear program will become .
There is , however , still plenty of time to ensure that Iran ’s civilian program does not morph into a military one -- but only if Iran can be convinced that it is off the regime - change list .
The days in which Iran could be viewed as a rogue state teetering on the verge of collapse are over .
Thanks to U.S. actions in the region , Iran is the new power in the Middle East .
It ’s well past time the United States started treating it as such .

Many in Japan dispute the scale of killing in Nanjing in 1937
It is a rare legal victory for the critics of Japan 's wartime past .
The relatives of two officers , accused of taking part in a race to decapitate Chinese soldiers , had sued for damages , claiming the report was fabricated .
Japan and China dispute the scale of murder , rape and looting during Japan 's wartime occupation of parts of China .
As Japan 's Imperial Army approached the Chinese city of Nanjing in 1937 , war correspondents sent back home morale - boosting reports which were published in national newspapers .
One described the exploits of two officers who were said to have staged a competition to be the first to behead 100 Chinese soldiers .
The two men were later executed by the Chinese government .
' Not proven '
Two years ago , though , their relatives lodged a claim for $ 330,000 ( 36 m yen ) in damages from two newspapers - one , whose forerunner published the story in 1937 , and another which carried an article repeating the allegations in 1971 .
The families claimed the stories were false because they had not been proved .
Now Tokyo's district court has rejected their suit .
The officers had admitted they raced to kill 100 people , the judge said .
Although the original article included some false elements and exaggeration , since a final historical assessment of the contest has not been made , it is difficult to say it was fiction , he added .
The journalist who wrote the follow - up article in the 1970s claimed the case had been brought by those trying to deny the Nanjing massacre .
It is an event still disputed by scholars in Japan and China , and continues to cause difficulties between the two countries more than half a century after it happened .
“ Those who told lies to take us into war should be held accountable under the U.S. Constitution and at the International Criminal Court . ” ( from Kucinich ’ website ) .
Respond to this video question from Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) via comments , e-mails , letters and most importantly a DIY Impeachment petition of memorial .

I ask you then :
Is it time to modify the Constitution to specifically provide for a formal " Separation of Corporation and State " in our democracy ?
And if we do n't take action , can our American democracy survive ?
Are we living in a true democracy when many of our highest elected officials continue to receive salaries and bonuses and hold stock in , large corporations they formerly worked for ?
Are we living in a true democracy when our leaders are able to award lucrative no -bid contracts to their former employers ?
Are we living in a true democracy when public policy is influenced by corporate - backed political lobbies that spend millions of dollars to influence key decisions ?
Are we living in a true democracy when the same people who start our wars benefit financially from weapons sales and reconstruction contracts ?
Is this ethical ?
Is this what our Founding Fathers intended ?
Is our Shining City on the Hill starting to get a bit tarnished ?
Because this threat was impossible to envision at the time our nation was formed , our Constitution was not designed with specific countermeasures and as a result our leaders , our government , our democracy , and our citizens , are presently without protection from political influence and manipulation by corporate interests .
The danger of this is that our government may be run by corporations , or at least key decisions may be based on commercial interests .
But is it democratic for national decisions to be driven by corporations that are only responsible to their shareholders ?
Are We The People represented by the corporate decision - makers and politicians they fund ?
Corporate influence on government , if not carefully regulated , is a threat to democracy .
It is a threat to the American way of life .
This threat to democracy may not be as dramatic as terrorism , but in the long - term it may be far more damaging to society .
In fact this threat was foreseen by some of our most visionary leaders :
Today corporations are becoming the single most powerful forces shaping our societies and governments .
While corporations have great potential to benefit society and even governments , they are entirely selfish entities - they have no accountability to the public , and no responsibility to ensure the public good .
A government that is influenced by corporations can easily become a government that caters to corporations , a government that is effectively run by corporations .
Such a government is not representative of its people anymore .
It is therefore not a democracy .
However , although they were well - aware of the risks of mixing politics and religion , our nation 's early Constitutional scholars were not as concerned with the risks of mixing politics and business .
And why should they have been ?
At the time corporations were not nearly as independent or influential as monarchies and the Church .
They were not considered threats .
It would not be until the much later advent of the Industrial Age that corporations became a serious political force to reckon with .
But one might well wonder whether our Constitution would have included protections against corporate influence had corporations been more of a force at the time it was devised .
I have nothing against religion - in fact I am religious myself - but I do n't think religion should have anything to do with government , or vice - versa .
This is in fact one of the key ideas in our Constitution .
Many of our Founding Fathers were deeply religious , but they recognized the need to make a clear distinction between their religious ideals and their political ideals .
Thus over time a Constitutional separation of Church and State was formed -- a separation that would not only protect the integrity and objectivity of government , but also that of religious institutions .
To illustrate this point , consider an earlier " separation " that has been essential to our democracy -- the Separation of Church and State .
What would America be like if the Constitution did not provide for the separation of Church and State ?
Would it be a nation that protects and celebrates freedom , equality and pluralism ?
Or would it be a nation , not so unlike those presently under the sway of fundamentalism , run by religious lobbies , religious police , and fanatical extremists ?
Today our American democracy faces a new threat to its integrity , a threat even greater than terrorism in the long - term .
This threat is the corporation .
In this essay I propose that it may be time to introduce a new principle into our democracy and a new amendment to our Constitution - a formal " Separation of Corporation and State . "
One viewpoint on the matter is that we should not enforce a specific Separation of Corporation and State but rather seek to provide ethical guidelines to corporations and politicians -- in other words , we should simply trust politicians and business people to maintain ethical boundaries and act appropriately .
But can we really rely on them to self - regulate ?
Can we trust the wolves to guard our sheep ?
After all if politicians require corporate endorsements and funding , or at least the absence of corporate interference , to win elections and stay in power , and if corporations in turn require political influence to cut costs , increase profits and beat the competition , can we really trust them to not do deals with one another ?
As America and the world enter the twenty first century there appears to be a blurring of the distinction between capitalism and democracy .
Many Americans , let alone others around the world , may not even be aware that there is any distinction at all !
In fact , capitalism is not a form of government - it is an economic framework while democracy is not an economic framework , it is a social system .
They are not one entity , they are two complementary systems .
While they are often found together and have the potential for profound symbiosis ( and in fact cannot really thrive without one another ) , neither is a sufficient substitute for the other .
For example running a corporation exclusively according to the rules of democracy is probably not good for the bottom line , but neither is running a nation exclusively according to the rules of capitalism good for society .
These two forces must be balanced appropriately .
In a corporation , democracy must take second place ( although I argue elsewhere that perhaps corporations should be at least more democratic than they presently are ) .
In a society however , democracy must take first place ; it must never be overwhelmed by capitalist interests .
If there was no separation of Church and State in America , both our government and religious institutions would suffer .
Similarly , in the case of the tension between capitalism and democracy , the only viable , sustainable , and effective path is to maintain a very precise balance .
If this balance is not maintained , neither democracy nor capitalism can function with full effectiveness and everyone loses in the long - run .
Short - term thinkers may gain temporary benefits by taking advantage of imbalances of this nature , but only at the expense of the many , and ultimately even at their own expense .
From the perspective of John Stuart Mill , who advocated the philosophy of " the greatest good for the greatest number , " we must not give in to the temptation to seek short - term gain at the expense of long - term sustainability .
Ensuring that this does not happen is essential to the sustainability both of democracies and free markets .
Unrestrained capitalism is a cancer - ultimately it consumes everything in its path .
At the same time , unrestrained democracy can easily devolve into socialism and economic gridlock - the death of the free market economy , and stunted growth .
Only a very delicate , precise , and carefully enforced balance between capitalism and democracy can ensure both long - term homeostasis AND growth - a sustainable civilization .
The issue of the Separation of Corporation and State runs deep - it is not only our problem , it is everyone 's problem because America is now leading the world .
Our American democracy is the template for new democracies , an example for others to follow .
And now that we are in the business of seeding new democracies it is even more important that we practice what we preach .
What kind of democracies are we really making in other countries ?
And what kind of democracy are we ourselves really living in now ?
What kind of standard - what kind of a template - are we providing for others who would emulate us ?
What makes this nation so great is that it stands for something - it always has .
We stand for freedom , we stand for equality , we stand for justice , we stand for tolerance , we stand for opportunity , we stand for human rights , we stand for democratic principles - in fact , we stand for balance .
This has always been the heart of our nation .
This willingness to live by , and fight for , these basic rights and principles is what has made us great , what has given us moral authority on the world stage .
It is also what has made the idea of America - our cultural meme - so contagious .
If we forget this balance or fail to preserve it , we may lose everything we have worked for , everything we have attained , and the whole world will lose alongside us .
What a lost opportunity that would be .
True Americans need to think about this issue carefully .
The very heart of American democracy and capitalism is balance .
To preserve this balance , we must adapt and evolve our nation in the face of change .
Today that balance is threatened - some would argue it is already gone - due to corporate influence over the political process .
In other words , our nation is at risk of losing its heart .
The question is not therefore , " should there be a Separation of Corporation and State " but rather " how can we realistically and practically ensure a Separation of Corporation and State ? "
Should we add new protections to the Constitution in some way ?
Should we legislate ?
Should we simply " let the market sort it out " or trust our leaders and corporations to self - regulate and do the right thing ?
I am a dedicated capitalist ; I have benefited from the free market and I believe in self - organization , creative chaos , and bottom - up emergent solutions to complex distributed problems .
So I would not advocate restraining capitalism to such an extent that it loses its edge .
Capitalism is a reflection of nature , of evolution itself - a basic creative process that leads to innovation , growth , optimization , and development that can benefit individuals and societies in incalculable ways .
Without capitalism democracies lack energy and cannot thrive , grow , innovate and reproduce .
Yet at the same time , I believe deeply in democracy and the basic principles that America stands for .
Without democracy - true democracy - capitalism becomes malignant , destructive , and cannibalistic .
I would not want to live in a non-capitalist society - how boring , how complacent , how uninspiring and uncreative that would be .
But neither would I want to live in a world controlled by corporations that are solely conditioned by profit motives - that would be a world raped of every natural resource , polluted to the point of being uninhabitable , commercialized and dumbed - down to the point of total conformity and cultural decay -- a world completely for sale and thus completely sold out .
Because neither of these extreme futures -- democracy without capitalism , or capitalism without democracy , is acceptable , I believe it is time to really address this issue of the Separation of Corporation and State as a society , and as a marketplace .
Because if we do n't find a new balance between capitalism and democracy we will lose both .
But is it too late ?
Is it futile to address this issue ?
Some would argue the Great Sell - Out happened long ago .
Others might even go so far as to suggest that it is already too late -- that nations are no longer the primary actors in the world , but rather that we have already begun evolving a new world order that transcends nations altogether - a world governed by interacting transnational corporations - what we might call corpocracies - what may be the new units of civilization .
It is not too late to save democracy .
We can and must evolve our democratic system to adapt to a world of giant global corporations .
While we may not be able to stop the rise of these corpocracies , we can at least make them more intelligent , just and balanced systems to live and work in .
We have to .
The alternative is simply unacceptable .
Beyond merely pointing out the imperative we face , I do not have the answer , I do not know the formula for the balance we need to create : this is a question for people far more qualified and knowledgeable than myself to address - a question for our political leaders , our business leaders , our political scientists , our Constitutional scholars , our community leaders .
This is a question for which the solution we choose will have the most profound effect on our nation , our society , and the rest of the world - perhaps the key question that Americans must address as we enter the twenty - first century .
DIGG THIS
Never in my lifetime has America ’s political elite been as disconnected from the people and as nakedly self - serving as it is today .
Never has it been so self - absorbed , so disingenuous , and so full of unmerited pomposity .
While watching the South Carolina Republican debate a few weeks ago , I finally succumbed to Justin Raimondo ’s theory that 9/11 ripped a hole in the space - time continuum and transported us all to Bizzaro World — an upside down universe of fun-house mirrors and distorted thinking .
I am , of course , speaking of Rudy Giuliani ’s reaction to Ron Paul ’s statement that our foreign policy has fueled Muslim anti-Americanism .
Rudy seemed surprised and angry as he pandered to the crowd and demanded that Rep .
Paul retract his statement .
Ron Paul , to his credit , stood his ground .
But as ignorant as Rudy ’s comments were , the real strangeness is to be found in our mainstream media ’s reaction to the incident .
Even establishment liberals like Chris Matthews have treated Rep .
Paul with bemused disdain and have written off his assertion as sheer quackery .
Since the debate , I ’ve been scratching my head and wondering how the " mainstream " candidates and the " mainstream " media develop their opinions .
At the very least , one would expect media analysts to objectively scrutinize the competing theories explaining 9/11 .
After all , what else are " media analysts " for ?
On one side , we have the " Rudy theory . "
This view — held by our entire political and media establishment — asserts that Muslim extremists are attacking America because they " hate our freedom . "
Even a cursory examination of this hypothesis exposes its sheer absurdity .
Are we to believe that waves of Muslims have spontaneously decided to immolate themselves in suicidal attacks because we have freedom of the press and freedom of religion ?
Would the Muslim world initiate a horrific war with the most powerful military in history merely because we have elections and jury trials ?
Do they really hate Britney Spears so much that they would blow themselves up just to take a few of us down with them ?
The questions answer themselves .
That this theory is the only one " permitted " in public discussions is proof positive of our descent into Bizzaro World .
No other evidence is necessary .
On the flip side is the " Ron Paul " theory of 9/11 .
Since WW II , America has been continuously inserting itself into the affairs of the Middle East .
We have overthrown governments ( Iran ) , financed dictators ( Egypt , Pakistan , Jordan , Iran and others too numerous to mention ) , taken sides in sectarian conflicts ( Iraq , Palestine , Lebanon ) , devastated Muslim societies with embargoes ( Iraq , Libya , Iran , Palestine ) , launched campaigns of aerial bombardment ( Iraq , Libya , Afghanistan , Sudan ) , stationed troops where they are n’t wanted ( all over the Middle East , but particularly Saudi Arabia ) , and embarked on the occasional military conquest ( Iraq , Afghanistan ) .
Given this legacy of death and destruction , is it so outlandish to suggest that these policies just might have something to do with the 9/11 attacks ?
Might not these policies be an underlying cause of the widespread hatred of America across the Muslim world ?
Is this idea so crazy that it should be excluded from " acceptable " political discourse ?
Even if common sense does n’t make the argument by itself , we do n’t have to speculate as to why Muslims harbor such hatred toward America .
All we have to do is ask the Muslims .
In poll after poll , people across the Middle East have made it abundantly clear why they are angry with us , and it does n’t have much to do with our freedom or our democracy , but it does have everything to do with our destructive foreign policy .
In the South Carolina debate , Rudy stated he ’d " never heard " the theory that our bombing and strangulation of Iraq had any relation to 9/11 .
What are we to make of that ?
Is Rudy devoid of common sense ?
Is he totally ignorant of our government ’s activities in the Middle East ?
Does he not have access to Google ?
Or , alternatively , is he lying ?
Perhaps he knows full well that our foreign policy is inciting virulent hatred against our nation , but he has some ulterior motive that prevents him from acknowledging that fact .
Whichever is the case , one thing is evident :
When our political situation has become so distorted that an obvious truism is discarded outright while an obvious falsehood is universally acclaimed , then something is seriously wrong .
Perhaps it really is Bizzaro world … or maybe it ’s something more sinister .
Either way , given what I saw in South Carolina , it ’s obvious that our political system is nowhere near curing what ails us , and we can expect more of the same for as far as the eye can see .
The Best of Steven LaTulippe
For all the talk about potential candidates who have n't entered the 2008 presidential race  from Mayor Bloomberg to Vice President Gore to Senator Thompson and Speaker Gingrich  the one that who would bring the most to the race is Vice President Cheney .
In previous recent campaigns , when there was an outgoing president who had won a second term , there has been a vice president around on the campaign trail to defend the record of the administration .
George H.W. Bush promised to be kinder and gentler than Reagan , but he was still essentially defending the Reagan record .
Vice President
Gore did n't campaign much with President Clinton in 2000 , but he was running in part on the record of the Clinton - Gore administration .
This year , the leading Republican candidates include Senator McCain , who was Mr. Bush 's rival in a bitter 2000 primary contest and who voted against some of Mr. Bush 's tax cuts , and Mayor Giuliani , who is going around proclaiming , in what seems a rebuke of George W. Bush , " it 's time now that we have a president that knows how to get things done . "
Were Mr. Cheney in the race , it 's hard to imagine that the president 's approval ratings would not be five or 10 points higher .
The reason is that the administration would have a defender on the campaign trail as part of the public debate .
Mr. Cheney has virtues as a candidate in his own right .
He has foreign policy experience by virtue of having served as defense secretary , and he has economic policy experience , having served as a leading tax - cutter while a member of the House of Representatives .
His wife , Lynne , would be an asset to the ticket in her own right , a point made by Kathryn Jean Lopez in a post on the topic at National Review Online back in February .
By our rights , Lynne Cheney would make one of the greatest First Ladies in history .
Mr. Cheney , in any event , is more than four years younger than Mr. McCain , and , if elected , would be 67 years old at his inauguration , younger than Reagan was when he took office .
His health , while a topic of frequent speculation , has n't interfered with his service as vice president .
Lawrence Kudlow wrote a column a while back saying he hoped President Bush asked Vice President Cheney to run for president in 2008 .
It was a fine idea then and it still is  not because the current field is particularly weak , but because Mr. Cheney is so much more experienced and shrewd a figure , one who could help settle some of the arguments about the Bush years in favor of Mr. Bush .
A White House aiming to get Mr. Cheney elected could also avoid some of the hazards that befall lame - ducks  drift , brain drain , irrelevance .
Such a campaign might lift Mr. Cheney 's own standing in the polls .
The vice president 's stature would put him instantly into the first rank of contenders on the Republican side .
On Monday , speaking in Alabama , the vice president received such a warm greeting that he began his remarks by saying , " A reception like that is almost enough to make you want to run for office again . "
It is hard to imagine the vice president did not comprehend how tantalizing such a remark would be .
He used the same opening line on March 24 when he spoke to the leadership of the Republican Jewish Coalition .
This is not an endorsement , and there are things we find attractive about many of the other candidates .
But for those of us who are concerned with extending Mr. Bush 's campaign for freedom around the world and cutting taxes at home , a Cheney campaign is attractive .
In the same Alabama speech in which Mr. Cheney quipped about wanting to run for office again , he said , " America is a good and an honorable country .
We serve a cause that is right , and a cause that gives hope to the oppressed in every corner of this earth .
We 're the kind of country that fights for freedom , and the men and women in that fight are some of the bravest citizens this nation has ever produced .
The only way for us to lose is to quit .
But that 's not an option .
We will complete the mission , and we will prevail . "
What a contrast to the carping over tactics that has infected some of the Republican field and to the fever among the Democrats for cutting off funds for our GIs and sounding a retreat .
Opera has released the latest update to its free desktop web browser , version 9.2 .
The new version adds a number of new features , but the most interesting one is what Opera calls " Speed Dial . "
Speed Dial is a new method of quickly browsing to a favorite web site .
When the user hits the " New Tab " button , instead of the usual blank page , a three by three grid appears .
The grid takes up the full screen and is laid out in the fashion of a telephone dial with numbers from 1 to 9 .
Each number can be populated with a different URL , selected either from existing favorites or hotlinks , or entered manually .
Once a web site has been selected for Speed Dial , a thumbnail of the site appears in the space previously occupied by the number .
To go to the site , the user can either click on the thumbnail , enter in the number of the site in Opera 's address bar and press Enter , or press the Control key followed by the number .
Speed Dial can be easily hidden by clicking on a small " Hide " button in the lower - right corner , and the browser will remember this setting when opening new blank tabs .
The Speed Dial page also contains an extra search bar , set by default to Yahoo ( Opera 's main search bar defaults to Google ) , but this is adjustable via the user preferences page .
At first glance , Speed Dial does n't seem to offer anything that traditional favorites or hotlinks in the address bar does n't already provide .
However , in practice the feature is actually quite useful .
Since one typically opens a new tab prior to loading a new web site , the Speed Dial page ( which loads instantly ) tends to follow the user 's default eye movements , and presents a clear visual picture of one 's favorite web sites .
The Speed Dial feature in action
In addition to Speed Dial , Opera 9.2 contains several bug fixes and minor changes .
The thumbnails for web pages — displayed when the user hovers over any tab — have been enlarged and no longer change size according to the length of the URL .
Fullscreen movies in YouTube now start correctly without requiring a page refresh , and Flickr Organizr now works properly .
Opera has also made optional developer tools available with this release , which helps web page builders test their sites by providing a DOM inspector , JavaScript inspector , CSS editor , and HTTP header inspector .
These tools can be installed either by visiting the Opera web site or loading the feature from the Tools menu .
The browser also allows users to submit voluntary , anonymous usage statistics , although it 's not immediately clear how to activate this feature or what Opera plans to do with the data .
Opera remains a perennial also - ran in terms of browser usage statistics , hanging out in the one - percent - share margin .
However , in survey polls conducted by NetApplications and SurveyWare the browser is slightly ahead of Internet Explorer with 10.9 percent of users rating it as the best browser ( Firefox leads the poll with 61 percent , Safari is second at 15 percent , and Internet Explorer comes in at 10.8 percent ) .
When the relative market share percentages are factored in , these results imply that Opera has the most satisfied user base .
Opera seems determined to make inroads in browser market share on the desktop , as well as make gains in the emerging mobile and game console browser arenas .
Theseus and the Zipper [ edit ]
The Labyrinth [ edit ]
" Theseus , we have to do something " said Homer , chief marketing officer of Ancient Geeks Inc. .
Theseus put the Minotaur action figure™ back onto the shelf and nodded .
" Today 's children are no longer interested in the ancient myths , they prefer modern heroes like Spiderman or Sponge Bob . "
Heroes .
Theseus knew well how much he had been a hero in the labyrinth back then on Crete [ 1 ] .
But those " modern heroes " did not even try to appear realistic .
What made them so successful ?
Anyway , if the pending sales problems could not be resolved , the shareholders would certainly arrange a passage over the Styx for Ancient Geeks Inc .
" Heureka !
Theseus , I have an idea : we implement your story with the Minotaur as a computer game !
What do you say ? "
Homer was right .
There had been several books , epic ( and chart breaking ) songs , a mandatory movie trilogy and uncountable Theseus & the Minotaur™ gimmicks , but a computer game was missing .
" Perfect , then .
Now , Theseus , your task is to implement the game " .
A true hero , Theseus chose Haskell as the language to implement the company 's redeeming product in .
Of course , exploring the labyrinth of the Minotaur was to become one of the game 's highlights .
He pondered : " We have a two - dimensional labyrinth whose corridors can point in many directions .
Of course , we can abstract from the detailed lengths and angles : for the purpose of finding the way out , we only need to know how the path forks .
To keep things easy , we model the labyrinth as a tree .
This way , the two branches of a fork cannot join again when walking deeper and the player cannot go round in circles .
But I think there is enough opportunity to get lost ; and this way , if the player is patient enough , they can explore the entire labyrinth with the left - hand rule . "
data Node a = DeadEnd a | Passage a ( Node a ) | Fork a ( Node a ) ( Node a )
An example labyrinth and its representation as tree .
Theseus made the nodes of the labyrinth carry an extra parameter of type a .
Later on , it may hold game relevant information like the coordinates of the spot a node designates , the ambience around it , a list of game items that lie on the floor , or a list of monsters wandering in that section of the labyrinth .
We assume that two helper functions
get :: Node a -> a put :: a -> Node a ->
Node a
retrieve and change the value of type a stored in the first argument of every constructor of Node a .
Exercises Implement get and put .
One case for get is
get ( Passage x _ ) = x .
To get a concrete example , write down the labyrinth shown in the picture as a value of type Node ( Int , Int ) .
The extra parameter ( Int , Int ) holds the cartesian coordinates of a node .
" Mh , how to represent the player 's current position in the labyrinth ?
The player can explore deeper by choosing left or right branches , like in "
turnRight :: Node a ->
Maybe ( Node a ) turnRight ( Fork _ l r ) = Just r turnRight _ = Nothing
" But replacing the current top of the labyrinth with the corresponding sub - labyrinth this way is not an option , because the player cannot go back then . "
He pondered .
" Ah , we can apply Ariadne 's trick with the thread for going back .
We simply represent the player 's position by the list of branches their thread takes , the labyrinth always remains the same . "
data Branch = KeepStraightOn | TurnLeft | TurnRight type Thread = [ Branch ]
Representation of the player 's position by Ariadne 's thread .
" For example , a thread [ TurnRight , KeepStraight On ] means that the player took the right branch at the entrance and then went straight down a Passage to reach its current position .
With the thread , the player can now explore the labyrinth by extending or shortening it .
For instance , the function turnRight extends the thread by appending the TurnRight to it . "
turnRight :: Thread ->
Thread turnRight t = t ++ [ TurnRight ]
" To access the extra data , i.e. the game relevant items and such , we simply follow the thread into the labyrinth . "
retrieve :: Thread ->
Node a -> a retrieve [ ] n = get n retrieve ( KeepStraight On : bs ) ( Passage _ n ) = retrieve bs n retrieve ( TurnLeft : bs ) ( Fork _ l r ) = retrieve bs l retrieve ( TurnRight : bs ) ( Fork _ l r ) = retrieve bs r
Exercises
Write a function update that applies a function of type a -> a to the extra data at the player 's position .
Theseus ' satisfaction over this solution did not last long .
" Unfortunately , if we want to extend the path or go back a step , we have to change the last element of the list .
We could store the list in reverse , but even then , we have to follow the thread again and again to access the data in the labyrinth at the player 's position .
Both actions take time proportional to the length of the thread and for large labyrinths , this will be too long .
Is n't there another way ? "
Ariadne 's Zipper [ edit ]
While Theseus was a skillful warrior , he did not train much in the art of programming and could not find a satisfying solution .
After intense but fruitless cogitation , he decided to call his former love Ariadne to ask her for advice .
After all , it was she who had the idea with the thread .
" Ariadne Consulting .
What can I do for you ? "
Our hero immediately recognized the voice .
" Hello Ariadne , it 's Theseus . "
An uneasy silence paused the conversation .
Theseus remembered well that he had abandoned her on the island of Naxos and knew that she would not appreciate his call .
But Ancient Geeks Inc. was on the road to Hades and he had no choice .
" Uhm , darling , ... how are you ? "
Ariadne retorted an icy response , " Mr. Theseus , the times of darling are long over .
What do you want ? "
" Well , I uhm ... I need some help with a programming problem .
I 'm programming a new Theseus & the Minotaur™ computer game . "
She jeered , " Yet another artifact to glorify your ' heroic being ' ?
And you want me of all people to help you ? "
" Ariadne , please , I beg of you , Ancient Geeks Inc. is on the brink of insolvency .
The game is our last hope ! "
After a pause , she came to a decision .
" Fine , I will help you .
But only if you transfer a substantial part of Ancient Geeks Inc. to me .
Let 's say thirty percent . "
Theseus turned pale .
But what could he do ?
The situation was desperate enough , so he agreed but only after negotiating Ariadne 's share to a tenth .
After Theseus told Ariadne of the labyrinth representation he had in mind , she could immediately give advice ,
" You need a zipper . "
" Huh ?
What does the problem have to do with my fly ? "
" Nothing , it 's a data structure first published by Gérard Huet [ 2 ] . "
" Ah . "
" More precisely , it 's a purely functional way to augment tree - like data structures like lists or binary trees with a single focus or finger that points to a subtree inside the data structure and allows constant time updates and lookups at the spot it points to [ 3 ] .
In our case , we want a focus on the player 's position . "
" I know for myself that I want fast updates , but how do I code it ? "
" Do n't get impatient , you cannot solve problems by coding , you can only solve them by thinking .
The only place where we can get constant time updates in a purely functional data structure is the topmost node [ 4 ] [ 5 ] .
So , the focus necessarily has to be at the top .
Currently , the topmost node in your labyrinth is always the entrance , but your previous idea of replacing the labyrinth by one of its sub- labyrinths ensures that the player 's position is at the topmost node . "
" But then , the problem is how to go back , because all those sub - labyrinths get lost that the player did not choose to branch into . "
" Well , you can use my thread in order not to lose the sub- labyrinths . "
Ariadne savored Theseus ' puzzlement but quickly continued before he could complain that he already used Ariadne 's thread ,
" The key is to glue the lost sub- labyrinths to the thread so that they actually do n't get lost at all .
The intention is that the thread and the current sub - labyrinth complement one another to the whole labyrinth .
With ' current ' sub-labyrinth , I mean the one that the player stands on top of .
The zipper simply consists of the thread and the current sub-labyrinth . "
type Zipper a = ( Thread a , Node a )
The zipper is a pair of Ariadne 's thread and the current sub - labyrinth that the player stands on top .
The main thread is colored red and has sub- labyrinths attached to it , such that the whole labyrinth can be reconstructed from the pair .
Theseus did n't say anything .
" You can also view the thread as a context in which the current sub - labyrinth resides .
Now , let 's find out how to define Thread a .
By the way , Thread has to take the extra parameter a because it now stores sub-labyrinths .
The thread is still a simple list of branches , but the branches are different from before . "
data Branch a = KeepStraightOn a | TurnLeft a ( Node a ) | TurnRight a ( Node a ) type Thread a = [ Branch a ]
" Most importantly , TurnLeft and TurnRight have a sub - labyrinth glued to them .
When the player chooses say to turn right , we extend the thread with a TurnRight and now attach the untaken left branch to it , so that it does n't get lost . "
Theseus interrupts , " Wait , how would I implement this behavior as a function turnRight ?
And what about the first argument of type a for TurnRight ?
Ah , I see .
We not only need to glue the branch that would get lost , but also the extra data of the Fork because it would otherwise get lost as well .
So , we can generate a new branch by a preliminary "
branchRight ( Fork x l r ) = TurnRight x l
" Now , we have to somehow extend the existing thread with it . "
" Indeed .
The second point about the thread is that it is stored backwards .
To extend it , you put a new branch in front of the list .
To go back , you delete the topmost element . "
" Aha , this makes extending and going back take only constant time , not time proportional to the length as in my previous version .
So the final version of turnRight is "
turnRight :: Zipper a -> Maybe ( Zipper a ) turnRight ( t , Fork x l r ) = Just ( TurnRight x l : t , r ) turnRight _ = Nothing
Taking the right subtree from the entrance .
Of course , the thread is initially empty .
Note that the thread runs backwards , i.e. the topmost segment is the most recent .
" That was not too difficult .
So let 's continue with keepStraightOn for going down a passage .
This is even easier than choosing a branch as we only need to keep the extra data : "
keepStraightOn :: Zipper a -> Maybe ( Zipper a ) keepStraightOn ( t , Passage x n ) = Just ( KeepStraightOn x : t , n ) keepStraightOn _ = Nothing
Now going down a passage .
Exercises Write the function turnLeft .
Pleased , he continued , " But the interesting part is to go back , of course .
Let 's see ... "
back :: Zipper a ->
Maybe ( Zipper a ) back ( [ ] , _ ) =
Nothing back ( KeepStraightOn x : t , n ) = Just ( t , Passage x n ) back ( TurnLeft x r : t , l ) = Just ( t , Fork x l r ) back ( TurnRight x l : t , r ) = Just ( t , Fork x l r )
" If the thread is empty , we 're already at the entrance of the labyrinth and cannot go back .
In all other cases , we have to wind up the thread .
And thanks to the attachments to the thread , we can actually reconstruct the sub - labyrinth we came from . "
Ariadne remarked , " Note that a partial test for correctness is to check that each bound variable like x , l and r on the left hand side appears exactly once at the right hands side as well .
So , when walking up and down a zipper , we only redistribute data between the thread and the current sub-labyrinth . "
Exercises
Now that we can navigate the zipper , code the functions get , put and update that operate on the extra data at the player 's position .
Zippers are by no means limited to the concrete example Node a , they can be constructed for all tree - like data types .
Go on and construct a zipper for binary trees data Tree a = Leaf a | Bin ( Tree a ) ( Tree a ) Start by thinking about the possible branches Branch a that a thread can take .
What do you have to glue to the thread when exploring the tree ?
Simple lists have a zipper as well .
data List a = Empty | Cons a ( List a ) What does it look like ?
Write a complete game based on Theseus ' labyrinth .
Heureka !
That was the solution Theseus sought and Ancient Geeks Inc. should prevail , even if partially sold to Ariadne Consulting .
But one question remained :
" Why is it called zipper ? "
" Well , I would have called it ' Ariadne 's pearl necklace ' .
But most likely , it 's called zipper because the thread is in analogy to the open part and the sub - labyrinth is like the closed part of a zipper .
Moving around in the data structure is analogous to zipping or unzipping the zipper . "
" ' Ariadne 's pearl necklace ' , " he articulated disdainfully .
" As if your thread was any help back then on Crete . "
" As if the idea with the thread were yours , " she replied .
" Bah , I need no thread , " he defied the fact that he actually did need the thread to program the game .
Much to his surprise , she agreed , " Well , indeed you do n't need a thread .
Another view is to literally grab the tree at the focus with your finger and lift it up in the air .
The focus will be at the top and all other branches of the tree hang down .
You only have to assign the resulting tree a suitable algebraic data type , most likely that of the zipper . "
Grab the focus with your finger , lift it in the air and the hanging branches will form new tree with your finger at the top , ready to be structured by an algebraic data type .
" Ah . " He did n't need Ariadne 's thread but he needed Ariadne to tell him ?
That was too much .
" Thank you , Ariadne , good bye . "
She did not hide her smirk as he could not see it anyway through the phone .
Exercises

Half a year later , Theseus stopped in front of a shop window , defying the cold rain that tried to creep under his buttoned up anorak .
Blinking letters announced

the great computer game by Ancient Geeks Inc .
He cursed the day when he called Ariadne and sold her a part of the company .
Was it she who contrived the unfriendly takeover by WineOS Corp. , led by Ariadne 's husband Dionysus ?
Theseus watched the raindrops finding their way down the glass window .
After the production line was changed , nobody would produce Theseus and the Minotaur™ merchandise anymore .
He sighed .
His time , the time of heroes , was over .
Now came the super - heroes .
Differentiation of data types [ edit ]
The previous section has presented the zipper , a way to augment a tree - like data structure Node a with a finger that can focus on the different subtrees .
While we constructed a zipper for a particular data structure Node a , the construction can be easily adapted to different tree data structures by hand .
Exercises Start with a ternary tree data
Tree a = Leaf a | Node ( Tree a ) ( Tree a ) ( Tree a ) and derive the corresponding Thread a and Zipper a .
Mechanical Differentiation [ edit ]
But there is also an entirely mechanical way to derive the zipper of any ( suitably regular ) data type .
Surprisingly , ' derive ' is to be taken literally , for the zipper can be obtained by the derivative of the data type , a discovery first described by Conor McBride [ 6 ] .
The subsequent section is going to explicate this truly wonderful mathematical gem .
For a systematic construction , we need to calculate with types .
The basics of structural calculations with types are outlined in a separate chapter Generic Programming and we will heavily rely on this material .
Let 's look at some examples to see what their zippers have in common and how they hint differentiation .
The type of binary tree is the fixed point of the recursive equation
T r e e 2 = 1 + T r e e 2 × T r e e 2 {\displaystyle {\mathit { Tree2}}=1+{\mathit { Tree2}}\times {\mathit { Tree2}}}
When walking down the tree , we iteratively choose to enter the left or the right subtree and then glue the not - entered subtree to Ariadne 's thread .
Thus , the branches of our thread have the type
B r a n c h 2 = T r e e 2 + T r e e 2 ≅ 2 × T r e e 2 {\displaystyle {\mathit { Branch2}}={\mathit { Tree2}}+{\mathit { Tree2}}\cong 2 \times {\mathit { Tree2}}}
Similarly , the thread for a ternary tree
T r e e 3 = 1 + T r e e 3 × T r e e 3 × T r e e 3 {\displaystyle {\mathit { Tree3}}=1+{\mathit { Tree3}}\times {\mathit { Tree3}}\times {\mathit { Tree3}}}
has branches of type
B r a n c h 3 = 3 × T r e e 3 × T r e e 3 {\displaystyle {\mathit { Branch3}}=3 \times {\mathit { Tree3}}\times {\mathit { Tree3}}}
because at every step , we can choose between three subtrees and have to store the two subtrees we do n't enter .
Is n't this strikingly similar to the derivatives d d x x 2 = 2 × x {\displaystyle {\frac {d} {dx}}x ^ { 2}=2 \times x} and d d x x 3 = 3 × x 2 {\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dx}}x ^{3}=3 \times x^{2}} ?
The key to the mystery is the notion of the one - hole context of a data structure .
Imagine a data structure parameterised over a type X {\displaystyle X} , like the type of trees T r e e X {\displaystyle {\mathit { Tree}}\ , X} .
If we were to remove one of the items of this type X {\displaystyle X} from the structure and somehow mark the now empty position , we obtain a structure with a marked hole .
The result is called " one - hole context " and inserting an item of type X {\displaystyle
X} into the hole gives back a completely filled T r e e X {\displaystyle {\mathit { Tree}}\ , X} .
The hole acts as a distinguished position , a focus .
The figures illustrate this .
X {\displaystyle X} T r e e X {\displaystyle {\mathit { Tree}}\ , X} Removing a value of typefrom aleaves a hole at that position .
X {\displaystyle X} A more abstract illustration of plugginginto a one - hole context .
Of course , we are interested in the type to give to a one - hole context , i.e. how to represent it in Haskell .
The problem is how to efficiently mark the focus .
But as we will see , finding a representation for one - hole contexts by induction on the structure of the type we want to take the one - hole context of automatically leads to an efficient data type [ 7 ] .
So , given a data structure F X {\displaystyle F\ , X} with a functor F {\displaystyle F} and an argument type X {\displaystyle X} , we want to calculate the type ∂ F X {\displaystyle \partial F\ , X} of one - hole contexts from the structure of F {\displaystyle F} .
As our choice of notation ∂ F {\displaystyle \partial F} already reveals , the rules for constructing one - hole contexts of sums , products and compositions are exactly Leibniz ' rules for differentiation .
One - hole context Illustration ( ∂ C o n s t A ) X {\displaystyle ( \partial {\mathit { Const_ { A}}} ) \ , X} = 0 {\displaystyle =\,0}
There is no X {\displaystyle X} A = C o n s t A X {\displaystyle A={\mathit { Const_ { A}}}\ , X} ( ∂ I d ) X {\displaystyle ( \partial {\mathit { Id}} ) \ , X} = 1 {\displaystyle =\, 1}
There is only one position for items X {\displaystyle X} X = I d X {\displaystyle X={\mathit { Id}}\ , X} X {\displaystyle X} X {\displaystyle X} I d X {\displaystyle {\mathit { Id}}\ , X} ∂ ( F + G ) {\displaystyle \partial ( F+G ) } = ∂ F + ∂
G {\displaystyle =\partial F+\partial G}
As an element of type F +
G {\displaystyle F+G} F {\displaystyle
F} G {\displaystyle G} ∂ F {\displaystyle \partial F} ∂ G {\displaystyle \partial G} ∂ ( F × G ) {\displaystyle \partial ( F\times G ) } = F × ∂ G + ∂ F × G {\displaystyle = F\times \partial G+\partial F\times G}
The hole in a one - hole context of a pair is either in the first or in the second component .
∂ ( F ∘ G ) {\displaystyle \partial ( F\circ G ) } = ( ∂ F ∘ G ) × ∂ G {\displaystyle =( \partial F\circ G ) \times \partial G}
Chain rule .
The hole in a composition arises by making a hole in the enclosing structure and fitting the enclosed structure in .
Of course , the function plug that fills a hole has the type ( ∂ F X ) ×
X → F X {\displaystyle ( \partial F\ , X ) \times X\to F\ , X} .
So far , the syntax ∂ {\displaystyle \partial } denotes the differentiation of functors , i.e. of a kind of type functions with one argument .
But there is also a handy expression oriented notation ∂
X {\displaystyle \partial _{X}} slightly more suitable for calculation .
The subscript indicates the variable with respect to which we want to differentiate .
In general , we have
( ∂ F ) X = ∂ X ( F X ) {\displaystyle ( \partial F ) \ , X=\partial _{X} ( F\, X ) }
An example is
∂ ( I d × I d ) X = ∂ X ( X × X ) = 1 × X + X × 1 ≅ 2 × X {\displaystyle \partial ( {\mathit { Id}}\times {\mathit { Id}} ) \ , X=\partial _{X}( X\times X ) =1 \times X+X\times 1\cong 2 \times X}
Of course , ∂ X {\displaystyle \partial _{X}} is just point - wise whereas ∂ {\displaystyle \partial } is point - free style .
Exercises Rewrite some rules in point - wise style .
For example , the left hand side of the product rule becomes ∂
X ( F X × G X ) = … {\displaystyle \partial _{X} ( F\ , X\times G\ , X ) =\dots }
To get familiar with one - hole contexts , differentiate the product X n := X × X × ⋯ × X {\displaystyle X^{n} : =X\times X\times \dots \times
X} n {\displaystyle n} Of course , one - hole contexts are useless if we cannot plug values of type X {\displaystyle X} plug functions corresponding to the five rules .
Formulate the chain rule for two variables and prove that it yields one - hole contexts .
You can do this by viewing a bifunctor F X Y {\displaystyle F\ , X\ , Y} ( X , Y ) {\displaystyle ( X, Y ) }
Zippers via Differentiation [ edit ]
The above rules enable us to construct zippers for recursive data types μ F := μ X . F X {\displaystyle \mu F:=\mu X.\ , F\ , X} where F {\displaystyle F} is a polynomial functor .
A zipper is a focus on a particular subtree , i.e. substructure of type μ F {\displaystyle \mu
F} inside a large tree of the same type .
As in the previous chapter , it can be represented by the subtree we want to focus at and the thread , that is the context in which the subtree resides
Z i p p e r F = μ F × C o n t e x t F {\displaystyle {\mathit { Zipper}}_ {F}=\mu F\times {\mathit { Context}}_ {F}}
Now , the context is a series of steps each of which chooses a particular subtree μ
F {\displaystyle \mu
F} among those in F μ F {\displaystyle F\ , \mu F} .
Thus , the unchosen subtrees are collected together by the one - hole context ∂ F ( μ F ) {\displaystyle \partial F\ , ( \mu F ) } .
The hole of this context comes from removing the subtree we 've chosen to enter .
Putting things together , we have
C o n t e x t F = L i s t ( ∂ F ( μ F ) ) {\displaystyle {\mathit { Context}}_ {F}={\mathit { List}}\ , ( \partial F\ , ( \mu F ) ) }
or equivalently
C o n t e x t F = 1 + ∂ F ( μ F ) × C o n t e x t F {\displaystyle {\mathit { Context}}_ {F}=1+\partial
F\ , ( \mu F ) \times {\mathit { Context}}_ {F}}
To illustrate how a concrete calculation proceeds , let 's systematically construct the zipper for our labyrinth data type
data Node a = DeadEnd a | Passage a ( Node a ) | Fork a ( Node a ) ( Node a )
This recursive type is the fixed point
N o d e A = μ X .
N o d e F A X {\displaystyle {\mathit { Node}}\ , A=\mu X.\ , {\mathit { NodeF}}_ {A}\,X}
of the functor
N o d e F A X = A + A × X + A × X × X {\displaystyle {\mathit { NodeF}}_ {A}\ , X=A + A\times X+A\times X\times X}
In other words , we have
N o d e A ≅ N o d e F A ( N o d e A ) ≅
A + A × N o d e A + A × N o d e A × N o d e A {\displaystyle {\mathit { Node}}\ , A\cong {\mathit { NodeF}}_ {
A}\ , ( {\mathit { Node}}\ , A ) \cong A+ A\times {\mathit { Node}}\ , A+ A\times {\mathit { Node}} \ , A\times {\mathit { Node}} \ , A}
The derivative reads
∂ X ( N o d e F A X ) ≅ A + 2 × A × X {\displaystyle \partial _{X} ( {\mathit { NodeF}}_ {A}\,X ) \cong A+2\times A\times X}
and we get
∂ N o d e F A ( N o d e A ) ≅ A + 2 × A × N o d e A {\displaystyle \partial {\mathit { NodeF}}_ {A}\ , ( {\mathit { Node}}\ , A ) \cong A+2 \times A\times {\mathit { Node}} \ , A}
Thus , the context reads
C o n t e x t N o d e F ≅ L i s t ( ∂ N o d e F A ( N o d e A ) ) ≅ L i s t ( A + 2 × A × ( N o d e A ) ) {\displaystyle {\mathit { Context}}_{ \mathit { NodeF}}\cong {\mathit { List}}\ , ( \partial {\mathit { NodeF}}_ {A}\ , ( {\mathit { Node}}\ , A ) ) \cong {\mathit { List}}\ , ( A+2 \times A\times ( {\mathit { Node}}\ , A ) ) }
Comparing with
data Branch a = KeepStraightOn a | TurnLeft a ( Node a ) | TurnRight a ( Node a ) type Thread a = [ Branch a ]
we see that both are exactly the same as expected !
Exercises
Redo the zipper for a ternary tree , but with differentiation this time .
Construct the zipper for a list .
Rhetorical question concerning the previous exercise : what 's the difference between a list and a stack ?
Differentiation of Fixed Point [ edit ]
There is more to data types than sums and products , we also have a fixed point operator with no direct correspondence in calculus .
Consequently , the table is missing a rule of differentiation , namely how to differentiate fixed points μ F X = μ Y .
F X Y {\displaystyle \mu F\ , X=\mu Y.\ , F\ , X\ , Y} :
∂ X ( μ F X ) = ?
{\displaystyle \partial _{X} ( \mu F\,X ) ={?}}
As its formulation involves the chain rule in two variables , we delegate it to the exercises .
Instead , we will calculate it for our concrete example type N o d e A {\displaystyle {\mathit { Node}}\ , A} :
∂ A ( N o d e A ) = ∂ A ( A + A × N o d e A + A × N o d e A × N o d e A ) ≅ 1 + N o d e A + N o d e A × N o d e A + ∂ A ( N o d e A ) × ( A + 2 × A × N o d e A ) .
{\displaystyle {\begin{matrix} \partial _{A}( {\mathit { Node}}\ , A ) &=&\partial _{A}( A+A\times {\mathit { Node}}\ , A+A\times {\mathit { Node}}\ , A\times {\mathit { Node}}\ , A ) \\&\cong &1+{\mathit { Node}} \ , A+{\mathit { Node}} \ , A\times {\mathit { Node}}\ , A\\&& + \partial _{A}( {\mathit { Node}}\ , A ) \times ( A+2 \times A\times {\mathit { Node}}\ , A).\end{matrix}}}
Of course , expanding ∂ A ( N o d e A ) {\displaystyle \partial _{A} ( {\mathit { Node}} \ , A ) } further is of no use , but we can see this as a fixed point equation and arrive at
∂ A ( N o d e A ) = μ X .
T A + S A × X {\displaystyle \partial _{A} ( {\mathit { Node}}\ , A ) =\mu X.\ , T\ , A+S\ , A\times X}
with the abbreviations
T A = 1 + N o d e A + N o d e A × N o d e A {\displaystyle T\ , A=1+{\mathit { Node}} \ , A+{\mathit { Node}} \ , A\times {\mathit { Node}} \ , A}
and
S A = A + 2 × A × N o d e A {\displaystyle S\ , A=A+2 \times A\times {\mathit { Node}} \ , A}
The recursive type is like a list with element types S A {\displaystyle S\ , A} , only that the empty list is replaced by a base case of type T A {\displaystyle T\ , A} .
But given that the list is finite , we can replace the base case with 1 {\displaystyle 1} and pull T A {\displaystyle T\ , A} out of the list :
∂ A ( N o d e A ) ≅ T A × ( μ X . 1 + S A × X ) = T A × L i s t ( S A ) {\displaystyle \partial _{A} ( {\mathit { Node}}\ , A ) \cong T\ , A\times ( \mu X.\ , 1+S\ , A\times X ) =T\ , A\times {\mathit { List}}\ , ( S\ , A ) }
Comparing with the zipper we derived in the last paragraph , we see that the list type is our context
L i s t ( S A ) ≅ C o n t e x t N o d e F {\displaystyle {\mathit { List}}\ , ( S\ , A ) \cong {\mathit { Context}}_{\mathit { NodeF}}}
and that
A × T A ≅ N o d e A {\displaystyle A\times T\ , A\cong {\mathit { Node}} \ ,
A}
In the end , we have
Z i p p e r N o d e F ≅ ∂ A ( N o d e A ) ×
A {\displaystyle {\mathit { Zipper}}_{ \mathit { NodeF}}\cong \partial _{A}( {\mathit { Node}}\ , A ) \times A}
Thus , differentiating our concrete example N o d e A {\displaystyle {\mathit { Node}} \ , A} with respect to A {\displaystyle A} yields the zipper up to an A {\displaystyle A} !
Exercises
Use the chain rule in two variables to formulate a rule for the differentiation of a fixed point .
Maybe you know that there are inductive ( μ {\displaystyle \mu } ν {\displaystyle
u }
Differentation with respect to functions of the argument [ edit ]
When finding the type of a one - hole context one does d f(x ) / d x .
It is entirely possible to solve expressions like d f( x ) / d g(x ) .
For example , solving d x ^4 / d x ^2 gives 2x ^2 , a two - hole context of a 4 - tuple .
The derivation is as follows let u=x ^2 d x ^4 / d x ^2 = d u^2 /d u = 2u = 2 x ^2 .
Zippers vs Contexts [ edit ]
In general however , zippers and one - hole contexts denote different things .
The zipper is a focus on arbitrary subtrees whereas a one - hole context can only focus on the argument of a type constructor .
Take for example the data type
data Tree a = Leaf a | Bin ( Tree a ) ( Tree a )
which is the fixed point
T r e e A = μ X .
A + X × X {\displaystyle {\mathit { Tree}}\ , A=\mu X.\, A+X\times X}
The zipper can focus on subtrees whose top is Bin or Leaf but the hole of one - hole context of T r e e A {\displaystyle {\mathit { Tree}} \ , A} may only focus a Leaf s because this is where the items of type A {\displaystyle A} reside .
The derivative of N o d e A {\displaystyle {\mathit { Node}} \ , A} only turned out to be the zipper because every top of a subtree is always decorated with an A {\displaystyle A} .
Exercises Surprisingly , ∂ A ( T r e e A ) ×
A {\displaystyle \partial _{A} ( {\mathit { Tree}}\ , A ) \times
A} T r e e A {\displaystyle {\mathit { Tree}} \ , A} Prove that the zipper construction for μ F {\displaystyle \mu F} Y {\displaystyle Y} μ X .
Y × F X {\displaystyle \mu X.\ , Y\times F\ , X} Y = 1 {\displaystyle Y=1} Find a type G A {\displaystyle G\ ,
A}
Conclusion [ edit ]
We close this section by asking how it may happen that rules from calculus appear in a discrete setting .
Currently , nobody knows .
But at least , there is a discrete notion of linear , namely in the sense of " exactly once " .
The key feature of the function that plugs an item of type X {\displaystyle
X} into the hole of a one - hole context is the fact that the item is used exactly once , i.e. linearly .
We may think of the plugging map as having type
∂ X F X → ( X ⊸ F X ) {\displaystyle \partial _{X}F\ , X\to ( X\multimap F\, X ) }
where A ⊸ B {\displaystyle A\multimap
B} denotes a linear function , one that does not duplicate or ignore its argument , as in linear logic .
In a sense , the one - hole context is a representation of the function space X ⊸ F X {\displaystyle X\multimap F\ , X} , which can be thought of being a linear approximation to X → F X {\displaystyle X\to F\ , X} .

Of course , the second topmost node or any other node at most a constant number of links away from the top will do as well .

Note that changing the whole data structure as opposed to updating the data at a node can be achieved in amortized constant time even if more nodes than just the top node is affected .
An example is incrementing a number in binary representation .
While incrementing say 111..11 must touch all digits to yield 1000..00 , the increment function nevertheless runs in constant amortized time ( but not in constant worst case time ) .

There 's an old joke that if you were reincarnated , you might want to come back as a polystyrene foam cup .
Why ?
Because they last forever .
Ba -dum - bum .
Despite being made 95 percent of air , polystyrene foam 's manufactured immortality has posed a problem for recycling efforts .
More than 3 million tons of the durable material is produced every year in the United States , according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency .
Very little of it is recycled .
Help may come from bacteria that have been found to eat polystyrene foam and turn it into useable plastic .
This is the stuff recycling dreams are made of : Yesterday 's cup could become tomorrow 's plastic spoon .
Kevin O’Connor of University College Dublin and his colleagues heated polystyrene foam to convert it to styrene oil .
The natural form of styrene is in real peanuts , strawberries and a good steak .
A synthetic form is used in car parts and electronic components .
Anyway , the scientists fed this styrene oil to the soil bacteria Pseudomonas putida , which converted it into biodegradable plastic known as PHA ( polyhydroxyalkanoates ) .
PHA can be used to make plastic forks and packaging film .
It is resistant to heat , grease and oil .
It also lasts a long time .
But unlike polystyrene foam , PHA biodegrades in soil and water .
The process will be detailed in the April 1 issue of the American Chemical Society journal Environmental Science & Technology .
Story Highlights • British Coroner says friendly fire death of British soldier was " unlawful "
• Hull 's widow says her family feels badly let down by U.S. government
• Hull killed when convoy was strafed by a U.S. warplane
• U.S. Defense Department expresses " deepest sympathies " for a " tragic accident "
Adjust font size :
LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- A British coroner on Friday ruled that a U.S. " friendly fire " attack that killed a British soldier in Iraq was unlawful and criminal .
Oxfordshire Assistant Deputy Coroner Andrew Walker said the death of Lance Cpl. Matty Hull in an attack on his armored vehicle convoy in southern Iraq in March 2003 , was entirely avoidable .
Walker also criticized U.S. officials for failing to provide all of the information and evidence he has asked for .
He said that not all of the facts had come to light in the case , and many pages of evidence had been blacked out .
The coroner 's verdict is not binding on the United States , which is not subject to British law , and will not lead to the prosecution of the American pilots .
Hull 's widow Susan welcomed the decision .
" All my family feel it is the right verdict , it is what we have waited four years to hear , " she told a press conference .
The coroner said there were many errors that resulted in the incident which left four other British soldiers wounded .
" Things were not checked , the coordinates were not checked , identification of the British armored convoy was not checked , and if this had been checked in such a way as the rules of engagement state that they should be , then this could have been entirely avoidable , " he said .
On Thursday , Hull 's widow appealed to U.S. President George W. Bush to release the full text of a military report on the incident .
( Full story )
She said 11 lines of the U.S. military 's Friendly Fire Investigation Board report into the incident had been blacked out in a copy supplied to the inquest .
The Hull family says the deleted lines relate to an interview with the ground controller -- code - named Manila Hotel -- in charge of the two A - 10 planes that attacked Hull 's convoy .
The coroner and the British government have repeatedly criticized the U.S. military for failing to cooperate with the inquest .
U.S. officials declined to send the pilots involved to give evidence and refused to release a cockpit recording of the attack .
In the tape , which was leaked to the press , the pilots ' coordinators gave assurances there were no coalition forces in the area at the time .
The pilots opened fire , but the error soon became obvious , and the pilots were informed that friendly units were in the area .
When they realize they have hit a convoy of British armored vehicles , the pilots say : " God damn it " and " We 're in jail , dude . "
Walker has called the lack of U.S. cooperation in the inquest " appalling . "
Britain's Ministry of Defence apologized for poor handling of the case .
" We are very sorry for confusion and upset caused over the handling of the cockpit footage , " it said in a statement .
" Susan Hull said today that she hopes that lessons will be learned as a result of this inquest - we will do all that we can to ensure that this is the case . "
Hull 's widow said her family had been " badly let down " by the U.S. government , but added that she would not be pursuing the matter any further .
" We 're drawing a line , we need to move on .
For all of us , it 's been a long painful time . "
Hull said she hoped her husband 's death would lead to better training for pilots and checks with the systems involved .
She said the pilots involved should not face further action .
" I hope that they are at peace with themselves and they can move on in their lives .
I 'm sure they are feeling remorse for what they did . "
A U.S. Defense Department spokesman -- who said the United States expressed its " deepest sympathies " to the Hulls -- called the U.S. probe into the matter " thorough " and said it was " conducted according to the same processes and same standards as would be used in the investigation of a friendly fire incident involving the death of an American military member . "
He said the U.S. shared " all information developed during the investigation " with British military authorities .
The spokesman said that the probe showed the incident " took place in a complex combat environment , the pilots followed applicable procedures and processes for engaging targets , believing they were engaging enemy targets , and that this was a tragic accident . "
But of course , Cheney just said he and his office are not part of the executive branch .
But he ’ll have to change his tune immediately in order to squash the subpoena by claiming executive privelege .
And that is why the subpoena was issued right now , to force Cheney to recant his recent claim that he ’s a new and independent 4th branch of government .
Two points for the Dems .
Code is bad .
It rots .
It requires periodic maintenance .
It has bugs that need to be found .
New features mean old code has to be adapted .
The more code you have , the more places there are for bugs to hide .
The longer checkouts or compiles take .
The longer it takes a new employee to make sense of your system .
If you have to refactor there 's more stuff to move around .
Furthermore , more code often means less flexibility and functionality .
This is counter - intuitive , but a lot of times a simple , elegant solution is faster and more general than the plodding mess of code produced by a programmer of lesser talent .
Code is produced by engineers .
To make more code requires more engineers .
Engineers have n^2 communication costs , and all that code they add to the system , while expanding its capability , also increases a whole basket of costs .
You should do whatever possible to increase the productivity of individual programmers in terms of the expressive power of the code they write .
Less code to do the same thing ( and possibly better ) .
Less programmers to hire .
Less organizational communication costs .
The minimum description length principle ( MDL ) is often used in genetic programming to identify the most promising candidate programs from a population .
The shorter solutions are often better ; not just shorter , but actually faster and / or more general .
A few hours reading WTF should convince anyone that there are often vast differences in the amount of code different programmers will put into the same task .
But it 's not just wtf ?
code .
Components like a page crawler can have very different solutions .
Maybe you can re-implement a 10 k line solution into a 1 k line solution , by taking a different approach .
And it turns out that the shorter crawler is actually more general and works in a lot more cases .
I 've seen this over and over again in code and I 'm convinced that it 's harder to write something short and robust than something big and brittle .
I 've been looking for ways to get code out of the code .
Is there something the code is doing that can be turned into an external dataset , and driven by a web UI , or some rule - list that I can contract out to someone on elance ?
Maybe a little rule - based language has to be written .
I 've seen this yield an unexpected productivity increase .
It turns out that using the web tool to edit the rules in the little domain - specific language ends up being more productive than messing around in the raw code anyway .
The time spent formalizing the subdomain language is more than paid back .
Code has three lifetime performance curves :
Code that is consistent over time .
The MD5 function is just great and it always does what we want .
We act like all code is like this but most of the interesting parts of the system really are n't .
Code that will get worse over time , or will inevitably cause a problem in the future .
Humans will have to jump in at some point to deal .
You know this when you write the code , if you stop to think .
Appending lines to a logfile without bothering to implement rotation is like this .
Having a database that you know will grow over time on a single disk that counts on someone to type ' df ' every so often and eventually deal is like that too .
RAID is kind of like this .
It reduces disk reliability problems by some constant .
But when a disk fails , RAID has to email someone and say it 's going to lose data unless someone steps in and deals .
In a growing service , RAID is going to generate m management events for n disks .
As n grows , m grows .
10X the disk cluster , 10X the management events .
Wonderful .
Better to architect something that decays organically over time , without requiring pager - level immediate support or else it will catastrophically fail .
e.g the datacenter in one of these shipping container prototypes .
Code that gets better over time .
This is the frontier .
Google 's spelling corrector is like this .
It works okay on a small crawl , but better on a big crawl .
People in the system can be organized this way , working on a component ( like a dataset or ruleset ) that they steadily improve over time .
They 're external to the core programming team but they make the code better by improving it with data .
I 've been wondering if it 's possible to generally insert learning components at certain points into the code to adaptively respond to failure cases , scenarios , etc .
Why am I manually tuning this perf variable or setting this backoff strategy ?
Why are we manually doing A/B testing and putting the results back into CVS to run another test , when the whole loop could be wired up to the live site to run by itself and just adapt and / or improve over time ?
I need to bake this some more but I think it 's promising .

Consumers were advised on Friday to discard all toothpaste made in China after federal health officials said they found Chinese - made toothpaste containing a poison related to a chemical used in antifreeze in three locations — Miami , the Port of Los Angeles and Puerto Rico .
Although there are no reports of anyone being harmed by the toothpaste , the Food and Drug Administration warned that the Chinese products have a “ low but meaningful risk of toxicity and injury ” to children and people with kidney or liver disease .
The United States is the seventh country to find tainted Chinese toothpaste within its borders in recent weeks .
F.D.A. officials said they found toothpaste containing a small amount of diethylene glycol , a sweet syrupy poison , at a Dollar Plus retail store in Miami , sold under the brand name ShiR Fresh Mint Flouride Paste .
The F.D.A. also identified another nine brands of Chinese toothpaste that contain diethylene glycol , some with concentrations of between 3 percent and 4 percent .

Thin , polite , deliberate , and articulate Doug Loranger offers me a seat in his Western Addition flat and turns on a television set to a video he made promoting his quest to halt construction of cellular telephone antennas .
Loranger feels so strongly that radio emissions from the towers might cause ailments such as brain cancer that fighting them has become a time - consuming hobby .
He drew on skills learned as a film school student to create this core public - relations tool , in which he interviews other San Franciscans opposed to radio - wave propagation , and shows how they fought cell tower construction .
For all the passion behind Loranger 's belief , however , I was perplexed by how long it took his documentary to cut to the chase .
Instead of hearing all about cellphone - tower death rays , minutes dragged by as I learned about how a middle - aged Chinese community activist volunteers as a City Hall docent , and about the different jobs a computer specialist had held during the last couple decades .
Then it occurred to me : Loranger seemed to be showing viewers that his anti-radio - wave activist friends were n't crazy .
They had normal lives , jobs , and friends .
Very few scientists who study the issue believe radio waves from cellphone towers are dangerous .
So anti-radio - wave activists are sometimes lumped together with UFO and other conspiracy nuts .
My next thought : I wondered if Gavin Newsom and his pal Sergey Brin know that these public - image - impaired San Franciscans are poised to kick their asses .
Loranger has plans to strike a deathblow against a mayor - backed plan whereby Google and EarthLink would provide free Wi-Fi Internet access citywide .
Loranger and his friends fear the Wi-Fi plan would broadcast more hated radio waves .
Separately , Loranger 's cause is aided by activists who believe , for reasons having nothing to do with radio waves , that it would be better to install an expensive , city - owned fiber network .
They have obtained backing on the Board of Supervisors to kill the mayor 's Wi -Fi plan .
This is a bummer for San Francisco .
Here in the world 's most Internet - hooked city , free citywide Wi-Fi would have been like free Guinness for Dubliners .
But it 's also fitting justice for Newsom , who earned his current political popularity based on a 2004 symbolic protest about gay marriage , which produced no tangible results .
Yet he somehow did n't learn that San Franciscans ' zest for aimless rebellion is a two - edged sword .
He never anticipated , and now does n't know what to do about , two separate , misguided citizen movements working to shut down his free Wi-Fi plan .
By failing to learn from his own social - protest success , Newsom may go down in history as so inept he could n't execute a plan to give away what amounts to free beer .
In 2004 , our just - elected mayor gained national notoriety by announcing that he would put free high - speed Internet in every pot .
The idea seemed downright magical .
San Francisco was a tech capital .
The mayor was young and attractive .
Magazine editors scheduled Newsom photo shoots .
After three years of fits , starts , and negotiations , the mayor announced a contract in January between the city , EarthLink and Google , by which EarthLink would pay the city $ 2 million over four years for the right to build , own , and maintain a citywide Wi -Fi network .
Google would provide free Internet access at a relatively slow speed sufficient for Web browsing and e-mail .
For a $ 22 upcharge , EarthLink would provide a faster service useful for things such as Internet telephony , videos , and such .
To my mind , that 's fantastic .
I pay $ 60 per month now for high - speed Internet .
The system Newsom 's backing would force players such as Comcast and SBC to swiftly mark down their prices to the $ 20 range .
A pricing and features war would ensue .
The resulting universal broadband would in turn create opportunities for new Internet business models , perhaps spawning a 1990s - like job boom .
However , for every good new thing in San Francisco , there is an army of protesters angry that it's not the perfect thing .
Yet Newsom ignored this fact .
He did n't hold meetings with members of the Board of Supervisors to negotiate the shape his Wi -Fi plan would take , nor give them any opportunities to take credit for some of it themselves .
Most of the Board is staffed by Newsom 's political opponents who are eager to the possibility of killing policies with his name - stamp on them , even good ones .
In that spirit , Supervisors Jake McGoldrick and Tom Ammiano are working separately from Loranger to kill Newsom 's Wi-Fi plan .
In its place , they 're attempting to revive a plan Ammiano floated in 2004 to create a city - owned fiber - optic cable network to compete with private networks already in place .
Board members ordered the city budget analyst to study the idea , and he issued a report saying the idea was theoretically viable .
A private nonprofit group is also studying the idea at S.F. officials ' behest .
When I looked into Ammiano 's plan back in 2004 , I found that experts in the field of city - owned communications networks said laying a city - owned fiber - optic would be an expensive , unworkable boondoggle in San Francisco .
Ammiano's own aide referred me to experts who ended up explaining that the plan could n't possibly work .
Since then , neither McGoldrick nor Ammiano has said anything to convince me that his current idea is different than the pointless money pit proposed in 2004 .
Instead , Ammiano and McGoldrick have been saying Newsom 's failure to support his 2004 plan to spend millions of tax dollars laying fiber - optic cable alongside sewer lines was a " missed opportunity . "
Perhaps , in the way a bullet that only singes your hair is a " missed opportunity . "
Much smaller cities such as Palo Alto and Alameda started up expensive municipal broadband systems , then lost millions of dollars trying to run them .
In San Francisco , a city - owned network would compete with already existing private networks such as cable , telephone lines , Wi-Fi , and yet - unknown technologies that might develop during the decade or more of installing such a system might require .
But because the idea 's been adopted by left - leaning supervisors as a way to kill a key mayoral policy initiative , this wasteful city - fiber - optic network pipe dream has become an official part of local " progressivism . "
As such , the city fiber - optic network will never be built .
But it 's a phantom menace that will kill the mayor 's much more workable Google - EarthLink Wi-Fi plan .
Loranger has been laying low during the Wi-Fi debate , so far .
But that 's only because he 's been waiting for the right moment to attack .
" People should be concerned about the cumulative effects of all of this microwave radiation being introduced to the city , " Loranger said , explaining that a Wi -Fi system would require installing battalions of small antennas on utility poles , which would beam radio waves into people 's homes .
In some cases the waves would strike sleeping babies , he points out .
" When you add that to the number of existing licensed cellphone antennas , Sutro Tower , the hundreds of thousands of cellphones that are themselves transmitting , and the tens of thousands of Wi-Fi facilities that are in apartments and in people 's homes , we think people will be concerned about the health issues , " he says .
" We have n't had hearings on the public health side of it yet , and we think there should be . "
Some time during the next couple of weeks the city 's Planning Department will issue a report saying whether or not it 's necessary to conduct a study about the Google - EarthLink Wi-Fi plan 's effects on the environment .
Loranger will fire back a letter demanding an environmental study of his own devising , in which specialists measure the amount of radio waves beamed into every part of San Francisco .
He 'll then demand public hearings about whether or not these radio waves are making people sick .
It 's doubtful such hearings would produce any sort of useful conclusion .
But Loranger will get the hearings , because supervisors are quite accustomed to giving Loranger what he wants .
Health concerns over the effects of radio waves generated by cellphone networks are repeatedly debunked by respected scientists , and then raised again by others , a cycle that 's continued since cellphone networks began in the 1970s .
Regulators over the world say radio waves do n't harm people , and since the 1980s , research has mounted saying such radiation does n't affect biology .
But now and again , studies will pop up saying it 's possible cellphone radiation can produce biological effects .
And that 's been enough for Loranger to contact and frighten residents where cellphone towers are slated to be built , and get them to flood City Hall with complaints .
So far , he 's defeated 13 out of 15 cell towers that have come before the Board of Supervisors during recent years , forcing companies such as Verizon and T - Mobile to stop installing them altogether .
Instead , they 've been placing miniature torso - sized antennas on stores and apartment buildings .
Earlier this year , Board of Supervisors President Aaron Peskin pressured cell companies to stop building those mini-antennas , too .
As a proven giant killer , Loranger will demolish whatever 's left of Newsom 's free , citywide wireless plan .
But it did n't have to be this way .
Back in 2004 , when Tom Ammiano was floating his inoperable fiber - optic plan , Newsom need n't have blown him off as he did .
Instead , Newsom could have patted Ammiano on the back for his great idea , and included a proposed city - owned network as one contestant in a bidding competition for S.F. broadband .
And there it would have died on the merits .
And when it did , Newsom could have made a big deal of trying to salvage some of Ammiano 's boondoggle with the supervisors ' help  perhaps by incorporating the small amounts of fiber - optic cable now in the city 's purview into whatever system got built .
Then he should have made Ammiano vice mayor for technology , much like he made his former opponent Angela Alioto vice - mayor of homelessness back in 2003 .
Sadly , Newsom took a different path .
He tried to sell free Wi-Fi as a go - alone no-brainer , and as an anti-poverty initiative ; in 2004 , you 'll recall , Newsom was still claiming that he liked to hang around in the projects and play pickup basketball .
Keeping with the theme , citywide Wi-Fi was touted as mostly aimed at residents of S.F. subsidized housing projects .
But Newsom needed a pro-Wi-Fi coalition broader than the PR team responsible for his phony man -o - the - poor image .
There are actually hundreds of thousands of San Franciscans who believe wide broadband access is crucial to social empowerment and economic growth , and they were left out of the loop .
Now , Newsom is scurrying between personal appearances to tout his wireless plan , hoping he can salvage it somehow .
But it 's as good as dead .
And in politics , death of a major policy initiative is noticed by those keeping score .
" If you can't give away free beer on a warm day , or free Wi-Fi in one of the most technologically savvy cities in the country , how can you be governor ? " asks Jim Ross , Newsom 's 2003 campaign strategist .
And why , I 'll add , should he get another term as mayor of San Francisco ?
An interactive computer software program called FaceSay™ has been shown to improve the ability of children with autism spectrum disorders ( ASD ) to recognize faces , facial expressions and emotions , according to the results of a study conducted by psychologists at the University of Alabama at Birmingham ( UAB ) .
FaceSay™ , created by Symbionica L.L.C. , features interactive games that let children with ASD practice recognizing the facial expressions of an avatar , or software “ puppet . ”
Specifically , the computer games teach the children where to look for facial cues such as an eye gaze or a facial expression .
The study found that the children with Asperger Syndrome who used the FaceSay™ program made significant improvements in their ability to read facial expressions .
The children with autism made less improvement .
Children in both the autism and Asperger groups , however , both improved their ability to recognize emotions .
Specifically , the children with autism who used FaceSay™ averaged a mean score of 14.8 on a facial recognition test .
The control group averaged 12.8 .
The children with Asperger Syndrome scored much higher with an average score of 18.4 compared to 15.4 by the control group .
On an emotion recognition skills test , the children with autism who used FaceSay™ scored an average of 6.53 .
The control group ’s average score was 5.2 .
The children with Asperger Syndrome had a mean test score of 8.7 compared with the control group score of 6.79 .
UAB doctoral student Maria Hopkins , Ph.D. , and UAB associate professor of psychology Fred Biasini , Ph.D. , conducted the study .
Autism spectrum disorder includes a range of developmental disorders such as autism , Asperger Syndrome and other pervasive developmental disorders .
Children with ASD often avoid eye contact with others , which prevents them from perceiving and understanding the emotions of others .
Many have problems remembering faces .
Hopkins and Biasini tested 25 children with autism and 24 children with Asperger Syndrome .
The children ranged in age from 6 to 15 , with an average age of 10 years .
The group consisted of 44 boys and five girls .
The computer training sessions were held twice a week for at least six weeks for an average of 20 minutes each session .
The software featured three interactive games .
Psychologists at UAB plan to conduct more studies to assess the longtime effects of the FaceSay™ intervention .
The study ’s results were presented recently at a meeting of the Association for Psychological Science .
Jadwiga and Rudy Taylor are old hands at winning million - dollar jackpots .
When the Mississauga couple picked up their $ 20 million Lotto 6/49 prize yesterday – their half of the June 13 draw – it was n't the first time they'd hit the big money .
The Taylors had also picked up a $ 1 million prize in 1999 .
And having been through the winning routine once before , they did n't want to stick around long to answer reporters ' questions about their winnings this time .
The Taylors won their previous prize with a quick pick – numbers drawn randomly by the lottery computer .
This time , Jadwiga Taylor said she chose her own numbers , including the birth date of her mother , who lives in Poland , as do most of the couple 's family .
She also picked 40 – her age when she won the last big prize – and 48 , her present age .
( The other numbers were 2 , 10 , 19 and 36 . )
Rudy is in his 80s , according to lottery officials , but would n't discuss his age with reporters .
" He 's not saying , " said Jadwiga ; Rudy simply shook his head and said : " Too old . "
The Taylors still have n't told their overseas relatives of their astounding good luck .
" I wanted to have this in the bank " before sharing the news , said Jadwiga , holding up her new cheque .
Jadwiga and Rudy have no children .
They 've been married for 20 years .
Rudy , a builder , retired about 15 years ago ; Jadwiga says she " never worked . "
Why keep buying lottery tickets after a big win ?
" Why not ? " shrugged Jadwiga – unassailable logic when she 's clutching $ 20 million .
She bought the winning ticket at Sheridan Mall on Erin Mills Parkway near the QEW .
But she said she will " probably not " keep buying tickets now that they 've won their super prize .

The Taylors have no immediate plans for their new wealth beyond spreading some of it around their families , once they let them in on the secret .
They plan to remain in their current home .
" I just did n't believe it " when she first heard the winning numbers , Jadwiga said .
" I did n't have the ticket with me .
I went downstairs to my wallet to check , and it was there . "
What then ?
" We just feel excited , and try to cool off . "
But the Taylors quickly tired of answering questions and asked to leave .
The other half of the $ 40 million prize , the third - largest ever Lotto 6/49 prize , went to three couples from Burlington who shared a ticket , and collected their loot last week .
Lottery officials said more than 29 million sets of numbers were entered in the draw .
Since many players have multiple sets of numbers , they did n't know how many tickets were sold .

Football concussions : hut , hut , uh , what comes next ?
Professional football players say that competing in the pros before a packed house of 70,000 fans provides memories that last a lifetime --- or at least until their 40s when their memory and other cognitive skills start to diminish as a result of a long career of blows to the head .
It 's enough to make you depressed .
In fact , according to a study in the current issue of Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise , the rate of clinical depression among former football pros is indeed strongly associated with number of concussions they sustained on the field .
The study , from the University of North Carolina , adds to a growing body of research on dementia and memory loss among retired athletes revealing how football takes an unreasonable toll on the mind as well as the body .
Put me in , coach A concussion is a bruise to the brain .
A mild concussion is a blow that causes confusion and short - term memory loss ; the so - called classic concussion entails a loss of consciousness , and the aftereffects are far worse .
The chance of receiving a second concussion is four times greater than receiving the first .
In a sport known for bullnecked brutes with veins in their teeth who are bred to compete , concussions often go unnoticed or unreported .
There is little appreciation among the coaches , trainers , players and even the fans about the seriousness of concussions , especially the kind that do n't render a player unconscious and are therefore not obvious .
The National Football League head office finally may be taking the issue seriously , though .
In May , NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell issued a new set of guidelines that could save a few brains , provided coaches are brainy enough to abide by them .
A high school knockout For professional football players , the trouble begins in high school .
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that there are 300,000 concussions per year in high school sports .
The CDC distributes a brochure for high school coaches to recognize the signs of mild concussion , such as confusion , irritability or an inability to follow instructions or answer clearly .
Of course , these characteristics matched half the players on my high school 's football team , even the guys who never played .
So admittedly coaches have their work cut out .
In the United States , each state has guidelines for how to manage high school athletes who receive concussions .
Colorado's guidelines are perhaps the strictest , developed by the Colorado Medical Society in response to the deaths from head injuries of several Colorado high school football players .
The Colorado guidelines characterize concussions into three grades , the first grade being the least severe ( with no amnesia or loss of consciousness ) and the third grade the most severe ( loss of consciousness ) .
A grade - one concussion will force a player out of the game for at least twenty minutes , pending further evaluation .
A grade - two concussion keeps a player out of the game and practice for at least a week ; a grade - three concussion benches the player for at least a month .
Still , many doctors say the guidelines do n't go far enough .
As reported last year in the journal Brain Injury , even grade - one concussions take a week or two to heal .
The study 's lead author , Michael McClincy of the University of Pittsburg , recommends a standard , objective test instead of subjective concussion grade evaluations to determine the severity of a concussion .
The ultimate price Bennett Omalu , a neuropathologist at the University of Pittsburg , claims that repeated concussions likely contributed to the depression and ultimate suicide of Philadelphia Eagles ' cornerback and safety Andre Waters , who shot himself last November at age 44 .
According to Omalu , Waters ' brain was similar to that of an 85 - year old with early - stage Alzheimer's .
Waters was known as one of the hardest hitters in the league .
Up until last season , NFL players dinged in the head routinely returned to the game after 15 minutes if their symptoms of confusion and such went away .
This year , players will start the season with standardized neuropsychological baseline testing as part of a long - term plan to assess mental health .
The players will be educated about the dangers of concussions .
While each team maintains the authority to establish return - to - game guidelines , Commissioner Goodell said that medical decisions must always override competitive considerations and that the NFL will establish a " whistle blower " system so that anyone may report an incident in which a doctor is pressured to return a player to the field .
It 's a start .

Robert Mugabe , Zimbabwe ’s dictator , must be watching CNN or something , because he ’s starting to take plays right out of Hugo Chavez ’s playbook .
Call this one the “ taunt the West ” play :
HARARE , Zimbabwe ( Reuters ) — Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe vowed on Friday to survive any Western attempt to dislodge him from power .
Mugabe said Britain and the United States would never overcome the support he enjoys in his ruling ZANU - PF party , which led the former Rhodesia to black majority rule in 1980 .
“ Nothing frightens me , not even little fellows like Bush and Blair .
I have seen it all , I do n’t fear any suffering or a struggle of any kind , ” Mugabe , 83 , said to cheers from ZANU - PF supporters at a meeting in Harare .
“ I make a stand and stand on principle here where I was born , here where I grew up , here where I fought and here where I shall die , ” Mugabe said , accusing the West of sponsoring the opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) to overthrow his government .
Sounds an awful lot like our buddy down in Caracas does n’t it ?
In other news , though , it looks like pressure on Mugabe is increasing and that the people of Zimbabwe are reaching the point of being fed up enough to do something :
One of Zimbabwe ’s top Roman Catholic clerics , Archbishop Pius Ncube of Bulawayo , on Friday repeated his call for mass peaceful protests to end Mugabe ’s 27 - year rule .
(…)
Ncube , who has used his archbishop ’s pulpit to become one of Mugabe ’s most vocal and fearless domestic critics , on Friday said again he was ready to lead mass peaceful protests .
“ This dictator must be brought down right now by the peoples ’ power but not in a violent manner .
If we can get 30,000 people together Mugabe will just come down , ” Ncube told a news conference .
“ I would put myself on the line . ”
Your eminenence , you just might have to .
" The bride 's mother insisted on these horrendous iridescent blue monstrosities , " says Jennifer , a bridesmaid out of Meridian , Idaho .
" The bows , the lace and the fabric itched like crazy . "
But these maids did n't have to just wear the dresses – they also had to perform !
" We had to walk down the aisle with [ the parasols ] open and then when we got to the altar , we had to do a little choreographed move to close them . "
You know what they say :
When it rains , it pours !
US Driver 's License Numbers
Florida , Illinois , Wisconsin , perhaps others
by Alan De Smet
You might want to look at my disclaimer before using this information for anything important .
You might want to see warning about fake ids before using this information to make a fake id .
This particular page focuses on the algorithm shared by Florida , Illinois , and Wisconsin .
For information on other states driver 's license numbers see this page .
I 've written programs so you can can calculate your license number based on your personal information , or you can determine your personal information from your driver 's license number :
Here is a Java applet for encoding these states .
A number of states encode your name , gender , and date of birth in your license number .
These include Florida , Wisconsin , and Illinois .
These states use the same system of encoding , or very similar ones .
Given someone 's driver 's license number from one of these states , you can take good guesses at someone 's name and exactly determine their gender and date of birth .
With someone 's name , date of birth , and gender , you can guess some or all of their driver 's license number .
( I expect this same system applies to State IDs , but I do n't know . )
I 'm not really sure why these numbers are designed so .
A likely guess is that it allows a skilled bouncer to quickly identify sloppy fake ids .
When you remove the hyphens , these license numbers look like the following :
SSSSFFFYYDDD F25592150094
The specific licenenses look like the following .
Florida : SSSS -FFF-YY - DDD -N F255-921-50-094-0
I 'm told Florida uses a different system for state identifications .
I do n't know anything else about it .
Illinois Driver 's License : SSSS -FFFY -YDDD F255-9215-0094 Illinois State ID : SSSF -FFYY -DDDS 2559-2150-094F
Illinois State ID 's simply move the initial letter to the end , but are otherwise calculated the same .
Wisconsin : SSSS -FFFY -YDDD-NN
F255-9215-0121-03
The segments are :
SSSS - Soundex code of your last name
Soundex is a hashing system for english words .
You might want to look at further information on how soundex works .
The example soundex is F255 , so the example name starts with F , so the name starts with an F , followed by a gutteral or sibilant , followed by a nasal , followed by another nasal .
This is correct , as the example person 's last name is " Fakename "
For my license generator , I simply implement this .
For my license reverser , I simply take likely guesses .
I also generated the Soundex code for the top 10,000 ( ish ) last names in the US , and I suggest the top 10 for any given code .
FFF - Encoded first name and middle initial
Look up your first name on this table :
Name Code Name Code Name Code Albert 20 Frank 260 Marvin 580 Alice 20 George 300 Mary 580 Ann 40 Grace 300 Melvin 600 Anna 40 Harold 340 Mildred 600 Anne 40 Harriet 340 Patricia 680 Annie 40 Harry 360 Paul 680 Arthur 40 Hazel 360 Richard 740 Bernard 80 Helen 380 Robert 760 Bette 80 Henry 380 Ruby 740 Bettie 80 James 440 Ruth 760 Betty 80 Jane 440 Thelma 820 Carl 120 Jayne 440 Thomas 820 Catherine 120 Jean 460 Walter 900 Charles 140 Joan 480 Wanda 900 Dorthy 180 John 460 William 920 Edward 220 Joseph 480 Wilma 920 Elizabeth 220 Margaret 560 Florence 260 Martin 560 Donald 180 Clara 140
If you fail to find your name , look up your first initial on this table :
Initial Code Initial Code Initial Code Initial Code A 0 H 320 O 640 V 860 B 60 I 400 P 660 W 880 C 100 J 420 Q 700 X 940 D 160 K 500 R 720 Y 960 E 200 L 520 S 780 Z 980 F 240 M 540 T 800 G 280 N 620 U 840
Now look up your middle initial on this table :
Initial Code Initial Code Initial Code Initial Code A 1 H 8 O 14 V 18 B 2 I 9 P 15 W 19 C 3 J 10 Q 15 X 19 D 4 K 11 R 16 Y 19 E 5 L 12 S 17 Z 19 F 6 M 13 T 18 G 7 N 14 U 18
Now , if add together the code for either your first name ( if possible ) or your first initial to the code for your middle inital .
So , the example FFF code is 921 .
Looking it up , it 's William or Wilma A .
If it had been 001 , we would simply know at the their initials are A. A . Since the example was generated for " William Andrew Fakename " this is correct .
Y-Y - Your birth year
The two numbers together represent the year of your birth .
If you are born in 1968 , it should read ' 68 ' .
This is the easiest information to pick out of a WDL , and is often used to spot fakes .
The example Y -Y code is 50 .
Mr. or Ms Fakename was born in 1950 .
DDD - Month and day of birth and gender
This portion encodes the month and day you were born on .
The general equation is :
General : ( birth_month - 1 ) * month_multiplier + birth_day + gender_mod Florida : ( birth_month - 1 ) * 40 + birth_day + ( male : 0 , female : 500 ) Illinois : ( birth_month - 1 ) * 31 + birth_day + ( male : 0 , female : 600 ) Wisconsin : ( birth_month - 1 ) * 40 + birth_day + ( male : 0 , female : 500 )
birth_month is the number of months into the year , January is 1 , December is 12 .
month_multiplier varies by state .
Illinois uses 31 .
Wisconsin and Florida both use 40 .
gender_mod varies by state .
In Illinois men use 0 , women use 600 .
In Wisconsin and Florida men use 0 , women use 500 .
If the result is less than 100 , add zeroes to the left side to make it 3 digits .
( So , January 1st is encoded as " 001 " for men in Illinois . )
Mr. or Ms Fakename 's code is 094 .
Assuming we 're looking at an Illinois license number , because that 's less than 600 , we know Mr. Fakename is male .
His name is probably William and not Wilma .
We can subtract 93 from that , which is 31 three times .
So three months into the year , April .
That leaves 1 left , which is the day .
Mr. Fakename was born on April 1 , 1950 .
Overflow
Looking at this , may become clear that it is possible for two people with similar names to get the exact same driver 's license number .
For example , if " Joshua William Smith " and " Jack Wayne Snoddy " were born on the same day , they 'll get the same Illinois drive 's license number .
This is solved with " overflow " numbers , a simple sequential number can be appended to each duplicate number to resolve the confusion .
Wisconsin prints a two digit overflow number on your license .
As a result , the last two digits of your Wisconsin license number represent the number of people who had the same license number as you ( ignoring the last two digits ) , when you got your license .
Illinois may have overflow digits , but if they do the information is not on your driver 's license .
This means that if Joshua William Smith is wanted by police and his driver 's license number is flagged as such , Jack Wayne Snoddy may be briefly detained while the police check their records to sort out the shared number .
I have been told that Illinois state databases actually include a two or three digit number to distinguish between different people with the same license .
One correspondent told me that their friend was pulled over for a minor traffic violation and was arrested as someone else .
He sat in the police car for a while while they sorted it out .
He and the other person had the exact same number ; the other guy was a wanted man , but my correspondent 's friend did not .
Florida prints a single digit overflow number on your license .
As a result , the last digit of your Florida license number represent the number of people who had the same license number as you ( ignoring the last two digits ) , when you got your license .
Urban Legends about Florida 's Last Digit
There are number of urban legends about Florida driver 's license overflow numbers .
The legends claim that the number represents the number of times you 've been arrested for drunk driving ( DUI , DWI , etc ) , the number of times you 've convicted for drunk driving , the number of times you 've been convicted of a felony , that it encodes driving restrictions ( 0 means no restrictions , 1 means corrective eyewear is required ) , or that it encodes gender .
I do n't believe it .
First , why bother ?
Who needs to know this information ?
Not a cop arresting you ; they 'll arrest a drunk driver no matter what .
Prior convictions only matter when you 're in front of a judge , and the judge has access to the database .
Unless Florida does something particularly weird , driving restrictions are ( in most states ) clearly printed elsewhere , and the cop is going to run your license anyway and will learn any restrictions that way .
Second , as noted above : if you do n't have overflow digits , you 'll occasionally two people with the exact same driver 's license number .
Can you imagine what a mess that would be ?
Indeed , it 's a mess in Illinois , see above .
Third , Wisconsin uses the exact same system , and as a native of Wisconsin I am absolutely certain it is correct .
( Oddly , there are no urban legends about this in Wisconsin .
It appears to be a strictly Florida thing . )
Finally , I 've had people claim with absolute certainty all of the above .
They can't all be true .
My hypothesis matches Wisconsin 's behavior and solves an important problem , so I 'm sticking with it until I see better evidence for another hypothesis .
Now , it 's entirely possible that I 'm wrong .
If you 're sure that I am , and can point me to a reliable source to support an alternate theory , please let me know !

Mr. Papf's Perpetual Motion
by Richard Feynman
Es ist auch eine deutsche Version verfügbar .
We are in debt to Ralph Leighton who through his kind permission enabled us to make this text available to the net .
One time [ in 1966 ] some students came over to my house with one of those magazines about automobiles - Roadrunner , or something like that .
In it there was an article about a marvelous new engine which works on a new principle for getting power , and it 's really quite remarkable .
You do n't have to buy fuel for the car ; the fuel is injected into the cylinders when the engine is manufactured and lasts about six months .
Then you have to bring it back to have it recharged .
The engine is air - cooled and can make a car run 60 miles per hour on the freeway .
There was a picture of the engine and its inventor , Mr. Joseph Papf , who had come to the United States from Hungary .
He 's standing next to the engine , making measurements on it with a panel full of dials .
Various people had looked at the engine and made various remarks about it in the article .
Mr. Papf was going to demonstrate his engine in Los Angeles , and the students wanted me to go along with them to see it .
I told them nothing has enough power to go for six months like that , unless it 's a nuclear reactor , which it surely is not .
' Fakes are always coming out , ' I said , ' and the guy 's probably trying to get investors to invest in his engine . '
Then I told them some stories about perpetual motion machines , such as the one in a London museum which was in a glass case .
It had no wires connected to it , yet it turned around and around .
' You have to ask yourself , ' Where is the power supply ? '
I said .
In that case , it was some air coming up through a little tube installed in one of the wooden legs holding up the glass case .
The students talked me into going along with them to see the demonstration .
It vas held in a refrigerator company 's parking lot , an L - shaped area .
The engine was down at one end of the lot , while the people , about 30 or so , were at the bend of the L , some distance away .
Mr. Papf talked about how the motor worked , using vague and complicated phrases about radiation , atoms , different levels of energy , quanta , and this and that , all of which made no sense whatsoever , and would never work .
But the rest of what he said was important , for every fraud has to have the right characteristics : Mr. Papf explained that he had tried to sell his engine to the big automobile companies , but they would n't buy it because they were afraid it would put all the big oil companies out of business .
So there was obviously a conspiracy working against Mr. Papf 's marvelous new engine .
Then there was a reference to the magazine articles , and an announcement that in a few days the engine was going to be sent to the Stanford Research Laboratory for validation .
This proved , of course , that the engine was real .
There was also an invitation to prospective investors to get in on this great opportunity to make large amounts of money , because it was very powerful .
And there was a certain danger !
There were quite a few wires running from the engine down to where Mr. Papf and the spectators were standing , into a set of instruments used for measurement ; these included a variac , a variable transformer with a dial which could put out different voltages .
The instruments were , in turn , connected by a cord to an electrical outlet in the side of the building .
So it was pretty obvious where the power supply was .
The engine started to go around , and there was a bit of disappointment : the propeller of the fan went around quietly without the noise of an ordinary engine with powerful explosions in the cylinders , and everything - it looked very much like an electric motor .
Mr. Papf pulled the plug from the wall , and the fan propeller continued to turn .
' You see , this cord has nothing to do with the engine ; it 's only supplying power to the instruments , ' he said .
Well , that was easy .
He 's got a storage battery inside the engine .
' Do you mind if I hold the plug ? '
I asked ?
' Not at all , ' replied Mr. Papf , and he handed it to me .
It was n't very long before he asked me to give me back the plug .
' I 'd like to hold it a little longer , ' I said , figuring that if I stalled around enough , the damn thing would stop .
Pretty soon Mr. Papf was frantic , so I gave him back the plug and he plugged it back into the wall .
A few moments later there was a big explosion : A cone of silvery uniform stuff shot out and turned to smoke .
The ruined engine fell over on its side .
The man standing next to me said , ' I 've been hit ! '
I looked at him , the whole side of his arm was torn open , you could see all the muscle fibers , tendons - everything .
I helped him over to a chair to sit down .
The youngest student in the group knew what to do .
' Make a tourniquet out of a tie for that man ! ' he told me .
He gave orders to everybody , and began to give artificial respiration to another man who was lying on the ground .
It was really quite wonderful to see this young student take over with all those grown men around .
By the time the paramedics came , we realized that there were three men injured , the one lying on the ground most seriously : he had a hole in his chest ( so the artificial respiration was n't effective ) and he ultimately died .
The other two men survived .
We were all shaking .
I turned to the young man who had been so capable in coping with the unexpected tragedy .
' I do n't usually drink . '
I said , ' but let 's go over to a bar and have a drink to calm our nerves . '
We went into a bar and ordered a drink , I was surprised to discover that the young man who had been the most mature of all of us was underage - he could n't get a drink .
We started to talk about the engine .
One man , an investor who had brought an engineer with him to see the demonstration , said , ' My engineer advised me to stand mainly behind the corner of the building and just peer out during the demonstration , because these new engines are sometimes dangerous .
Somebody else pointed out that Mr. Papf had previously done some work with rockets , and the explosion looked like fuel when it goes off .
My idea was that had Mr. Papf sent his engine to the Stanford Research Institute as announced , the game would be up in a few days .
Therefore an explosion just big enough to destroy the engine would keep the game going a little longer ; it would show the tremendous power of the engine , and , most importantly , it would provide a reason for investors to put more money into the project , now the engine had to be rebuilt .
We all agreed that the explosion was much larger than Mr. Papf probably intended .
After such an explosion with the resulting fatality and injuries , there was , of course , a lawsuit .
Mr. Papf sued me for ruining his engine , charging that my stalling around with the cord caused him to lose control of it .
Caltech has a legal department to protect its errant professors , so they talked to me .
I told them I thought he did n't have much of a case : he would have to prove how the engine worked , and he'd have to demonstrate that in fact , taking the cord off caused the explosion .
The case was settled out of court , and Mr. Papf was paid something .
I guess there 's a certain amount of wisdom in not going to court , even when you 're right , but I cost Caltech a certain amount of money by going to that demonstration .
I still think I correctly diagnosed what was happening with a reasonable probability .
And , of course , nothing has been heard of Mr. Papf 's new engine since .

Last update : 23 October 1997
A few days back , I was having a discussion with a few developers about the path to becoming an independent software vendor ( ISV ) .
Ultimately , there ’s a major difference between doing software development as a hobby and working for an ISV as your full - time job .
Quentin smartly dubbed this the Full - Time Gap .
The seminal blog post ( if such a thing can exist ) on bridging the Full - Time Gap is Gus Mueller ’s “ 1068 days ” , which I discovered we never linked to ( and shame on us ) .
If you have n’t read it , the time is now , whether you ’re a developer or just a user .
In brief , Gus began Flying Meat as a side - project while at his full - time job .
After almost three years of sales growth and saving money , he was finally ready to quit his job and work for himself .
Gus ’ path to independence is a great lesson for others , but it ’s certainly not the only way to become an full - time software developer .
After reading Gus ’ post , I decided it might be helpful to post our own experience with crossing the gap .
I also talked Daniel Jalkut , of Red Sweater Software , into chronicling his own journey .
Prologue
Before starting Rogue Amoeba Alex , Quentin , and I worked together in a professional capacity at several companies , on a string of MP3 players .
In fact , the genesis for Audio Hijack was in a little - known plugin for MacAmp and MacAmp Lite X .
When we could n’t get approval from our previous corporate overlords to release Audio Hijack , we left to form a new company – Rogue Amoeba .
Alright , Professional – Absolutely No Ties Though !
From the beginning , we attempted to work very professionally ( as professional as you can be with a name like “ Rogue Amoeba ” , anyhow ) on Audio Hijack .
For us that meant having a complete website , comprehensive documentation , and fast , responsive support .
With three founders , we were able to divide work and take care of many tasks .
For us , Rogue Amoeba was never a hobby or a side project .
Instead , from day one , we built it as a full - fledged company .
We worked on Rogue Amoeba seven days a week , answering support rapidly and updating the software often .
Lesson :
If you want to be a professional , act like one .
However , while we were working on Rogue Amoeba as much as 50 hours a week , we were n’t yet “ independent ” .
Alex was still working a full - time job , while Quentin and I were studying full - time at the University of Maryland and Tufts University , respectively .
With three people , a bare minimum of $ 75,000 in profit was needed yearly in order to be able to consider working solely for Rogue Amoeba , and Audio Hijack was n’t there .
A hobbyist product , perhaps updated infrequently or poorly supported , might make as little as a few hundred dollars a year .
A few thousand dollars in a year is a nice take , which is great for beer money .
Many developers get here and stop , and that ’s just fine – not every developer needs to be an ISV .
Lesson : Acting professional does n’t make you one .
However , a business needs to earn enough to support itself .
At $ 16 ( that ’s 24 ) a pop , Audio Hijack would need to sell about 4700 copies a year to hit that $ 75,000 “ floor ” .
That ’s approximately 13 copies a day , every day , 7 days a week , 365 days a year – no small feat .
In addition to increasing sales , we really needed to earn more profit per sale .
Lesson : Pricing is important , and under - pricing could sink you before you get started1 .
At the end of 2002 , Rogue Amoeba had released 3 updates to Audio Hijack and seen revenues grow , but we did n’t have a reliable level of sales .
Our story could have largely ended there , with Audio Hijack being updated a few times , never gaining much in the way of fame .
But as you know ( or can safely assume ) , that ’s not what happened .
We Think We Can , We Think We Can …
For the record books , Audio Hijack Pro started life as version 2 of Audio Hijack .
While we were developing it , we realized we ’d added and changed so much that we had a whole new product on our hands .
Ultimately , this was released as Audio Hijack Pro , for $ 32 ( that ’s right , 25 ) .
This is really what allowed Rogue Amoeba to take off .
The day Audio Hijack Pro ( 03-03-03 , forever imprinted on our brains ) was released , sales rose 1400 % over the previous day .
Even without dollar figures that should sound impressive and indeed it was a big day for us .
We ’d never seen anything like it .
Sales came down of course , but in the second five months of Rogue Amoeba we averaged almost three times the average sales per day of the first five months .
Lesson : “ Instant success ” is never instant – keep working .
After Audio Hijack
Pro , we were making enough to consider going full time – heady stuff !
However , this was n’t a no - brainer by any means .
There was still plenty of risk – would sales continue ?
Could we really handle this ?
What about school ?
Rogue Amoeba Bridges The Gap
Ultimately , the answers to the above proved to be “ Yes ” , “ Yes ” , and “ What about it ? ” .
Alex left his job , and Quentin left school following the release of Audio Hijack Pro. Perhaps foolishly , I decided to work to finish school a year early2 .
We ’ve been working full - time and solely for Rogue Amoeba for 2 - 3 years now , and it ’s been fantastic .
I think the most important part of our particular journey was starting out from day one acting professionally .
We were n’t big when we started , but we continued to work and develop our software until we got big .
When we reached that point , one by one we moved across the bridge to full - time .
Many Paths To Skin A Cat
I ’d imagine starting a company yourself while working full - time would be quite difficult , as a lack of motivation and time to work are definitely going to be obstacles .
Scarier still is the idea of quitting a full - time job and living off savings until sales ramp up , as the brave folks at Potion Factory have done .
For Rogue Amoeba , college provided an incubator that was invaluable .
While we were getting started , Alex had the security of another job while Quentin and I had the safety net college provided .
That luxury was something we used to our strong advantage , taking a risk on an unproven concept and ultimately joining the ranks of many great Mac ISVs .
There are many ways to amortize risk , and I ’m eager to hear about the experiences of others .
If you ’re working full - time as an ISV , post about your experience !
With any luck , our tale and those of others like Gus and Daniel will encourage another generation of Mac developers .
There are lots of ways across the Full - Time Gap .
The most important thing is to decide that you want to cross it , and then get started building your bridge .
Endnotes
1 Pricing requires its own article , or possibly an entire book .
The simple conclusion we ’ve reached is that anything under $ 20 is probably too cheap for a business .
Back
In the old days in The United States of America , a journalist did n't have to get permission to conduct an interview in a public place .
But this is a new America , a place where armed security agents watch your every move and require their permission to exercise what used to be a first amendment right .
I 've been a television news reporter for 33 years .
I first began covering news when Richard Nixon was about to resign .
I 've gone to airports many times to film - yes we used to use film - and lately to video - tape and interview famous and infamous people getting on and getting off airplanes .
I 've been around a while and I 've covered a lot of stories at airports .
Things have changed .
I want to tell you what happened to me today ( May 17 , 2007 ) at Honolulu International Airport .
I was assigned to meet and interview Nainoa Thompson , navigator of the Polynesian Voyaging Canoe Hokule'a .
He and his crew were departing for Japan to sail their Hawaiian canoe on the final leg of an historic voyage .
It was arranged for our crew to meet them on the sidewalk outside the check - in area .
All I needed was a quick couple of sound bites with Nainoa and two of the young crew members who were leaving to fulfill a cultural mission of goodwill and Aloha .
I arrived with a news photographer at the Honolulu Airport and we paid to park in the parking garage .
We walked to the public sidewalk in front of the check - in area where we met Nainoa and the young crewmembers .
We turned on the camera and began talking with them .
This is something I have done at least a hundred times over the past 33 years .
In the USA a reporter used to be able to go to any public place and interview someone without being rousted by authorities .
This was not a restricted area .
We did not attempt to board an airplane , or walk past the security gate , or get out on to a runway .
We were not taping near any TSA checkpoint .
We were out on the sidewalk at a public facility .
While I was interviewing an 18 - year old Hawaiian , asking how he felt about taking a voyage on a Hawaiian canoe several uniformed security agents walked up and stopped the interview .
They insisted that we cease videotaping .
They demanded to know what we were doing , who authorized us to be there , and whether we had permission .
EXCUSE ME ???
In the United States of America that I grew up in a reporter was allowed to interview anyone in any public place , about anything , at any time , without requesting or having to be granted permission by unformed goons .
Pardon me - I mean low wage security guards .
I snapped , and perhaps I should apologize to these poor rent - a - cops .
I did not say it to their faces , but as I turned to go to the airport security office I did mutter an obscenity : " This is the f&#^ing United States .
You do n't need permission to do an interview in a public place .
This is not supposed to be a goddamned fascist state ! "
They heard me .
Now I was asking for trouble .
They called for backups .
Several more armed security guards surrounded my cameraman .
He told them , " It 's not big deal ; we 're just trying to interview some people about sailing on the Hokule'a . "
I went to the security office and got " permission " from airport authorities to do something that is supposed to be guaranteed under our ( former ) Constitution .
It saddens me to see America slipping into a state that allows armed security guards to demand " authorization " for something that used to be taken for granted .
I never before had to get " permission " from " authorities " to talk to someone in a public place .
I brought this up in the security office when they were so graciously " granting " me permission to resume my interview .
A security guard in front of a bank of television surveillance monitors told me , " Things are different after 911 . "
I wonder - what does a well known television reporter interviewing young Hawaiian kids in a public place about sailing on a canoe have to do with 911 ?
How is this a threat ?
And the saddest thing for me is this - young people growing up today will simply submit .
They wo n't even remember a time when a reporter - or any citizen - could go to an airport and talk to someone without having to get permission from authorities .

If you were in a car accident and are working with an attorney , you may qualify for a car accident loan .
Car accident loans are also referred to as a car accident cash advance .
If you lose your case , you do n’t repay anything .
That is why car accident loans are not actually loans , they are an advance against your potential car accident settlement .
Car accidents have a tremendous impact on your life and finances .
You will often have to wait over 24 months before collecting a potential settlement .
And if you ’re unable to work , bills can begin to pile up .
Car accident loans can help car accident victims avoid pressure to settled their case .
You do n’t need to accept a low ball offer from your insurance company or get behind on your bills with a car accident cash advance .
When YouTube CEO Chad Hurley told a Congressional committee that his company " advances democracy , " perhaps this was the sort of thing he had in mind .
An opposition Venezuelan television station whose broadcast license has not been renewed by the government is now turning to YouTube to get its message out after its transmitter was taken over by a state - run channel .
Hugo Chavez 's " Bolivarian Revolution " has no time for media groups that criticize his government ; Radio Caracas Televisión ( RCTV ) is now off the air , and another channel , Globovision , could be next , according to CNN .
RCTV journalists and producers have not been arrested or stopped from working , but their main link to the public has been removed .
Rather than giving up , the station has turned to YouTube , where it now has its own channel for the show El Observador .
A Colombian channel is also broadcasting RCTV content into Venezuela .
El Observador clips have been seen 175,000 times since May 28 , and the channel is currently the most - subscribed channel of the week .
While putting the station 's shows on YouTube is an excellent idea , YouTube still lacks anything near the reach of over - the - air broadcasts .
But the use of the site to avoid censorship is growing , and it's not hard to imagine a day in the near future when the site ( or sites like it ) becomes as essential as local TV stations .
As that happens , YouTube will come into even more conflicts with governments that have an interest in controlling what their citizens see , It 's already happening — Thailand 's king , for instance , has a thing for iPods but is n't too keen on YouTube .
Will Hugo Chavez show more tolerance ?
Update :
Some readers are concerned that Chavez is getting a bad rap here ; RCTV has been accused of supported the earlier coup against him and of calling for the overthrow of the current government .
It 's a complicated situation , but the fact remains that RCTV was a main opposition outlet and that its replacement is a state - run channel .
Given Chavez 's long history of attacks on the press and his current ability to rule by decree , he does n't look like a man interested in a robust and critical press , though he has not instituted mass arrests or official censorship of journalists .
Chavez 's concern for government stability and threats against the state are a recent development , too ; Chavez participated in a coup attempt of his own back in 1992 .

post # 303 — February 6 , 2007 — a Client Relations post
I received two emails at opposite ends of an important spectrum yesterday .
The first , from Bill Paul , Author ( Ex - Wall Street Journal and CNBC energy reporter ) read , in part :
As a former Wall Street Journal staff reporter , I ’m not big on self - promotion , but I thought you might be interested in knowing about a new book just published by Wiley about the future of energy .
. .
Title is : Future Energy : How the New Oil Industry Will Change People , Politics and Portfolios .
Sorry again about the self - promotion .
The second email was from Keith Ferrazzi , the author of the best - selling Never Eat Lunch Alone , one of the most successful recent guides to networking and self - promotion .
Here ’s ( part of ) Keith ’s email :
I really wanted to maximize the opportunity for readers to actually start using the advice ( in LifeCoachTool 1.0 ) in their own lives , I also had my team put together a simple online quiz / survey / tool that does n’t cost anything and only takes a couple minutes to complete .
If you visit this link You can :
Watch a brief video of me explaining what it is Try it for yourself Even enter a contest we ’re running that rewards you for helping make others more successful â€ ” prizes include personalized coaching calls with me , signed books , and DVDs .
Should be fun .
What struck me about these two emails is not just the extra thought and investment that has gone into promoting Ferrazziâ€™s new venture , but ( no surprise here ) his utter self - confidence in putting himself forward .
By way of contrast , Bill Paul , ( in common with many people including myself , ) actually feels so bad about letting me know about his new book that he apologizes – twice — for doing nothing more than politely informing me of the availability of something I might be interested in .
But hereâ€™s the interesting thing .
While itâ€™s clear that Ferrazziâ€™s approach is going to get more response , Iâ€™m not sure I could do it on behalf of myself .
Like Bill Paul , there is something in me that holds me back from the more explicit forms of self - promotion .
Like many other professionals , Iâ€™m comfortable with showing my material and saying â€ œLet the work speak for itselfâ€  but Iâ€™ve been around long enough to know that more than that is required .
Iâ€™m just not comfortable doing it .
Those who are in marketing often laugh at the people who donâ€™t want to â€œget out and network , â€  but the reluctance to self - promote is something many of us were brought up with .
We can read and be impressed by Ferrazziâ€™s book about networking , but find it hard to do personally .
( Maybe thatâ€™s why we try to hire other people as our marketers for doing it for us — which rarely works out too well . )
These are the things I am reflecting on :
Update The Register is pleasantly surprised to learn that humanity continues to muddle along after a leading Islamic scholar predicted its abrupt destruction on 22 August .
Academician Bernard Lewis , a specialist in Middle - Eastern culture and politics , and one of Dick Cheney 's favorite thinkers , appeared to have it all worked out in an op - ed piece published by the Wall Street Journal .
After a careful reading of scripture , and a bit of arithmetic , Lewis was able to determine the ideal day for Iran to nuke Israel , initiating the atomic Armageddon that we 've all been worrying about .
Iran was expected to ignite World War III on the anniversary of the prophet Muhammad 's journey to Heaven , which this year fell on 22 August .
Oddly , the Iranians seem to have had other things on their minds , and marked the occasion with an overture toward negotiating with the West over their controversial nuclear weapons research and development program .
Of course , it 's entirely possible that the professor misplaced a decimal point somewhere along the way , and that the Apocalypse is still being arranged for some equally important but perhaps less pleasant occasion in the Islamic calendar .
The predictions business can be tricky , as everyone knows ( The Simpsons ' episode " Thank God It 's Doomsday " illustrates this nicely , as Homer needs two attempts at calculating the end of the world ) .
We will of course continue to bring our readers all breaking news regarding the end of civilisation .
We regret to remind those who bought Gulfstreams , Lamborghinis , etc. , on the strength of Professor Lewis 's prior prediction , that they 're liable for payments until the debt is satisfied or Armageddon commences , whichever comes first . ®
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A drug - resistant type of “ superbug ” bacteria called MRSA is more than eight times as common as believed in U.S. hospitals , putting patients at risk and posing a big hygiene problem , experts said on Tuesday .

A drug - resistant type of " superbug " bacteria called MRSA is more than eight times as common as believed in U.S. hospitals , putting patients at risk and posing a big hygiene problem , experts said on Tuesday .
REUTERS / Lee Celano
They found that nearly 5 percent of patients -- 46 out of every 1,000 -- were infected or colonized with methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus or MRSA for short .
The one - day “ snapshot ” look at infection suggests that 1.2 million U.S. hospital patients may be infected each year , the survey by the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology or APIC found .
Most of the infections have clearly originated in the hospitals and do not , contrary to popular belief , affect mostly intensive care patients , the experts said .
“ This rate is between 8 and 11 times greater than previous MRSA estimates ( which were more limited in scope and used different methodologies ) , ” the group said in its report .
And 67 percent of the affected patients were being treated for general medical conditions such as diabetes and pulmonary and cardiac problems .
The survey of 1,200 health care facilities in all 50 states found close to 8,000 patients infected with MRSA , or colonized by the bug , meaning they had it somewhere in or on their bodies but did not have symptoms .
APIC recommends that hospitals and clinics take simple actions to prevent the spread of the bacteria , which has more than double the fatality rate of ordinary staph infections .
Number one priority is washing hands .
“ Hand hygiene is the most important means of preventing the spread of infection , ” said APIC president Denise Murphy , who is also a safety officer at Barnes - Jewish Hospital in St. Louis .
But many studies have shown it is difficult to persuade health care workers to do this consistently .
Jarvis said it would be too difficult to test each and every health care worker , but it is simpler to identify which patients are the likeliest to be carriers of MRSA and institute tight procedures around them .
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that in 1974 , only 2 percent of staph infections in hospitals and other health care settings were MRSA ; by 2004 , nearly 63 percent were .
The activist group Consumers Union said hospitals must do more .
“ It ’s time for hospitals to aggressively step up their efforts to protect patients from these preventable infections , ” said Lisa McGiffert , director of Consumers Union ’s Stop Hospital Infections Campaign .
I ’ve been one of the doomsayers regarding America ’s economy , with the impending collapse of the subprime lending market ( which I think will create a nasty recession ) .
As with any economic downturn , the government and the media will be looking for someone to blame .
Ron Paul suggests that we place our sights directly on the Fed .
When the bubble finally bursts completely , millions of Americans will be looking for someone to blame .
Look for Congress to hold hearings into subprime lending practices and â€œpredatoryâ€ mortgages .
Weâ€™ll hear a lot of grandstanding about how unscrupulous lenders took advantage of poor people [ ed : Chris Dodd is already doing it ] , and how rampant speculation caused real estate markets around the country to overheat .
It will be reminiscent of the Enron hearings , and the message will be explicitly or implicitly the same : free - market capitalism , left unchecked , leads to greed , fraud , and unethical if not illegal business practices .
But capitalism is not to blame for the housing bubble , the Federal Reserve is .
Specifically , Fed intervention in the economy – through the manipulation of interest rates and the creation of money– caused the artificial boom in mortgage lending .
The Fed has roughly tripled the amount of dollars and credit in circulation just since 1990 .
Housing prices have risen dramatically not because of simple supply and demand , but because the Fed literally created demand by making the cost of borrowing money artificially cheap .
When credit is cheap , individuals tend to borrow too much and spend recklessly .
…
Unless and until we get the Federal Reserve out of the business of creating money at will and setting interest rates , we will remain vulnerable to market bubbles and painful corrections .
If housing prices plummet and millions of Americans find themselves owing more than their homes are worth , the blame lies squarely with Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke .
Paul also points out the use of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to offload risk ( which many investors consider to be implicitly guaranteed by the US Government ) .
He does n’t mention the use of derivatives to slice - and - dice the risk and further offload it onto the market , but his point still stands .
The Federal Reserve has flooded the market with money , and that money has been chasing returns .
Housing has been the “ hot ” asset class , creating an unsustainable bubble .
When that bursts , it will be a lot worse than the tech stock bubble , because it actually hits people right at home .
Much debate on this blog has gone on ( and will again soon with the Point / Counterpoint feature ) regarding the Federal Reserve and the money supply .
Whether you believe in a backed currency or not , it is generally assumed that the quantity of money in a economy should be based on the productive ability of that country .
If the money supply has tripled since 1990 , I think this is far in excess of any productivity growth we ’ve seen since then .
Thus , we have inflation .
You flood the market with money , and you see what happens .
The rich , who have the ability to move money around chasing these asset classes , get richer .
They buy second homes or investment properties to ride the appreciation wave , increasing demand .
The poor and middle class , who are just trying to get ahead , struggle to keep their incomes constant or rising relative to the cost of goods .
And when housing becomes the asset class bubble , they get priced out of homes and lenders must resort to “ creative ” financing to allow them to buy .
Then , when the returns on investment start drying up , the demand of speculators and investors dries up , and home prices collapse .
The bubble is bursting .
The particular nature of the housing market , as a relatively illiquid asset , is making this occur more slowly than a stock bubble would occur .
But it ’s occurring nonetheless .
Blame can be spread around , of course , especially to some of those subprime borrowers who purchased homes they cannot afford .
But Ron Paul is right , it is clear that the Fed ’s loose money policy created this bubble , and they deserve a great deal of blame when it bursts .

The fire engulfed two carriages on the Samjhauta ( Friendship ) Express
Passengers said they heard two blasts as the train passed near Panipat , about 80 km ( 50 miles ) north of Delhi .
A fire then swept through two carriages .
The train is part of the " Friendship Express " service that takes passengers from Delhi to Lahore in Pakistan .
Indian and Pakistani leaders denounced the attack as an act of terrorism aimed at disrupting their peace process .
The blasts happened a day before Pakistan 's foreign minister was due in Delhi for talks with Indian leaders .
The minister , Khurshid Kasuri , said the explosion was a " horrendous act of terrorism " but it would not change his plans to visit India from 20 - 23 February .
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf called for a full investigation by the Indian authorities but said the attack would not undermine peace efforts between the two nations .
" Such wanton acts of terrorism will only serve to further strengthen our resolve to attain the mutually desire objective of sustainable peace between the two countries , " the president said in a statement .
Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh , expressing " anguish and grief " at the loss of life , vowed that the culprits would be caught .

The reaction from both governments suggests the prime suspects might be groups such as Lashkar - e - Toiba and Jaish - e - Mohammad , the main Islamic militant groups who have been blamed for many high - profile bombings , says the BBC's Jill McGivering .
Recent attacks on Delhi , Mumbai and Varanasi , for example , seemed designed to damage India 's image abroad and stoke anti-Pakistan feeling inside India .
But the fact that so many of the dead on the train were Pakistani Muslims may indicate that the devices were intended for a different target , or exploded prematurely , she says .
The twice - weekly service from the Indian capital to Lahore was restarted in 2004 after a two - year gap as part of the peace process between the two countries .
More than 500 people were believed to have been on the train , the majority of them Pakistanis .
' Suffocated to death '
Two carriages were shaken by blasts at about midnight ( 1830 GMT Sunday ) as the train was passing through the station in the village of Deewana in Haryana state .
It shuddered to a halt and a ball of fire then engulfed the two coaches .
SAMJHAUTA EXPRESS
Service restarted in January 2004 Connects Delhi and Lahore , via Atari Runs twice a week One of a series of measures easing travel restrictions
Witnesses said they saw people screaming and struggling to get out .
The injured were pulled out of the burning carriages onto the trackside by fellow passengers , and local residents rushed to help .
" I heard a loud explosion and then it was all smoke , " passenger Tara Chand was quoted by Reuters news agency as saying .
" Looking at the intensity of the smoke , many people must have suffocated to death before being charred . "
The BBC's Soutik Biswas , reporting from the scene , said the heat of the flames had peeled the blue paint off the coaches , and oil and cinders covered the tracks .
He went into one of the carriages and saw boxes of food and spices that many of the passengers would have been taking as gifts to friends and relatives in Pakistan .
Shiv Ram , a police railway constable , was one of the first officials on the scene .
" The coaches were totally engulfed in flames .
I brought out three charred women - I could only recognise them as women because they were wearing bangles , " he said .
Police said they had found explosive devices at the scene .
Beyond recognition
The burnt - out carriages were moved to a railway siding a couple of kilometres away for forensic examination .
Anxious families gathered at Delhi 's main rail station for information
The rest of the train continued on its journey to the border station of Attari where passengers switched to another train to travel on to Lahore .
Most of the bodies were charred beyond recognition and the mortuary at the local hospital in Panipat is overflowing .
Mohammad Saif , from Delhi , went to the site and the local hospital in search of his aunt and niece , who been visiting him from Pakistan .
" I saw them off at the Delhi railway station last night about 9 pm .
There was no security , no checking , nothing at the station .
I 've been looking for them , ca n't trace them , " he told the BBC .
Anxious families rushed to the main railway station in Delhi where there was a handwritten list of some of the people known to have been injured .
The Indian High Commission in Islamabad said arrangements were being made to process visas immediately for Pakistanis who had relatives on the train and wished to go to India , Reuters reported .
Standardistas adore the Mozilla Firefox browser for its advanced support of web standards .
( How good is it ?
The Web Standards Project considered declaring victory and closing shop when Netscape Corp. announced in 1999 that it would heed our advice and dump its non-compliant software in favor of the Gecko rendering engine that powers Firefox today . )
Though Firefox and related Mozilla browsers deserve credit for their unsurpassed handling of everything from the Document Object Model to MIME types , Firefox ’s way with text leaves much to be desired , as the following screen shots show .
Indeed , if reading is mostly what you do on the web , and if accurate typography makes reading more of a pleasure and less of a strain , then Apple ’s Safari is superior to Firefox .
Lucida , Test One : with genuine italics
Zeldman.com is designed to be read in Lucida Grande , and the site originally listed “ Lucida Grande ” first in its style sheet .
Alas , Lucida Grande lacks true italics .
Fortunately , Lucida Sans has them .
In a version of our style sheets used to capture the following screen shots , we ’ve listed Lucida Sans first , Lucida Grande second , and substitutes thereafter .
Both browers handle the site like a dream — but it is only a good dream in Safari .
Open the screen shots in tabs :
Questions for discussion
In Firefox , why does the text “ now in its second edition .
I can ’t ” display midway between roman and bold , and why is it so poorly antialiased ?
Apparently , Firefox bungles roman text that follows italics .
In Firefox , why does n’t hyphenation work ?
My gosh , people , it ’s nearly 2007 .
IE5 / Mac supported hyphenation .
Lucida , Test Two : using a font that lacks italics
Remember : Lucida Grande does not have italics ; Lucida Sans does .
But as Test One showed , Firefox ca n’t handle Lucida Sans correctly .
So we ’ve revised the style sheet .
With Lucida Grande listed first in the style sheet , and Lucida Sans deleted , Safari still trounces Firefox .
The experience of reading text is smoothly beautiful in Safari , much less so in Firefox .
Observations
Both browsers fake the italics .
But Firefox does the job crudely : a child could tell that its “ italics ” are faked .
( Firefox slants the roman text . )
By contrast , Safari fakes its italics so well ( by substituting a true italic from the next available listed font that contains one ) that only graphic designers and type hounds will realize that the font they ’re viewing contains no true italics .
See reader comments for delicious details .
In Firefox , hyphenation still does not work .
Notes
It ’s worth pointing out that these tests were done on Macintosh computers , which are known for their superior handling of text , and that Lucida is not some strange face chosen to prove a point .
It is the default font in Mac OS X ( not to mention on apple.com ) .
Moreover , Lucida Sans Unicode , the first Unicode encoded font , shipped with Windows NT 3.1 and comes standard with all Microsoft Windows versions since Windows 98 .
When I showed a friend and fellow designer these simple tests as I was working on them , he asked if I had reported “ the bug ” to the makers of Mozilla .
But as I count it , there are multiple , overlapping Firefox bugs happening here — too many to fit into a bug - report form .
I suspect that the problems have to do with Mozilla ’s reliance on its cross-platform display environment .
If you scuttle what an individual operating system does well in favor of what a cross - platform environment does poorly , you get what we ’re seeing here .
It ’s not good enough .
Inferences for best practices
If your content will sometimes include italicized text , you naturally want to specify a font that contains italics .
That ’s just common sense .
Unfortunately , as our screen shots have shown , common sense works against you here , because Firefox , although superior to other browsers in many ways , handles text like a drunken fry - cook .
When you specify the font that contains genuine italics ( as we did in Test One ) , Firefox mishandles the roman text that abuts italicized words .
When you replace that font with one that contains no italic ( Test Two ) , Firefox fakes the italics crudely , but overall display and legibility are better than the unusable results of Test One .
Obviously there are fewer problems if you limit your website to Verdana and Georgia , but more constraints on typography are not what the web needs .
Discussion is now closed .

A man who posed as a police officer in Suffolk County and NYC has been indicted on 54 counts , from first - degree rape to fraud .
Twenty - four year - old Terry Henry was held without bail , and one law enforcement source called him a " serial killer in the making . "
Henry was initially arrested for impersonating a police officer and stealing his landlord 's car earlier this year , but investigators found that he used realistic police gear and a car with lights and sirens to intimidate many more people .
He allegedly pretended to investigate a robbery and then raped a woman , coerced teen age boys he met in Greenwich Village to be his " sex slaves , " and conned a former NYC bus driver out of $ 120,000 by claiming the bus driver was victim of a " Freemason identity theft scam . "
Henry is also accused torturing a number of animals ; Newsday reports that he " captured and torched his neighbor 's cat " and offered to help the neighbor find the culprit because he was a " cop . "
Henry 's lawyer says his client " steadfastly maintains his innocence and is anxious to defend himself in court . "
But the Suffolk County DA believes there may be more victims out there and asks them to contact the office .
The Brilliantly Profitable Timing of the Alaska Oil Pipeline Shutdown
For The Guardian ( UK )
Is the Alaska Pipeline corroded ?
You bet it is .
Has been for more than a decade .
Did British Petroleum shut the pipe yesterday to turn a quick buck on its negligence , to profit off the disaster it created ?
Just ask the “ smart pig . ”
Years ago , I had the unhappy job of leading an investigation of British Petroleum 's management of the Alaska pipeline system .
I was working for the Chugach villages , the Alaskan Natives who own the shoreline slimed by the 1989 Exxon Valdez tanker grounding .
Even then , courageous government inspectors and pipeline workers were screaming about corrosion all through the pipeline .
I say “ courageous ” because BP , which owns 46 % of the pipe and is supposed to manage the system , had a habit of hunting down and destroying the careers of those who warn of pipeline problems .
In one case , BP 's CEO of Alaskan operations hired a former CIA expert to break into the home of a whistleblower , Chuck Hamel , who had complained of conditions at the pipe 's tanker facility .
BP tapped his phone calls with a US congressman and ran a surveillance and smear campaign against him .
When caught , a US federal judge said BP 's acts were “ reminiscent of Nazi Germany . ”
This was not an isolated case .
Captain James
Woodle , once in charge of the pipe 's Valdez terminus , was blackmailed into resigning the post when he complained of disastrous conditions there .
The weapon used on Woodle was a file of faked evidence of marital infidelity .
Nice guys , eh ?
Now let 's talk timing .
BP 's suddenly discovered corrosion necessitating an emergency shut - down of the line is the same corrosion Dan Lawn has been screaming about for 15 years .
Lawn is a steel - eyed government inspector who has kept his job only because his union 's lawyers have kept BP from having his head .
Indeed , it 's pretty darn hard for BP to claim it is surprised to find corrosion this week when Lawn issued a damning report on corrosion right after a leak and spill were discovered on March 2 of this year .
Why shut the pipe now ?
The timing of a sudden inspection and fix of a decade - long problem has a suspicious smell .
A precipitous shutdown in mid-summer , in the middle of Middle East war(s ) , is guaranteed to raise prices and reap monster profits for BP .
The price of crude jumped $ 2.22 a barrel on the shutdown news to over $ 76 .
How lucky for BP which sells four million barrels of oil a day .
Had BP completed its inspection and repairs a couple years back — say , after Dan Lawn 's tenth warning — the oil market would have hardly noticed .
But $ 2 a barrel is just the beginning of BP 's shut - down bonus .
The Alaskan oil was destined for the California market which now faces a supply crisis at the very height of the summer travel season .
The big winner is ARCO petroleum , the largest retailer in the Golden State .
ARCO is a 100 % - owned subsidiary of … British Petroleum .
BP could have fixed the pipeline problem this past winter , after their latest corrosion - caused oil spill .
But then ARCO would have lost the summertime supply - squeeze windfall .
Enron Corporation was infamous for deliberately timing repairs to maximize profit .
Would BP also manipulate the market in such a crude manner ?
Some US prosecutors think they did so in the US propane market .
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) just six weeks ago charged the company with approving an Enron - style scheme to crank up the price of propane sold in poor rural communities in the US .
One former BP exec has pleaded guilty .
Lord Browne , the imperious CEO of BP , has apologized for that scam , for the Alaska spill , for this week 's shutdown and for the deaths in 2005 of 15 workers at the company 's mortally sloppy refinery operation at Texas City , Texas .
I do n't want readers to think BP is n't civic - minded .
The company 's US CEO , Bob Malone , was Co-Chairman of the Bush re-election campaign in Alaska .
Mr. Bush , in turn , was so impressed with BP 's care of Alaska 's environment that he pushed again to open the state 's arctic wildlife refuge ( ANWR ) to drilling by the BP consortium .
Indeed , you can go to Alaska today and see for yourself the evidence of BP 's care of the wilderness .
You can smell it : the crude oil still on the beaches from the Exxon Valdez spill .
Exxon took all the blame for the spill because they were dumb enough to have the company 's name on the ship .
But it was BP 's pipeline managers who filed reports that oil spill containment equipment was sitting right at the site of the grounding near Bligh Island .
However , the reports were bogus , the equipment was n't there and so the beaches were poisoned .
At the time , our investigators uncovered four - volume 's worth of faked safety reports and concluded that BP was at least as culpable as Exxon for the 1,200 miles of oil - destroyed coastline .
Nevertheless , m'Lord Browne preens himself with his corporation 's environmental record .
We know BP cares about nature because they have lots of photos of solar panels in their annual reports — and they 've painted every one of their gas stations green .
The green paint - job is supposed to represent the oil giant 's love of Mother Nature .
But the good Lord , Mr. Browne , knows it stands for the color of the Yankee dollar .
BP claims the profitable timing of its Alaska pipe shutdown can be explained because they 've only now run a “ smart pig ” through the pipes to locate the corrosion .
The “ pig ” is an electronic drone that BP should have been using continuously , though they had not done so for 14 years .
The fact that , in the middle of an oil crisis , they 've run it through now , forcing the shutdown , reminds me , when I consider Lord Browne 's closeness to George Bush , that the company 's pig is indeed , very , very smart .

If there is a mathematician eagerly waiting for the Large Hadron Collider near Geneva to start up next year , it is Alain Connes of the Collge de France in Paris .
Like many physicists , Connes hopes that the Higgs particle will show up in detectors .
The Higgs is the still missing crowning piece of the so - called Standard Model -- the theoretical framework that describes subatomic particles and their interactions .
For Connes , the discovery of the Higgs , which supposedly endows the other particles with mass , is crucial : its existence , and even its mass , emerges from the arcane equations of a new form of mathematics called noncommutative geometry , of which he is the chief inventor .
Connes 's idea was to extend the relation between geometric space and its commutative algebra of Cartesian coordinates , such as latitude and longitude , to a geometry based on noncommutative algebras .
In commutative algebra , the product is independent of the order of the factors : 3 x 5 = 5 x 3 .
But some operations are noncommutative .
Take , for example , a stunt plane that can aggressively roll ( rotate over the longitudinal axis ) and pitch ( rotate over an axis parallel to the wings ) .
Assume a pilot receives radio instructions to roll over 90 degrees and then to pitch over 90 degrees toward the underside of the plane .
Everything will be fine if the pilot follows the commands in that order .
But if the order is inverted , the plane will take a nosedive .
Operations with Cartesian coordinates in space are commutative , but rotations over three dimensions are not .
To gain a clearer vision of what goes on in nature , physicists sometimes resort to " phase space . "
Such a space is an alternative to Cartesian coordinates -- a researcher can plot the position of an electron against its momentum , rather than simply its x and y locations .
Because of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle , one cannot measure both quantities simultaneously .
As a consequence , position times momentum does not equal momentum times position .
Hence , the quantum phase space is noncommutative .
Moreover , introducing such noncommutativity into an ordinary space -- say , by making the x and the y coordinates noncommutative -- produces a space that has noncommutative geometry .
Through such analyses , Connes discovered the peculiar properties of his new geometry , properties that corresponded to the principles of quantum theory .
He has spent three decades refining his thinking , and even though he laid down the basics in a 1994 book , researchers beat a path to listen to him .
On a day plagued by typical March showers and wind , about 60 of the crme de la crme of French mathematicians fill Salle 5 at the Collge de France .
Like a caged lion , the 59 - year - old Connes walks quickly back and forth between two overhead projectors , talking rapidly , continually replacing transparencies filled with equations .
Outside , police sirens scream amid student protestors trying to occupy the Sorbonne next door in response to the French government 's proposed new employment law .
Connes seems oblivious to the commotion -- even afterward , while crossing the rue Saint - Jacques past blue police vans and officers in riot gear , he keeps talking about how his research has led him to new insights into physics .
As an example , Connes refers to the way particle physics has grown :
The concept of spacetime was derived from electrodynamics , but electrodynamics is only a small part of the Standard Model .
New particles were added when required , and confirmation came when these predicted particles emerged in accelerators .
But the spacetime used in general relativity , also based on electrodynamics , was left unchanged .
Connes proposed something quite different : " Instead of having new particles , we have a geometry that is more subtle , and the refinements of this geometry generate these new particles . "
In fact , he succeeded in creating a noncommutative space that contains all the abstract algebras ( known as symmetry groups ) that describe the properties of elementary particles in the Standard Model .

However , I have noticed that we 've crossed over into a place where some women are just a little too comfortable with homosexuality .
" Too much tolerance " you say ?
I 'll explain .
Honestly , I am flattered when a woman says something along the lines of " you 're cute .
Too bad you 're not straight . "
That 's nice to hear .
I 'm not going into some PC tirade over a compliment .
You know what though ?
I only need to hear it once .
My friend 's friend says it every time I see her .
She does the rubbing my upper back back , hands in my hair shit .
And you know what I want to say ?
" LISTEN .
My being gay is n't the only reason it would never happen . "
Like , back the fuck up .
And she 's also volunteered to be my beard at events .
" Great , we 'll time travel to the 1950s when people in LA last did that .
" I think " Will and Grace " has instructed an entire generation of women that gay men are dying - DYING ! - to be your friend and indulge your every co-dependent and neurotic whim .
We 'll be there in a clinch with a " you go girl ! " or " you look fierce ! "
Because we all love to say that stuff and many other quippy zingers .
Last Monday night , a woman at a bar came up to me and asked me if I was single .
Not to disparage her , but let 's just say I was happy to shut her down right away with an abrupt " I 'm gay . "
And you know what ?
THAT DID NOT DETER HER .
She LIT up and said , " We can go shopping together and you can watch me play with myself with my Rabbit . " Ugggggghhhh ...
Do you ever not even know where to begin ?
I wanted to say , " Yes , please , I am in the habit of befriending bar skanks in the first ten seconds of talking to them .
And despite my lack of sexual attraction to women , I would simply LOVE to watch you get yourself off .
JACKPOT !" As far as the shopping thing goes : I love saying " I 'm not really into shopping " and I just stand back and wait for their heads to explode .
Their precious " Will and Grace " never prepared them for that possibility !
Call me uptight but I 'm also against using the word " fag " aimed at me in some joking , campy way to demonstrate how comfortable you are with my being gay .
This has happened to me .
It 's like a folksy gay - bashing without the exclamation point of the beatings .
Let 's from now on consult what I call " The Nigger Test " to see if a carefree epithet really is appropriate .
The way it works is that when you want to call me " fag " you imagine instead that I 'm black and that you 're going to call me " nigger " in some whimsical , ironic way .
If you would in fact drop the N bomb , then by all means , proceed !
Also , please refrain from referring to your gay friend as " my Will " or yourself as " Grace . "
That 's totally queer .
It was an okay show that 's been off the air for over a year .
Move on .
And lastly , just because you know another gay man who is single DOES NOT MEAN WE WOULD MAKE A PERFECT MATCH .
I appreciate the desire to see me paired up but most women ( or straight men who attempt this ) think pairing up gays is as difficult as a game of Concentration .
" Hey ... there 's one ... there 's another ... done ! "
" This guy you want to pair me up with ... what does he like to do in his free time ?
Does he vote ?
Does he read ?
Like to go out ?
Stay in ?
You do n't know ?
So you just know his name and sexual orientation . "
PASS .
And while I 've got nothing against the uber - feminine gay men , and respect that they have a much tougher path than gay men who seem straight , please do not fix me up with them .
Because I am not attracted to them , which you would know if you 'd asked any of the pertinent questions before acting as a one - woman Match.com .
In closing , I am a friendly guy and like knowing people from all walks of life .
But straight girls , just dial down the desperation level a couple of notches and find a more constructive way to deal with the void that the cancellation of " Sex and the City " has left in your life .
( Full disclosure : I 'm a total Miranda ! )
If we 're meant to be friends , you 'll let me breathe and know me for me , not as the hot urban accessory of the gay male friend .
Thank you .
I feel so much better .
How to Snatch an Expiring Domain
I recently found myself in the position of wanting to register a domain which was owned by someone else .
The domain was set to expire in a week , and I figured there was a decent chance that the person who owned it would n’t be renewing it .
Upon consulting the WhoIs registry on the current owner , I discovered the guy was a bit of a domain shark and did n’t seem to be around anymore .
So I placed a backorder through GoDaddy for $ 18.95 thinking that was all I needed to do .
During the week that followed , I learned a lot about the domain expiration process .
Two and a half months and $ 369 later , I am the proud owner of a shiny new domain .
A really really good one .
This article will explain the domain expiration process and what you need to do in order to use it to your advantage .
How a domain expires
Contrary to popular belief , domains do not expire when they say they do .
If the owner of a domain does not renew by the expiration date of the domain , the domain goes into “ expired ” status .
For 40 days , the domain is in a grace period where all services are shut off , but the domain owner may still renew the domain for a standard renewal fee .
If a domain enters this period , it is a good first indicator that it may not be renewed , but since the owner can re-register without penalty , it can also just be a sign of laziness or procrastination .
After 40 days are up , the domain ’s status changes to “ redemption period ” .
During this phase , all WhoIs information begins disappearing , and more importantly , it now costs the owner an additional fee to re-activate and re-register the domain .
The fee is currently around $ 100 , depending on your registrar .
When a domain enters its redemption period , it ’s a good bet the owner has decided not to renew .
Finally , after the redemption period , the domain ’s status will change to “ locked ” as it enters the deletion phase .
The deletion phase is 5 days long , and on the last day between 11 am and 2 pm Pacific time , the name will officially drop from the ICANN database and will be available for registration by anybody .
The entire process ends exactly 75 days after the listed expiration date .
For an even more detailed explanation , read the article Inside a Drop Catcher ’s War Room .
Landing your domain
So if domains are available to the general public 75 days after they expire , how do you know your GoDaddy backorder is n’t one of many other backorders from other people using other services ?
The answer is , you do n’t .
And thus begins the cloak - and - dagger game of “ getting in on The Drop ” .
“ The Drop ” is the unpredictable three hour period of time in which the domain is deleted from VeriSign ’s database and released back into the ecosystem .
I briefly thought about trying to beat GoDaddy to the punch by manually registering my domain during the drop process , but I quickly found out that there are no fewer than three major services which specialize in pounding away on VeriSign ’s servers during the drop period .
With their considerable resources and my measly Powerbook , there was no way I could compete on their level .
So I decided to enlist the services of all three major domain snatching firms in hopes that a ) one would grab my domain for me , and b ) no one else would be competing against me .
The three services — Snapnames.com , Enom.com , and Pool.com — all operate in a similar manner .
They use a network of registrars to hit the Verisign servers at frequent intervals ( but not too frequent to get banned ) and snatch as many requested names as possible .
If you do n’t get your name , you do n’t pay .
But that ’s where the three services begin to differ .
Snapnames.com
Snapnames.com ( the exclusive partner of Network Solutions ) charges you $ 60 for your domain unless there are multiple suitors , at which point there is an open bid auction between suitors .
Seems fair enough .
Snapnames is a bit of a newcomer to the game , but with their Network Solutions affiliation , they are said to be improving their success rates .
Enom.com
Not wanting to chance it with only one company , I also enlisted Enom to snatch my domain for me .
Enom had reportedly been improving their “ Club Drop ” service for a year or two and it was now considered one of the top three .
Their fee was only $ 30 and they are based in my ‘ hood ( Seattle ) , so I was hoping they would be the company to successfully “ work The Drop ” for me .
Here ’s where it starts to get sketchy though .
Enom claims that the higher your bid is ( beyond the $ 30 ) , the more “ resources ” they will dedicate to grabbing the domain .
What the hell ?
How am I supposed to judge that ?
Does that mean you ’re using one server now and will use 30 servers if I bid $ 40 ?
Or does it mean that you ’re using 30 now and will use 35 if I bid $ 1000 ?
Not knowing exactly what to do , I attempted to bid a couple of hundred dollars during the last day , but Enom required me to send them a fax to become a “ verified bidder ” .
Since I was at home that day and only dinosaurs still have fax machines , I was unable to increase my bid .
Oh well , I thought , if someone else on Enom bids higher , at least I ’ll be able to participate in the auction .
Pool.com
Pool.com is the Scott Boras of domain name grabbing — the brilliant , yet conniving agent that players ( domains ) love and team owners ( prospective domain buyers ) hate .
Pool plays off the power of the unknown in such a fiendishly clever way that you do n’t know whether to hug them or kill them .
Here ’s how it works :
Pool is the # 1 company around as far as number of servers and success rates go .
You place your original bid for $ 60 and if Pool.com grabs your name for you , they send you an e-mail telling you they ’ve been successful and that you ’ve now entered “ Phase 1 ” of the two - phase auction system .
This is the case whether or not you are the only bidder !
Pool.com does n’t even reveal how many bidders there are .
Then , in a Boras - like move of diabolical genius , Pool.com informs you that you have three days to place a new sealed bid .
If the bid is either one of the top two bids or within 30 % of the top bid , you move on to a one - day open bid auction ( the “ challenger ” auction ) for final control of the domain .
Grrrrreat .
So if I bid $ 100 and two people bid $ 140 , I do n’t even get to move on to the final auction !
It ’s all designed to get me to up my sealed bid … whether or not there are even any other bidders .
Note :
One other thing I forgot to mention is that before the name dropped , I grabbed all .net , .org , and .info variants ( all were available ) in order to have more leverage over other buyers .
The chase is on
Right on time , 75 days after the domain expired , I got an e-mail from Pool.com telling me they ’d secured my domain for me .
Great .
Of the four sources I used , Pool.com was the one I least wanted to deal with .
But true to their claims , they ended up being the best agent of The Drop and had just gotten me one step closer to my domain .
They had A - Rod and I was the Texas Rangers .
Unlike the Texas Rangers , however , I realized I could be bidding against myself and entered a sealed bid of $ 302 .
I chose that number because it seemed sufficiently high but not so high that I ’d feel foolish if I was the only bidder .
I added the extra two dollars on the end just to edge out any other people potentially deciding on $ 300 as their number .
The next three days were particularly stressful .
I had no idea where I stood , and throughout this entire process , I ’d always had the sneaking suspicion that the people at these companies are on the lookout themselves for valuable domains .
In other words , if someone all of a sudden bids $ 1000 on a domain , will a domain company decide to snatch it up themselves or “ shill bid ” against you on it ?
Finally the e-mail from Pool arrived and informed me that I had moved onto the Challenger Auction .
There was one other bidder and they had upped their bid to $ 312 in order to beat me .
Not too bad , but I had no idea how high that person was willing to go .
I had to decide on a top bid ( a la eBay ’s proxy bidding ) and a strategy for when to place it .
True to form , Pool.com ’s auction system squeezes even more money out of you by making sure the auction does n’t end if there ’s a bid in the last five minutes .
In that case , the auction time keeps extending by five minutes until there are no more bids .
I could try one of two things :
Bid high and bid early in an attempt to scare off the other guy , or lull the other guy to sleep by doing nothing until the last 6 minutes .
I chose the second method since the ending time was 8 am on a Saturday … a time when many people are not in front of computers .
I set four alarms for 7:45 am Saturday morning , woke up on time , and placed my bid for $ 500 when the countdown clock hit 6 minutes .
The system immediately auto - upped the current bid to $ 369 and I was the leader .
Six nervous minutes , fifty browser refreshes , and a thousand heartbeats later , my opponent was nowhere to be found and the domain was mine … ready for immediate transfer to Dreamhost , my hosting company of choice .
I ’m still not quite sure whether the person on the other end was real ( although I assume they were ) , but the bottom line is that by playing every possible angle , I now have an extremely valuable domain in my possession for the reasonable sum of $ 369 .
Not valuable because I want to sell it or anything ; just valuable because I want it .
Thank you Pool.com .
I love / hate you .
Lessons from The Drop
Hopefully this article helps you in your own quest for a domain that may be expiring .
My best advice is that if your interest in a domain name is only lukewarm , go ahead and use a basic service like GoDaddy , but if you really do n’t want to let one get away , you must enlist the services of the big three : Snapnames , Enom , and Pool .
It ’s anybody ’s guess what the final price will be , but by getting all the best agents out there working for you , you ensure at least being in the game .
In 2006 Thiago Olson joined the extremely sparse ranks of amateurs worldwide who have achieved nuclear fusion with a home apparatus .
In other words , he built the business end of a hydrogen bomb in his basement .
The plasma " star in a jar " — shown at the left — demonstrated his success .
For two years , Olson researched what he would need and scrounged for parts from eBay and the hardware store .
Flanges and piping ?
Check .
High - voltage X - ray transformer ?
Check .
Pumps , deuterium source , neutron bubble dosimeter ?
Check , check , check .
“ I have cross-country and track , so during those seasons I do n’t have much time to work on it , ” says Olson , a highschool senior in Michigan .
“ It ’s more of a weekend project . ”
Last November the machine finally delivered the hallmark of success : bubbles in the dosimeter .
The bubbles indicate the presence of neutrons , a by - product of fusion — an energy - releasing process in which two hydrogen nuclei crash together and form a helium nucleus .
Fusion is commonplace in stars , where hydrogen nuclei fuse in superhot plasma , but temperatures that high are hard to achieve on Earth .
Still , the prospect ofcreating all this energy while forming only nonradioactive helium and easily controlled neutrons has made harnessing fusion one of the most sought - after and heavily funded goals in sustainable energy .
Olson ’s apparatus wo n’t work for generating commercial power because it takes more energy to run than it produces .
But he has succeeded increating a “ star in a jar , ” a tiny flash of hot plasma .
“ The temperature of the plasma is around 200 million degrees , ” Olson says modestly , “ several times hotter than the core of the sun . ”
Robert Bussard , a nuclear physicist who has spent most of his career investigating fusion for both the government and private companies , applauds Olson ’s ambition .
“ These kids are studying much more useful physics than what the country is spending billions on , ” he says .
“ It causes them to think .
They ’re not going down the mainstream path to oblivion . ”
And , aside from using high voltage and emitting low - level radiation , the machine has been deemed harmless .
“ About a week ago , the department of health from Michigan called my principal , ” Olson says .
“ They wanted to come over and inspect it .
They did that , they were impressed , and it checked out . ”
Imagination refers to holding in mind a representation that may not be ( yet ) ' true ' and does not necessarily reflect the facts about the external world or the Reality as of now .
The act of imagination may use previous memories and a general knowledge of the world to recreate past memories or to imagine novel future events .
An article by Simon Baron Cohen , discusses the biology of imagination .
Simon distinguishes between the contents of imagination , which are culturally determined ; and the capacity for imagination , which is biologically grounded .
He also focuses on imagination as a false or distorted representation of Reality as opposed to mere imagery , which though itself also being a mental representation , may more - or - less represent the world accurately .
Imagery may be necessary for human imagination .
It has been suggested that all the products of the imagination are derived from imagery , following some transformation of the basic imagery .
For example , Rutgers ’ psychologist Alan Leslie , when he worked in London in the 1980s , proposed that imagination essentially involves three steps :
Take what he called a ‘ primary ’ representation ( which , as we have already established , is an image that has truth relations to the outside world ) .
Then make a copy of this primary representation ( Leslie calls this copy a ‘ second - order ’ representation ) .
Finally , one can then introduce some change to this second - order representation , playing with its truth relationships to the outside world without jeopardising the important truth relationships that the original , primary representation needs to preserve .
For Leslie , when you use your imagination , you leave your primary representation untouched ( for important evolutionary reasons that we will come onto ) , but once you have a photocopy of this ( as it were ) , you can do pretty much anything you like with it .
Thus , what Leslie contends is that the faculty of imagination involves a mechanism for making a second - order representation in the mind of a past stimulus ( the imagery ) , in the absence of the stimulus in the here and now .
Crucially , the faculty of imagination also involves the ability to modify the stimulus in such a way so that it no longer represents the original stimuli accurately .
One , either creatively or mundanely , transforms some aspects of the original stimulus .
to come up with something imaginary ( like the concept of a unicorn ) .
Thus , it seems there are three faculties involved - one for maintaining a second order representation of an object in absence of stimulus , another for distorting or manipulating that representation to come up with novel objects and the last for keeping this novel representation as different from the original representation to avoid confusion and loss with reality .
Leslie calls the abilities to form second - order representations and the ability to change or distort these representations as Meta- representation capacity and links this to the ability to indulge in pretend play in 9 - 15 months old infants and the ability for mind reading or false - belief or Theory of Mind ( ToM ) ability in older children ( 4 yr olds ) .
The contention is that pretend play enables one to keep two copies ( one primary and the second a false second - order representation ) of an external object in mind simultaneously while at the same time enabling one to know that one is true and the other false or a pretense .
Also pretend play involves treating one object ( say a banana ) as another object ( say a telephone ) and thus develops the capacity to distort the second order representation of an object .
This meta - representation ability in turn is the pre-requisite for imagining future outcomes and thus for successful planning in older adults .
Before I continue , let me pause and define imagination faculty in more rigorous terms for forthcoming discussions .
We would be primarily concerned with the ability to shift focus from now and here to then and there and also from self to others .
We would be concerned with imagination as depicted in scenarios involving people or objects with agency .
Also please refer to this document by Buckner and Carrol .
Thus , the following kinds of imaginations are under preview :
Remembering the autobiographical past ( reconstructing past memories or imagining what it felt like ' then ' in the past vis -a - vis ' now ' ) .
Simulating the autobiographical future or Prospecting ( constructing plausible future scenrie that would happen ' then ' as compared to ' now ' )
Navigating ( constructing a scene that is ' here ' ( first person perspective ) to ' there ' ( third person perspective ) )
Changes in spatial perspective - seeing things / scenes from someone else 's point of view .
Please keep in mind the distinction between two types of spatial point - of - view taking - one involving line tracing and the other perspective taking ) .
It is my contention that while normal kids would rely more on perspective taking , the autistic children rely on line tracing for navigation .
Theory Of Mind : ( constructing a representation of ' another ' as opposed to self ) .
Thus this too involves a shifting of focus from one agent to another with the concurrent risk that the new representation may not be true .
In what sense might a meta - representational capacity be essential for mind - reading ?
Let ’s define mind - reading as the ability to put yourself in someone else ’s shoes , to imagine the other person ’s thoughts and feelings .iv
Leslie ’s deeply interesting argument is that when you mind - read , you again need to quarantine your primary representations .
Here ’s how his argument goes .
Just as your mental picture of a fish has ‘ truth relations ’ to a real fish in the outside world , so a belief , or a sentence , has truth relations to real events in the outside world .
Thus , ‘ John is having an affair with his colleague ’ is a primary representation of a state of affairs , and is true if John is indeed having an affair with his colleague .
But when we mind - read , we again take the primary representation ( step one ) , copy it so that it becomes a second - order representation ( step two ) , and can then add a prefix ( step three ) that completely changes its truth relations with the outside world .
Thus , we can take the primary representation ‘ John is having an affair with his colleague ’ ( step one ) .
We can copy it to produce an identical version ‘ John is having an affair with his colleague ’ , except this version is tagged as being a copy or a second - order representation ( step two ) .
Finally , we can add a prefix such as ‘ Mary believes that ’ to the second - order representation to end up with ‘ Mary believes that “ John is having an affair with his colleague ” ’ ( step three ) .
Such second - order representations have unique logical properties , an insight that Leslie borrowed from the standard views in philosophy of mind .
They have , to use the jargon , referential opacity .
‘ I pretend that “ this tea - cup is hot ” ’ is true if I pretend this , irrespective of whether the tea -cup really is hot .
‘ Mary believes that “ John is having an affair with his colleague ” ’ is true if Mary believes it , irrespective of whether John really is having an affair .
According to Leslie , and I think he is right , when we mind - read ( just as when we use imagination ) , we employ such second - order representations .
I can maintain my own knowledge base ( John is not having an affair ) whilst representing someone else ’s different ( possibly false ) belief ( Mary believes he is ) .
Note that all of the above involve or are about persons or entities with agencies and their beliefs / memories / imaginations and how they are distinct from the actual reality .
This is important as the neural evidence would pertain to only this class of imaginations and would not generalize to imagining events not involving agency , for example imagining a unicorn .
Thus , ToM has also been placed squarely in the category of tasks requiring Imagination , as we have defined it .
Simon than contends that in Autism children lack this Imagination circuit or network and have deficts with ToM in particular and Imagination in general .
Thus , as per this hypothesis they must also have problems imagining future autobiographical events , problems with episodic memory and problems with perspective taking approach to spatial navigation .
All this still needs to be tested .
Let me now digress a little and point to data that suggests that the module we are talking about is specific to Imagination involving Agency and not for all second - order representations .
When confronted with questions that do not require an agency , the autistic people perform as well on control tasks that require false representations in the mind .
To determine whether the poor performance of autistic children is due to a specific impairment in theory of mind , Leslie constructed a control task that very closely resembles the Sally - Ann task but does not rely on theory of mind .
In the control task , the children watch an actor photograph a cat that is sitting on a chair .
The cat then moves to a bed , and the subject is asked to predict what the photo will show .
The control task is formally similar to the Sally - Ann task in that both tasks require children to infer the contents of a representation that does not reflect the current state of affairs .
The photograph task and a standard FB task were given to normal 3 and 4 - year - olds and mental - age - matched autistic adolescents .
The autistic children performed slightly better than the normal 4 - year - olds on the photograph task but worse than normal children on the standard FB task .
The normal 3 - year - olds failed both the FB task and the control task .
The autistic children also outperformed normal children on another control task .
In the second control task , the position of a cat was marked on a map .
The cat then moved , and children were asked to predict the location of the mark on the map .
The results indicate that autistic kids can meet the general problem solving demands of false belief tasks , but normally developing 3 - year - olds cannot .
Leslie concludes that the three year olds have a difficulty with suppressing or inhibiting their own beliefs and desires ( the primary representations ) and selecting the second - order representations or beliefs of Sally .
Thus his hypothesis is that their performance reflects a failure of inhibition or selection processing .
this is clearly tied to the third ability we have identified of keeping two representations operate .
They confuse between the two , and it is my contention that this is due to their inability to hold two representations of same objects in memory at the same time .
Thus , three year olds also do not have episodic memory or the capacity to hold in memory the same object representations , but with different time coordinates .
Leslie also demonstrates that this deficit in inhibition , that is age dependent , is different from the deficit in Autistic children .
I suspect the deficits in Autistic people are due to their propensity to view entities with agency too as objects and thus not having any beliefs , desires or emotions .
Now let me return to the Buckner and Carrol paper .
It is an important paper that shows that we use the same brain areas for Remembering the past , imagining the future , ToM tasks and Navigation .
Morover , the paper shows that this default network is nothing else but the default network in brain .
It is to be remembered that the default network is the network active in absence of any stimulus and one feature of Agency dependent imagination we have seen earlier is that one should be able to form representations in absence of any stimuli .
Also , we have already covered research that suggest that same brain areas are used for remembering the past and imagining the future .
Let me give you the abstract of the paper :
When thinking about the future or the upcoming actions of another person , we mentally project ourselves into that alternative situation .
Accumulating data suggest that envisioning the future ( prospection ) , remembering the past , conceiving the viewpoint of others ( theory of mind ) and possibly some forms of navigation reflect the workings of the same core brain network .
These abilities emerge at a similar age and share a common functional anatomy that includes frontal and medial temporal systems that are traditionally associated with planning , episodic memory and default ( passive ) cognitive states .
We speculate that these abilities , most often studied as distinct , rely on a common set of processes by which past experiences are used adaptively to imagine perspectives and events beyond those that emerge from the immediate environment .
I would request that the readers go back up a little and re-read the faculties required for imagination :
They involve second - order representation without stimulus ( as in the activity in default network when no tasks are being carried .
This spontaneous activity in the default network suggest that this is one region that can do its work without any input data . )
Distorting , changing , modifying the representation and moving them back and forth in time and space : I believe the frontal regions are involved in combining different stimuli , sequencing and planning them to archive novel combinations .
Keeping the false / imagined / other - people representations distinct from primary representations : I believe medial temporal lobe is crucial here .
It is implicated in learning and memory and for keeping representations of past events ( episodic memory ) .
It thus has to keep the representations distinct , so that many memories may have the same constituent objects .
Thus , the medial temporal lobe , I believe is mainly responsible for keeping the representations distinct .
It is interesting to note that the default network comprises of precisely these brain areas - the PFC and other frontal areas and the medial temporal lobe along with temporal - parietal junctions implicated in ToM .
Also the fronto - polar region is implicated in the shifting of perspectives from self to other , from now to then etc and may be the most affected in Autism ..
Functions that shift the perspective from the immediate environment to another vantage point create an interesting challenge for the brain .
We must keep track of these shifts , otherwise our perceptions would blur together .
Decety and Gre´zes note that ‘ reality and imagination are not confused ’.
A computational model of how such a process might be structured is far from being defined , but it will probably require a form of regulation by which perception of the current world is suppressed while simulation of possible alternatives are constructed , followed by a return to perception of the present .
Povinelli considered this issue from a developmental perspective and noted that coordination of internal perspectives ‘ paves the way for the child to sustain not simply one current representation of the self but also to organize previous , current , and future representations under the temporally extended , metaconcept of ‘ ‘ me ’ ’ ’
A final set of findings suggests that the frontopolar cortex contributes to theory of mind .
What does this selective generalization mean ?
The combined observations suggest that the core network that supports remembering , prospection , theory of mind and related tasks is not shared by all tasks that require complex problem solving or imagination .
Rather , the network seems to be specialized for , and actively engaged by , mental acts that require the projection of oneself into another time , place or perspective .
Prospection and related forms of self - projection might enable mental simulations that involve the interactions of people , who have intentions and autonomous mental states , by projecting our own mental states into different vantage points , in an analogous manner to how one projects oneself into the past and future .
In this article , we have considered the speculative possibility that a core brain network supports multiple forms of self - projection .
Thinking about the future , episodic remembering , conceiving the perspective of others ( theory of mind ) and navigation engage this network , which suggests that they share similar reliance on internal modes of cognition and on brain systems that enable perception of alternative vantage points .
Perhaps these abilities , traditionally considered as distinct , are best understood as part of a larger class of function that enables flexible forms of self - projection .
By this view , self - projection relies closely on memory systems because past experience serves as the foundation on which alternative perspectives and conceived futures are built .
The Fronto - polar regions are suspected behind this ability and I suspect are the most affected in Autism .
Thus Autism stems from the ToM deficts in the fronto - polar regions , plus the inability to keep many simultaneous representations in mind / ' memory ' .
I would also suspect that same region is involved in agency attribution .
In the end they very wisely conclude :
That brings us to my final conclusion .
I believe this is further evidence for the different cultures of Schizophrenia and Autism .
If Autistic have a deficit with this ToM / Agency default network , we also know that in schizophrenics too the default network works abnormally .
I presume it acts unusually in the opposite way to that in Autism - attributing more agency , involving more imagination and self - projection .

Science education in the United States is broken .
So says Congressman Bart Gordon , chair of the House Committee on
Science and Technology in a scathing criticism that he wrote for the
Spring issue of Issues in Science and Technology .
Gordon argues that China and India will crush the United States unless there are substantial improvements to American science education .
Unless the United States maintains its edge in innovation , which is founded on a well - trained creative workforce , the best jobs may soon be found overseas .
If current trends continue , along with a lack of action , today 's children may grow up with a lower standard of living than their parents .
The United States is in direct competition with countries that recognize the importance of developing their human resources .
The numbers and quality of scientists and engineers being educated elsewhere , notably in China and India , continue to increase , and the capabilities of broadband communications networks make access to scientific and engineering talent possible wherever it exists .
It warms my heart to know that a member of congress empathizes with the hordes of science and engineering students who are bored into submission by lackluster classes .
A serious problem with undergraduate STEM ( Science , Technology , Engineering , and Mathematics ) education is high student attrition .
In most instances , attrition is not because of an inability to perform academically , but because of a loss of interest and enthusiasm .
If making classes more exciting does not work , maybe bribes will do the trick .
Finally , the panelists agreed that it is necessary to make careers in
S&T more appealing to students .
Specific recommendations included funding undergraduate scholarships and generous graduate fellowship programs and providing paid internships in industry .
Rather than offering training in stagnant fields of science and engineering , Gordon believes that students should be urged to study frontier areas of science like systems biology , tissue engineering , and nanoscience .
The thrust of these recommendations ( from a house round table ) was that U.S. S&T workers will need to acquire skills that will differentiate them from their foreign competitors .
This implies the need to identify the kinds of skills valued by industry and the need for much better information about the skill sets that industry can easily acquire abroad .
So far , the United States has dealt with a lack of skilled scientists and engineers by importing them .
Gordon warns that this may become harder as foreign economies improve , citing the train wreck that was American manufacturing in the 80s and early 90s .

Michael Marmor , MD , wanted to know what it was like to see through the eyes of an artist .
Literally .
After writing two books on the topic of artists and eye disease , the Stanford University School of Medicine ophthalmologist decided to go one step further and create images that would show how artists with eye disease actually saw their world and their canvases .
Combining computer simulation with his own medical knowledge , Marmor has recreated images of some of the masterpieces of the French impressionistic painters Claude Monet and Edgar Degas who continued to work while they struggled with cataracts and retinal disease .
The results are striking .
In Marmor 's simulated versions of how the painters would most likely have seen their work , Degas ' later paintings of nude bathers become so blurry it 's difficult to see any of the artist 's brush strokes .
Monet 's later paintings of the lily pond and the Japanese bridge at Giverny , when adjusted to reflect the typical symptoms of cataracts , appear dark and muddied .
The artist 's signature vibrant colors are muted , replaced by browns and yellows .
" These simulations may lead one to question whether the artists intended these late works to look exactly as they do , " said Marmor who has long had interest in both the mechanics of vision and the vision of artists .
" The fact is that these artists were n't painting in this manner totally for artistic reasons . "
Degas and Monet were both founders of the Impressionist era , and their artistic styles were well formed before their eye disease affected their vision .
But their paintings grew significantly more abstract in later life as , coincidentally , their eye problems increased .
" Contemporaries of both have noted that their late works were strangely coarse or garish and seemed out of character to the finer works that these artists had produced over the years , " Marmor wrote in a paper titled " Ophthalmology and Art : Simulation of Monet 's Cataracts and Degas ' Retinal Disease " that was published in the December issue of the Archives of Ophthalmology .
It 's well - known that such artists as Monet , Degas , Rembrandt , Mary Cassatt and Georgia O'Keefe all reached their heights of artistic vision while facing a decline in their ocular vision .
Marmor chose to focus on Degas and Monet for these simulations because both artists suffered from eye disease that was well - documented in historical records , journals and medical histories .
Degas had retinal eye disease that frustrated him for the last 50 years of his long career .
Monet complained of cataracts interfering with his ability to see colors for 10 years before he finally underwent surgery to have them removed .
" We understand better from these simulations what Degas and Monet struggled with as vision failed , " Marmor said .
Over the past 32 years , the Harvard - educated physician has published 200 - plus scientific articles on the science of eye disease while at the same time writing about famous artists and how eye disease may have affected their artwork .
He authored one book , Degas Through His Own Eyes , and co-authored another , The Eye of the Artist , with James G. Ravin .
" As an ophthalmologist , I 'm fascinated with the visual components of art , " said Marmor , whose Stanford home is decorated with pieces of modern art that emphasize optical illusions .
His family donated works of art to the Cantor Arts Center at Stanford .
" I 've also spent years talking to patients about the symptoms of their eye diseases .
This was a natural outgrowth of my science and art interests . "
One museum curator , Richard Kendall , called Marmor 's publications on Degas and Monet " of considerable value to the art historical community . "
" I consider him one of the most thoughtful commentators from the scientific community on questions of eyesight among French 19th - century artists , '' said Kendall , who is curator - at - large at the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute in Williamstown , Mass .
To create the images of the artists ' paintings as seen through their own eyes , Marmor used Adobe Photoshop software .
He adjusted the blur and filter settings to what he determined would be the different stages of Degas ' and Monet 's eye diseases , based on medical expertise and historical research .
Degas suffered failing vision from 1860 to 1910 .
As his eye disease progressed , his paintings grew increasingly rough .
From treating hundreds of patients with retinal disease similar to what Degas suffered , Marmor said , he knows that the shading and contrast of images becomes less defined and blurriness increases as such illness progresses .
" Friends would ask Degas , ' Why are you still painting ? ' "
Marmor wrote in his December paper .
" His works in the 1870s were drawn quite precisely with facial detail , careful shading and attention to the folding of ballet costumes and towels . "
By the 1880s and 1890s , the shading lines and details of the face , hair and clothing of the same subjects became progressively less refined .
" After 1900 , " Marmor said , " these effects were quite extreme and many pictures seem mere shadows of his customary style . "
Monet wrote of his growing frustration with his deteriorating vision , describing how he was forced to memorize where the colors were placed on his palette .
In 1914 he wrote in his correspondence that colors no longer had the same intensity .
" Reds had begun to look muddy , " he wrote .
" My painting was getting more and more darkened . "
He was forced to rely on the labels on the tubes of paint in place of his own vision .
" Like retinal disease , cataracts also blur vision , " Marmor said , " but more importantly for a painter like Monet , whose style was based on the use of light and color , they can affect the ability to see colors . "
" Monet must have struggled mightily as he looked out into the murky yellow - brown garden and tried to decide what subtle impression to create on canvas , " Marmor wrote in the December paper .
" Slowly progressive age - related cataracts manifest as yellowing and darkening of the lens .
This has a major effect on color perception as well as visual acuity . "
After reluctantly submitting to cataract surgery in 1923 , Monet returned to his original painting style , even throwing away much of the artwork he'd done during the 10 - year period that he had cataracts .
" He just could n't see the colors , " Marmor said .
" These simulations show how much his sense of color had been destroyed .
Some people say , ' Oh , it 's a stylistic change . '
Gosh , I do n't think so . "
Understanding the challenges these artists faced because of eye disease helps further illuminate the accomplishments they achieved despite their disabilities , Marmor said .
" There 's some reluctance among people in the art world to look outside the historical or psychological influences on the great artists , " Marmor said .
" I 'm open to debate about what these visual changes might mean stylistically or aesthetically .
What is not open to debate is what the artists saw .
If you ignore that , you 're ignoring facts . "

If it is true , as Ambrose Bierce ( 1842 — 1914 ) said , “ War is God ’s way of teaching Americans geography , ” then empire must be God ’s way of making Americans masters of the subject since the United States now has troops in 159 different regions of the world .
We know this is true , not because some opponent of U.S. imperialism says so , but because the Department of Defense publishes a quarterly report called the “ Active Duty Military Personnel Strengths by Regional Area and by Country . ”
Although these reports used to be issued by the Defense Department ’s Directorate for Information Operations and Reports ( DIOR ) , they are now prepared by the Statistical Information Analysis Division of the Defense Manpower Data Center .
The latest report is dated September 30 , 2006 .
Previous reports can be seen here .
I first reported on this in an article published on March 16 , 2004 , and called “ The U.S. Global Empire . ”
There I documented that the U.S. had troops in 135 countries , plus 14 territories that were not sovereign countries — some controlled by the United States and some controlled by other countries .
I then showed on October 4 , 2004 , in “ Guarding the Empire , ” that the U.S. empire had increased to 150 different regions of the world .
The last time I reported on the extent of the empire , December 5 , 2005 , in “ Today Iraq , Tomorrow the World , ” it had grown to encompass 155 different regions of the world .
Today it pains me to report that the U.S. empire has now extended its tentacles to 159 regions of the world : 144 countries and 15 territories .
To the original list of 135 countries I gave in “ The U.S. Global Empire ” can now be added : Angola Rwanda Armenia Slovakia Gabon Somalia Guyana Sudan Moldova Uzbekistan North Korea can be removed from the list .
Yes , the “ Active Duty Military Personnel Strengths by Regional Area and by Country ” document that I originally used in 2004 said that there were four U.S. Marines stationed in the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea .
Since there are 192 countries in the world besides the United States , this means that the U.S. military has troops in over 70 percent of the world ’s countries .
And this does n’t include territories that are not sovereign countries .
The 15 territories in which the United States now has troops are : American Samoa Micronesia Diego Garcia Northern Mariana Islands Gibraltar Palau Guam Puerto Rico Greenland St. Helena Hong Kong Virgin Islands Kosovo Wake Island Marshall Islands
The Marshall Islands , Micronesia , Palau , and the Northern Mariana Islands make up the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands .
American Samoa , Guam , the Northern Mariana Islands , Puerto Rico , the Virgin Islands , and Wake Island are all territories of the United States .
Here we might ask , not why does the United States have troops in these areas , but why does the United States have control of these territories to begin with ?
Although Donald Rumsfeld once claimed that the United States is not imperialistic and does n’t seek empires , what else are you going to call this global presence in 159 regions of the world ?
Do all these countries want U.S. troops on their soil ?
Is there really any reason why the United States still has 64,319 troops in Germany , 33,453 troops in Japan , and 10,449 troops in Italy — sixty years after World War II ?
And what are we doing with 1,521 troops in Spain , 414 troops in Honduras , and 347 troops in Australia ?
And why do we have 31 soldiers in Cote D’Ivoire ?
Cote D’What ?
Cote D’Where ?
How many Americans can locate Cote D’Ivoire on a map or have ever heard of it ?
How many even care ?
( For the record , Cote D’Ivoire is next to Burkina Faso . )
Scholarly advocates of American imperialism , like CFR Senior Fellow Max Boot , reject the term imperialism , but hold , like Boot , that the United States “ should definitely embrace the practice . ”
Boot subscribes to what can be called twenty - first - century gunboat diplomacy .
He believes that the United States should impose the rule of law , property rights , and free speech on Iraq “ at gunpoint if need be . ”
Since “ Iran and other neighboring states wo n’t hesitate to impose their despotic views on Iraq ; we should n’t hesitate to impose our democratic views . ”
Less sophisticated apologists for U.S. interventionism and imperialism , along with the usual assortment of chickenhawks , armchair warriors , Bush lovers , Christian warmongers , Republican Party loyalists , and other “ conservatives ” who defend the military and the warfare state , attempt to dismiss U.S. global hegemony over the majority of the planet by claiming that many of the U.S. troops stationed abroad are just embassy guards .
Since I have already showed in “ Guarding the Empire ” that it definitely is not the Marine guards at U.S. embassies overseas that account for the U.S. troop presence in so many countries , I will not address that point again here .
The other argument is that the presence of U.S. troops in so many countries is really not an issue because in some countries the United States has only a handful of its soldiers .
Now , it is true that the United States only has a handful of troops stationed in some countries ( e.g. , 9 in Albania , 7 in Latvia , 3 in Laos ) , but focusing on how few troops are actually in some countries misses the point entirely .
The issue is U.S. troops on foreign soil .
They have no business there .
Period .
No bases , no troops , and no military advisors .
Echoing the inscription on the Liberty Bell , President Bush closed his second inaugural address with the statement that “ America , in this young century , proclaims liberty throughout all the world , and to all the inhabitants thereof . ”
But rather than proclaiming liberty , the stationing of soldiers in 159 different regions of the world and garrisoning the planet with military bases does just the opposite .
Instead of proclaiming liberty , it proclaims imperialism , interventionism , militarism , and jingoism — all with devastating consequences for those countries that dare to question American hegemony .

Did Rove 's Protégé Puff Up Résumé ?
Little Rock ’s interim U.S. Attorney J. Timothy Griffin – already at the center of a firestorm over whether the White House has put politics ahead of prosecutorial integrity – made claims about his experience as an Army lawyer that have been put in doubt by military records .

The 38 - year - old Griffin claims on his official Web site that he prosecuted 40 criminal cases while at Ft. Campbell , where he was stationed from September 2005 to May 2006 .
But Army authorities say Ft. Campbell ’s records show Griffin only serving as assistant trial counsel on three cases , none of which went to trial .
Griffin did n’t agree to be interviewed about his claim of 40 criminal prosecutions versus the Army ’s confirmation of three cases , all of which were settled as plea bargains .
But Cherith Beck , a Griffin spokeswoman , suggested that Griffin ’s higher number might refer to all cases he worked on in any capacity .
“ Just wanted to clarify , make sure you had an understanding that prosecuted means it ’s a case he handled while he was there ; it does n’t mean that it went to trial necessarily , ” Beck said .
“ Prosecuted means he handled those cases in one form or another . ”
Griffin ’s prosecutorial experience at Ft. Campbell is important in evaluating Griffin ’s fitness to serve as the top federal prosecutor in the Eastern District of Arkansas since the bulk of Griffin ’s legal career has been in political operations , such as opposition research on Democrats or work as a Republican staffer on Capitol Hill .
Seeking to burnish Griffin ’s prosecutorial credentials , his backers also have cited a letter of recommendation dated Aug. 13 , 2002 , from then - Little Rock U.S. Attorney H.E. “ Bud ” Cummins III praising Griffin ’s nine months of work as one of his assistants .
On NBC ’s “ Meet the Press ” last Sunday , Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah , a senior Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee , hailed Griffin as “ a person with prosecutorial experience who the attorney – who the U.S. Attorney who was going to be removed said was his right - hand man and one of the best prosecutors he had . ”
In an e-mail to me , however , Cummins disputed Hatch ’s characterization of the letter .
“ I do n’t see here where I referred to him as my ‘ right arm , ’ ” Cummins said .
“ I do n’t know where they are getting that .
Tim [ Griffin ] worked hard and did a good job organizing the launch of what became a very successful PSN [ Project Safe Neighborhoods ] program .
But the great success was at least equally due , if not a great deal more , to the efforts of virtually every prosecutor in the office after his departure . ”
False Talking Points Cummins noted that Hatch also made disparaging remarks about Carol Lam , the U.S. Attorney in San Diego who was another of the eight federal prosecutors fired last year because the White House and Justice Department did n’t rate them highly on lists that included an assessment of whether they were “ loyal Bushies . ”
“ I imagine Senator Hatch will be very upset with the person or persons that fed him all the wrong information , ” Cummins said in the e-mail .
“ I know he does n’t want to put HIS credibility at risk , too .
Sounds like he was provided talking points by someone as reckless with the facts as other previous occurrences in this saga .
“ I have lost count of the public statements they have made that are simply wrong , or at least obviously deceptive .
It smacks of desperation .
You wonder if the bosses know the underlings are composing talking points for them with such little regard for the facts . ”
In an earlier phone interview , Cummins told me he had no clear recollection of Griffin actually trying any case during his nine - month stint in Little Rock .
“ I honestly do n’t remember , ” Cummins said .
“ He may have tried one or two but nothing jumps out at me . ”
Cummins added that Griffin “ got a lot of indictments but other people had to try his cases because he left . ”
Griffin quit his job with U.S. Attorney Cummins to go to work as an opposition researcher for the 2004 Bush - Cheney campaign .
It was in such political assignments that Griffin became a favorite of White House deputy chief of staff Karl Rove whose office pressed for Griffin ’s appointment as U.S. Attorney in Little Rock starting in 2005 .
In December 2006 , Griffin was named to replace Cummins , a Republican who was well - regarded for his fairness by both Republican and Democratic lawyers in Arkansas .
Cummins was put on the Justice Department hit list as early as March 2005 with Griffin tapped as his replacement by January 2006 , according to internal administration documents and e-mails .
Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and other administration officials have denied acting improperly in the prosecutor purge , but Gonzales is under increasing fire from Congress over a series of inaccurate explanations about how and why the firings occurred .
Griffin ’s other principal experience in a prosecutor ’s office came early in his career , in the mid-1990s , when he was hired as an associate to special prosecutor David Barrett , a Republican lawyer who was appointed by a conservative - dominated three - judge panel , to investigate alleged misstatements by President Bill Clinton ’s Housing and Urban Affairs Secretary Henry Cisneros about payments to a mistress .
Cisneros , then one of the most promising Hispanic politicians in the United States , eventually pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of lying to the FBI about the payments , effectively destroying his career .
In the final report on the case , Barrett thanked Griffin “ for helping in the early stages of the investigation . ”
Griffin ’s résumé , however , paints a more substantial picture of his role , saying he “ interviewed numerous witnesses with the FBI and supervised the execution of a search warrant , drafted subpoenas and pleadings and questioned witnesses before a federal grand jury . ”
Griffin next went to work for the House Committee on Government Reform , which was looking into other alleged offenses by Democrats , including improper campaign contributions .
‘ Oppo ’ Researcher
In September 1999 , Griffin joined the Bush - Cheney campaign as deputy research director handling what ’s known in the Washington political world as “ oppo ” or opposition research , digging up dirt on political opponents .
He also worked as a legal adviser in the Florida recount battle that gained Bush the White House .
In 2001 , Bush appointed Griffin as a special assistant to Michael Chertoff , assistant attorney general at the Justice Department ’s criminal division .
During five months on the job , Griffin “ tracked ” issues for Chertoff , such as extradition and provisional arrest , according to Griffin ’s résumé .
Griffin then spent nine months in Little Rock as a special assistant to U.S. Attorney Cummins before returning to the political world where he was named research director and deputy communication director for the 2004 Bush - Cheney campaign .
Griffin ’s campaign initiatives included the use of a technique known as “ caging ” to identify suspect voters .
Griffin ’s team sent letters to newly registered voters in envelopes barring any forwarding , so they would be returned if a voter was n’t at that address .
BBC investigative reporter Greg Palast uncovered Griffin ’s role in this practice that proved especially effective in “ caging ” African - Americans who lived in low - income areas or who were in the U.S. military .
“ Caged ” voters would then be challenged by Republican lawyers when they arrived at the polls or cast absentee ballots .
After Bush secured a second term , Griffin joined the White House staff as deputy director for political affairs under Karl Rove .
Griffin ’s résumé again portrayed him playing an important role .
Starting in April 2005 , Griffin said he “ advised President George W. Bush and Vice President Richard B. Cheney on political matters , organized and coordinated political support for the President ’s agenda , including the nomination of Judge John Roberts to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court . ”
Military Lawyer Griffin ’s brief
White House service was interrupted in September 2005 when he reported for active duty as an attorney at Ft. Campbell , Kentucky .
It was there where Griffin claimed to put significant prosecutorial experience under his belt .
Griffin ’s
Web site states that “ At Fort Campbell , he prosecuted 40 criminal cases .
One of those , U.S. v. Mikel drew national interest after Private Mikel attempted to murder his platoon sergeant and fired upon his unit ’s early morning formation .
Private Mikel pleaded guilty to attempted murder and was sentenced to 25 years in prison . ”
When I asked the Army to identify the cases prosecuted by Griffin at Ft. Campbell , the Army ’s public relations office replied , “ According to our SJA [ Staff Judge Advocate ] office , Major Griffin was involved in these three cases ( guilty pleas before a military judge alone ) as an assistant trial counsel at Ft. Campbell , US vs. Hurst , vs. Mikel , and vs. Edwards . ”
Then , after a tour of about three months as an Army lawyer in Iraq , Griffin returned to the United States where the White House offered him the job as U.S. Attorney in Little Rock .
Over the preceding two years , White House and Justice Department officials had collaborated to create the vacancy by ousting Griffin ’s old boss , U.S. Attorney Cummins .
Although the Justice Department initially denied knowing “ of Karl Rove playing any role in the decision to appoint Griffin , ” an e-mail by Gonzales ’s chief of staff Kyle Sampson revealed that Griffin ’s appointment was “ important to Harriet , Karl , etc. , ” in a reference to then - White House counsel Harriet Miers and Karl Rove .
As a furor arose over the firing of the eight U.S. Attorneys , Sampson resigned .
However , in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on March 29 , he insisted there was no contradiction between the initial denial about Rove ’s role and the e-mail because he only “ assumed ” Rove ’s interest from the pressure coming from Rove ’s staff to grant Griffin the appointment .
Griffin ’s appointment also has proved controversial because Gonzales exercised a new emergency power that was put into the USA Patriot Act to give the Attorney General discretion to name U.S. Attorneys without the normal Senate approval .
Both houses of Congress have now voted to rescind that power .
Griffin also has indicated he will not submit himself to the Senate confirmation process .
Griffin told the Arkansas Democrat Gazette that “ I have made the decision not to let my name go forward to the Senate . … I do n’t want to be part of that partisan circus . ”
One of the questions Griffin may want to avoid is a detailed recounting of his courtroom experience .

Apple 's sales are still soaring
The firm said it took a charge of $ 84 m ( £ 43 m ) for misdated options , some of which were awarded to boss Steve Jobs .
But Apple reiterated that its probe had found no misconduct by any current management , including Mr Jobs .
Like many other tech firms , Apple has admitted that some options awarded to executives had had their dates changed .
The effect of such a change could make options more lucrative when cashed in , if the changed date produced a lower price at which they could be exercised .
Many of the more than 150 firms implicated in backdating have been investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) .
Apple said it was providing both the SEC and the Department of Justice with details of its internal inquiry .
The company also reported its results for the year ending in September 2006 , which showed a 39 % increase in sales to $ 19.3bn .
Macintosh laptops , up 43 % , and iPods , up 69 % , drove the sales boost - with the iPod numbers resulting in Apple , for the first time , making more money from selling iPod music players than by selling computers .
On an unaudited basis , the firm said it made profits for the year to September 2006 of $ 1.99 bn - up 50 % .
The news helped lift Apple 's shares , which closed $ 3.97 , or 4.9 % , higher at $ 84.80 .
Concerns
Steve Jobs did not benefit from any misdated options , Apple said
In its 29 December filing , Apple said : " The board ... is confident that the company has corrected the problems that led to the restatement .
" It has complete confidence in Steve Jobs and the senior management team . "
The filing reiterated the findings released in October of its internal investigation , set up by a special committee of directors , which cleared current management .
But it also found that 15 stock option awards between 1997 and 2002 " appear ( ed ) to have grant dates that precede the approval of those grants " .
The firm said the investigation also voiced concerns about two unnamed former executives .
' Unaware '
It remains unclear exactly what the problem has been , although several December reports have suggested that documents may have been altered .
During the day after the reports , Apple 's share price sank as much as 5 % , although it later recouped the day 's losses .
The new filing says that while chief executive Mr Jobs did not himself gain from the backdated grants and was unaware of their accounting significance , he nevertheless was " aware or recommended the selection of " some of the favourable dates .
It also gives details of the grants which were misdated .
Many , it suggests , were the result of dating options to when a compensation committee agreed them , instead of when the board signed them off .
In some cases , the discrepancy was a single day - although for many the difference in dates is not specified .
Steve Jobs ' options
For Mr Jobs , Apple 's founder , the investigation found that one of two grants made between 1997 and 2002 had the wrong date .
The grant of 7.5 million options was initially approved at a board meeting in August 2001 .
They were dated 19 October and priced at that day 's share price of $ 18.30 - up from $ 17.83 at the August meeting .
In fact , they were not finalised until 18 December , by which time Apple shares were worth $ 21.01 .
The investigation found board sign - off had been " improperly recorded " as occurring at a 19 October " special board meeting " - a meeting it said had never occurred .
However , the company said that no evidence had been found that " any current member of management was aware of this irregularity " .
Both the October grant and an earlier , correctly - dated one of 10 million options were surrendered by Mr Jobs in 2003 before they were used , resulting in no benefit to him .
There was no money in it at first -- but Mr. Adler was no stranger to making do with little .
As a child growing up in Brooklyn , he lived with his parents , his two brothers and assorted relatives in his grandparents ' house .
At one point , 11 people shared a bathroom , " but it seemed a glorious childhood , " he said .
He was a so - so student -- " I read voraciously but I hated studying " -- but still made it through New York University , majoring in English .
He took a job as a copy boy at The Daily News , " because it was the closest I could get to the printed word . "
One day , on a Long Island beach , he struck up a conversation with Sonia Kline .
They married in May 1951 and have three sons .
After a stint in the Army and a briefer stint in public relations , Mr. Adler started his own ad agency .
By then , he had written three novels .
Publishers were monumentally uninterested -- until 1973 , when he struck a deal with Whitman Publishing : he publicized John David Garcia 's " The Moral Society " free , and Whitman published " Options , " Mr. Adler 's third book .
" Options " bombed -- but he was finally a published author .
That made it easier to get G.P. Putnam 's Sons to publish " Banquet Before Dawn " in 1974 .
The advance was just $ 4,000 , " but it felt like I 'd won the lottery , " Mr. Adler said .
" It was the defining moment of my life . "
Putnam published six more of his novels .
Then it was bought by Universal Pictures , and " they dumped me , " Mr. Adler said .
Warner Books picked him up and published " War of the Roses . "
He has learned from the many business mistakes he made along the way .
In the 70's he sold the movie rights to " Trans- Siberian Express " for $ 250,000 ; the movie was never made , but he could not get the rights back .
When he sold movie rights to " Private Lies " several years later , he made sure the rights reverted to him after 10 years .
Still , the writing life has been good to him .
He lived in Hollywood , working on movie scripts .
And he lived in Washington for years , hobnobbing with politicos .
For the last 15 years , the Adlers have lived in Jackson Hole , Wyo. , most of the time , and on Manhattan 's Sutton Place some of the time .
Reader Questions and Answers
Why can't the man swallow his own seed if the woman does not want to ?
It would not be homosexual because it is his own , and it would not spill .
How can I partake of the spiritual replenishment of the living water without being homosexual ?
There is nothing in the Scriptures that prohibits a man from swallowing his own semen if he so chooses .
In fact , this is an ideal solution for avoiding the sin of “ spilling seed ” if the female partner is not willing to swallow , or if the man is masturbating alone .
As you point out , there is nothing homosexual about swallowing your own semen because it does not involve having sex with another man .
However , if you do choose to swallow your own ejaculate , be careful not to get any on yourself or your clothes .
The same requirements regarding semen and cleanliness still apply ( Leviticus 15:16 - 17 ) .
My boyfriend and I drink each other 's semen .
We do n’t have oral sex because we believe it is forbidden by the scripture .
We believe that it is the way God intended us to be - just like David and Jonathan .
You cite the Biblical story of David and Jonathan , which describes a close spiritual relationship between two men - ” the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David , and Jonathan loved him as his own soul . ”
( 1 Samuel 18:1 ) Jonathan and David loved each other deeply , and even wore the same clothes ( “ And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him , and gave it to David , and his garments , even to his sword , and to his bow , and to his girdle .
[ 1 Samuel 18:1 ] ) .
However , the Bible does n’t say anything about them having sex or swallowing each other ’s semen .
You and your friend would be better off each drinking your own semen , as described above .
If you want to do it together , that ’s probably OK , as long as you do n’t touch each other .
This is complete blasphemy .
You must take this down .
To suggest that the Lord Jesus Christ propositioned a woman for a blowjob is preposterous .
You are sinning against God by twisting the words of His son .
You need to take this down , for your own good .
We did not mean to suggest that Jesus was propositioning the woman at the well or asked her to give him a blowjob .
Of course not !
Jesus would never do that .
In fact , he refuses to give her the “ living water ” himself .
When she asks him to give her the living water ( semen ) , Christ tells the woman to get her husband .
This is so he ( Christ ) could instruct her on how to give a blowjob to her husband and receive the living water from her husband .
Thank you for your concern , and we hope this clarifies matters .
You f*****g idiots .
If you did any research at all , you 'd understand the true meaning of the texts you cite .
Christ 's " living water " was not referring to semen , you f*****g a ** holes .
He was referring to spiritual enlightenment .
When one learns how to learn , there are no limits to your future knowledge .
That ’s what he meant , f*****g idiots .
He fetched the husband so he can learn and hear what he has to say , not have him stand by and watch his woman giving a blowjob .
Read the texts before it and you 'll understand how the conversation started .
It has nothing to do with sex .
We agree that Christ was referring to spiritual enlightenment in the passages describing his interaction with the woman of Samaria at the well .
He was talking about spiritual enlightenment as symbolized by the “ living water , ” or semen .
At the Last Supper , when Christ broke bread with his disciples , he said , “ Take , eat ; this is my body , ” and he poured wine for them and said , “ This is my blood . ” ( 1 Cor 12 : 23-30 )
This is the symbolic ritual that we reenact when we partake in the Holy Communion .
Obviously , Jesus was n’t suggesting that his disciples cannibalize him .
And in this case , he was n’t suggesting that the woman give him a blowjob ( that ’s not what we were suggesting to begin with ; we said he was going to have her give her husband a blowjob ) .
When a woman performs oral sex on her partner , she is symbolically enacting drinking the living water of Christ .
It ’s a spiritually symbolic act .
Christ said , ” If any man thirst , let him come unto me , and drink .
38 He that believeth on me , as the scripture hath said , out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water . ” ( John 7:37 - 38 )
Of course , Jesus is talking metaphorically about living water in this case ; if a man literally drank the living water of Christ , that would make him gay .
But by accepting Jesus as his savior , a man then metaphorically partakes in the living water of Christ and then has his own source of living water that flows from his belly ( we think they probably meant loins , but “ belly ” is close enough ) .
It could be argued that women also have this source of living water – their vaginal juices .
So every time a woman practices oral sex on a man , or vice versa , they are symbolically enacting drinking the living water of Christ .
There ’s no reason spiritual enlightenment and sexual expression have to be mutually exclusive .
In fact , they are both so much more powerful when you put them together .
We ’re sorry this issue has caused you to become so upset to the point of using obscene language .
We will be praying for you to find peace .
I 've never read in my Bible where adultery is okay with a spouse 's permission .
This is disgusting .
I would like to see you back up God permitting this with scripture .
My Bible talks about relations between a man and man AND woman and woman being WRONG , and that there is unity between ONE man AND ONE wife .
The Bible is clear when it tells us “ Do not commit adultery . ”
However , what is at issue here is the definition of adultery .
In Biblical times , wives were considered the property of their husbands , and the crime ( or sin ) of adultery was basically defined by one man violating another man ’s property rights by using ( having sex with ) that man ’s property ( his wife ) .
The wife was also often considered culpable , because in having sex with another man , she was defying her husband .
As we see in Numbers 5:12 - 14 , a woman could be tried for adultery without even committing the act , simply if her husband became jealous because he suspected her of cheating on him .
This is why Old Testament kings could have hundreds of wives and concubines without being “ adulterers ” – although they were married , and had sex with many women , they were n’t committing adultery because none of those women were married to other men .
On the other hand , if one of King David ’s hundreds of wives , for example , had a fling with a stable hand , they could have both been put to death .
In these more enlightened times , we no longer consider wives to be property , so this definition of adultery is obsolete .
Although the male is still considered the leader within the marriage and the family , the husband and wife are more or less equal partners .
They must respect each other , and anything that undermines this respect and trust undermines the marriage .
However , if they are open and honest about their relationships with others , and if there is no jealousy or distrust created between them , then there is no cause for blame or guilt .
We have a close friend next door who has been widowed for a number of years and does n't wish to remarry .
Yet , at 61 , we can see that physically she is lonely and longing for lost intimacy .
Could we invite her into our bed ?
We are all the same age and so reproduction is n't an issue .
This is a perfect example of a couple being called to share the divine love of their relationship with another in the spirit of Christian charity .
This situation would seem to fit all of the criteria that we outlined for a Christian threesome .
Since your friend is widowed , adultery is not a problem from that perspective .
If your wife is open to this arrangement , there is no reason for you not to open up your bed , and your hearts to this woman , sharing your love for each other and for the Lord .
Police were heavily armed for their assault on the slum
Guns and grenades were used in the fighting , with armoured vehicles and helicopters backing police units .
The violence began when more than 1,000 policemen advanced on Alemao , the slum stronghold of a drug - dealing gang .
Rio de Janeiro officials are trying to make the city safer before it hosts the Pan - American games on 13 July .
Some 5,500 athletes and around 800,000 tourists are expected to visit the city for the games .
The city is also one of the host venues for the global series of Live Earth rock concerts on 7 July .
This is a war .

More than 30 people had been killed and 80 injured since the police first surrounded the slums in northern Rio known as the German Complex on 2 May .
But Wednesday 's police operation was the biggest to date , triggering fierce fighting for several hours in the slums which are home to some 100,000 people .
Caught in cross-fire
There were conflicting reports of how many people had died , but police said 19 had been killed in the fighting by early on Thursday .
Several people were also reported to have been injured by stray bullets .
Local residents have often been caught in the gunfire
" This is a war .
My granddaughter was hit by a bullet in her home , " a resident told Brazil 's Agencia Estado news agency .
The authorities have defended the operation and say all those killed were suspected drug dealers .
" We must retake control of the slums and instil public order .
The goal is to put an end to the traffickers ' arsenals , " state public safety secretary Jose Mariano Beltrame said .
Up to 1,300 officers were involved in Wednesday 's raid , the majority heavily armed and wearing flak jackets and some driving in reinforced vehicles .
Gang members set up barricades and created oil slicks to slow down the police assault .
The BBC's Gary Duffy in Sao Paulo says the police face a formidable opposition as many members of the drug gangs have high - calibre weapons .
In a recent exchange of gunfire a man was killed at a petrol station up to 2 km ( 1.2 miles ) from where the shot was originally fired .
The operation has been criticised by local community groups and human rights organisations and it is clear local people have been suffering considerably , our correspondent says .
Police were patrolling the streets and controlling all access points to the slums on Thursday , officials said .
Several schools were closed .
The Bush administration argues the Kyoto protocol would hurt the U.S. economy and objects that high - polluting developing nations like China and India are not required to reduce emissions .
- AP
Why ?
Because if we reduce carbon emissions along with EVERYONE ELSE ON THE PLANET ... What is more important , saving the world or worrying about our economy ?
Why are we worried about our economy , when EVERY other country is n't worried about theirs ?
And if they are worried about their economies , why have they decided to forgo their concerns to fight global warming while we have not ?
Maybe they realize a correlation between the two that the current administration does not .
As the standard cliche has it , Suburbia USA is consumerist wasteland where endless rows identical houses define a dreary landscape of dull conformity .
The anthem for that sentiment is Malvina Reynolds ' song " Little Boxes , " which became a hit for folkie Pete Seeger in 1964 :
Little boxes on the hillside , Little boxes made of tickytacky
Little boxes on the hillside , little boxes all the same
There 's a green one and a pink one and a blue one and a yellow one
And they 're all made out of ticky tacky and they all look just the same .
As it happens , Malvina had a particular place in mind when she wrote her anti-suburban sing - along : The Westlake District of Daly City , California , just south of San Francisco .
To wit :
Westlake has earned some unflattering nicknames over the years .
Malvina Reynolds ’ folk song “ Little Boxes ” was inspired by Westlake ’s “ ticky - tacky ” houses , visible along the highway during a car trip she took through Daly City in 1962 .
Forty years later , however , Westlake may be getting the last laugh .
Inspired by our recent discovery of the deliciously retro Italian - American restaurant Joe's of Westlake , Telstar Logistics recently spent some time surveying the neighborhood , and it turns out to be far more interesting than the stereotypes ( and Pete Seeger ) would suggest .
First , a little bit of history about Westlake and its developer :
Henry Doelger was America ’s largest homebuilder during most of the 1930’s , and ended up building much of San Francisco ’s Sunset district .
In 1945 , he purchased a large tract of land adjoining San Francisco .
This sandy , foggy area , comprised of pig ranches and cabbage farms , seemed remote and unappealing to Doelger ’s advisors , who thought he ’d made an expensive mistake .
But his legendary business foresight proved 20 / 20 again – the postwar housing boom was poised to begin .
If there is such a thing as a “ good ” suburb , that ’s what Doelger wanted Westlake to be – a fully planned “ city within a city ” of houses , schools , shopping centers , offices , medical facilities , churches , and parks , right next to San Francisco .
But in order to be economically viable , the homes had to be affordable to average people , so Doelger and his company had to invent ways to keep construction costs down while making them attractive enough to lure buyers from the city .
Today , Westlake remains a middle - class place of freshly - painted little boxes perched on the hillside , one after the other , each with a late - model car in the driveway .
But it all seems rather pleasant , and not so ticky - tacky .
Moreover , unlike East Coast Levittowns , the homes in Westlake remain curiously unmarred by later additions and remodels , and thanks to lots of loving maintenance and lawn care , the area 's architecture now exudes midcentury - modern cool .
( A chicken in every pot !
An Eames Lounge chair in every living room ! )
Driving the streets feels like cruising through a time capsule of late 1950s America , with all the innocence and optimism that era embodied .
And in 2006 , that seems strangely reassuring .
Most tangibly , no suburban development looks this good after so many years unless the people who live there feel that they have an investment in the place as a community .
Westlake was a success , despite the criticism it generated when it was first built .
Come 2046 , it 'll be interesting to see if the same can be said of the even more identical , even more ticky - tacky developments being erected today by the likes of Pulte and KB Homes .

Zyprexa is by far Lilly ’s best - selling product , with $ 4.2 billion in sales in 2005 , 30 percent of its overall revenues .
About two million people worldwide received it last year .
Based in Indianapolis , Lilly is the sixth - largest American drug company .
The issue of off - label marketing is controversial in the drug industry .
Nearly every company is under either civil or criminal investigation for alleged efforts to expand the use of its drugs beyond the specific illness or condition for which they are approved .
Lilly faces federal and state investigations over its marketing of Zyprexa .
In its annual report for 2005 , Lilly said that it faced an investigation by federal prosecutors in Pennsylvania and that the Florida attorney general ’s office had subpoenaed the company “ seeking production of documents relating to sales of Zyprexa and our marketing and promotional practices with respect to Zyprexa . ”
Since Lilly introduced Zyprexa in 1996 , about 20 million patients worldwide have received the drug , which helps control the hallucinations and delusions associated with schizophrenia and severe mania .
But Zyprexa also causes weight gain in many patients , and the American Diabetes Association found in 2004 that Zyprexa was more likely to cause diabetes than other widely used drugs for schizophrenia .
Lilly says that no link between Zyprexa and diabetes has been proven .
As part of the “ Viva Zyprexa ” campaign , in packets for its sales representatives , Eli Lilly created the profiles of patients whom it said would be suitable candidates for Zyprexa .
Representatives were told to discuss the patient profiles with doctors .
One of the patients was a woman in her 20s who showed mild symptoms of schizophrenia , while another was a man in his 40s who appeared to have bipolar disorder .
The third patient was “ Martha , ” a widow with adult children “ who lives independently and has been your patient for some time . ”
Martha was described as being agitated and having disturbed sleep , but without the symptoms of paranoia or mania that typically marked a person with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder .
Ms. Nobles said that Lilly had actually intended Martha ’s profile to represent a patient with schizophrenia .
But psychiatrists outside the company said this claim defied credibility , especially given Martha ’s age .
Instead , she appeared to have mild dementia , they said .
Well done to all those Reg readers who donated cash to the campaign to release Iranian teenager Nazanin Fatehi , who secured her freedom on Wednesday .
Fatehi was in January 2006 " sentenced to death for murder by court in Iran after she stabbed one of three men who attempted to rape her and her 16 - year - old niece in a park in Karaj ( a suburb of Tehran ) in March 2005 " .
A retrial spared her the rope , but she remained in prison until supporters could raise 400 m Rials ( approx $ 43,000 ) bail .
Well , thanks to an extensive web and press campaign , the Help Nazanin site collected " $ 31,000 USD in online donations , $ 1,000 in cheques and $ 1,000 in Iran " .
Member of Canadian Parliament Belinda Stronach generously covered the rest of the amount , and Fatehi is now back with her family .
Help Nazanin has an update here , complete with heartwarming pictures .
All those who donated can award themselves a well - deserved pint . ®
If you need your home computer to be fixed do n't go to PC World 's repair centre , a new report has warned .
Consumer magazine Computing Which ?
carried out an undercover investigation of independent and major stores that offer a computer repair service .
It targeted PC World because it 's the only major store that offers to fix computers even if not originally purchased at one of its stores .
The magazine 's researchers deliberately " broke " computers in order to assess the level of service at various repair centres across the UK .
On half of the computers they simply deleted a Windows start up file to prevent the operating system from er , starting .
On the remaining computers they loosened a hard disk cable .
The " faulty " computers were then taken along to a total of 20 PC repairers and the results of the investigation showed that the independent stores performed much better than big boys PC World .
Diagnosis of the faults at PC World ranged from reinstalling Windows to advising the " customer " to replace their computer .
In some instances the reinstallation led to personal data being lost as work had not been backed up .
Repair costs also varied wildly at PC World between £ 69.99 and a staggering £ 350 .
On the whole , independent stores provided a better service according to the report , with more accurate diagnosis and repair costs typically lower than PC World .
In the report , Computing Which ?
advised its readers not to go to PC World if they need to get their computer repaired .
The magazine 's editor said : " We think that they [ PC World ] should overhaul their training – they could learn a lot from independent retailers . "
A PC World spokeswoman said the Which ?
report was not representative of the level of service and expertise offered by the chain .
" PC World 's skilled engineers have fixed more than two million PC problems for customers in the last year , and in nine of 10 PC repairs there was no requirement to fit a spare part , " she said .
She says the Which ?
visits preceeded " an extensive overhaul of our national support operation , including our services for customers in - store " .
" We 'd like to stress that our pricing for all services is transparent , and we always discuss the potential cost with customers prior to carrying out any installation or repair service .
In many , if not most cases , the actual cost is considerably lower than the initial estimate . " ®
Frown and the Net Frowns With You , But Smile and You Smile Alone
That ’s according to a study which assessed the effects of smileys :) and frownies :( as I ’m now calling them .
Walther and D’Addario ( 2001 ) found that while smileys had no effect on the way a message was interpreted , frowns did reduce the positivity of positive messages .
Overall , though , the effect of emoticons was relatively small .
These results do n’t seem to tie up with a study I reported recently about the effects of emoticons and capitalisation on how email is perceived which did find a positive effect for smileys .
But this study used different measures along with taking into account personality variables .
Plus it compared a smiley emoticon with no emoticon , rather than with a frowny emoticon as did Walther and D’Addario ( 2001 ) .
Time of day and delay
But emoticons and capitalisation are not the only nonverbal cues that have been studied in ‘ computer mediated communication ’ .
Time of day and delay before replying are two key nonverbal cues in email .
Walther and Tidwell ( 1995 ) looked at both of these .
Work emails sent at night received the higher ratings for dominance when compared with the same email sent during the day .
The opposite was seen for social emails , where more dominance was attributed to emails sent during the day .
Looking at the delay in replying to emails , affection towards work email replies was highest when quick during the day , while lowest when they were quick at night .
The reverse findings were seen for social messages with quick replies at night attracting the most affection .
Avatars
A few studies have also examined choice of avatars .
These are images people chose to represent themselves in online chat or in online games .
Contrary to expectations , one study found that generally the more abstract and less human - like an avatar was , the more likely it was to provoke interest ( Nowak & Biocca , 2003 ) .
Another study has found that when avatars with facial expressions are used , these are communicated to humans , although only to a limited extent ( Ku et al. , 2005 ) .
Masters of meaning
All this research shows it ’s amazing how much we can infer from so little information .
You ’d be forgiven for thinking that nonverbal behaviour in emails or instant messaging or even avatar choice was non-existent , and what there was did n’t make much difference .
But this research just goes to show humans are masters at squeezing every last ounce of meaning from everything we ’re presented with , even it ’s only a colon followed by a left bracket .

You 're wrong and should be ignored , but do n't worry , you 're loved .
If you 're reading this article , you 're likely a hardcore videogame fan .
You read message boards , and you 're not afraid to tell developers what they 're screwing up .
I 'm here to tell you that if you 're a member of a specific videogame 's community , your opinion should be ignored .
Your thoughts must be digested - it's hard to ignore loud screaming - but discarded .
It sounds harsh and definitely wo n't be a popular opinion , but the most dangerous thing a developer can do is listen to his hardcore community .
The hardcore can and have led developers astray .
Before a game undergoes production , developers write what 's called a design document .
Detailing various technical and operational aspects of a game , it functions as the team 's battle plan , but it 's hardly a static document .
It is fluid , evolving as development progresses .
It is on the strength or weakness of these documents that good or bad games are born .
Too often , though , perfectly good games get confused , turned around and bashed over the head by those who claim to love them most .
It 's tragic , really .
They enter beta , with all their bright ideas and shiny new toys and then some 14 - year - old screams , " This sucks ! "
At a company with strong leadership and vision , this is read , digested and considered , but rarely do they succumb to the mighty weight of one 14 - year - old and a few of his buddies .
At a not - so - steady company , a post or 10 like that can be fatal .
Welcome to a world of reactionary development .
Every time the community screams , the developers shift focus and try to put out that fire .
Suddenly , the game is no longer in development , but rather in commercial service , and this is wrong .
Testing phases are for testing and there is no way to say with any idea of accuracy that something truly does suck until all the spices are in the pot .
Games are huge undertakings .
Clever designers , like good cooks , need all the different ingredients to work together for the final result to be appetizing .
Like cooking , you cannot just go " voila " and have the whole friggen game there .
It takes time , it takes massaging , it takes patience .
You , my hardcore friends , lack patience .
The hardcore , for the most part , play games in beta the way they 'd play any old game they got from Best Buy .
They try to get better , they try to win .
When they find something boring , they scream and yell .
Yet , for some reason , those egocentric screams are fatal .
It is extremely hard to build a work of art while people piss and moan about how much they hate it .
Imagine Leonardo da Vinci with a group of art critics in his studio as he painted the Mona Lisa .
He 'd end up with a brown canvas .
When too many people are yelling contradictory opinions , and developers try to accommodate them all , they get a brown canvas ; something that is entirely innocuous , but completely pointless .
These are also known as unremarkable or - dare I say - bad games .
Yet it happens every day , and I blame the increased importance of online communities for the current dilution and sameness of so many games , especially in the MMOG genre .

Red China , Inc. Does Communism Work After All ?
China is securing an ever - bigger share of the world market with the methods of a planned economy .
Competitors and economists alike are astounded by the country 's seemingly unstoppable march to becoming a global economic superpower .
The development has left many wondering : Does communism work after all ?
Five years ago , when the World Trade Centre fell , the shockwave rolled around the world .
It ruined many lives , and sank a few companies .
But who could have known that it would hit Sir Trevor Baylis 's business so hard ?
Baylis , the British inventor best known for the wind - up radio , was developing a shoe that would charge your mobile phone battery as you walked .
The shoe , complete with a slot for the battery , captured some of the power generated by the average human step , roughly eight watts , and used it to charge a phone over thousands of strides .
Baylis had even walked 100 miles across the Namibian desert to raise money for the idea .
But his idea collapsed along with the twin towers .
" After 9/11 , anyone wearing electric shoes would look like a bomber .
That 's what you have to watch with any electric kit that you carry nowadays , " muses Bailey .
Richard Reid , who tried to blow up a plane by carrying explosives in his heels - which subsequently made customs officials particularly nervous about footwear - has a lot to answer for .
The idea of harvesting otherwise wasted energy is n't new , but it 's beginning to gain traction .
Not only are researchers hoping to reap the energy from people , but they 're also planning to use the vibrations from motors and even passing trains to generate power .
In some cases , converting vibrations into a tiny charge may be enough to power a wireless sensor .
In others , thousands of footsteps could power lights and audio systems .
Historically , piezoelectricity has been the biggest hope for energy harvesters .
Discovered in 1880 , piezoelectric crystals , emit a charge when subjected to sudden mechanical stress .
When you press the button on an electric lighter or the ignition switch on your gas oven , a piezocrystal is probably causing the spark .
Spring in your step
In 1996 , MIT Media Lab doctoral student Thad Starner wrote a paper on the potential for " energy harvesting " .
Using a piezoelectric shoe insert that flexed with each step , or a flywheel system connected to a small spring in the back of the shoe , five to eight watts could be recovered from each footfall , Starner 's paper said .
Other options for harvesting human energy included finger motion ( a 90 words per minute typist could generate 19 milliwatts ) .
Starner believed that by using footfall energy alone , he could power a small wearable computer .
Building a five - watt wearable computer in the lab is one thing , but commercialising wearable computing and wearable power would involve a huge design and user testing effort .
Besides , such a computing technology has n't captured the public imagination yet .
People do n't want to walk around looking like one of the Borg from Star Trek .
Moreover , a key problem in wearable computing is getting power from one place to another .
Cables tangle , rub and break .
Dr Stan Swallow , director of Intelligent Textiles , hopes to transfer energy around the human body more easily .
His company develops material that transfers power using electrical circuitry woven into " smart fabric " .
And while wearable computers might be a niche market , iPods are n't .
" The iPod single - handedly created a common format for everyone to work with , " he says .
" Suddenly your market is composed of everyone who 's an iPod owner . "
We 've already seen some jackets with built - in circuitry designed to control MP3 players .
How long before clothes emerge that carry energy around the body to power that iPod while you walk or run ?
Or how about clothes that harvest power directly ?
Dr Markys Cain , who runs the Sensor Knowledge Transfer Network at the National Physics Laboratory , hopes to see fabric that generates its own power using piezoelectric fibres woven into frequently moving joints such as elbows and knees .
" You can incorporate ceramic fibres , around which technology has increased dramatically in the last few years .
You put them into polymer mats .
They are flexible , and you can get millimetres of actuation , " he says .
Swallow puts it simply : " Your iPod will run on so little power , and your trousers will contain so much . "
Finger power
While improvements in energy harvesting technology generate more energy , power consumption in computing devices is falling .
That could make consumer - friendly computers running on harvested energy workable .
New generations of displays from firms like e-Ink are appearing , which only draw power when the image changes .
Solid state memory removes the need to spin hard drives at high speeds , points out Simon Powell , managing director of piezoelectric lock company Servocell .
" If you have Flash RAM and you only use energy to write and read from it , it all just about becomes viable , " he says .
But wearable computing may not be the killer application for harvested energy .
Piezoelectricity can power wireless sensors , for example , that can use the energy to communicate with other devices in a certain range .
With finger motion , Starner believed he could give a wireless keyboard enough power to transmit keystroke information to another device .
Today , Ennocean sells wireless light switches that use the energy generated by flipping the switch to communicate with a bulb and turn it on - no cabling necessary .
That makes Claire Price 's eyes light up .
She is a director of the Facility Architects , a London - based group working on energy harvesting in buildings .
The company is involved in the Pacesetters project , an initiative to design energy - harvesting floors and stairs for large public spaces .
Price 's team will put devices under such surfaces to collect the energy from footfalls , and use it to power local systems .
" You can convert about 3 - 6 W per step , " she says .
" Think of Victoria train station .
In one rush hour period there are 34,000 people walking through that space .
There are many kilowatts of energy that we could be harvesting and ploughing back into low - power circuits . "
These include audio equipment , display screens , or , by her calculation , around 6.5 million LED lights .
But Price is unlikely to use piezoelectricity for the Pacesetters project , because she does n't think it has an high enough efficiency .
Working with Jim Gilbert , a researcher at Hull University - who also worked with Baylis on the abandoned electric shoe - the Facility has investigated hydraulic systems and electromagnetic rotary generators .
She believes that the opportunities for harvesting energy on a mass scale in public spaces are huge .
If floors in railway stations , then why not pavements in Trafalgar Square ?
If pavements in Trafalgar Square , then why not bridges ?
" Think about Norman Foster 's wobbly bridge , where they spent millions on damping equipment , " she says .
" You could have applied energy harvesting devices within those dampers . "
Servocell 's Powell , a former Cambridge lecturer and patent holder in several piezoelectric applications , agrees : " If you had piezos on that , you could probably have lit it with LEDs , " he says .
Price is also working with Perpetuum , a small research company that has developed electromagnetic rotary generators that harvest vibrational energy .
She wants to attach the devices to sleepers on train tracks to pick up the energy from passing trains .
That could be used to power wireless transmissions , says Roy Freeland , chief executive of Perpetuum .
" One of the main problems on railway systems is goods wagons breaking down .
No one monitors them and there 's no power source to do that .
We could monitor them not only for bearing failure , but could use the generators to power transmission systems that tell people where the railway wagons are . "
And what of Baylis ?
Currently involved in Trevor Baylis Brands , a company that helps inventors get their ideas to market , he would like to take a stab at the electric shoe idea one more time and is looking for a large company to collaborate with .
" The shoe would have to be a trendy shoe with a mark on it , " he says , when asked about his original security concerns .
" So that if someone was wearing this , you know they had an electronic device . "
He 'd employ better computer aided design techniques to refine his shoe design , he adds , and would also switch from a piezoelectric device to something else like a rotary electric generator , which would provide a bigger power kick .
That would be a step in the right direction .
· Compressed crystals that generate power
Piezoelectricity was discovered in 1880 by Pierre and Paul - Jacques Curie , who found that compressing certain types of crystals - including quartz , tourmaline , and Rochelle salt - along certain axes produced a voltage that could be measured on the crystal 's surface .
The next year , they observed that applying an electric current could make the crystals elongate very slightly .
The charge arises when crystals which have no axis of symmetry are squeezed : the centre of the positive charge in the crystals ' ions is slightly separated from the centre of the negative charge .
That creates a net electric field , which can be measured on opposite faces of the crystal .
Similarly , applying an electric field across the faces induces the ions to move , and so deforms the crystal .
For decades this remained a laboratory curiosity , but was used in the first world war to generate ultrasound signals ( by applying a high - frequency alternating current to make a crystal vibrate ) for early sonar , and in the second world war to make impact - triggered detonators for bombs dropped from aircraft : striking the ground triggered a spark to ignite the explosives inside .
Piezoelectricity generates high voltages - a pressure sufficient to distort lead zirconate titanate by 0.05 mm generates 100,000V - but tiny currents .
However it is enough , for example , to create an electric spark to ignite gas in an oven or grill .
The piezoelectric effect has subsequently been used in electronic equipment , clocks and watches , cigarette lighters , and many other items - including the " needles " of vinyl record players , which generate electricity as the groove moves them .

Isis will be trawling the depths of Antarctica
Isis , the UK 's first deep - diving remotely operated vehicle ( ROV ) , will be combing the sea-bed in the region in its inaugural science mission .
Researchers hope to uncover more about the effects of glaciers on the ocean floor , and also find out about the animals that inhabit these waters .
The mission begins in mid-January and will last for about three weeks .
While the scientists and engineers begin their long journey to the Antarctic at the start of January , Isis left the UK shores in November and has only just arrived at its destination .
Once unpacked from its containers , the ROV will be placed aboard the British Antarctic Survey 's ship - the RSS James Clark Ross - ready to explore the Marguerite Bay area on the west side of the Antarctic Peninsula .
Diving deep
With Isis , scientists hope to bring the UK to the forefront of deep - sea research .
The submersive vessel , which is based at the National Oceanography Centre ( NOC ) , Southampton , was built in the US in collaboration with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution ( WHOI ) .
The project cost about £ 4.5 m , and Isis is based on of WHOI 's Jason II remotely operated vehicle .
UK marine scientists can book time on Isis to carry out their research into the deep .
Isis was built to withstand enormous pressure , explained Peter Mason , the Isis project manager at NOC .
It measures 2.7 m ( 9ft ) long , 2 m ( 6.5 ft ) high and 1.5 m ( 5 ft ) wide , and weighs about 3,000kg ( 6,600 lb ) in the air .
Ten kilometres of cable connect it to its " mother ship " , allowing scientists to control the vehicle and receive the data it collects in real - time .
On the ROV , Mr Mason said , were lights , cameras to produce high - quality video and still pictures , sonars for acoustic navigation and imaging , and two remotely controlled manipulator arms to collect samples or place scientific instruments on the sea-bed .
Isis , he added , also had extra capacity to carry a range of scientific tools , such as borers , nets etc , so that scientists could tailor the vehicle to their research needs .
Professor Julian Dowdeswell , director of the Scott Polar Research Institute at the University of Cambridge , is the principal investigator on this three - week - long inaugural research cruise .
The environmental history of the Antarctic is held in this sediment
Professor Julian Dowdeswell
The ROV will be traversing the relatively shallow waters of the bay to the continental shelf edge and then down the steeper continental slope beyond .
" The environmental history of the Antarctic is held in these sediments , " he said .
" Using the ROV , we can look at the sea - floor and its sub - surface structure on a very detailed scale . "
This will help the researchers better understand the record of past glacial activity in the Antarctic .
Sea creatures
Another project will also be running alongside .
Professor Paul Tyler , a deep - sea biologist at NOC , will use Isis to survey the sea creatures of Marguerite Bay .
" I 'm interested in the effects of glaciers on the sea-bed and how this affects the fauna - the animals .
I 'm also interested in how the animal life in Antarctica changes as one goes deeper and deeper into the water , " Professor Tyler said .
Spider crabs have been found in Antarctic waters ( Image : Noaa )
" We are hoping to see a whole bunch of large creatures such as star fish , sea cucumbers , sea fans , sea pens , etc , that inhabit the deep shelf slope and abyssal depths . "
He added : " Essentially no - one has explored Antarctica using a ROV at these depths . "
After this expedition , Isis will be sent to investigate the deep - sea floor off the Portuguese coast .
Professor
Tyler said : " It is great to have this kind of facility in the UK . "
Supreme Court overturns race - based school admissions Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday June 28 , 2007 Print This Email This
In a narrowly divided opinion handed down Thursday , the Supreme Court overturned school district policies that made race a factor in admissions , CNN reported .
The 5 - 4 decision backed parents in Seattle and Louisville who argued that their children were unfairly denied positions in " magnet " public schools because of their race .
Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the majority opinion , which found the school districts failed to show that classifying students on the basis of race was the only way to maintain racial diversity .
" The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race , " Roberts wrote , according to SCOTUSblog .
The decision could affect racial integration plans in hundreds of school districts , according to the Associated Press .
In another 5 - 4 decision released Thursday , the court ruled Texas cannot execute a mentally ill prisoner .
Scott Panetti was convicted of murdering his in - laws 15 years ago , but his lawyers argued he should not face the death penalty because he does not understand why he is facing that punishment .
Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote the majority opinion in that case .
Justices found the Eighth Amendment prohibited putting to death a person who " is so lacking in rational understanding that he cannot comprehend that he is being put to death because of the crime he was convicted of committing , " according to the Associated Press .
Thursday 's decisions represented the extent to which Kennedy remains a pivot - point on the court .
In the death penalty case , he sided with the court 's liberal wing -- Justices Ruth Bader Ginsberg , David Souter , John Paul Stevens and Stephen Bryer .
In the school decision he wrote a concurring opinion joining with conservative Justices Roberts , Clarence Thomas , Antonin Scalia and Samuel Alito .
Although Kennedy upheld the majority decision that the Seattle and Louisville school districts went too far in using race as a factor , he did not eliminate all possibilities it could be a factor in the future .

Mike Ruppert responded to my post about Armorware .
As I expected , he did n’t address any of the several concerns I raised .
He confirms what we already knew :
He ’s virtually clueless about computer security and is promoting something he does n’t understand because it looks “ elegant ” to him .
* sigh *
He did , however , mention Alex Jones .
In his response , to my post , Mike Ruppert wrote , “ I get slammed for promoting one prouduct . [ sic ]
How many paid advertisers are there on Alex Jonesâ€™ sites ? ”
I did n’t know if Alex Jones was promoting / endorsing / offering any computer security or anonymity products .
I ’d never heard of him doing do , but since Ruppert mentioned it , I thought I ’d look into the matter , just to make sure .
Uhhhhhhgh .

Before you read about what I found , this is what I wrote about proxy services in my Ugly Truth About Online Anonymity essay :
Many technologies that amateur anonymity fetishists are attracted to are actually designed to harvest information .
Put yourself in the shoes of the NSA .
If you wanted a concentrated haul of the most interesting information what would you do ?
You would establish a honeypot : a service ( free or paid ) that purported to provide an anonymous web browsing / email capability .
Who knows what people might get up to if they thought nobody was looking ?
That , of course , is the idea with honeypots .
If youâ€™re relying on a proxy server , how will you know that itâ€™s not simply recording your entire session for examination by acreages of the Homelandâ€™s supercomputers that are running advanced statistical Magic 8 Ball algorithms ?
Because the company or individual providing your proxy service says that they donâ€™t keep logs ?
HA

2002 .
In 2002 , I wrote the following to a Cryptogon reader :
Few people have “ clean , ” that is anonymous Internet access .
The people who “ think ” they have it are paying extra for it , and may just be supporting a NSA honeypot .
I get a good chuckle when I see webwasher and anonymiser hits in my log .
Read Sun
Tzu’s , “ Art of War . ”
If he wanted people to think they were anonymous online , so he could learn their maneuvers and tactics , how would he go about it ?
He ’d set up an ISP offering “ anonymous ” surfing and post ads for it all over the dissident backwaters of the Internet .
He might even require clients to run an executable in order to access the “ anonymous ” browsing system .
That way , he gets every keystroke , in addition to all Internet activity .
In 2005 , both Alex Jones and Mike Ruppert began promoting possible honeypot email and web anonymity services …
I feel ill .
I ’m literally sitting here , holding my head in my hands .
In mindwar , which is what this is , the battlespace is littered with bullshit and honeypots .
Getting outside the boxes lands you inside other boxes .
It is like planning an ambush far in advance .
When the enemy ( you and me ) walks along the path and starts taking fire , we leap into the bushes for cover … and land in a mine field .
Another analogy .
The Internet is like a safety valve on a pressure cooker .
If the thing is getting dangerous , dissidents and activists of EVERY possible description can meet up with the handfull of other people who share similar interests , sit in front of their computers , and spend a lot of time accomplishing nothing .
In the meantime , valuable intelligence may be gleaned about us via the methods I discuss above , and probably techniques we ca n’t begin to imagine .
When I studied information warfare in college , this now long forgotten essay was a big deal , but twelve years later , have we learned anything ?
The Internet could also be used offensively as an additional medium in psychological operations campaigns and to help achieve unconventional warfare objectives .
Used creatively as an integral asset , the Internet can facilitate many DoD operations and activities .

Police and military sources said most of the dead were Sunnis and had been killed in the 24 hours since the attack , which destroyed the golden dome of the al - Askari shrine in Samarra , one of Shia Islam 's most revered sites .
The Iraqi government has cancelled all police and army leave , extending curfews in Baghdad and other cities in an attempt to prevent the violence from spreading further .
As world leaders including Tony Blair called for Iraqis not to be deflected from the task of establishing a unity government , the main Sunni political party pulled out of talks called by the Iraqi president , Jalal Talabani , in an attempt to avert the descent towards civil war .
The Iraqi Accordance Front accused the ruling Shia of fomenting attacks on civilians and dozens of Sunni mosques in retaliation for the attack on the Shia shrine .
It said it was suspending negotiations with the Shia Alliance over the government 's failure to protect Sunni mosques , more than 90 of which have been attacked , and demanded an apology from Shia leaders before rejoining talks .
After discussions with Shia and Kurd groups and leaders of a small Sunni party , Mr Talabani warned that , if civil war came , " no one will be safe " .
Mr Blair said those who carried out the bombing - which he claimed was likely to be al - Qaida - wanted to " stop the will of the Iraqi people for the country to come together in a unity government " .
" Each time this happens our reaction is not to say let 's walk away , " he said at his monthly press conference in London .
" Our response has to be that we stand up and defeat these people . "
The US president , George Bush , condemned the shrine attack as an " evil act " and appealed for restraint , while the UN security council called on Iraqis to rally behind a non-sectarian government .
Police and military sources said there had been more than 130 deaths since yesterday 's bombing , most of them Sunnis .
The majority of the deaths happened around Baghdad and Basra .
In the worst single incident , 47 people who had taken part in a joint Sunni and Shia demonstration against the Samarra attack were dragged from vehicles as they left and shot dead in Nahrawan , on the outskirts of Baghdad .
Their bodies were dumped in a ditch by the side of the road and found near the village of Nahrawan , south of Baghdad .
Sixteen people - including eight civilians - were killed and 21 injured when a bomb aimed at an army foot patrol exploded in a busy market in Baquba , north - east of Baghdad .
Earlier , one person was killed and two injured when gunmen opened fire on a Sunni mosque in the town .
Iraqi police also reported finding around 50 bodies , many of them with their hands bound , at sites around Baghdad .
It was not immediately clear whether this figure included the 47 recovered in Nahrawan .
In Basra , which is predominantly Shia , men dressed in police uniform took 11 Sunni prisoners from a prison .
They were later found dead at various sites in the city .
Officials put the overall death toll in the city at 25 .
An Iraqi journalist working for the al - Arabiya television channel was kidnapped and killed , along with two members of her crew , while reporting on the Samarra attack .
The bodies of Atwar Bahiat , a 26 - year - old Sunni who had previously worked for al - Jazeera , her cameraman , Adnan Khairallah , and her soundman , Khaled Mohsen , were found on the outskirts of the town .
The US military said seven US soldiers had been killed in two separate bomb attacks north of Baghdad .
The wave of violence came as Iraq 's various factions struggled to agree on the formation of a government after elections for the country 's first full - term parliament on December 15 .
They have until mid-May to form a new government .
Talks between the main Shia , Sunni and Kurdish political parties were already stumbling , and yesterday 's attack and the ensuing violence have brought deadlock .
A statement posted on the internet by the Mujahideen Council , which includes the group al - Qaida in Iraq , blamed Shia leaders for blowing up the mosque in order to justify attacks .
The Sunni Muslim Clerics Association accused its Shia counterparts of supporting violence , saying 184 Sunni mosques had been damaged , 10 clerics killed and 15 abducted .
The president of Iran , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , blamed the US and Israel for the bombing of the shrine , saying it was the work of " defeated Zionists and occupiers " .
It ’s a toy that most kids have played with at one time or another , but the findings of Northeastern University Computer Science professor Gene Cooperman and graduate student Dan Kunkle are not child ’s play .
The two have proven that 26 moves suffice to solve any configuration of a Rubik 's cube – a new record .
Historically the best that had been proved was 27 moves .
Why the fascination with the popular puzzle ?
“ The Rubik 's cube is a testing ground for problems of search and enumeration , ” says Cooperman .
“ Search and enumeration is a large research area encompassing many researchers working in different disciplines – from artificial intelligence to operations .
The Rubik 's cube allows researchers from different disciplines to compare their methods on a single , well - known problem . ”
Cooperman and Kunkle were able to accomplish this new record through two primary techniques :
They used 7 terabytes of distributed disk as an extension to RAM , in order to hold some large tables and developed a new , “ faster faster ” way of computing moves , and even whole groups of moves , by using mathematical group theory .
Cooperman and Kunkle put all of the configurations of a Rubik 's cube in a family of sets of configurations ( called a family of cosets in mathematical group theory ) .
They then looked at the result of applying a single move to all of the configurations of a coset at once .
They simulated this on a computer at a rate of 100,000,000 times per second , using a new technique in mathematical group theory .
In May 1997 , U.C.L.A. computer science Professor Richard Korf announced that he had found the first optimal solutions to Rubik 's Cube .
His research showed that the median optimal solution was 18 moves , and he believed any cube could be solved in no more than 20 moves .
However , he was unable to prove this , and no one has ever been able to prove that it could be solved in less than 27 moves .
“ Korf had written a program that spends a long time to find optimal solutions for single states of the Rubik 's cube , ” says Kunkle .
“ Our program first does a large pre-computation and then it very quickly - in about a second - finds a solution in 26 moves or less for any state of Rubik 's cube .
Cooperman and Kunkle used computers at Teragrid ( teragrid.org ) and at Northeastern , part of the first node from a $ 200,000 grant Cooperman and colleagues received from the National Science Foundation in 2006 to obtain 20 terabytes of storage .
Rubik 's Cube , invented in the late 1970s by Erno Rubik of Hungary , is perhaps the most famous combinatorial puzzle of its time .
Its packaging boasts billions of combinations , which is actually an understatement .
In fact , there are more than 43 quintillion ( 4.3252 x 10** 19 ) different states that can be reached from any given configuration .

They can even compensate for vaguely worded queries or outright mistakes .
“ Search over the last few years has moved from ‘ Give me what I typed ’ to ‘ Give me what I want , ’ ” says Mr. Singhal , a 39 - year - old native of India who joined Google in 2000 and is now a Google Fellow , the designation the company reserves for its elite engineers .
Google recently allowed a reporter from The New York Times to spend a day with Mr. Singhal and others in the search - quality team , observing some internal meetings and talking to several top engineers .
There were many questions that Google would n’t answer .
But the engineers still explained more than they ever have before in the news media about how their search system works .
As Google constantly fine - tunes its search engine , one challenge it faces is sheer scale .
It is now the most popular Web site in the world , offering its services in 112 languages , indexing tens of billons of Web pages and handling hundreds of millions of queries a day .
Even more daunting , many of those pages are shams created by hucksters trying to lure Web surfers to their sites filled with ads , pornography or financial scams .
At the same time , users have come to expect that Google can sift through all that data and find what they are seeking , with just a few words as clues .
“ Expectations are higher now , ” said Udi Manber , who oversees Google ’s entire search - quality group .
“ When search first started , if you searched for something and you found it , it was a miracle .
Now , if you do n’t get exactly what you want in the first three results , something is wrong . ”
Google ’s approach to search reflects its unconventional management practices .
It has hundreds of engineers , including leading experts in search lured from academia , loosely organized and working on projects that interest them .
But when it comes to the search engine — which has many thousands of interlocking equations — it has to double - check the engineers ’ independent work with objective , quantitative rigor to ensure that new formulas do n’t do more harm than good .
Of the 31 ads subject to formal complaints this month , 28 were cleared by the board .
But two of the three ads where the complaints were upheld were by McDonald 's , with the fast - food giant being accused of sending the wrong message to children on stranger danger .
In one animated ad , a little girl rescues a kitten before accepting a lift from space aliens , then agrees to " pick up dad along the way " to McDonald 's for a meal .
According to one complainant , the ad condoned getting in a vehicle with strangers .
" They may be aliens but they are still strangers , " the complaint reads .
" In the ad they pick up dad along the way , but what is to stop a would - be abductor using the same ploy and saying ' Oh , it 's all right .
We will pick up your dad along the way ' as a way to get the child to get into the car ? "
McDonald 's defended the ad , saying it portrayed a fantasy world .
" As everyone knows , even children know green monsters do n't exist and UFOs do not fly around the city .
We were feeding the imaginations that we know every child has … "
But the board found the ad had breached the Children 's Television Code , because it portrayed an unsafe situation that could encourage children to engage in a dangerous activity .
Complaints against another McDonald 's ad , which showed children being rewarded with a meal after retrieving a stranger 's ring from a drain , were upheld for similar reasons .
Defending multiple complaints against its ad , another fast - food chain successfully argued the level of nudity used " was essential to ensuring authenticity " .
The ad shows a topless pole - dancing mother using fictitious " Nando - fix " skin patches and gum to control her craving for Nando 's chicken .
" The concept is to show somebody who , for professional reasons , can't wear the Nando - fix patch , " the company reasoned , disputing the ad was degrading to women .
Pole dancing had become mainstream , Nando 's argued , citing the example of Martha , a character in Home and Away , who works as a pole dancer .
The board of the Advertising Standards Bureau agreed , ruling that pole dancing was " … a popular form of exercise " and " was not incompatible with family values " .
The ad " depicted a strong in - control woman who went about her work in a professional manner " , because it showed her travelling to work wearing a suit , the board concluded , while the ad had not broken any rules regarding permissible levels of nudity .
