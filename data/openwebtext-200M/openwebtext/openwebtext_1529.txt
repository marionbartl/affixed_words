Some $ 850 in Russian currency was allegedly taken
A man believed to be a sumo wrestler ripped out a cash machine weighing 90kg ( 200 lb ) and made off with it on his shoulders , police in Moscow report .
The suspect and an accomplice were arrested after being stopped in a BMW with tinted windows which they were driving without number - plates .
The machine containing 25,320 roubles ( $ 850 , £ 560 ) was found in the car .
Police say the accomplice tried to take the blame for the robbery , saying he had misled his sumo - wrestler friend .
They were alerted to the incident by a saleswoman , who said the suspects had walked into her shop in northern Moscow at 0600 ( 0300 GMT ) and begun ripping out the electronic payment machine without a word .
When she tried to protest , one of the suspects allegedly yelled at her : " Be quiet if you know what 's good for you ! "
The frightened woman waited until the two men had left before phoning police , who dispatched two officers to Marshal Fedorenko Street where they blocked the BMW .
The man who allegedly carried the cash machine said he was a " professional sumo wrestler " .
" The second rascal says it is his fault entirely and makes out that he misled his sumo - friend , telling him he was taking away his own machine , " Moscow police 's press service added .
Police said both suspects were from a " neighbouring country " but were registered as living in the Moscow area .
Radio host warns that agent provocateurs will commit terror to frame patriots

Tuesday , April 21 , 2010
Popular talk show host Michael Savage has warned that the “ illegitimate ” Obama regime is planning to use agent provocateurs to stage violence or acts of terror in order to frame Tea Party members as violent extremists and crush free speech in America .
Savage ’s rant was in response to Council on Foreign Relations member and Time Magazine journalist Joe Klein , who told Obama attack dog Chris Matthews during an MSNBC interview that some of the rhetoric coming from Tea Party members borders on sedition .
Savage also made reference to BIll Clinton ’s comments to CNN ’s Wolf Blitzer last week in which the former President implied that rising anger directed towards the federal government could cause another domestic terror attack on the scale of the Oklahoma City bombing to take place , which is nothing less than a veiled threat as anyone who has investigated the OKC bombing in any depth will understand .
Savage labeled Klein and his ilk “ horses arses ” for attempting to charge 80 per cent of Americans with sedition for dissenting against the government , stating that the majority of Americans see the Obama administration as an “ illegitimate government ” .
Savage said that it was Obama and not the American people who was committing sedition against the constitution by forcing policies upon the American people that they had never voted for .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
“ You want us to be arrested for speaking out against the President ?
Kiss my behind Joe Klein , how ’s that for sedition ? ” proclaimed Savage .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Savage warned Americans not to be provoked into taking the bait and committing violence .
“ They have probably sent agent provocateurs in there with guns – I can guarantee you that this government is going to do something along those lines , ” said Savage , adding , “ It does n’t take a genius to know what this illegitimate band of gangsters is going to do next , ” saying that a violent action somewhere in America will be conducted by an agent provocateur “ that they sent into the crowds ” .
“ The October surprise that they have in mind for this world is not to be imagined , ” continued Savage , “ As we speak the enemies of freedom are planning their next move if it has n’t been done already , they ’ve already planted the agent provocateurs in the Tea Parties and they ’re only waiting to set them off like the sleeper cells that Al - Qaeda allegedly had in the United States of America . ”
“ Mark my words , I would hazard a guess , knowing how politicians have worked who do n’t have the interests of the people at heart …. that the agent provocateurs have been planted like sleeper cells inside the Tea Parties and they ’re gonna let them go off all at once , make no mistake about it they want that to happen , they want the flashes to go off , and they will be behind it in my estimation , ” said Savage , adding that if action is not taken to stop it , “ The iron heel fascism of the left will have crushed free speech in America . ”
With the media ceaselessly hyping the inevitability of violence by obsessing about stories like “ Jihad Jane ” and the Hutaree raid , and then connecting it with libertarians , constitutionalists , tea party members and basically anyone who expresses dissent , the groundwork is clearly being prepared for some kind of false flag that will be used to frame the most vociferous critics of the Obama administration .
Listen to Savage ’s rant below .

Yes , you are all well aware of the Donkey Kong " rivalry " between Billy Mitchell and Steve Wiebe .
If for whatever reason you 're not , go watch The King of Kong and come back right fast .
We 'll wait .
Okay , you done ?
Pretty fun , entertaining movie , no ?
I 'm glad you liked it , but really , none of that matters right now -- neither Mitchell nor Wiebe set the new high score .
Nope , it was actually newcomer Hank Chien of New York .
He scored 1,061,700 points in 2 hours , 35 minutes ; the previous high score was 1,050,200 .
Twin Galaxies has verified the score and yes , everything is on the level .
When he's not kicking ass and taking names in Donkey Kong , Chien can be found performing plastic surgery .
I declare this man to be our newest officially unofficial badass of the week .

Dean Potter @ Taft Point in Yosemite ( 2009 Dean Potter ( born January 1972 , in the United States ) is an American free climber , alpinist , BASE jumper , BASEliner , and highliner .
He is noted for hard first ascents , free solo ascents , speed ascents and enchainments in Yosemite and Patagonia .
Free climbing and free soloing : Potter has made several new routes and bold solo ascents in Patagonia .
Speed climbing :
In July 2006 , he climbed The Reticent Wall , one of the hardest routes on El Capitan , in 34 hours and 57 minutes with Ammon McNeely and Ivo Ninov , shaving five days off the existing time .
Highlining and BASE jumping : Potter is known for his exploits in highlining and BASE jumping .
He was introduced to slacklining by Chongo , aka Charles Victor Tucker III , one of the first three people to highline across Lost Arrow Spire .
Delicate Arch climb : Potter is infamous for climbing Delicate Arch , for which he lost his sponsorship from the Patagonia clothing company .
" There was n't any legal reason for me not to climb it , " Potter said of Delicate Arch .
" I did n't see any moral reason not to climb it .
I did n't hurt it .
" Potter said he would not climb Totem Pole , the spire in Monument Valley that Navajo imbue with religious significance .
Delicate Arch , despite its prominence on Utah license plates , does n't have the stature of that sacred Arizona tower , he said .
" I did n't see a reason why it 's wrong , why we should n't mesh with nature , " Potter said .
" At first Potter 's handler in Patagonia spread the word of his climb by calling a press release to the Salt Lake Tribune .
Public outrage was immediate , though , especially in Utah , where many see Delicate Arch as a symbol for the state 's wild beauty .
" Potter 's Delicate Arch climb became the topic of the song Not All Roses by rapper Odub ( Kris Hampton ) , released on the web on 2 April 2007 .
On 11 April 2007 , Potter 's lawyer sent Hampton a Cease and Desist letter advising him to halt all distribution of the song .
Hampton subsequently released a follow - on song called Cease and Desist .
Notable Ascents :- 2002 Supercanaleta , Cerro Fitz Roy , Patagonia .
First solo of route .- 2003 Concepcion 5.13 + ( 67 m ) , Day Canyon , Moab , Utah .
First Ascent .- 2006 Heaven ( 5.12d/13a ) Glacier Point , Yosemite Valley .
First solo ascent .- 2006 Southern Belle ( V 5.12d ) , Half Dome , Yosemite Valley .
Second ascent with Leo Houlding .
It ’s only been a few hours since John Paul Stevens announced that he ’ll step down from the Supreme Court this summer , but speculation over who his replacement will be , of course , is already rampant .
The White House is well prepared for the decision ; not only did it know Stevens ’s retirement was approaching , but it already has a bunch of candidates lined up from the last go - round .
According to ABC News , Obama already “ has a list of fewer than 10 possible nominees , ” including the widely discussed Solicitor General Elena Kagan , Judge Diane Wood , and Judge Merrick Garland .
Other names being mentioned as “ outside the box ” picks are Homeland Security secretary Janet Napolitano and Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm .
But there ’s also some chatter on the Internet promoting another big name : Hillary Clinton .
Slate senior editor Emily Bazelon writes that Clinton would be “ a rock star of a Supreme Court justice ” whose only downside is that she ’s already 62 .
Prominent liberal blogger Ezra Klein tweeted , “ By the by , have always thought Hillary Clinton would make a good justice . ”
Daily Kos leader Markos Moulitsas , another prominent liberal voice , retweeted some other guy suggesting , “ What about Hillary as Supreme Court nominee ? ”
Our question is , would Hillary even want it ?
That would all depend on whether she still — despite all her denials , some not so convincing — wants to be president someday .
If she does , becoming a justice would kill that dream , unless she plans on sitting on the bench for only four years or so .
If she ’s given up on the idea , though , she ’d probably be relieved to leave the State Department behind .

Grant is a writer and activist who spoke yesterday at a panel on sex work and feminism at the Civil Liberties and Public Policy 's 2010 Reproductive Justice Conference .
Before she spoke to them , though , she spoke to me .

Megan :
A long time ago on Twitter , you and I had a long conversation about feminism and sex work , and why it was really important for mainstream feminists to be more inclusive in this regard .
And I wanted to get back into that , because I think , and know in my own life , that there is a very natural reaction to feel like sex work and feminism are not really that compatible , between sexism and trafficking and misogyny .
Melissa : Right , and there 's more politically at stake right now , maybe more even than there was in the 70's and 80's during the sex wars , for feminists in regards to sex work .
There 's a new wave of laws coming down on the state level — two in process right now in Illinois and in DC — that would further criminalize sex workers in the guise of " ending demand " for sex work
Advertisement
Megan :
Ah , yes , because all these years that it was legal totally increased demand .
Melissa :
It 's critical for those who have political power as feminists , whether that 's as a lobbyist , an organizer , a media person , to listen to sex workers — that this call to " end demand " does little to improve our lives .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
Megan :
And I think that this is the crux of the matter : do we as feminists want to improve the lives of the women involved in sex work ?
Or do we want to criminalize a practice that is regarded as rooted in sexism , regardless ?
Because , I think we all rationally know that criminalizing sexism does n't eliminate it .
Just ask any woman who faces pay inequity or sexual harassment .
Melissa : Right , these laws do little to shift the conditions of patriarchy and sexism that impoverish women , throw up barriers to opportunity for women .
We can't say , " Boo Lily Ledbetter , " but we know , on the ground , these laws do n't play out how we intend .
Advertisement
Megan :
And while it 's important to protect women and men who are caught in sex work when they do n't want to be , criminalizing women and men who choose to be does n't assist them , and does n't change the market for sex work .
Melissa :
So we 're sort of stuck , as feminists in the US — unless we actually listen to folks in the work and meaningfully consider how we build political power for sex workers and anyone who is involved in commercial sex , no matter what they call it .
Advertisement
Megan : I would agree , but I think it 's important to have criminal penalties for traffickers and people that coerce men and women into sex work .
And I think it 's important to ask how do we really work to minimize demand for the commoditization of sex , and women 's bodies ?
Melissa : I do n't think there 's anything we can do within the legal system to address the commodification of sexuality .
And I 'd really want to unpack that phrase — that notion .
Advertisement
Megan : I agree .
You can't address a thought with a law .
Melissa :
But I 'd take it a step further than you — criminalization does n't help people who are involved in commercial sex through coercion either .
We had a rhetoric in the early days of working against violence against women , that police were not always allies in ending domestic violence .
Why now do we trust cops to protect us ?
Especially when we see , in communities of color and for folks who are transgender and gender non-conforming , that cops are incredibly racist and incredibly violent towards folks in the course of arrest
Advertisement
Megan :
Well , I think a more interesting question is why do we feel we need the police to protect us from sex workers ?
Melissa :
And who exactly needs to be protected " from " sex workers ?
Often it 's litter and loitering people are angry about .
Or , more generally , people are unsettled by being encountered with poverty — especially on the sidewalk of their nice new condo , with the husband inside they do n't want to imagine buying blow jobs outside .
Advertisement
Megan :
This is actually something I 've been wondering about , particularly when it comes to feminism .
Often , when I read feminists talk about sex work , I get the very distinct sense that they feel the need to protect themselves and / or their relationships from sex work .
I feel , more and more , that so much is set up and structured around the idea that women are in competition sexually .
Melissa :
We do n't have a lot of politicization around or even discussion around the fear of competition sexually .
So instead we displace that fear onto the women we 've been raised to fear , or on getting mad about Brazilian waxes or whatever .
But that totally strips away any thinking we could engage in around power dynamics , and class .
Advertisement
Megan : ( Let alone race and sexism and misogyny . )
Melissa :
No one really wants to go there .
I really do think most of this anti-prostitution , end - demand stuff is rooted in unchallenged classism within feminism .
Advertisement
Megan : I think it is not remotely unfair to say that , in many ways , there is a lot of unchallenged classism in official feminism .
Melissa :
It 's not just virgin / whore , but a very specific class connotation within that construct .
Advertisement
Megan :
Because a whore , of course , needs the money , whereas a virgin has the economic option to maximize her marriage potential , which is just another form of sexual commodization .
Melissa : Right , and if you can see it with establishment feminists — Laura Agustin gets at this in her book , Sex At The Margins — feminists need money too .
Feminists who do research , write books , work the conference circuit , feminists who starts orgs to " save " sex workers — they are working , too .
They are laborers in an industry intimately connected to sex work , too .
Advertisement
Megan : I mean , when are women not working ?
At home , in the job market , in feminism and out ?
It 's just what is monetarily valued or not .
Advertisement
Melissa : I want feminists coming up into the movement and its establishments to consider that — who profits from the anti-trafficking movement ?
And saving - type work is good work .
Megan : I want to be clear , here , though : neither of us wants women or men coerced into the sex industry , or to be unable to make the choice to get out of it .
I think both of us agree that the people that profit off of coerced sex work should be liable for that .
Advertisement
Melissa :
No one would question you morally there .
But this is so frustrating — why do we have to continually say , " we are against coercion " — if we want to suggest that the tactics of some feminists do n't make sense to us ?
I really think it 's a false binary — no one is for coercion , or trafficking .
And in the sex worker rights movement , most of what we talk about is n't " pro " sex industry .
It 's about challenging structural violence , racism .
Megan :
But I think when the debate is framed in a certain way — as you said , around " saving " people — it 's important to acknowledge that there is coercion and that it needs to end .
I think an important medium - term goal for both feminists and sex workers is to make sure that sex work is full of , say , Ashley Dupres .
Advertisement
Melissa : I really hope none of my comments make me appear to want a world full of young women who are stalked by CNN and retire from the business to become NY Post sex advice columnists .
I think that 's a huge dodge there .
Megan : I did n't mean it like that ( and the harassment she faced was terrible ) .
I meant more that she chose to be in sex work .
Advertisement
Melissa : Right , maybe ?
I mean , how can we know ?
The choice / coercion divide is really more complex than that , and it does n't change anything about how shamed she was in the media .
Megan :
True , it was a reductive statement on my part .
I just meant it in the sense that her story is well - known and she says she chose sex work .
But I think part of the shaming comes , again , from the idea that no one would really " choose " sex work .
Advertisement
Melissa : Stigma and criminalization are common to all of us , whether we 're in sex work through choice , circumstance , or coercion .
And you are doubly bad if you do choose it .
We reserve sympathy for those who are " forced . "
Megan :
Not just sympathy , but empathy .
Melissa :
It 's a double standard that also does n't have much resemblance to people 's working lives .
How many people , in any job , truly choose it ?
How many of us have agency , power , and control in our working lives ?
I think this is classism , again — this not wanting to talk about how economic choice is complex .
Money is just as dirty for us to confront as sex , even as feminists — maybe especially as feminists .
Advertisement
Megan : I think people like to believe they make choices about to whom they sell the labor and the products thereof , when the market power , actually , is all in the hands of the buyer .
Because , otherwise , we 're all just selling bits of ourselves .
Melissa :
And they like to think maybe it 's totally different when you 're naked
Megan : ( Also : it is very clever of you to sneak the M** xist theory into this ! )
Melissa : Ha , I 'm such a lousy Marxist , I 'm still practicing hookernomics .

The Law Society says the acquittal of three men who attacked the Waihopai spy base has not set a legal precedent .
Adrian Leason , Sam Land and Catholic priest Peter Murnane had admitted deflating a 30 - metre - high dome shielding a satellite dish at the spy base , near Blenheim , in 2008 .
However , they argued they were acting to save the lives of others , including victims of the Iraq war .
The jury deliberated for two hours before finding them not guilty on Wednesday of charges of intentional damage and entering a property with intent to commit a crime .
Mr Land says the verdict is a landmark in New Zealand history and the three men are privileged to have been part of it .
Adrian Leason told Morning Report the three were confident of the legality of their actions .
Asked whether the decision would affect what other activist groups do , he said the judge and the prosecution made it clear that every trial is unique .
" This is no general ruling giving permission and this particular defence we used was very specific to a whole lot of unique variables .
" I think another activist in another situation would have to look at the merits of their own defence , case by case . "
The convenor of the Law Society 's criminal law sub-committee , Jonathan Krebs , says only judicial decisions have value as precedents , so the verdicts will not pave the way for others to carry out similar attacks .
Mr Krebs told Morning Report the defence used , known as claim of right , would normally be used in certain property cases where a person does n't know a crime had been committed - such as purchasing an item which is later found to be stolen .
' Not in public interest '
The director of International Relations and Security Studies at Waikato University , Ron Smith , told Nine to Noon the decision was an abberation .
It was not in the public interest that such a flimsy defence would aquit someone of criminal damage which may be in excess of $ 1 million , Dr Smith said .
In summing up the case to jurors on Wednesday , Judge Stephen Harrop said if the men believed they were acting lawfully , even if they were mistaken in that belief , they must be acquitted .
The Crown Law Office has yet to announce whether it will appeal against the acquittal .
Protest groups consider verdict
Anti-abortion group Right to Life says it will seek legal counsel over what the decision means for other activists .
Save Animals from Exploitation director , Hans Kriek , says people in the animal rights movement may reconsider what they do in light of the decision .
" However , the people that did the actions at the base got off because they were seen to be helping people , and wheras with animal rights people , from my experience , certainly in the courts , that will be weighted far less . "
Meanwhile , Father Murnane says he hopes his deeds will inspire people to think about justice , and that people are more important than war machines .

WASHINGTON —
In a major First Amendment ruling , the Supreme Court on Tuesday struck down a federal law that made it a crime to create or sell dogfight videos and other depictions of animal cruelty .
Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. , writing for the majority in the 8 - to - 1 decision , said that the law had created “ a criminal prohibition of alarming breadth ” and that the government ’s aggressive defense of the law was “ startling and dangerous . ”
The decision left open the possibility that Congress could enact a narrower law that would pass constitutional muster .
But the existing law , Chief Justice Roberts wrote , covered too much speech protected by the First Amendment .
It has been more than a quarter - century since the Supreme Court placed a category of speech outside the protection of the First Amendment .
Tuesday ’s resounding and lopsided rejection of a request that it do so , along with its decision in Citizens United in January — concluding that corporations may spend freely in candidate elections — suggest that the Roberts Court is prepared to adopt a robustly libertarian view of the constitutional protection of free speech .

Supporters of marijuana law reform are rallying behind 29 - year - old Joe Casais , a cancer sufferer and registered medical marijuana user who was
fired from his job
at Wal - Mart in Battle Creek .
Casais , who had worked at the store for five years and in 2008 was named Associate of the Year , tested positive for marijuana during a worker 's compensation screening after he sprained his knee on the job .
Marijuana advocates are
calling for a boycott
of the chain , and recently a
rally
took place in support of Casais :
Beyond the immediate fallout from the boycott -- such as a sharp decline in the sale of snack foods -- the story raises questions about how employers are to reconcile their drug policies with laws regarding the use of marijuana , particularly medical marijuana .
Wal - Mart wants no part of it .
In a statement , a company spokesman said : " In states , such as Michigan , where prescriptions for marijuana can be obtained , an employer can still enforce a policy that requires termination of employment following a positive drug screen .
We believe our policy complies with the law and we support decisions based on the policy . "
It may be legal , but is it the right thing to do ?
" It 's despicable that Wal - Mart would fire such a hardworking and seriously ill employee simply for treating his symptoms with a medicine that he is authorized to use under state law , " Karen O'Keefe , director of state policies for the Marijuana Policy Project and lead drafter of Michigan 's medical marijuana law , told the Michigan Messenger .
" Would Wal - Mart also fire someone for taking doctor - prescribed Percocet , or any of the other legal medications sold in many of Wal - Mart 's own stores ? "
The American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan also sides with Casais , telling the publication , " It 's immoral and it 's illegal to fire somebody for treating their disease with a medicine that 's legal and recommended by someone 's physician . "
Wal - Mart also is contesting Casais ' unemployment benefits claim since any marijuana use still is a violation of federal law , even if states are allowing it in some cases .
The Obama administration said it will not seek to prosecute marijuana users who are in compliance with state law .
Michigan legalized medical marijuana in 2008 .
What do you think of Wal - Mart 's actions here ?

RIO DE JANEIRO , April 16 ( UPI ) -- Brazil secured Chinese pledges to investment heavily in and buy more from Brazil as the summit of BRIC countries -- Brazil , Russia , India and China -- opened a day early to allow for President Hu Jintao to return to China to oversee earthquake relief .
More than 800 people died in an earthquake in western China as Hu embarked on his Latin America visit , which was to have taken him to Venezuela and Chile as well .
Advertisement
The Brazil deal became the highlight of Hu's visit as he cut short his tour .
The wide range of economic collaboration agreed between Brazil and China gives Beijing a much vaunted foothold in Latin America , opening possibilities for business and export expansion , investment in joint projects and military sales .
Analysts said neither of the other two BRIC nations at the summit , India and Russia , could match Beijing in terms of access to cash and extent of business opportunities in a growing consumer market , as in China .
The BRIC summit , the second since last year , looked at alternatives to the U.S. dollar as the world 's reserve currency and ways of engineering economic and political shifts to achieve its avowed goal of a multipolar world order -- a system independent of Western pre-eminence .
Agreements reached Thursday between Brazil and China include a plan to study the use of the Brazilian real and the Chinese yuan , instead of the U.S. dollar , in bilateral trade .
BRIC countries account for about 40 percent of the world 's population .
Analysts said
Hu's visit differed from initiatives taken by Russia to boost Latin American trade , including arms sales , because of China 's ability to deploy its cash reserves into new acquisitions , investment deals and marketing for a greater share of the region 's consumer markets .
Russia has focused on arms sales and technology transfers to increase its cash revenues .
Russian deals with Argentina to boost nuclear collaboration will give Moscow a welcome entry into a market that U.S. manufacturers once dominated .
Brazilian Presidents Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and Hu signed several trade and investment agreements that will see large inflows of Chinese cash into the Brazilian economy .
Lula said a Chinese pledge to build a steel plant in Brazil port would be China 's biggest investment ever in Latin America 's largest economy .
China may also bid to construct a high - speed train line that will connect Rio de Janeiro with Sao Paulo , he said .
" The possibility for Chinese companies to participate in the modernization of Brazil 's infrastructure is exceptional , " Lula said , citing the 2014 soccer World Cup and the 2016 Olympics and Beijing 's experience as host of the 2008 Olympics .
Details of China 's involvement with Brazil 's oil industry were n't mentioned but a greater Chinese role in that sector is in the cards because of China 's declared strategy of securing energy sources for future growth in its oil demand .
Last year , China agreed on a $ 10 billion loan facility for Petrobras and more financing for the state - manged oil giant is n't ruled out .
A joint statement said , " The two sides will deepen the bilateral partnership in the oil sector , with the participation of Brazilian companies in development and production in China and the participation of Chinese companies in development and production in Brazil . "
Lula and Hu also discussed Iran nuclear issues , on which Lula has frequently expressed support for Tehran .
He is due to visit Iran next month .

The sun is about to shine on those controversial college credit card agreements .
The terms of lucrative college affinity card contracts between colleges and universities and credit card companies that have been shrouded in secrecy for decades will soon be made public , thanks to reporting and disclosure provisions of the Credit CARD
Act that take effect Feb. 22 .
By that date , card companies that contract with colleges and universities to issue affinity credit cards emblazoned with school logos and campus images must submit a report to the Federal Reserve detailing the terms of those contracts by institution .
The Fed will then compile a report and make it publicly available .
Source : Inaugural report delay likely
A Federal Reserve source who spoke on condition of anonymity said that although the Fed plans to include the college card data in its annual report to Congress each April , this year ’s inaugural compilation likely wo n’t be ready by then , given the CARD Act deadline and anticipated volume of issuer reports .
“ We know we ’re going to get a lot , ” the source says .
“ A major issuer is going to have a separate agreement with possibly thousands of different institutions of higher learning , and while the terms may be fairly standard , we understand that the agreements are not identical , so we expect the volume to be pretty big .
We have n’t set a firm date for issuing our [ college card ] report simply because we do n’t quite know what we ’re dealing with yet . ”
The Fed source says college affinity card issuers must file one report that includes copies of each of its college affinity card agreements .
Those that fail to do so would be in violation of Truth in Lending Act statutes and could be sued by individual cardholders for up to $ 5,000 .
Issuers without college affinity programs need not submit a report to the Fed .
The reporting requirement is piled on top of other substantial changes to how card issuers can market their cards on campus .
When added together , the credit card law ends the era of readily available credit cards for students .
“ It ’s ugly out there for issuers , ” the source says .
“ They have a lot to do between now and February 22 . ”
Alumni group must reveal deals
Ca n’t wait for that spring sunshine ?
You may not have to ; the Credit CARD
Act also requires alumni associations , which typically enter into affinity card agreements , to also make public the terms of their college card contracts if even one student has been issued a card .
Brian Flahaven , director of government relations for the Council for Advancement and Support of Education ( CASE ) that works on behalf of alumni associations , says the Act requires “ dependent ” alumni associations that are part of a college or university , as opposed to “ independents ” that are separate nonprofit 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) organizations , to disclose the terms of their affinity card agreements on their websites , make it available upon request or both .
For nonprofit “ independents ” or foundations , the onus is on the affinity card issuer to report to the Fed .
Colleges and universities are under no obligation to report to the Fed , however .
“ All of these agreements now are basically public documents ” says Flahaven .
“ If the alumni associations have a confidentiality clause in their contract , obviously that has been trumped by the law . ”
Flahaven says the disclosure requirements came as a shock to some of his constituents .

“ A lot of alumni associations were caught off - guard by this because they were thinking , ‘ Hey , we do n’t market to students ! ' ” he says .
“ But all it takes is one student going to an alumni association website to apply for a card and you ’re subject to disclosure . ”
Some of the confusion stems from other sections of the Credit CARD
Act that restrict on - campus credit card marketing to college students and impose new restrictions on issuing cards to persons under 21 .
“ The way the act defined ‘ student ’ was not age - based , ” Flahaven notes .
“ It was about your enrollment in the institution .
Even if [ the cardholder ] were over that age limit , that agreement would still be subject to public disclosure . ”
College affinity credit card programs have proliferated during the past 20 years , in part due to the popularity of college logos on everything from clothing and accessories to bank checks and auto insurance .
As the credit card industry matured , major issuers such as MBNA ( now Bank of America ) and Chase began to offer multiyear , multimillion - dollar deals to college and university alumni associations for the exclusive rights to market alma mater cards to its members .
In exchange , the alumni association typically provides the issuer with personal contact information on students and alumni , as well as a menu of campus perks , from promotional event opportunities to stadium box seats .
Although fewer than 5 percent of college affinity cards are issued to undergraduates under 21 , the secrecy of these affinity programs came under fire by consumer rights groups as they cataloged credit card industry abuses that ultimately resulted in the Credit CARD Act .
‘ This is new to us ’
At this point , how the Federal Reserve Board ultimately intends to use all that data remains partly cloudy .
“ It ’s sort of a strange thing because the statute does n’t require us to do a lot in the way of analysis .
Now the board could always choose to provide analysis , and we may well do that ; that will sort of depend on what we see once we have the data , ” the Fed source says .
“ Are there benchmarks ?
No , nothing quite like this .
The board collects information from lenders on a variety of subjects , but policy - wise , nothing really like this .
This is new to us . ”
LUCRATIVE COLLEGE -CREDIT CARD MARKETING AGREEMENTS
The practice of card issuers paying colleges to allow credit card marketing is widespread , but largely secret .
Some details of the agreements have been revealed by the institutions or pried free through Freedom of Information Act requests .

What is ALIAS Record ?
The two DNS records – CNAME and ALIAS , can both can link one domain name to another domain name .
The ALIAS has the advantage to combine well with other records too , and the CNAME does not have it .
You can use it together with different types of DNS records , with just the exception of Web Redirect and CNAME record .
Here you can see an ALIAS record example !
Differences between ALIAS and CNAME :
The process of resolving of the records is different
CNAME record has limited functionality , and ALIAS record has more .
ClouDNS and ALIAS records
With our ClouDNS services , you can easily create and manage ALIAS records and integrate them with an HTTP API .
You can use them to build a Round - Robin DNS that links CNAME and A or AAAA records .

Re-Thinking EQ – A Powerful Method
What Happens When We Cut Frequencies ?
What Happens When We Boost Frequencies ?
Fixing problems first –
Finding Problem Frequencies
Figure 1 . A Waves Q4 plug - in on a Pro Tools session ( stereo , in this case ) .
Note that the plug - in “ rounded ” my 2641 Hz. to 2650 – annoying but not significant .
Determining An Appropriate Q to Correct Them
Figure 2 .
The same setup as Figure 1 , but now we ’ve narrowed the Q to 100 , which is as narrow as this plug - in will go .
Figure 3 . Same as above , but now we 've " widened " the Q to 3.2 , by which point we‘ve noticed that we are hearing parts of the track that are outside of the annoying band of resonance .
Figure 4 .
Finally , we ’ve narrowed the band again so we ’ve got just the annoying resonance , nothing more .

First forgive my poor English !!!
Second let me congratulate you for the beautiful Website you have whit a lot of knowledge .
And about this article can i ask you what is the significance of the phrase " Start by dropping the overall level of the track by 10 dB " there is any point in the output level of compressor that is a good level for do what Mr Tom Bates say to do ?

Alejandro Hernandez " well son - of - a- bitch " thats genius !!!
i think it 's the fact that Tom cranks the particular filter at +18 dB to find problematic freqs would cause ur ears to just bleed with all the loudness .
With the master gain down 10 dB this would effectively give a +8 dB when finding problematic freqs .
be kind to your ears !

Tom has a worked out a method for approaching EQ that is remarkably effective .
It is a general purpose process for dealing with specific individual tracks that very effectively addresses some of the issues that always made me crazy .
I took it home , tried it immediately , and said to myself , “ Well , hot damn .
” You all probably know the basics of this .
It ’s comparatively hard to hear EQ cuts .
Further , when we cut , the level of the signals usually does n’t change much at all .
So , it has become an audio verity that we cut when we wish to conceal badnesses .
Meanwhile , when we boost , we exaggerate parts of the spectrum , audibly emphasizing them .
The level of the signal DOES go up as well , almost as much as the amount of boost we use .
So , the audio verity here is that we boost when we wish to ENHANCE a sound .
Tom ’s approach is to fix the problems first , by cutting .
How he does this is a model of evolved audio process .
Listen up !
This is worth the cost of your subscription for the next five years .
First , we find the offending frequencies .
Then we find their bandwidth ( some call it Q ) .
Then we figure out how much to cut them .
Cool , eh ?
What could be simpler ?
To do this , you need a parametric equalizer , hopefully with a lot of bands .
Working in Pro Tools , I use the Waves Q- series plug-ins , guessing how many bands I ’m gonna need in each case .
So how do you find problem frequencies in a given track ?
Well , by using your ears , of course !
But you can give them a little ( actually a lot of ) help .
Start by dropping the overall level of the track by 10 dB .
Set the Q at 8 , which is like a 10th of an octave , pretty narrow .
Crank one band of EQ all the way up to max , typically +18 dB.
Now , sweep the frequency ( I start with high frequencies , ca. 10 kHz. and work my way down ) , gently and slowly , listening for the truly ugly resonances , the ones that make your teeth itch or your sinuses act up .
If the track distorts on some frequency band , drop the level some more until the distortion is gone ( if it never goes away , then you ’ve got distortion on the track at that frequency – obviously you ’d like to hide it ! ) .
What I ’ve found is that the problem frequencies are pretty obvious .
They are unpleasant resonances of the instrument ( or the instrument / microphone interaction ) .
So let ’s assume you find a real nasty at 2641 Hz .
It just jumps out at you , says “ UUUUGGHLEEE ! ” at the limits of your monitors , puts little hairline cracks in your vintage Oakleys ( you should never mix wearing Oakleys , by the way ) .
See Figure 1 .
Now you narrow the Q all the way until you have just this poor tormented single 2641 Hz. frequency whistling and spitting at you ( Figure 2 ) .
Very slowly , start widening the Q. Listen for the point where you BEGIN to hear parts of the sound that are OK .
Now the Q is slightly wider than the offensive frequency band ( Figure 3 ) .
Narrow it back slightly so the nice stuff JUST BARELY goes away .
Now you ’ve found both the problem frequency and its bandwidth ( Figure 4 ) .
Time for a break .
The Guyandotte River in southwestern West Virginia where cancer rates are high and stream ecological integrity is poor .
Image credit , Steve Kiser .
A new study from West Virginia has found a significant relationship between the cancer mortality rates in local communities and the ecological integrity of nearby streams .
Researchers looked at an index of stream ecological condition and found that it correlated with digestive , breast , respiratory , and urinary cancer mortality rates .
The study also found a relationship between the amount of nearby coal mining and both stream health and cancer rates .
This suggests that coal mining may be the underlying cause of both problems .
This study merits media attention because it provides empirical evidence of the negative public health and ecological consequence of coal mining .
However , this study is also important because it shows that measurements of stream ecological integrity can serve as a warning sign of underlying environmental problems that are causing cancer in local populations .
Often these environmental stressors are difficult to otherwise detect .
Ecological integrity in streams refers to a specific ecosystem state " with species composition , diversity , and functional organization comparable to that of natural habitats within the region . "
In terms of water quality assessments , scientists often sample the species composition of macroinvertebrates , organisms visible to the naked eye living at the bottom layer of streams - e.g. crustaceans and insects .
Macroinvertebrate communities are sensitive to pollution and can provide indications of contamination not observable from chemical testing .
This happens " because biota are exposed to multiple physical and chemical conditions simultaneously and therefore provide an integrated measure of environmental quality . "
Nathaniel Hitt from Virginia Tech and Michael Hendryx from the University of West Virginia University looked at a stream condition index ( SCI ) that has been measured across the state based on 6 metrics of macroinvertebrate community structure .
They aggregated the values to the county level to compare them against public records on cancer mortality rates .
They also compared both SCI values and cancer rates against a metric of coal mining activity by country .
The researchers found significant relationships between the SCI values , cancer mortality rates , and the coal mining index .
In addition they conducted spatial analyses and " found cancer clusters that corresponded to areas of high coal mining intensity . "
Based on their findings the authors write ,
" Assessments of ecological integrity therefore may contribute not only to monitoring goals for aquatic life , but also may provide valuable insights for human health and safety . "
However , more research is needed to see if this relationship holds in other geograpic settings .
Hitt and Hendryx note that a recently developed ecological integrity dataset for all of North America provides scientists with this opportunity .

The death toll from the powerful earthquake that struck western China Wednesday rose to at least 617 people on Thursday , with 10,000 more injured as many remained buried under debris , Chinese state media reported .
The quake , which struck at 7:49 a.m. in Qinghai Province , bordering Tibet , had a magnitude of 7.1 , according to China ’s earthquake agency .
At least 18 aftershocks measuring more than 6.0 followed throughout the day , government officials said , according to Xinhua .
China ’s earthquake agency said the quake centered on Yushu County , a remote and mountainous area sparsely populated by farmers and herdsmen , most of them ethnic Tibetans .
The region , pocked with copper , tin and coal mines , is also rich in natural gas .
As with the devastating earthquake two years ago that killed 87,000 in neighboring Sichuan Province , many buildings collapsed , including schools .
But with Qinghai ’s far smaller and less dense population , the toll is likely to remain far lower .
How Christianity Lost Jesus Editor ’s Note :
It is one of the conundrums of religious history : How did Christianity , a religion based on the teachings of a pacifist who said love your enemy and who defended the poor and vulnerable , become so twisted into nearly its opposite ?
Why did dominant Christian institutions , like the Vatican , amass obscene wealth and immense power ?
How could individuals – the likes of George W. Bush – who claim to be devout followers of Jesus unleash the fearsome might of modern military technologies to slaughter peoples in faraway lands ?
In this guest essay , Rev. Howard Bess traces this Christian mystery to the chronology of when the books of the New Testament were committed to writing and to whether the apostle Paul was even aware of Jesus ’s Sermon on the Mount :
We call Chapters 5 , 6 and 7 of the Matthew Gospel the Sermon on the Mount .
It is without question our finest summary of the teachings of Jesus .
Email
Printer friendly
While the gospels about Jesus are filled with the stories that he told and others about what he did , the Sermon on the Mount is different .
The Sermon on the Mount is a collection of his aphorisms or short sayings .
Under the critical analysis of our best Bible scholars , the Sermon on the Mount stands as authentic Jesus material .
I have concluded that if people want to follow Jesus , they need to read and digest the Sermon on the Mount .
Near the end of Chapter 5 , the great challenge of Jesus is laid down .
“ You have heard the saying ‘ an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth ; ’ but I say to you do not resist one who is evil .
If anyone strikes you on the right cheek , turn to him the other side .
And if someone sues you and takes your coat , let him have your cloak as well .
You have also heard it said ‘ love your neighbor and hate your enemy ; ’ but I say to you love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you . ”
Nothing was more basic to the society in which Jesus lived and taught than the declaration “ an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth . ”
The saying is a clear expression of the understanding of sin as a debt to be paid . …
This concept was commonly applied to God.
Break one of God ’s rules and God will repay insult for insult .
In the prevailing understanding of Judaism in Jesus ’s day , sin was a debt that must be paid .
Jews traveled long distances to Jerusalem to make blood sacrifices to pay God the price of their sin .
Jesus argued against the prevailing system .
Jesus did not believe that punishment cured the problem of sin .
He rejected the concept of sin as a debt that must be paid .
In this opinion , he joined a minority of Old Testament prophets who believed that the antidotes for sin were love and acts of kindness .
It is my observation that in the 21st century the vast majority of Christians have embraced “ an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth . ”
Not only have Christians embraced what Jesus denied , the western world has adopted the standard of “ a debt must be paid . ”
Penalties are supposed to fit the crime and an offender must pay his debt to society .
Christians have become what Jesus despised and rejected .
How did this happen ?
Look no further than Paul , the author of about half of the material that we have in our New Testaments .
Paul had a mysterious experience that he believed was with Jesus .
It happened a few years after the death of the man from Galilee as Paul traveled on the road to Damascus .
Paul ’s experience with Jesus took place decades before any of the parables , aphorisms and stories about Jesus were put in written form .
They existed only as oral traditions .
In the many letters that Paul wrote there is no hint that he was aware of what we now call the Sermon on the Mount .
Paul was Jewish by birth , training and conviction .
He was steeped in the tradition of sin as being debt .
Paul wrote a theology for the early church .
The book of Romans is the center piece of his theology .
Paul embraced the idea that the debt of sin must be paid .
Jesus ’s death on the cross was the payment .
All of Paul ’s letters were written and were being circulated decades before any of the four gospels were put in written form .
Paul ’s theology won the day over the teachings of Jesus .
In the history of Christian churches , there have been many ardent followers who have advocated a return to the teachings of Jesus , but Paul ’s concept of Jesus ’s crucifixion as the payment of the debt of mankind ’s sin became imbedded in the central ceremony of Christians , in the Roman Catholic Mass and the Protestant Communion .
Paul ’s theology still has a stranglehold on the Christian churches and on Christians .
Human beings have a long history of behaving badly .
They lie ; they cheat ; they steal ; and when pressed , they kill one another with abandon .
They actually believe they can fight with honor .
There is no evidence that the practice of “ eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth ” ever produced an honorable result , made people more whole with lives that are more satisfying , or produced a society that is good for all .
The good news is that Jesus is still looking for followers , who want to go on a different kind of a journey .

It ’s not yet illegal , but federal officials and local law enforcement have pulled the popular , marijuana - like substance known as K2 off the shelves at the Lawrence store Sacred Journey , 1103 Mass .
The Food and Drug Administration , along with area police , raided the store and a major distributor of the herbal mixture Thursday , leading to drug charges against a Lawrence man in Jefferson County .
Jonathan Sloan , 29 , owner of Bouncing Bears Botanicals , was charged in Jefferson County District Court on Friday with eight felony drug offenses , including the unlawful manufacturing and distribution of controlled substances .
Jefferson County Attorney Caleb Stegall said Sloan was arrested after an investigation of a warehouse facility he owns in Oskaloosa , north of Lawrence .
Bouncing Bears Botanicals , 14501 S. U.S. Highway 59 , had supplied Sacred Journey with K2 , along with other herbal products .
Federal , state and local authorities seized more than $ 700,000 in cash from Sloan ’s business and bank accounts .
Numerous items , including thousands of cactus plants and 20 toads , were removed from the warehouse , according to warehouse employees and Sloan ’s attorney .
The charges come one day after law enforcement seized Sacred Journey ’s entire K2 supply , other “ ethnobotanicals ” and certain cactus plants .
Authorities on scene said the FDA was in charge of the investigation , but an FDA spokesman said the agency does not publicly comment on active investigations .
The raid and seizure at the store came as a “ shock ” to Melissa Hart , who resigned as Sacred Journey store manager on Friday .
She said the store was very careful in ensuring that the products it sold complied with state and federal laws .
“ We had no knowledge of anything that was illegal , ” she said .
The store reopened Friday .
The FDA has yet to release further details about the investigation .
Sloan ’s attorney , Scott Gyllenborg , said his client was operating a legitimate botanical plant business , which he said was “ one of the country ’s , if not the world ’s , biggest distributors of these botanicals . ”
“ These are remedies .
These are items used in religious ceremonies that are legal , that can be put to illegal purposes , ” Gyllenborg said .
Sloan is scheduled to return April 13 to Jefferson County District Court for a preliminary hearing .
Prosecutors said more charges could be filed against him .
Bond was set at $ 150,000 .
Johnson County officials raised public awareness about K2 in November , warning that the substance is a synthetic version of marijuana , though it ’s marketed as an incense .
Kansas
House legislators this week passed a bill that would make illegal the sale or possession of the substances found in K2 , but that legislation has yet to become law .
Gov. Mark Parkinson has spoken in favor of the bill , which is expected to hit his desk this session .
Sacred Journey has been at the center of the debate about K2 , as store employees and customers have begun speaking out against a ban on the substance .
Moscow , Russia ( CNN ) -- Russian President Dmitry Medvedev called for the resignation of the nation 's top Olympic officials Monday after the country 's worst performance in a Winter Olympics in nearly a hundred years .
Speaking on state television from his residence outside Moscow , Medvedev put the main blame for Team Russia 's failures on sports bureaucrats , whom he called " fat cats , " and said the country 's sports pyramid should be turned upside down .
Despite infusions of cash , patriotic pep talks and bravado , the Russian team suffered a humiliating blow at the Olympic Winter Games in Vancouver , Canada , coming in 11th with three gold , five silver and seven bronze medals .
It was Russia 's poorest showing since it began competing in the Winter Olympics in 1912 .
" Unprecedented investments are being made in sports in Russia , but money is not everything , " Medvedev said .
" We need to think about how we change our training methods .
The new training system should focus on athletes who should be put at its cornerstone , not sports federations and their executives -- and not even the trainers , with all our great respect to them .
Athletes are those who bring victories , and they should become the focus of our attention . "
Russian president right to want glory
Medvedev said he will thank the few athletes who won medals at the Olympics and give them government awards .
Russia 's poor performance has angered members of the public , who have vented their rage on the Internet .
" It 's been a total washout , " wrote blogger Valere Pryakhin .
" It hurts to see , I should not have watched this .
There 's no team , just empty talk .
Everything 's bad ... "
" I 'm upset to tears with our Olympic ' successes , ' " wrote another blogger .
On the eve of the games , Russian sports officials said the country could expect a place in the top three and predicted its athletes would bring home at least 30 medals .
They also announced that the government would pay athletes 100,000 euros for every gold medal , 60,000 euros for every silver and 40,000 euros for every bronze -- three times as much as athletes competing in the previous Winter Olympics , in Torino , Italy in 2006 , were paid .
But problems started early on , and by the end of the first week of the Olympics , the country had won just one bronze medal .
Russian athletes , trainers and sport officials blamed bad luck , lousy weather , equipment failure , echoes of previous doping scandals , judges ' bias and other factors for its dismal showing .
" Team Russia has already won gold for the multiple excuses of its losses , " a popular Moscow tabloid scoffed .
But it was in figure skating and ice hockey -- the two sports where Russia has for decades been an international powerhouse -- that Russia suffered its strongest and most devastating blow .
In figure skating , it was the first time since 1964 that a Soviet or Russian team did not win any gold .
And in the hockey quarterfinals , the Russian national team lost to Canada for the first time in half a century of Olympic matchups .
Russia 's Olympic performance was a ticking time bomb doomed to explode sooner or later , sports analysts have said .
The old Soviet infrastructure is rapidly wearing out , including its once - famous sports machine producing record - breaking performances .
Many trainers and promising young athletes went abroad in the 1990s when the country was struggling for its economic survival .
Finally , fewer babies were born in the past two decades , creating a generation gap for the sports recruitment system .
" We have been living on Soviet resources for a long time , but that is over now , " Medvedev said .
The poor showing caused particular concern because Russia is hosting the next Winter Olympic Games , in the Black Sea resort of Sochi in 2014 .
" Each of us had strong negative feelings [ about the Vancouver games ] , " Medvedev said .
" But there is no time for grieving .
We should stop that and move forward -- the main thing is getting prepared for the 2014 Olympics , and all of our resources should be geared to that . "
Within six months
The couple can keep their current benefits , but the plan can no longer set lifetime limits on coverage or drop them if they get sick .
2013
The couple will contribute more to the Medicare program from their payroll taxes , 2.35 percent instead of the current 1.45 percent , because they earn more than $ 250,000 .
They will also pay an additional 3.8 percent tax on their investment income .
Some tax breaks for medical costs will be reduced .
Flexible spending accounts , which typically allow employees to shelter as much as $ 4,000 or $ 5,000 from taxes , will be reduced to $ 2,500 , and they will not pay for over - the - counter drugs .
They must spend more than 10 percent of their income on medical expenses before they can be deducted , up from the existing 7.5 percent threshold .
2014 and after
The couple ’s plan might have to meet new coverage standards , if the insurer makes significant changes in benefits or cost - sharing .
In 2018 , the most expensive insurance policies would be subject to a new tax , which means the couple could face higher costs or lower benefits .

Every age has taboos , just like it has ideals .
These are the stick and the carrot , respectively .
If you want to succeed , find some way to justify what you ’re doing in terms of the ideals ; if you want to knock out some competition , bully them and accuse them of being the taboo .
One of the big ones for this age , like calling someone a pedophile , is the term racist , which has dangerous political implications .
And no matter what we do , the problem never seems to go away , and may not go away until we ’re all a uniform grey color and have no ancestry line to speak of .
Abandon your MySpace account for Facebook ?
You might just be a racist .
At a keynote speech during New Yorkâ€™s Democracy forum at Lincoln Center , Danah Boyd spoke of the racial disparity and possible reasons for mass abandonment of MySpace for the â€œmore culturedâ€  and â€œless cheesyâ€ social networking site Facebook .
Boyd , a social media researcher for Microsoft and fellow of the Harvard University Berkman Center for Internet and Society , stated : â€ œWe might as well face an uncomfortable reality â€¦ what happened was modern day â€˜white flightâ€ ™.â€ 
Referring to MySpace as the â€œghetto of the digital landscape , â€  Boyd indicated that MySpace users are more likely to be â€œbrown or blackâ€  and espouse a different set of ideals in conflict with those espoused by the teens she surveyed over four years .
She said that patterns in migration across social networking sites echoed those of a white exodus from cities in the past .
Boyd also said that teens who use Facebook are more likely to condescend their MySpace - favoring peers .

And then , other language problems blunder into the sensitivity zone of Westerners :
Russian Energy giant Gazprom has inadvertently walked into a racism row with the announcement of its joint venture in Nigeria – Nigaz .
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and his Nigerian counterpart Umaru Yar ’Adua last week agreed the deal to build refineries , pipelines and gas power stations in Africa ’s most populous nation .
The name is meant to be an amalgamation of ‘ Nigeria ’ and ‘ Gazprom ’ , pronounced ‘ nye - gaz ’ , but it can be read phonetically as an offensive term for those of black African origin .
The Daily Mail
It ’s like a witch hunt : it ’s such a flexible accusation that , should you not be surrounded by minorities , you can be at any time accused of being a witch and have a massive public problem .
Since most people want to stay out of the public eye — they know the public is equal parts a weeping sap and a lynch mob — this creates a terrifying state where one either pro-actively defends against the possible accusation at great cost , or just hopes the lottery does n’t pick your number one day .
Final word from a sensible Nigerian :
One Nigerian in Lagos said : ‘ White people are making too much of this .
‘ As long as the Russians pay us , they can call it what they like . ’

This formed the basis for her practice as an artist creating sculptural installations and continues to influence her work at present .
Dairy farmers are to be rewarded for maintaining healthy herds for the first time under a new payment method that offers bonuses for high standards of animal welfare .
The retailer Marks & Spencer will unveil the scheme next week , agreeing to pay a " fair price " to producers which reflects production costs as well as the retail price of milk , and provides incentives for improving animal living conditions .
The move could help stabilise the beleaguered dairy industry .
Milk is one of the top - selling items of food and drink in the UK , with more than 180 m pints consumed every week .
But the industry has been hard hit , with profits squeezed by retailers which have paid them only a small premium .
A supermarkets ombudsman demanded by the National Farmers ' Union – delayed until after the election – could ease this situation .
The new scheme from M&S , called Milk Pledge Plus , offers a price based on a formula that takes into account the M&S retail milk price .
In addition , the retailer will pay farmers agreed bonuses based on the objectives of a plan that aims to ensure high standards of animal welfare , health and sustainability .
To create a clear set of objectives for its farmers to achieve and be measured against , M&S has teamed up with the Bristol vet school ( part of Bristol University ) , which will monitor the scheme to ensure that farmers make continuous improvements to animal health and welfare .
Paul Willgoss , M&S head of technology , said : " Our new milk scheme will not only continue to give farmers greater security , but it will also incentivise them to have the highest levels of animal health and welfare , so that our customers can enjoy our milk safe in the knowledge that it comes from farms with the highest standards . "
Mark Taylor , group milk production director of Dairy Crest – a major supplier to M&S and which supplies 18 % of total UK milk consumption – said : " This is genuinely groundbreaking .
Farmers are being given the opportunity to maximise their profit , and if they hit all the targets they can achieve a better milk price . "
He said that although M&S was not one of the major retailers of milk in the UK , its relatively small share of the market meant it had the scope to be innovative .
Jim Begg , director general of the national trade body Dairy UK , said : " This is a further evolution and deepening of co-operation across the supply chain between a leading retailer and its suppliers .
It shows that collaboration between farmers , processors and retailers is one of the best routes to securing the industry 's future . "
The scheme was devised in close consultation with farmers , who welcomed the move .
The Soil Association , which represents organic farmers , said it approved of " any kind of initiative which gives farmers a fairer price for their product and which encourages better animal welfare standards . "
Richard Brook , an M&S dairy farmer in Chichester , West Sussex , said : " It is vitally important to the future of our business that we make sure our cows are healthy and reared to the highest welfare standards so that we can continue to produce quality milk .
Having the reassurance that we will be rewarded for our investment in these areas is a huge step forwards and something we are very excited about . "
So this is impressive : A group of 150 high school students in Utah have created a 6,400 - square - foot replica of Vincent van Gogh ’s Starry Night out of two tons breakfast cereal — Malt - O - Meal to be exact .
It took them almost a week to complete the entire thing ; a plastic sheet with an outline of the design dictated which colors went where .
This epic project reminds us of the more small - scale works ( at least in comparison ) found in San Francisco - based artist Ryan Alexiev ‘s campy Cereal Mosaics series ; check out images from that after the jump .

Inside the 2010 Syfy Channel Upfront
Last night I attended the annual Syfy Channel Upfront , where the stars chatted up the media on the red carpet , executives made their important presentation to advertisers and everybody got to party afterward .
I covered the event both for AOL TV and for ADD , so you ’ll be seeing those stories posted in the near future .
This year ’s Upfront took place at the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan , where the Tim Burton exhibit is currently being held ( and which Syfy is a proud sponsor of ) .
It was a great location for this sneak peek into Syfy ’s forthcoming year , not only because of the chance to see the Burton artwork but also because of the large space where the party was held afterward .
Syfy President Dave Howe , Blake Callaway ( SVP , Brand and Integrated Marketing ) and Chris Czarkowski ( VP , Sales , USA and Syfy ) kept the official presentation moving along fast and furious with good wit , and they were quite accessible afterward , as were the stars .
The channel also displayed a self - deprecating sense of humor by showing a clip of Stephen Colbert making fun of their name change from Sci Fi to Syfy .
Good call .
Tracy Morgan sent a video message announcing he will now be executive producer as well as the host of Scare Tactics , and he excused his absence due to his “ fear of modern art ” .
Here ’s a photo gallery of the event .
Stories forthcoming !
The following is a slightly altered transcript of Rev. Gaddy ’s commentary from an upcoming broadcast of State of Belief .
Originally , I intended to devote my commentary to tributes to Benjamin Hooks and to Dorothy Height , admired courageous civil rights leaders who died this past week .
Each exemplified the best of efforts aimed at helping our nation move closer to a realization of the full promise of our Constitution .
Dr. Height had marched against lynching as a teenager .
As she developed as an activist , her vision of freedom was as large as all women , as well as all African Americans .
She understood that in this democracy there should be no boundaries around freedom or hierarchies of privilege .
So my plans for today ’s commentary changed .
Frankly , following the news this past week gave me the sensation of watching a car wreck while holding my breath in anticipation of learning how many people had been , or would be found , injured by the crash .
Enter Sarah Palin , the driver at the wheel of a political vehicle that has catapulted out of control .
Obviously Sarah Palin does not know enough about the road of democracy or the rules for driving it .
Frightened people looking for a quick fix for their fears and alleviation of their anxieties are being hurt by a distorted version of American history and a perverted vision of the future .
This past week in Louisville , Kentucky , the former governor of Alaska told a crowd , in response to a federal court ruling that a government celebrated National Day of Prayer was unconstitutional , that “ America needs to get back to its Christian roots . ”
Sadly , Sarah Palin cannot distinguish between fanciful images of revisionist historians and actual facts documentable in the chronicles of the nation ’s archives .
She has turned a deaf ear to George Washington who asserted that “ The government of the United States is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion , ” and to his successor John Adams — who knew the Constitution better than Ms. Palin — when , after signing a treaty with a mostly Muslim nation , repeated Washington ’s comment almost verbatim .
I suppose the popular speaker would have us establish one religion over all others — hers , of course — and subject our nation to the possibility of the kind of violent political wars that were averted here because of the wisdom of our founders .
But , of course , she seems to consider guns more friend than weapon as she shouts , “ Reload . ”
Palin has thrown what we used to call in West Tennessee “ a conniption fit ” over the federal judge ’s decision that the National Day of Prayer is unconstitutional .
While many of us applauded a judge who seems to understand the First Amendment ’s religion clauses , some political pontificators and bandwagon religionists rushed to microphones to decry the further moral ruination of the nation .
Setting aside all Constitutional arguments for a moment , I am always suspicious of people who seem not to understand the theology of prayer and who seem preoccupied with support only for prayers that attract public attention rather than prayers offered to God in solitude .
Palin said she finds a ruling such as this “ mind - boggling . ”
That is precisely the reaction I have to her alarmist rhetoric that seems sensitive to nothing more than grabbing another headline in her next high - paying talk .
Palin did get one thing right in her Louisville speech .
She said the Founding Fathers were believers .
That is a true statement .
Many of them were deists , but few of them were Christians by Palin ’s narrow evangelical definition .
However , the larger truth is that these were people , regardless of their religious identity , who had witnessed the abuse and violence that emerge when institutions of religion and government became entangled .
Palin and her followers represent danger to religion and government .
They understand neither the freedom for everybody at the heart of real religion nor the religious freedom assured by the Constitution .
The American people do not need the President of the United States to tell them when to pray or what to pray for .
By definition prayer is personal and volitional .
But neither do the American people need Sarah Palin stirring a revolt to get rid of the very principles that have assured efforts to guarantee civil rights to everybody and made our nation great .
It is , indeed , like watching a car wreck that has just happened or is about to happen .
It is time for more of us to scream , “ Watch out ! ”
Considering its 85 tonnes and its potential to shape the future of maritime travel , the launch of Türanor was a surprisingly reserved affair .
The world 's largest solar - powered boat made a gentle plop as it was lowered by a huge crane on to the waters of the Kiel firth in northern Germany today , and triggered the polite applause of onlookers – mainly fishermen and shipyard workers .
" We 've made it , she 's safe , and she floats , " whispered its owner , Immo Ströher , with tears welling in his eyes .
But the real challenges for the gleaming white catamaran still lie ahead , as its makers seek to use it to prove that the sun can fuel our world .
Next year , after an intense testing phase , Türanor – the name , inspired by JRR Tolkein 's Lord of the Rings , means " power of the sun " – will embark on her maiden voyage , a round - the - world trip during which her two - man crew will attempt to chase the sun in order to capture as much available solar power as possible and navigate her at an average speed of 7.5 knots .
Ströher 's granddaughter christened her today by smashing a bottle of champagne against her teak deck , and pronouncing : " May you always have plenty of water under your bows , and sun on your deck . "
The 31 - metre-long multi-hull vessel , the brainchild of Swiss former ambulance driver Raphael Domjan , is topped by scores of photovoltaic panels , with a total area of more than 600 sq metres , that covers most of the catamaran 's surface .
Additional panels are attached to outriggers on its starboard , port and stern sections , that can be retracted in stormy weather .
The solar energy , which will be stored in the largest lithium ion battery in the world , will power the vessel 's silent , pollution - free electric motor .
" The mission of the skippers will be to chase the sun , " said Dany Faigaux , a member of PlanetSolar , the Swiss team behind the ambitious project .
" Up until now , sailing navigation has involved working with the three parameters of the waves , wind and tide .
But we 've added two new dimensions – namely , sunlight and the lithium ion battery .
It 's a completely new form of energy management . "
The £ 16 m catamaran – chosen for its energy - saving ability to " slice " rather than " ride " through waves – will store energy in its batteries by day .
It can run on its stored energy in the absence of sunlight for around three days at 7.5 knots , the speed of an average oil tanker .
At slower speeds it could run for up to 15 days , according to its makers .
Türanor , which will travel along an equatorial route – to take most advantage of the sunshine – will be helped by French meteorologists who will advise the most efficient path along which to steer it according to current conditions and forecasts .
If it is a particularly cloudy day , they might recommend a diversion to sunnier parts , even if the route turns out to be longer .
" Its all about maximising its energy efficiency , " said Faigaux .
The 34,000 - mile journey will take the vessel across the Atlantic , the Panama Canal , the Pacific , the Indian Ocean and the Suez Canal to the Mediterranean over a scheduled 160 days .
The voyage is intended not so much to revolutionise sea travel – the technology requires the vessel to be as light as possible , so it would not be suitable for heavy container ships – as to prove the under - exploited potential of solar energy .
" We want to be the Phileas Fogg of the 21st century , " said 38 - year old Domjan , the project 's pioneer .
" But beyond Jules Verne 's dream , our project is meant to serve the environment and to enable solar energy to replace fossil fuels , and to motivate engineers and scientists to develop these technologies , " he said .
Appropriately , one of the patron's of the project is Jean Verne , the great - grandson of the French author of Around the World in Eighty Days .
" I do n't know why no one has tried it before , " added Domjan , whose company also boasts what they say is the world 's only solar - powered computer server .
" But what we want to show is that all the technology that is in this boat is technology you can already find on the market , rather than just in the lab , and all of it can be applied to our normal , everyday lives . "
Gerard d'Aboville , his fellow skipper for the forthcoming voyage , is no stranger to maritime challenges , having become the first person to row across the Atlantic Ocean in 1980 .
" We 'll have to learn a new kind of navigation , " he said .
" It 's very different from any of the other challenges I 've faced , which is what makes it so interesting .
It 's strongly symbolic for the future of solar energy , but I would not dare to say that tomorrow a merchant boat or a passenger plane will be powered by the sun . "
A MAN was accidentally shot in the chest at a gun show in Denver , Colorado , Saturday ( local time ) according local media reports .
The shooting happened at the monthly Tanner Gun Show about 2 pm Saturday ( 7 am Sunday AEDT ) at the Denver Merchandise Mart , FOX 31 reported .
The victim is recovering at Denver Health Medical Center .
A witness told FOX 31 he was shot in the chest .
" I heard the gunshot .
Nobody panicked or anything , so I did n't think too much about it , " said visitor Russ Huntley .
Signs outside the event clearly state , " Absolutely no loaded weapons allowed . "
" Apparently , somebody was looking at the gun .
That gun did discharge and one person was struck , " said Sergeant Candi Baker of the Adams County Sheriff 's Office .
The Tanner Gun Show bills itself as the state 's largest gun show with 700 tables displaying guns , knives , ammunition , reloading equipment , military surplus and hunting and fishing gear .
The show , which drew fire in 1999 when three guns bought there were used by Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris in the Columbine High School shooting , has run in some form since 1964 , The Denver Post reported .
It 's not the first time there 's been a shooting at or around the show - a 64 - year - old Littleton man accidentally shot himself in the stomach with .38 - caliber handgun in the parking lot in 2008 .
The poor , unfairly maligned Double Down .
Yes , that 's right -- we 're here to take up the dubious mantle of Double Down Defenders .
What did it ever do to deserve the kind of scorn that 's been heaped upon it by the media ?
So it 's a sandwich that does n't have any buns .
Good for the Double Down !
It simply replaced all that sugar and starch and overprocessed " flour " ( if you can even call it flour anymore once it's been made into the mass - produced buns that haunt every fast food chain ) with a bunch of protein .
Sure , protein that has a fatty , crunchy exterior , but it 's closer to actual " real " food than those buns were .
And if the fried chicken bothers you , you can always get your Double Down with grilled chicken sandwiching those strips of bacon and cheese .
If you do , you 've just knocked the fat and calorie content of the Double Down even further , from an already pretty manageable 540 calories and 32 grams of fat to an even slimmer 460 calories and 23 grams of fat .
To place this into context , a regular old Big Mac has 540 calories , too ( and just a little bit less fat ) , but you do n't see people proclaiming that the end times are near over a McDonald 's burger .
Instead , what people should be focusing on is the fact that there are far worse fast food choices out there , some of which you may unwittingly make every day .
It 's obvious that Wendy 's Triple Baconator will be the death of you .
But what about a salad ?
What about an item that 's even marked with a cute little heart symbol next to it on the menu ?
The hidden fat and calories in these items make a Double Down look positively macrobiotic in comparison .
Here are some of the worst offenders .
5. McDonald 's Chicken Select Premium Breast Strips ( 5 pieces )
Look at how good you 're being , ordering " premium " chicken strips instead of those McMangled McNuggets .
And you 're eating white meat , not that terrible dark meat !
Sorry , but what you 're actually consuming is 660 calories and 40 grams of fat , not to mention 1680 grams of sodium .
Your bloodstream has more salinity than the Dead Sea now .
Way to go .
4. Jack In The Box's Steak Teriyaki Bowl
Leaving aside for a second that anything served in a bowl in a fast food joint is usually questionable ( sorry , KFC ; we 've got your back on the whole Double Down situation , but these are disgusting ) , let 's instead focus on the fact that this is listed on JITB 's " Healthy Dining " portion of the menu .
Healthy ?
If 750 calories ( 210 more than the Double Down ) and 1750 grams of sodium makes this bowl healthy , then the Double Down itself must be the equivalent of a light garden salad !
Right ?
Well , that really depends on the salad in question ...
3. Wendy's Chicken BLT Salad
Speaking of salads , this is one gut - bomb that you 'll want to avoid .
Sure , there are healthy salads on Wendy 's menu , but this is not the salad you 're looking for .
When combined with the chicken , bacon , cheese , dressing and croutons ( come on , like you 're not going to put the croutons and dressing on it ) , you 're looking at nearly 800 calories and a staggering 53 grams of fat .
For a salad .
Jesus .
2. Burger King's TenderCrisp Garden Salad
This is even less of a salad than the poor Wendy 's abomination above .
Iceberg lettuce , a few cherry tomatoes and strands of carrot , plus a shitload of cheese ( three different kinds ! ) .
Really , the only difference between this and a chicken sandwich is that the sandwiches do n't come with carrot scrapings and usually have a bun .
Once you add the salad dressing to your " salad , " it gets worse : 740 calories and 47 grams of fat .
Did you know Burger King offers veggie burgers ?
That 's what you should be getting instead .
1. Arby 's Market Fresh Pecan Chicken Salad Sandwich
Again , an item that smacks of something " fresh " and healthy , thanks in large part to clever branding by Arby's .
And how bad could pecan chicken salad really be for you ?
How about 830 calories , 44 grams of fat and another 1390 grams of sodium ?
You 're better off making your own chicken salad at home ( with low - fat mayo , please ) if you 're looking for a healthy sandwich .
I was working the following example from Doug Hellmann tutorial on multiprocessing :
import multiprocessing def worker ( ) : " " " worker function " " " print ' Worker ' return if __name__ == ' __main__ ' : jobs = [ ] for i in range ( 5 ) : p = multiprocessing .
Process ( target=worker ) jobs.append ( p ) p.start ( )
When I tried to run it outside the if statement :
import multiprocessing def worker ( ) : " " " worker function " " " print ' Worker ' return jobs = [ ] for i in range ( 5 ) : p = multiprocessing .
Process ( target=worker ) jobs.append( p ) p.start ( )
It started spawning processes non-stop , and the only way to stop it was reboot !
Why would that happen ?
Why it did not generate 5 processes and exit ?
Why do I need the if statement ?
Today I found out the origins of the demotivator meme .
The meme , as we know it today , has its origins in a company called Despair , Inc .
Before them though was a company called Successories .
This company was started by Mac Anderson in 1985 .
Among their products were motivational posters with the now classic black background and text underneath a picture .
Around 1998 along came Despair Inc , who started making spoofs of these motivational posters .
In the beginning , these tended to be near exactly the same as the motivational counterparts which tended to feature some artsy photograph and be “ office friendly ” .
The original demotivators then used similar artsy photos , but would just change the text to be something depressing instead of uplifting .
The demotivators from Despair Inc were eventually popularized by none other than the meme generating machine that is 4 chan .
From here , people started making their own demotivators , now including often racy content and twisted humor .
And the rest is history .
Just for fun , here ’s a bunch of funny demotivators :

Numismaster reports that CFTC Gets Facts of Bullion Manipulation .
( emphasis mine ) [ my comment ]
CFTC Gets Facts of Bullion Manipulation
By Patrick A. Heller
March 30 , 2010
Last Thursday , the Commodity Futures Trading Commission held hearings on the possible imposition of commodity futures and options trading limits in the precious metals markets .
Each of the five commissioners plus two CFTC staff members made presentations .
In addition , 14 outside parties accepted invitations to make presentations .
This hearing came about in part because of long - term complaints from organizations such as the Gold Anti-Trust Action Committee and individual analysts such as Ted Butler , Reg Howe , James Turk , Frank Veneroso and Adrian Douglas that the gold and silver commodity markets have been subject to blatant extensive price suppression manipulation by the U.S. government and its trading partners .
Among the outsiders making presentations at this hearing were Bill Murphy , in his capacity as chairman of GATA , and Harvey Organ , an individual investor .
Murphy was advised to expect a strict time limit of five minutes for his presentation , even though the CFTC chairman Gary Gensler had the option to allow more time .
In order to provide the maximum documentation possible into the official written record of these proceedings , Murphy raced through his 6 - 1/ 2 minute oral presentation in just five minutes .
It was not a graceful presentation , but Murphy introduced a lot information into the record that the CFTC can no longer pretend not to know .
After his formal remarks , Murphy was asked by commissioner Bart Chilton if he could provide some specific instances where such manipulation had occurred .
This was the opening for Murphy to introduce a bombshell .
In November 2009 , Andrew Maguire , a former Goldman Sachs silver trader in that firm ’s London office , had contacted the CFTC Enforcement Division to report the illegal manipulation of the silver market by traders at JPMorgan Chase .
He described how the JPMorgan Chase silver traders bragged openly about their actions , including how they gave a signal to the market in advance so that other traders could make a profit during the price suppressions .
Maguire had a series of e-mails with Eliud Ramirez of the CFTC Enforcement Division explaining how the manipulations were tied to the Bureau of Labor Statistics monthly release of non-farm payroll figures and other recurring events .
On Feb .
3 , 2010 , Maguire sent an e-mail to Ramirez and commissioner Chilton saying that he had observed the JPMorgan Chase signal that the price of silver would be knocked down upon the announcement of the non-farm payroll report at 8:30 a.m. on Feb .
5 . Maguire then sent them e-mails on Feb. 5 as this suppression was in process , pointing out that it would not be possible for him to have such accurate advance information about this development if the markets were not controlled by JPMorgan Chase .
Maguire asked to be invited to speak at the CFTC hearings this past Thursday .
When he was not invited , he contacted Adrian Douglas , another director of GATA , on March 23 to supply this information to be made public at the CFTC hearings .
Murphy filled Maguire ’s request in response to Chilton ’s question asking for specific instances of price manipulation .
When I saw him Saturday , Murphy told me that the CFTC commissioners all went pale as he described exactly how the CFTC was provided this detailed information about silver price manipulation but had not yet done anything about it .
During Harvey Organ ’s presentation , a question came up about whether large short positions on the London Bullion Market Exchange also reflected efforts to suppress gold and silver prices .
Adrian Douglas was permitted to address the hearing on this issue , a subject he has studied extensively .
Douglas pointed out that the huge volume of trading levels in the London market ( averaging $ 22 billion per day ) could not possibly be settled by delivery of physical metals .
To this point , the commissioners asked Jeffrey Christian , one of the other speakers who runs CPM Group – one of the most respected precious metals consultancies , whether Douglas ’s contention that the London gold and silver markets could not be settled by delivery of physical metal for all the contracts .
Christian rejects the concept that the gold and silver markets are manipulated , but he did confirm Douglas ’s analysis .
In effect , the commissioners were told that almost all of the trading activities on the London exchange were merely settled by paper for paper , not for physical metals as the exchange supposedly requires .
Further , the commissioners were told that it was impossible for the London exchange to ever deliver all the gold and silver owed to the owners of contracts .
After the hearing , GATA publicly released copies of Maguire ’s e-mails with the CFTC .
Murphy also revealed that Maguire had recorded all of his telephone conversations with the CFTC without asking for their permission to do so .
This is legal to do in Britain , but such recordings cannot legally be provided to other parties .
GATA is currently working to ensure that these recorded conversations can be legally released to the public .
This past Saturday , Murphy addressed a full room with his Numismatic Theatre presentation at the American Numismatic Association convention in Fort Worth .
There , he shared much of the breaking information he provided to the CFTC commissioners .
Little did we know at the time , but at about then Andrew Maguire ’s car , in which his wife and he were riding , was struck by a hit - and - run driver .
Both Maguire and his wife were briefly hospitalized .
The police eventually arrested the other driver .
The Maguires may be considered more than lucky .
There are other past would - be whistle blowers about the manipulation in gold and silver markets that died in unusual accidents before they were able to bring forth their evidence .
Curiously , the live television broadcast of the CFTC hearing suffered a technical failure right as Murphy was set to begin his testimony .
This was corrected right after Murphy was finished .
At the same time , at least one live voice broadcast failed during Murphy ’s presentation .
Coincidence ?
Now that this information about silver price manipulation and about the massive shortage of physical gold and silver on the London exchange is part of the official record , I expect huge fallout .
Remember , after the five men were arrested for breaking into the Democratic headquarters in Watergate in June 1972 , it took more than two years for President Nixon to resign .
I do n’t think it will take anywhere near this long for last Thursday ’s revelations to blow back against the U.S. government and the U.S. dollar .
Once the public realizes the extent of the manipulation , gold and silver prices are likely to skyrocket .
I think this hearing will be the beginning of the end for those trying to suppress gold and silver prices .

The Huffington Post reports that It 's Ponzimonium in the Gold Market .
It 's Ponzimonium in the Gold Market
Posted : March 31 , 2010 10:13 AM
Nathan Lewis
We 've had a string of amazing revelations recently regarding the world 's precious metals market .
This is important stuff for anyone ( like me ) who holds gold as a means to avoid currency turmoil and counterparty risk .
( My earlier post on shenanigans at the Comex gold market . )
This news has been actively suppressed in the mainstream media .
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission , a U.S. government regulatory agency , held hearings in Washington D.C. in late March regarding position limits in the futures market .
People involved in the markets have known / suspected for years that they have been manipulated by certain large entities , notably JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs .
Analysts like silver maven , Ted Butler , hedge fund giant , Eric Sprott , and the Gold Anti-Trust Action Committee ( GATA ) have been collecting evidence of this manipulation for years .
These hearings were supposed to be a non-event [ which is why I did n’t blog about them ] .
However , despite the media lock - down , the word is getting out .
The CFTC , like the SEC , is a conflicted agency .
Some people , notably Chairman Gary Gensler and Commissioner Bart Chilton , seem to want to clean up the sleaze , fraud and corruption .
The CFTC even invited GATA 's Bill Murphy and Adrian Douglas to make statements .
Would you be surprised to learn that the cameras had a " technical malfunction " during Bill Murphy 's statement , which magically righted itself immediately after he finished ?
After the hearing , according to Douglas , Murphy was contacted by several major media outlets for more interviews .
Within 24 hours , all the interviews were canceled .
All of them .
You can follow the links above to see the research that Butler , Sprott and GATA have done over the years .
That was only one part of the emerging story .
The second part is the appearance of London metals trader and now whistleblower Andrew Maguire , who understands JP Morgan 's manipulation scheme inside and out .
Maguire understands the process so well that he was able to describe it to the CFTC's Bart Chilton on the phone in real time .
As in : " in a few minutes , they are going to do this , and then they will do that . "
Listen to an extended interview with Maguire and GATA 's Adrian Douglas on King World News here .
Maguire has taken some personal risks to tell all this in public .
In fact , almost immediately after his initial statements , he was run over by a car while walking down the street .
The driver sped away , nearly running over some other pedestrians in his haste to escape .
Fortunately , Maguire survived the hit - and - run " accident " with minor injuries .
What a coincidence .
The third item was during the question - and - answer session at the CFTC hearings .
GATA 's Adrian Douglas .
For many years , people assumed that the London Bullion Market Association ( LBMA ) , the world 's largest gold market , was a simple bullion market .
Cash for gold .
However , just in the past few months , more people are realizing that there is actually very little gold within the LBMA system .
Even long - time gold specialists like Maguire have been amazed to learn that there is no gold corresponding to the vast " gold deposits " at the major LBMA banks .
During the CFTC hearings , Jeffrey Christian of CPM Group apparently informed us that the LBMA banks actually have about a hundred times more gold deposits than actual gold bullion .
This means that there are thousands of clients -- Asian and Middle Eastern governments and sovereign wealth funds among them -- who think they own hundreds of billions and perhaps trillions of dollars of gold bullion , and are being charged storage fees on that fantasy bullion , but they really own unsecured gold loans to the banks at a negative interest rate .
There is nothing new about this .
Morgan Stanley paid several million dollars in 2007 to settle claims that it had charged 22,000 clients for storage fees on silver bullion that did n't exist .
Imagine now that you are one of these people who think they own billions of dollars of gold in an LBMA bank depository .
Now you find out that this gold does n't really exist .
You would ask for delivery of your gold immediately .
It would be a " run on the bank . "
What about things like ETFs linked to gold ?
Most of them also claim , as assets , these " deposits " at the LBMA banks .
The entire gold market is complete " ponzimonium , " a word popularized by the CFTC's Bart Chilton .
LBMA Bullion Market Ponzi Scheme
PR Newswire reports that gold / silver short squeeze could be imminent .
Silver Short Squeeze Could Be Imminent
FORT LEE , N.J. , April 3 / PRNewswire / --
The National Inflation Association today issued a silver update to its http://inflation.us/ members :
…
On February 3rd , Andrew Maguire wrote Eliud Ramirez , a senior investigator for the CFTC's Enforcement Division , giving him the " heads up " for a " manipulative event " signaled for February 5th .
He warned the CFTC that JP Morgan was about to manipulate down the price of silver after the release of non-farm payroll data on February 5th .
Andrew said that the takedown would happen regardless of if employment was better or worse than expected and the price of silver would be flushed to below $ 15 per ounce .
During the next couple of days , silver was crushed from $ 16.17 per ounce down to a low of $ 14.62 per ounce .
Despite all of the evidence given by Andrew Maguire to the CFTC of gold and silver manipulation , Andrew was n't allowed to speak at last week 's CFTC hearing on limiting gold and silver positions held by banks like JP Morgan .
Bill Murphy of the Gold Anti-Trust Action Committee ( GATA ) was allowed to speak ( within a five - minute time constraint ) and present some of Andrew Maguire 's evidence , but right when his presentation began there was a technical failure of the live television broadcast , which was mysteriously fixed as soon as he was done speaking .
Bill Murphy was scheduled for several mainstream media television interviews after the CFTC hearings , but they were all abruptly cancelled at once .
A couple of days after the CFTC meeting , Andrew Maguire and his wife were involved in a bizarre hit - and - run car accident in London where a second car coming out of a side street struck their vehicle , which resulted in a police chase using helicopters and patrol cars before the suspect was nabbed .
Andrew and his wife were released from the hospital with minor injuries .
( NIA does not believe in conspiracy theories but when you consider that this is a potential multi-trillion dollar fraud that could bring down the world 's financial system , it really makes you think . )
The silver market provides a window into what is happening in the gold market .
Because the silver market is very small and its short position is so concentrated , its price is easier to manipulate than gold , but the same manipulation is taking place in gold on a much larger but less noticeable scale .
In our opinion , the CFTC is under pressure not to do anything about the manipulation because the lower gold and silver prices are , the stronger the U.S. dollar appears to be .
If we saw an explosion to the upside in gold and silver prices , it would result in a complete loss of confidence in the U.S. dollar .
NIA believes the precious metals markets are currently being artificially suppressed by paper gold and silver that does n't physically exist .
At last week 's CFTC hearings , Jeffrey Christian of the CPM Group admitted that banks have leveraged their physical bullion by 100 to 1 .
This means for every 100 ounces of paper gold / silver that trade , there could be as little as 1 ounce of physical gold / silver in the vaults backing it .
However , Mr. Christian sees no problem with this because he says " it has been persistently that way for decades " and there are " any number of mechanisms allowing for cash settlements . "
What Mr. Christian fails to realize is that most investors around the world holding paper gold / silver believe they own physical gold / silver .
There will come a time when these investors do n't want cash settlements in U.S. dollars , but they will want the physical precious metals themselves .
When investors around the globe eventually call for physical delivery of their precious metals , NIA believes it will result in the biggest short squeeze in the history of all commodities .
Howestreet reports about “ New Dynamic " in the Gold Market .
A “ New Dynamic ” in the Gold Market
April 1 , 2010 –
The shorts in gold – and particularly the shorts in silver – felt some pain today .
Gold climbed $ 11.80 to close on the Comex at $ 1125.10 , a 1.1 % gain for the day .
Silver did nearly twice as well , up 2.1 % for the day and ending at $ 17.876 , the highest in ten weeks .
The gold / silver ratio fell to 62.9 from 63.6 the day before .
Now that the downward pressure put on gold and silver prices by the gold cartel for option expiry and quarter - end window dressing is behind us , it is no surprise that the precious metals have jumped higher .
Physical demand – which is always the major driver of the gold price in the long - run – remains strong , as evidenced by high premiums pretty much everywhere .
The big news that has now begun influencing the market is the stunning revelation by GATA at a Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) hearing last week about the London whistle - blower who had explained to the CFTC how JP Morgan Chase has been manipulating / capping precious metal prices .
In a shocking parallel to the inaction by the SEC after receiving warnings from Harry Markopolos about the Madoff ponzi , the CFTC has apparently been sitting on this information .
The whistle - blower , Andrew Maguire , is an experienced precious metal trader in London .
In this riveting interview on King World News with GATA director , Adrian Douglas , Maguire describes a “ new dynamic ” impacting gold .
Specifically , there is a huge short position in the market .
But there is even more .
The CFTC hearing confirmed what GATA has been saying all along , that the gold market is being manipulated .
To achieve this manipulation , the gold cartel has accumulated a huge short position .
Importantly , the hearing confirmed that the gold cartel ’s huge short positions are ‘ naked ’ , meaning that these positions are not hedged .
More to the point , the CFTC hearing revealed that there is 100 - times more paper - gold outstanding than physical gold .
The market is now starting to absorb the significance of what GATA has uncovered over the years and summarized succinctly in its prophetic announcement in The Wall Street Journal more than two years ago , seven weeks before the collapse of Bear Stearns and the start of the present financial crisis :
“ The objective of this manipulation is to conceal the mismanagement of the U.S. dollar so that it might retain its function as the world ’s reserve currency .
But to suppress the price of gold is to disable the barometer of the international financial system so that all markets may be more easily manipulated .
This manipulation has been a primary cause of the catastrophic excesses in the markets that now threaten the whole world . ”
The revelations from the CFTC hearing are earth - shaking , and indeed a “ new dynamic ” has emerged .
The gold cartel now has a big target painted on its forehead .
One can never predict the future , but it seems to me that as this news about the gold cartel ’s huge naked short position spreads , two things will happen .
It is inevitable that the big traders and hedge funds will push the naked shorts to the wall by asking for physical metal .
We could therefore see more hedge funds switching out of GLD like Greenlight Capital did last summer , which leads to the second likely outcome .
If we get a squeeze on the naked shorts , the sky is the limit for precious metal prices .
The gold cartel may not yet be finished , and wo n’t be until the unholy Wall Street - D.C. axis is dismantled .
But the gold cartel is on its way out .
Over the past ten years , the gold cartel has staged a controlled retreat .
It has been fighting the advancing gold price with propaganda , paper short sales and the occasional dishoarding of physical metal from central bank vaults and more recently , the IMF .
This retreat is I suspect about to turn into a rout , which means the upside potential for the precious metals is huge .

NEW YORK ( Commodity Online ) :
After the sub - prime catastrophe in banking and realty sector , which led to the global recession in 2008 - 09 , it is the turn of bullion markets now .
‘ FRAUD ’ , that is the one word which comes to any investor ’s mind when s/he reads about the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) hearing on manipulations in bullion market by gold cartels .
So , the small and clean investors have been short - changed by big cartels during the past many years , especially during the recent boom time in bullion markets .
Otherwise , how will you explain the biggest boom in paper gold ( Exchange Traded Funds , ETFs ) in the recent past with hardly any gold available in the market .
In fact , there is no gold left in this world if all the Gold ETFs ask for physical delivery .
And , if that happens only god knows what will be the gold prices in the coming months — $ 10000 per ounce ?
Maybe , even more .
Because , price of a commodity which is not available at all can go up to any level due to the sheer fact that it is not there in the market .
[ This is also true with agricultural commodities .
The panic created by a shortage of gold or food is like nothing else , and we will experience both this summer . ]
Now read about the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) hearing last week about a London whistle - blower who had explained to the CFTC how JP Morgan Chase has been manipulating / capping precious metal prices .
In a shocking parallel to the inaction by the US Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) after receiving warnings from Harry Markopolos about the Madoff ponzi , the CFTC has apparently been sitting on the information on gold cartels .
Did you visit the websites of GATA and CFTC this week ?
If you do , you can see a lot of articles and responses from investors who have been keenly watching the developments in bullion market .
The whistle - blower in this biggest gold fraud was Andrew Maguire , an experienced precious metal trader in London .
In an riveting interview ( which is available on the internet all over the world ) with GATA director , Adrian Douglas , Maguire describes a new dynamic impacting gold .
The fact is that , there is a huge short position in the market .
The CFTC hearing confirmed what GATA has been saying all along , that the gold market is being manipulated .
And , how ?
The gold cartel has accumulated a huge short position and the huge short positions are ‘ naked ’ , which means these positions are not hedged .
There is 100 - times more paper - gold outstanding than physical gold .
You must be saying Oh , My God !
Then wait , there is more to it .
Sub - prime crisis was peanuts before this scam .
The bullion market is now slowly taking in the impact of these revelations .
The result is , there will be no gold in the market .
Because , if people ask for physical delivery of gold for their ETFs , who will give all the gold .
THERE IS NO GOLD !
And the price of gold can be $ 5,000 per ounce , $ 10,000 or may be even more .
Who can predict the value of a commodity which is not there is the market ?
Gold ETFs are nothing but paper
Commodity Online reports that fraud will spoil the image of ETFs .
Gold ETFs : prudent investment or paper dream ?
By Geena Paul
LONDON ( Commodity Online ) : Almost all market and bullion analysts in the recent years harped on a new investment option — the Gold Exchange - Traded Funds ( ETFs ) .
Till a decade ago , there were no easy options to invest in gold like the equities market .
Realising this , innovative people brought out the gold ETFs to make gold investment easy for investors .
The development of the gold ETF market in 2003 changed the way people invested in bullion .
…
But when the gold ETFs came into the market , nobody anticipated a fraud will spoil the image of ETFs within 10 years of its existence .
So , last week , when the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) heard a case regarding manipulations in bullion market by gold cartels , the gold ETF scam hit the investors like a bolt from the blue .
Now , the gold ETFs ’ image is at stake .
Soon , investors are set to question the credibility of the gold ETFs .
The reason is the facts emerged during the CFTC hearing .
The whistle - blower in this biggest gold fraud was Andrew Maguire , an experienced precious metal trader in London .
In an riveting interview ( which is available on the internet all over the world ) with GATA director , Adrian Douglas , Maguire describes a new dynamic impacting gold .
The fact is that , there is a huge short position in the market .
The CFTC hearing confirmed what GATA has been saying all along , that the gold market is being manipulated .
And , how ?
The gold cartel has accumulated a huge short position and the huge short positions are ‘ naked ’ , which means these positions are not hedged .
There is 100 - times more paper - gold outstanding than physical gold .
So , if you are buying ETFs , be sure that there is no gold guarantee for your piece of paper which offers you the ownership of some specific quantity of the yellow metal .
In reality , it is just a piece of paper which you bought paying huge sums .
Recently , the World Gold Council reported that the world ’s total gold ETF market grew 85 % relative to 2008 .
During the hearing Adrian Douglas of GATA said : I would just like to make a comment .
We are talking about the futures market hedging the physical market .
But if we look at the physical market , the LBMA , it trades 20 million ozs of gold per day on a net basis which is 22 billion dollars .
That ’s 5.4 Trillion dollars per year .
That is half the size of the US economy .
If you take the gross amount it is about one and a half times the US economy ; that is not trading 100 % backed metal ; it ’s trading on a fractional reserve basis .
And you can tell that from the LBMA ’s website because they trade in “ unallocated ” accounts .
And if you look at their definition of an “ unallocated account ” they say that you are an “ unsecured creditor ” .
Well , if it ’s “ unallocated ” and you buy one hundred tonnes of gold even if you do n’t have the serial numbers you should still have one hundred tonnes of gold , so how can you be an unsecured creditor ?
Well , that ’s because its fractional reserve accounting , and you ca n’t trade that much gold , it does n’t exist in the world .
So the people who are hedging these positions on the LBMA , it ’s essentially paper hedging paper .
Bart Chilton uses the expression “ Stop the Ponzimonium ” and this is a Ponzi Scheme .
Because gold is a unique commodity and people have mentioned this , it is left in the vaults and it is not consumed .
So this means that most people trust the bullion banks to hold their gold and they trade it on a ledger entry .
So one of the issues we have got to address here is the size of the LBMA and the OTC markets because of the positions which are supposedly backing these positions which are hedges , but it is essentially paper backing paper .
So the giant Ponzi trading of gold ledger entries can be sustained only if there is never a liquidity crisis in the real physical market .
If someone asks for gold and there is n’t any the default would trigger the biggest “ bank run ” and default in history .
This is , of course , why the Central Banks lease their gold or sell it outright to the bullion banks when they are squeezed by high demand for real physical gold that can not be met from their own stocks .
Investing Contrarian reports that the world ’s largest fraud .
The world Largest Fraud : 5.5 Trillion ?
Time you stood up .
By Contrarian
The Gold and Silver Manipulation spanning decades ( going back well back into 1980s ) has now taken mammoth proportions , one that could bankrupt not just a few banks but entire countries along with their central banks .
Prime in this network are the Bank of England and the FED reserve who have been caught on the wrong side .
…
For the first time now , the CFTC ( The regulator ) has a whistle blower testimony to make a legal move against the cartel of JPM and other trader network .
In an incredible audio interview , the London based former Metals trader , Andrew Maguire , chronicled the silver manipulation , Trade by Trade in his running commentary to CFTC .
This testimony is being ignored and being pushed under the carpet .
Am yet to see main stream coverage of this mammoth fraud clinically and brilliantly uncovered by Andre Maguire , who is now a marked man for the cartel .
He already has been involved in a Hit and Run case where a speeding car almost took him down .
What is even more interesting , the driver has been caught and yet his testimony is still not being published .
Why did he do it ?
Who paid him to do it ?
None of the details have emerged .
But for those who are on the Internet and can help in letting this be know to all , this is that interview and must be downloaded and kept for records .
No one knows when the King Wold News website will be taken down which brought us this interview with Andrew and Adrian .
We have already had one extraordinary attack on the website couple of days back through a coordinated DOS attack .
King World
News today received more detail about yesterday ’s attack on its Internet site , which happened soon after the posting of Eric King ’s half - hour interview with GATA Chairman Bill Murphy , board member Adrian Douglas , and your secretary / treasurer about last week ’s hearing of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission .
The major Internet hosting company that maintains the King World News site reported to King World News : “ Your hosting account is the target of a distributed denial of service attack .
To protect the network resources , we have temporarily placed your Web site behind a network filter .
Once the attack has ended , service will be restored to normal .
…
Computers were attacking your account . ”
Those who have not heard the interview of Andrw Maguire , please do listen to this bombshell and make your judgement on why it is not being given the importance in US justice department .
This man while guilty along with the others had the nerve to stand up to the cartel .
The century biggest Fraud revealed
At a point within the interview Adrian Douglas makes the point that the Gold Market in LBMA ( London Metals Exchange ) is to the tune of $ 5.5 Trillion .
And that is Gold contracts cleared only in London .
Imagine COMEX when added to those volumes .
We are talking of a market which is more than the economy of China and nearly 60 % of US economy .
…
The important point note is that the market is not made of Physical Gold but paper contracts exchanged in the form of Futures trades .
This gives us the illusion of Price discovery and allows the players in the market to control and manipulate Gold and Silver Prices at will .
…
Let me address the cartel if ever they come across my writing : Truth will come out .
Your days are counted .
You will be taken down .
Every reader of this should make your own judgments on the sequence of extraordinary events that have occurred from Jan 2010 to March 2010 including the Andre Maguire Testimony , his near Death , CFTC hearing going blank at critical times , and most importantly the forced ignorance of this mammoth Fraud which is being ignored by Main Stream even to the point of not having the desire to look one level deeper into all the Mire and dirt in the Precious metal markets .
Media Blackout of CFTC hearings
Timiacono.com reports that Gold , Silver , the CFTC & Conspiracy Theories .
Gold , Silver , the CFTC & Conspiracy Theories
On April 1 , 2010 , in Article of the Week , Commodities , by Tim
Not being much of a conspiracy theorist , last week ’s hearing by the CFTC ( Commodities Futures Trading Commission ) on futures market trading for metals was a subject of some interest to me , but the news flow since that time has been rather remarkable – if for no other reason that none of the news seems to be flowing in the mainstream media .
In fact , a search at the Wall Street Journal on “ Gensler ” ( CFTC Chairman Gary Gensler would surely be included in any report ) produces only this one item from before the hearing .
You ’d think that , if a news organization that normally finds time to report on the most arcane of financial market goings - on saw fit to publish a story before the hearing was held , they ’d also figure it was worthwhile to let their readers know what happened at the hearing .
Apparently not .
The one story ( $ ) that the search did turn up quickly gets to the heart of the argument against imposing position size limits for metals markets – the real question that the hearing was attempting to answer :
Imposing new speculative trading limits on metals futures contracts is unwarranted and could have an adverse impact on U.S. markets , some exchange and bank officials will tell the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Thursday .
Later in the story they mention that GATA ( Gold Anti-Trust Action Committee ) chairman Bill Murphy was planning to speak though , curiously , they failed to mention him by name and then , even more curiously , they followed this mention up with almost three times as many words bashing those , like Murphy , who allege manipulation in these markets .
One of the staunchest believers in the allegations of gold manipulation — the chairman of the Gold Anti-Trust Action Committee — will testify as well .
But others , including the CME’s Mr. LaSala and John J. Lothian , a commodity trading advisor , futures broker and the head of a well - known markets newsletter , will urge the CFTC not to pay attention to arguments that there has been manipulation .
" Those who believe gold and silver markets are manipulated to keep prices low are nothing more than politically opportunistic rent seekers in my book , " Mr. Lothian planned to say .
" They are parasites on the body public profiting from selling fear and seeking political change that will benefit their world view and related market position . "
Now , that ’s some stunningly unbalanced reporting on a subject that , admittedly , anybody anywhere near Wall Street probably does n’t want to contemplate – that markets are rigged .
But , in the broader scheme of things , would n’t it be better to just let “ those crazy gold bugs ” have their day and be discredited once and for all if they really are as nutty as the WSJ would have us believe ?
Well , if you read the Wall Street Journal , you ’ll never know what happened at the hearing and whether the CFTC paid any attention to them , but , if you look elsewhere , you ’ll read about all kinds of interesting developments during and after the meeting .
Here ’s a partial list :

King Interview With GATA On The Biggest Gold Manipulation Story Disclosed – Zero Hedge
Now , of all the sources above , the Mineweb story is probably the most mainstream and they had a few interesting observations and conclusions :
Some observers feel that the Gold Anti Trust Association ( GATA ’s ) long held views on a conspiracy by some major banks and government entities to manipulate precious metals prices are off - target , but the latest evidence produced by GATA chairman Bill Murphy in open testimony at the CFTC hearing is compelling assuming the source material is accurate .
The evidence came in the form of a series of emails , and accompanying commentary , from a London metals trader , Andrew Maguire , who contacted GATA on March 23rd regarding alleged rigging of the precious metals markets by JP Morgan among others , through shorting the markets around key economic data releases , describing in detail how this is achieved .
Maguire , Murphy contends , informed the CFTC enforcement division of this market manipulation ahead of the release of farm payroll data in February this year and set out not only how the manipulation would be achieved two days in advance , but also sent real time emails to the CFTC investigators as the alleged manipulation was taking place .
According to Murphy the metals prices followed the scenario precisely – something which he felt could not be predicted without prior knowledge of the manipulation of the markets by major players with huge financial clout .
Now , why could n’t the Wall Street Journal report something like that ?
It seems to be a rather important development and one that anyone even remotely related to the gold and silver market would surely be interested in .
For the first time ever , a whistleblower has stepped forward citing specifics of a market rigging as it was occurring in real time .
Now , there were more than a few strange goings on at the hearing , one of which was that the video feed went dead just as Bill Murphy was about to detail the Maguire story for the CFTC .
Here ’s the video ( that no one was able to see at the time ) in which Murphy details Maguire ’s charges that massive short positions by HSBC and JP Morgan aimed out flushing out longs occur regularly and predictably , in a coordinated fashion .
The fact that whistleblower Maguire was struck by a hit and run driver in London the next day adds to the intrigue .
He was apparently not injured badly as he was able to do an interview with Eric King a couple days later in which he sounds completely sane ( see link from above ) .
Of course , the case that the “ gold bugs ” should be ignored was n’t helped by Jeff Christian of the CPM Group clumsily defending the current system and , in the process , essentially , admitting that there is little or no actual precious metal backing the trading in London – that it ’s strictly a “ paper market ” , which , to most people makes no sense .
How can you have “ price discovery ” on a futures market when few of the sellers have anything to sell ?
…
You ’d think there ’s something in here that the Wall Street Journal would have found newsworthy .
Reuters filed this report after the conclusion of the hearing and they too failed to mention anything other than opposition to any idea of position limits in metal markets .
A Google News search on “ Gensler ” confirms the virtual blackout by the mainstream news media , the only source of information coming from , well , blogs just like mine .
You ’d think the mainstream media would at least acknowledge that something happened .

King World Interview with Andrew Maguire ' the Silver Market Whistleblower '
" The Biggest Fraud in the World "
I do not know what to think about this , except to just offer it up to you for your own information .
I am disappointed , however , that only the blogs , and almost no one in the mainstream media , have bothered to cover this story and to speak to the principals , and to either debunk them , support them , or even consider what they have to say .
This really is like the Harry Markopolos story , trying to get a hearing on the Madoff ponzi scheme , and being repeatedly ignored , intimidated , and discouraged in every way possible by the establishment , and even fearing for his life .
Even if this is a mistake , a hoax , some conspiracy , it deserves a proper hearing and an airing in the public .
Ignoring it raises even more questions , and serious concerns about the integrity of the US markets .
If instead of a proper airing there are only the smears , and disinformation , and the usual sly ad hominem attacks , or even worse , I will begin to believe that it is true .
King World News Interview with Andrew Maguire and Adrian Douglas
I cannot believe that testimony is being completely ignored .
I do not understand why this is a ' national security ' issue .
It seems just too bizarre to me .
Do people inside the trade know something that we do n't know ?
Are these fellows frauds or just mistaken ?
Is this a hoax ?
Part of some conspiracy ?
Or is this something coming right at us , that will end up hurting the public once again , as the rampant fraud in the financial markets has done so thoroughly .
If there is something going on then it is time to bring it out into the open .
If it is national security concern , or more properly the national interest , because it involves the US banking industry , how long do they think they can keep this sort of thing quiet ?
If this is something else , why is it not aired , investigated , and nipped in the bud ?
I am trying to keep an open mind on this , but it is not being made any easier by what looks like a curtain of silence while the stories and counter - moves are prepared .
I was disappointed that in the interview they never seemed to discuss the hit and run car incident .
I do n't want to speculate or get paranoid on this but its not easy .
We deserve to know the truth .
Note at night : I have now listened to this tape five times , carefully .
It is a bombshell .
This has to be dealt with , one way or the other .
Bring it out into the light of day , and let the facts be known .
This is either the equivalent of the fictionalized testimony on the order of the Salem Witch trials , or one of the most damning accusations of malfeasance in office against quasi- governmental agencies , and probably US officials , since Teapot Dome .
Giving the mainstream media the benefit of the doubt , they are afraid to touch it because it is radioactive .
They will wait on the sidelines until something happens .
And the strategy seems to be to stonewall , and hope it goes away .
The American public is nortoriously fickle and if not reminded of it will move on to the next shiny thing , the next controversy of any type .
But the coverup is always the first mistake of a government in approaching a breaking scandal .
But they never seem to learn .
You deal with it up front and early .
It was not the actual burglary at the Watergate that brought down the government , and took American into its ' long national agony . '
It was , and always is , the coverup .

Manipulating Gold ( GLD ) and Silver ( SLV ) : A Criminal Naked Short Position that Could Wreck the Economy
By Mark Mitchell , Published : April 2nd , 2010 3:04 PM PDT
Everyone from U.S. Senators to prominent hedge fund managers say that criminal naked short sellers had a hand in the financial collapse of 2008 , but the regulators are n’t listening .
Not a single criminal has been prosecuted .
Indeed , the regulators continue to allow the miscreants to manipulate the markets — not just the stock markets , but also the markets for corporate bonds , derivatives , U.S. Treasuries , and all manner of commodities – even when the regulators are provided with indisputable evidence of a massive crime in progress .
They could easily fix the flaws in the settlement system that allow much of the manipulation to occur , but they refrain from doing so either because they are too captured by the miscreants or too cowed by the possible consequences of throwing the lights on what may be an enormous confidence game .
So I am inclined to say that it is hopeless .
Everyone loves an optimist – but , yes , it is hopeless .
We are like the audience in one of those cheesy horror flicks – yell and scream all you like , but the dumb blonde is still going to walk into that room and get hacked to pieces .
Except that it is not a movie .
It is real .
And it ’s not just the dumb blonde who is going to get slaughtered .
It is all of us .
It is our economy .
It is our standard of living .
It is our financial system – the lifeblood of the nation .
The latest case of regulatory indolence was recently exposed by Andrew Maguire , a successful metals trader and whistleblower who went to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission with data that strongly suggested that a small number of criminal short sellers had rigged the markets for silver and gold .
Maguire not only provided the regulators with a Dummies ’ guide to how the manipulation generally worked , but also warned them of a specific crime – a dramatic take - down of the gold [ SPDR Gold Trust ( NYSE : GLD ) ] and silver [ iShares Silver Trust ( NYSE : SLV ) ] markets – that he said would occur at an exact time on a specific date in the near future .
That is , Maguire told the regulators that a massive crime was about to happen , and the crime happened precisely as he predicted it would .
With Maguire ’s warning , the regulators were able to watch a crime unfold , right before their eyes , in real time .
Then the regulators thanked Maguire by saying , in essence , “ you ’re a nuisance , go away . ”
This is not just appalling , but scary , because the criminal activity that Maguire exposed is much bigger than the Madoff Ponzi scheme , and more likely to result in serious damage to the American economy .
Indeed , there is a strong case to be made that our national security is at stake .
As Maguire stated in a recent interview with King World radio , the manipulators have likely created a massive naked short position that can easily be exploited by foreign entities who might see financial or even political gain in eviscerating the dollar .
…
After that , Maguire sent several more emails detailing manipulation of the gold and silver markets .
He received no replies .
So he wrote a final email , providing still more evidence in support of his case and stating : “ I have honored my commitment to assist you and keep any information we discuss private , however if you are going to ignore my information I will deem that commitment to have expired . ”
To that email , a CFTC official finally replied : “ I have received and reviewed your email communications .
Thank you so very much for your observations . ”
That was it .
Thanks a lot and goodbye .
No follow up questions .
No acknowledgement that a crime had occurred .
No apparent interest whatsoever .
Maguire was understandably peeved .
As he said in his radio interview , “ I kept a live commentary going on that entire scenario .
How they were going to flush it down below 15 , how it then went down below 15 , and how then they were putting big block offers hitting all the bids to stop it getting back through the technical level of 15 so as not to trigger covering by the shorts and inviting longs to get long again .
To me , you do n’t get any better than that , how could anyone predict that unless they knew what was going to happen , not just saying it ’s going to move in one direction , but it ’s going to move in one direction then another direction – all in a matter of minutes . ”
Not long after the massive crime took place , the CFTC held a public hearing on manipulation of the metals markets .
Maguire was specifically barred from participating .
He told King World radio that he believed one CFTC official , Bart Childers , wanted him to attend the hearing , but Childers is a lone “ Elliot Ness ” crime fighter working in an agency that is dominated by the feckless and the corrupt .
“ There are a lot of people at CFTC wanting to look the other way , ” Maguire said .
However , the hearing ( a partial transcript and video of which can be found at the excellent financial blog Zero Hedge ) did yield an interesting piece of information .
In the course of answering an unrelated question , Jeffrey Christian , a former Goldman Sachs ( GS ) staffer who is now the head of a metals trading firm called CPM Group , stated that “ precious metals … trade in the multiples of a hundred times the underlying physical … ” ( the italics belong to me and a lot of other people whose eyes popped out of their heads when they heard this ) .
[ red belongs to me ]
What Christian was saying is that every ounce of gold or silver is being sold 100 times .
This would not be problematic if we were speaking of some dusty market in Central Asia with rows of traders ’ stalls wherein some commodity ( such as gold , silver , radios or Kalashnikovs ) were being sold and resold in rapid - fire succession : there , our sensibilities about scarcity , value , and price discovery would actually grip reality .
Here , however , we are talking of markets where the distinction between reality and representation has become as blurry as the last round of a game of musical chairs , enabling some sellers to offload paper IOUs promising eventual delivery of silver and gold – promises that would be impossible to keep if some small segment of the buyers were to demand delivery of the real thing .
This is quite similar to the naked short selling of stocks , where traders sell stock that does not exist , but enter IOUs in their computers , and then “ fail to deliver ” what they have promised .
It is hard to distinguish this from fraud ( notwithstanding the Efficient Market Hypothesis of financial theory , which maintains , essentially , that it should n’t matter ) .
Christian , the fellow who inadvertently revealed the massive naked short positions in gold and silver , said that he did n’t see this as a problem because “ there are any number of mechanisms for cash settlement , ” and “ almost all of these short positions are in fact hedges … ”
This is slightly absurd .
Later in his testimony , Christian himself said that it was “ exactly right ” to say that the hedges are nothing more than hedges of “ paper on paper ” – a particular sort of merry - go - around where one IOU is settled by another IOU , with these IOUs outnumbering real gold and silver by multiples of a hundred times .
As for the notion that cash settlement solves the problem , Maguire noted in his radio interview that cash settlement “ is the very definition of default .
If somebody wants to buy gold and silver and instead they ’re given cash , that is a default . ”
In addition , “ there are people who will not want cash – Chinese , Vietnamese , Russians – people looking for the metal , they will want to take it , and that will cause a default on the Comex [ the metals exchange ] because the Comex will be drained … that was the word that was used by several people making testimony [ at the CFTC meeting ] , that the Comex would be drained … ”
Maguire added : “ What ’s going to happen , if you ’re an Asian trader , or a non-Western trader , who has no loyalty , or does n’t care about homeland security or anything else , who says , now wait a minute , if I can establish in my mind that there is 100 ounces of paper gold , paper silver for example , for each ounce of real silver , than I have a naked short situation here that I can squeeze and they can go on the spot market which is basically a foreign exchange transaction , short dollar , long silver to any amount they want – billions , trillions — whatever they want , and they can take this market , squeeze this market , and blow it up … ”
In other words , the problem is n’t just that criminal naked short sellers manipulate the metals market downwards .
It is that they have created a condition where a foreign entity can merely demand delivery of real metal to induce a massive “ squeeze ” that sends the price of metals skyrocketing , putting huge downward pressure on the dollar .
Meanwhile , says Maguire , with prices rising , “ for 100 customers who show up there is only one guy who is going to get his gold or silver and there ’s 99 who will be disappointed , so without any new money coming into the market , just asking for that gold and silver will create a default . ”
“ There are no prisoners taken in this kind of environment , ” Maguire added .
“ All they need to establish is that it is naked , and by the admission of [ former Goldman staffer ]
Christian at the meeting …we have a definition of physical actually being paper …
They get that in their heads and its locked , it ’s a done deal , then we do n’t have to wait … there is a profit to be made here , and there is nothing [ anybody ] can do about it because it ’s a foreign exchange transaction , and there are no limits on a foreign exchange transaction , and obviously foreign exchange transactions are coming to light , there [ is talk ] of manipulation … ”
Indeed , Maguire says that he has received phone calls from wealthy individuals in Asia looking for the go ahead to exploit the naked short position .
“ The only question they have in their mind is can we establish that this is a naked short position , that ’s the only thing they had to clarify , it ’s become clear , it is now clear [ that the naked short position is massive ] , and no doubt they do their own due diligence , but basically [ the naked short position ] has been admitted at the only metals meeting [ the CFTC hearing ] that we ’ve ever had … ”
Maguire says that the naked short selling scam is in the trillions of dollars , making it by far the biggest financial fraud in history .
He calls it “ financial terrorism ” and accuses the naked short sellers of “ treason ” for putting national security at risk .
It might be hard to believe that foreign entities are plotting to crush the U.S. economy , and perhaps they are not , but there is no doubt that loopholes in the clearing and settlement system – not just for metals , but also stocks , bonds , Treasuries , and derivatives – could quite easily be exploited by any foreign entity desiring to do harm to the U.S. economy .
The only dispute is whether such a desire exists .
Maguire and Adrian Douglas of GATA , an organization that lobbies against manipulation of the metals market , took their concerns to the mainstream media and had a number interviews scheduled .
However , every one of those interviews were suddenly cancelled .
This is not surprising .
The mainstream media has consistently shied away from stories about illegal naked short selling and market manipulation , partly because the media outlets are captured by the powers that be on Wall Street , and partly because investigative journalism is now viewed as an anachronism – a time - consuming effort that might have been suited to Woodward and Bernstein back in the 70s , but not to the downsized news rooms tasked with churning out tepid and meaningless “ he said , she said ” mimeographs for a population of readers who ( so it is said ) want their “ news ” fast , and do n’t care a whit for in - depth reporting .
Meanwhile , just as the stock manipulators have engaged in a coordinated effort – deploying threats , ruthless smear campaigns , and slick lobbying – to keep their crimes out of the spotlight , so too will the gold and silver manipulators .
Adrian Douglas of GATA notes that at the precise moment he began to speak at the CFTC meeting , the video camera recording the event experienced “ technical problems ” – problems that were fixed at the precise moment when Douglas stopped talking .
Douglas concedes that this might have been a coincidence , but when this sort of thing happens often enough , a little healthy paranoia is probably a good thing .
That said , everyone loves an optimist , so I ’ll say the camera really went kaput .
But…ack … another coincidence :
The day after Maguire gave his radio interview , he was the victim of a hit and run collision .
Somebody sped out of a side alley at top speed , smashed into Maguire ’s car , and then tried to escape .
A high - speed chase ensued , and the perpetrator was caught by police .
The British press has reported that this might have been an assassination attempt , or a threat , but as yet there has been no word from the police .
Maguire was injured , but not seriously .
Let ’s be optimistic , and say this was an accident – assassinations and threats only happen in the movies .
But…ack … another coincidence : Shortly before somebody crashed into Maguire ’s car , the CFTC caught on fire .
This fire happened to be located in the one small basement room where gold and silver trading data and other pertinent documents were kept .
The CFTC claims that its investigation of metals manipulation , for what it was , did not burn .
So maybe it was just an accident .
Maybe some eager CFTC regulators were down there smoking cigarettes .
Maybe it was stress .
Maybe they ’ll keep investigating .
Maybe they ’ll bust the criminals .
Maybe , just maybe…yes , everyone loves an optimist , so let me make this clear – the horror show that is our regulatory system is going to have a happy ending .
There will be no massacre .
The financial system will be just fine … really … maybe… or maybe not .
* * * * * * * *
Update : Another coincidence : GATA reported recently that there has been an attack on the King World website — the website that contains the radio interview of Maguire and his emails to the CFTC .
This was an apparent attempt to shut down the website and prevent the scandal from being exposed further .
The Internet company that hosts the King World website reported to King World the following : Your hosting account is the target of a distributed denial of service attack … Computers were attacking your account . ”
My reaction : Gold manipulation has been officially confirmed by revelations from last CFTC hearings
Amazing set of revelations
1 ) For the first time ever , a whistleblower , Andrew Maguire , has stepped forward citing specifics of a gold market rigging as it was occurring in real time .
2 ) There is no gold corresponding to the vast " gold deposits " at the major LBMA banks .
During the CFTC hearings , Jeffrey Christian of CPM Group apparently informed us that the LBMA banks actually have about a hundred times more gold deposits than actual gold bullion .
3 ) Almost all of the trading activities on the London exchange were merely settled by paper for paper , not for physical metals as the exchange supposedly requires .
4 ) there are thousands of clients ( Asian and Middle Eastern governments , sovereign wealth funds , etc ) who think they own hundreds of billions and perhaps trillions of dollars of gold bullion , and are being charged storage fees on that fantasy bullion , but what they really own unsecured gold loans to the banks at a negative interest rate .
5 ) it is impossible for the London exchange to ever deliver all the gold and silver owed to the owners of contracts .
Unbelievable “ coincidences ”
1 ) The live television broadcast of the CFTC hearing suffered a technical failure right as Murphy was set to begin his testimony .
This was corrected right after Murphy was finished .
2 ) At least one live voice broadcast ( radio ) failed during Murphy 's presentation .
3 ) After the hearing , Murphy was contacted by several major media outlets for more interviews .
Within 24 hours , all the interviews were canceled .
All of them .
4 ) The day after Maguire gave his radio interview , he was the victim of a hit and runcollision .
Somebody sped out of a side alley at top speed , smashed into Maguire ’s car , and then tried to escape .
A high - speed chase ensued , and the perpetrator was caught by police .
Although the British press has reported that this might have been an assassination attempt or a threat , there has been no word from the police .
5 ) Shortly before somebody crashed into Maguire ’s car , the CFTC caught on fire .
This fire happened to be located in the one small basement room where gold and silver trading data and other pertinent documents were kept .
6 ) A few days after the CFTC caught on fire , there was an DOS ( denial of service ) attack on the King World website which contains the radio interview of Maguire and his emails to the CFTC .
Virtual blackout by the mainstream news media
1 ) Only the blogs , and almost no one in the mainstream media , are covering the relevations of the CFTC hearings .
2 ) At the Wall Street Journal , a search on " Gensler " ( CFTC Chairman Gary Gensler would surely be included in any report ) produces only one item from before the hearing .
Readers of the Wall Street Journal will never hear what happened at the hearing and whether the CFTC paid any attention to them .
3 ) The few mainstream stories that do cover the CFTC hearings are unnaturally one sided , failing to mention anything other than opposition to any idea of position limits in metal markets
4 ) The media lock - down is being met by disbelief and confusion .
5 ) A Google News search on " Gensler " confirms the virtual blackout by the mainstream news media .
6 ) The media ’s strategy seems to be to stonewall and hope scandal goes away .
Implications
1 ) This is a scandal of monumentous proportions .
As the articles above put it :
Sub - prime crisis was peanuts before this scam .
this is a potential multi-trillion dollar fraud that could bring down the world 's financial system
It is a bombshell .
This has to be dealt with , one way or the other .
Bring it out into the light of day , and let the facts be known .
This is either the equivalent of the fictionalized testimony on the order of the Salem Witch trials , or one of the most damning accusations of malfeasance in office against quasi- governmental agencies , and probably US officials , since Teapot Dome .
FRAUD ’ , that is the one word which comes to any investor ’s mind when s/he reads about the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) hearing on manipulations in bullion market by gold cartels
The world Largest Fraud : 5.5 Trillion .
The Gold and Silver Manipulation spanning decades ( going back well back into 1980s ) has now taken mammoth proportions , one that could bankrupt not just a few banks but entire countries along with their central banks .
2 ) As the significance of the CFTC hearings ’ revelations sink in , it will create a gold rush and dollar panic , resulting in the biggest short squeeze in the history of all commodities .
( See ***** Preview of 2010's Gold Rush And Dollar Panic***** )
3 ) The upward explosion in gold prices , it will result in a complete loss of confidence in the U.S. dollar .
Conclusion : Last October , I wrote about the Gold Market Reaching The Breaking Point .
Well now we are there .
1 ) Consider this a final warning about the gold market .
You are n’t going to get much , if any , further confirmation of gold market fraud before it is too late .
I would be amazed , especially considering recent relevations , if the gold market manages to make it passed June intact .
2 ) If you wondering how it will all end , I believe there will be a big “ financial freeze ” .
Checking accounts , money market accounts , brokerage accounts , etc ... everything will become inaccessible .
The New York Times article below about the 1987 market crash should give an idea what will happen when the settlement process breaks down in gold and other commodities .
October 2 , 1988
The Day the Nation 's Cash Pipeline Almost Ran Dry
By KURT EICHENWALD
LAST Oct. 20 , a day after the nation 's financial markets collapsed , Goldman , Sachs & Company and Kidder , Peabody & Company found themselves short of cash by a total of more than $ 1.5 billion , according to people close to the firms .
The shortfall resolved later in the day was not the result of trading losses or poor business strategy , but of failures in a behind - the - scenes process that attracted little attention until the crash .
The process , known as clearing and settlement , is the linchpin of the financial system , the mechanism for the transfer of money among brokerage firms , their customers , the stock and commodities exchanges and the banks .
Through it , cash is shifted from buyer to seller when trades are made .
Money is also transferred among a myriad of commodity and options accounts to adjust for changing requirements for margins , which are essentially deposits on futures and options contracts .
The amount of money required fluctuates with the value of the account .
Usually , the clearing process works smoothly .
But during the crash , it proved to be frighteningly fragile .
Indeed , Government and market studies of the crash and interviews with Wall Street professionals show that the flow of money through the nation 's markets came perilously close to gridlock on Oct. 20 because of chaos in the clearing system .
For several hours that day , bottlenecks appeared throughout the pipeline , creating potentially crippling credit squeezes for even the biggest players .
Kidder and Goldman , for example , had advanced the more than $ 1.5 billion on behalf of customers to cover calls for more margin initiated by plummeting prices .
But the firms ' banks were slow to credit the firms with an equivalent sum from the customers ' banks because of many delays along the line .
Moreover , the clearing process drained billions of dollars out of the markets at a time when some of that money might have been used for purchases , thus slowing the collapse .
Instead , to meet their margin calls , investors had to use cash reserves , borrow or sell out their positions .
That further depressed prices .
'' The problems in clearing have the potential for cataclysm , '' said the chairman of one major brokerage firm who spoke on condition that he not be identified .
'' Program trading and these other issues everyone is talking about could stop the markets from functioning .
This other thing could cause a failure of the financial system . ''
In a speech this spring , E. Gerald Corrigan , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , described such a malfunction as '' the greatest threat to the stability of the financial system as a whole . ''
…
Making a trade , like writing a check , has no value unless the clearing and settlement process works , backing up those transactions with cash .
But while all banks clear checks in essentially the same way , the clearing systems of the various stock and commodity exchanges are a hodgepodge that do not always mesh well together .
…
Last October , the different clearing systems put conflicting demands on virtually every big market player , creating unprecedented problems for investors and for the clearing systems themselves and raising terrifying concerns about market safety .
' 'A major mechanical breakdown , a liquidity problem or , even worse , default in one of these systems has the potential to seriously and adversely affect all other direct and indirect participants in the system , '' said Mr. Corrigan in his speech last spring .
…
… critical questions about the crash that were raised by the Brady Commission report and other studies have not been answered :
When does the financial responsibility of one player in the market begin and end ?
If a clearing firm or a customer defaults , is a brokerage firm or a bank left holding the bag ?
With the answers unclear , experts said that future problems in the clearing system could well tie up many market players in court .
'' The day that there is a default in the clearing system , everyone will be calling their lawyers , not their bankers , '' said Mr. Russo of Cadwalader , Wickersham & Taft .
As for me , I ’ve moved to Russia and have launched a fund to Invest in Russian Black Earth farmland .
I believe owning hard assets outside the US financial system is going to become very attractive in the near future .

10 “ New ” Films for a New Year
It ’s the end of a decade , but it ’s also the beginning of a new year , which means that it ’s as good an excuse as any to kick off 2010 with a list of ten enjoyable ( in their own way ) “ new ” films you might want to watch this weekend … starting with this classic :
10 . New Year ’s Evil ( 1980 ) :
Any holiday worth its salt has inspired a slasher film , and the celebration of a new year is certainly no exception to that rule .
The tag line for this Cannon Films classic is just as cheesy as it ought to be – “ This New Year ’s , you ’re invited to a killer party ” – and so is the cast , which is led by Roz Kelly , best known for playing Pinky Tuscadero on “ Happy Days . ”
Roger Ebert deigned to review it upon its original release , describing the film as “ an endangered species : a plain , old - fashioned , gory thriller .
It is not very good .
It is sometimes unpleasantly bloody .
The plot is dumb and the twist at the end has been borrowed from hundreds if not thousands of other movies .
But as thrillers go these days , ‘ New Year ’s Evil ’ is a throwback to an older and simpler tradition , one that flourished way back in the dimly remembered past , before 1978 . ”
For a slasher flick , that ’s about as much of a rave as you could hope to get , really .
9. A New Leaf ( 1971 ) : This was in my original draft of this list , but I yanked it because I could n’t find a clip to use with it .
When our man Bob Westal snuck a peek at the piece and cited it as an unforgivable omission , however , I dug a little deeper and found something that I could use .
This was Elaine May ’s directorial debut , and she also served as the female lead of this Walter Matthau comedy .
Any film that ’s loved by both Roger Ebert and Vincent Canby clearly has something going for it , so I ’d say it ’s more than worthy of making an appearance on this list , but , my , I had no idea that carbon on the valves was such a common mechanical problem …
8. The Emperor ’s New Groove ( 2000 ) : David Medsker swears by this Disney animated flick , and who am I to argue with him ?
Plus , this gives me an excuse to drop in an anecdote from Patrick Warburton about the flick .
He assured me , “ I love Disney as much as any straight man in the world can love Disney , ” but then he told me about meeting up with Eartha Kitt , his “ co- star ” in the film , at the premiere and reminding her that they ’d worked together before .
“ When I was in my very early 20 ’s – I was 21 or 22 – I had done a movie with her in South Africa that was absolutely horrible , ” he said .
“ I got the impression that she probably did n’t want to hear that anything she had ever done was not good .
You did n’t even have the right to say it if you were a part of it .
She just looked at me and said , ‘ I ’m sure we had a good time , darling . ’
I looked back at her and said , ‘ Well , we did n’t have that good of time , Eartha . ’ ”
7. A New Kind of Love ( 1963 ) : I am assured that , as Paul Newman / Joanne Woodward team - ups go , this is definitely one of their lesser works ( at the very least , it certainly has the shortest Wikipedia entry ) , and PopMatters went so far as to describe it as “ predictable and borderline offensive , ” but all I know is that you ca n’t buy the kind of real - life romantic chemistry that those two had .
6. New Jack City ( 1991 ) : I have n’t seen the film in years , but I still remember how great the soundtrack was .
I see that Joe Bob Briggs gave it four stars upon its release , however , and after reading his end - of - review summation , I ’m ready to see the movie again .
Read it for yourself , and I think you ’ll feel the same :
“ Six breasts .
Thirty - eight dead bodies .
Three gun battles .
Knife through the hand .
Brain blasting .
Cold - turkey crack withdrawal .
Catfight .
East River bridge - dangling , with deadly results .
Gratuitous street - corner four - part harmony .
Gratuitous hip hop .
Gratuitous ‘ Say No to Drugs ’ lecture .
Kung Fu. Rap Fu. Plea- bargain Fu. Drive - In Academy Award nominations for Wesley Snipes , as the whacked - out basehead drug king , for saying , ‘ You gotta rob to get rich in the Reagan era , ’ and , after he gets rich , ‘ Sit your five - dollar ass down before I make change ’ ; Chris Rock , as Pookie the freebasing narc , for saying , ‘ They call it the Enterprise Room , man , because it ’s for people who wanna be beamed up to Scotty ’ ; Judd Nelson , as the Eyetalian buddy cop , for saying , ‘ Is this one of those black things ? ’ ; and Mario Van Peebles , for directing this sucker , for doing the street life like it really is , and for coming up with lines like , ‘ They either become customers , or they become live - in hostages , ’ and , ‘ Yeah , he gonna be hangin with Elvis . ' ”
God bless you , Joe Bob .
5 . The New Barbarians ( 1982 ) :
There ’s nothing I can possibly say about this film that will make you want to see it , but after you watch the trailer , I ’m betting you wo n’t be able to resist trying to hunt it down , if only to confirm first - hand that any motion picture can possibly be as bad as this one looks to be .
4. The New Centurions ( 1972 ) : Based on the novel by Joseph Wambaugh , George C. Scott plays the world - weary cop to Stacy Keach ’s wide - eyed rookie , and you ’ll be unsurprised to hear that , by the end of the film , the latter is just as jaded as the former .
All told , the Scott - heavy beginning of the film is better than the Keach - centric conclusion , but it ’s still a solid ’ 70s cop drama .
3. What ’s New , Pussycat ? ( 1965 ) : One can quickly lose count of the number of reasons to love this film , from the soundtrack ( score by Burt Bacharach , theme song by Tom Jones ) to the screenplay by Woody Allen to the performances by Peter O’Toole , Peter Sellers , Paula Prentiss , and Ursula Andress .
In short , if you like zany ’60s comedies , you should n’t miss it .
2. Gremlins 2 : The New Batch ( 1990 ) : Some people hate this movie , but for my money , it ’s one of the greatest sequels of all time .
It ’s ridiculous , it knows it ’s ridiculous , and it has a cast which features John Glover , Robert Picardo , Christopher Lee , Gedde Watanabe , Tony Randall as the voice of a Gremlin , and returning cast members Zach Galligan , Phoebe Cates , Dick Miller , and Keye Luke .
For my money , the only thing it ’s missing is Hoyt Axton … and according to the audio commentary on the DVD , he was supposed to have been in it .
( They ’d planned to have him appear at the end of the film , with Randall Peltzer having designed special clothing for Gizmo that would ensure Gizmo would never come into contact with water again , but at the last moment , the filmmakers decided not to shoot the scene in order to reduce time . )
It ’s positively anarchic , and it ’s one of those movies I ’m sucked into watching whenever I stumble upon it on cable .
1. Star Wars IV : A New Hope ( 1977 ) : Purists never , ever refer to this film by its subtitle – I certainly never do – but if it ’ll give me an excuse to put “ Star Wars ” on the playlist , then I ’m willing to make an exception .
Oh , and just one more thing …
Honorable Mention : Twilight : New Moon .
Yep , that ’s right , I ’m unabashedly citing the latest “ Twilight ” film to get a few extra hits .
In truth , I was always going to have an Honorable Mention , but when it came down to choosing between this and DJ Qualls ’
“ The New Guy , ” it was really no choice at all .
( DJ ’s online fanbase just ai n’t what it used to be . )
It gets better .
The route to the airfield passes all the turn - offs for Heathrow airport , so is always very busy .
But thanks to that volcano I set off in Iceland a few weeks ago there was absolutely no airport traffic , so I enjoyed living in one of those 1930s photographs of the Autobahn - a perfect arrow - straight road populated by a single distant descendant of the Beetle .
On this , and the winding backroads that followed , the Spyder was as superb as it is silly .
When Jammie Thomas ( now Thomas - Rasset ) became the first alleged P2P file - swapper to take her case all the way to trial and verdict , no one suspected that she would actually have three trials and verdicts , but that 's the case today , as the RIAA rejected a federal judge 's decision to slash Thomas - Rasset 's damage award .
Instead , we 're headed to a truncated third trial on the issue of damages .
The recording industry also made it clear this week that both Thomas - Rasset and Joel Tenenbaum ( the second P2P defendant to go to trial and verdict ) are , in its view , quite terrible people : lying , deceiving , irresponsible , and unreasonable .
And the industry can't understand why they 're both fighting on .
Thomas - Rasset
Which is , when you look into the details , a pretty good question .
Thomas - Rasset was first hit with a $ 222,000 damage award in her first trial , which the judge later vacated when he ordered a second trial .
That second trial , in mid-2009 , landed Thomas - Rasset with $ 1.92 million in damages .
The judge , calling it a " monstrous " verdict , slashed it to $ 54,000 on remittitur , and he gave the recording industry a few days to decide if they would accept the lower award or proceed to a third trial .
The RIAA 's answer came last night — and it simply wo n't accept the new award .
It 's not due to the price ; in fact , the RIAA offered Thomas - Rasset a lower settlement if she would ask the judge to vacate his remittitur order .
Thomas - Rasset refused , and her lawyers tell Ars that she will continue her refusal to pay anything .
The issue is the judge 's decision to cap the damage award at $ 2,250 per song — triple the baseline $ 750 in statutory damages , but far from the upper limit of $ 150,000 allowed under the law .
The recording industry " regretfully must decline " this lower amount because of the precedent it would set .
" Plaintiffs find it impossible to accept a remittitur that could be read to set a new standard for statutory damages — essentially capping those damages at three times the minimum statutory amount of $ 750 ( or $ 2,250 ) for any ' noncommercial individuals who illegally download and upload music . '
This far - reaching determination is contrary to the law and creates a statutory scheme that Congress did not intend or enact . "
Copyright claims like this must be filed in federal court , an expensive and lengthy process .
" The Court ’s cap would set a new ceiling such that no copyright owner could effectively enforce their rights unless they could and did sue on numerous works , " says the filing .
" No copyright owner would be motivated to enforce its rights where it could only sue on a handful of works because the potential recovery would be too limited . "
That 's probably true , though the industry has always contended that both Thomas - Rasset and Tenenbaum downloaded and shared thousands of songs ; even at a cap of $ 2,250 apiece , this could add up to serious money .
Instead , the labels sued in each case on only a handful of the songs in question .
From the industry 's perspective , the judge is essentially rewriting statutory damages law in the case of P2P file - sharing , and that 's something it can't accept .
As for why Thomas - Rasset wants a third trial , that 's less clear .
The judge has ordered that the new trial be " on the issue of damages , " and it will apparently be devoted only to giving a third jury another crack at plucking damage awards from the air ( which , in the absence of any real testimony about damages , is clearly what has been happening ) .
But if Thomas - Rasset wo n't agree to pay a single penny , what 's the point ?
The other question is how Judge Michael Davis will react ; will he simply cap the third award at $ 2,250 and present the parties with the same choices once more ?
If so , will we keep going round and round until a jury finally comes in with something less than $ 2,250 per song ?
At some point , does this simply become an unwillingness to allow the industry a jury trial ?
One thing that remains clear is the RIAA 's disdain for Thomas - Rasset , which was already obvious the last time around .
" Her conduct throughout this litigation has been patently unreasonable , " the lawyers assert .
Also , she " chose to stonewall Plaintiffs and lie to two juries . "
Expect those points to be hammered home in a damages trial .
Tenenbaum
The industry is n't a fan of Joel Tenenbaum , either , who was hit with a $ 675,000 damage award in July 2009 .
" Tenenbaum complains that ' Plaintiffs did their best throughout the trial to make him appear to the jury to be a liar , a perjurer , and a person dodging responsibility for his actions and blaming others under oath for his conduct , ' " writes recording industry lawyers in a separate filing , also filed yesterday .
" Of course , Tenenbaum ignores the fact that he is all of those things — and he has no one to blame but himself . "
Then comes the clever wordplay .
" Tenenbaum is the poster child for willful copyright infringement , and now he asks the Court to autograph that poster .
The Court should do no such thing . "
What 's the issue here ?
One similar to the Thomas - Rasset case : possible precedential rulings .
The RIAA is upset that Judge Nancy Gertner said she might have accepted the idea of a " fair use interregnum " before music was widely available online .
To the labels , this is anathema .
" Even if such a supposed fair use interregnum did exist ( which it does not ) , it would have no application here because the evidence at trial showed the availability of the works at issue in both physical and digital format long before Tenenbaum ’s infringement , " says the filing .
And , just in case Tenenbaum is getting any ideas about remittitur after watching the Thomas - Rasset case , the labels want to put the kibosh on that , too .
" This too is ridiculous , " write the lawyers .
" The Court lacks the authority to interfere with a jury award that falls within the statutory range established by Congress .
Furthermore , even if the Court were able to remit a statutory damages award in certain circumstances ( a proposition Plaintiffs strongly dispute ) , this case represents a textbook example of where it would be entirely inappropriate to do so .
The jury ’s verdict represents only 15 percent of what the jury could have awarded . "
Rough translation : that $ 675,000 verdict was , in reality , a shockingly moderate damage award !
The judges in each case have made no secret of their disdain for the RIAA methods ; Davis ( in Minnesota ) actually begged for Congress to rewrite the law on statutory damages , while Gertner ( in Massachusetts ) has verbally horsewhipped industry lawyers for the way the whole legal campaign has been conducted .
Given that , it looks unlikely that the RIAA will let these cases drop at the trial level , and appeals could eat even more years spent on such cases .
That might not be needed if the defendants would settle , but so far , neither looks likely to crack .
So it goes .

Significant changes in brain plasticity have been observed following alpha brainwave training .
A pioneering collaboration between two laboratories from the University of London has provided the first evidence of neuroplastic changes occurring directly after natural brainwave training .
Researchers from Goldsmiths and the Institute of Neurology have demonstrated that half an hour of voluntary control of brain rhythms is sufficient to induce a lasting shift in cortical excitability and intracortical function .
Remarkably , these after - effects are comparable in magnitude to those observed following interventions with artificial forms of brain stimulation involving magnetic or electrical pulses .
The novel finding may have important implications for future non-pharmacological therapies of the brain and calls for a serious re-examination and stronger backing of research on neurofeedback , a technique which may be promising tool to modulate cerebral plasticity in a safe , painless , and natural way .
Inner control of one 's own brain activity may be learned with the aid of a brain - computer interface , which acts to display a person 's instantaneous brain activation on a computer screen through what is known as a " neurofeedback " loop .
During brainwave neurofeedback , a visual display on a computer screen behaves like a virtual " mirror " to real electrical oscillations produced by neurons in the cerebral cortex , which are recorded by surface sensors on the scalp .
Lead author Tomas Ros , and co-authors Diane Ruge and Moniek Munneke , under the supervision of Professors John Gruzelier and John Rothwell , utilised noninvasive transcranial magnetic stimulators ( TMS ) to investigate whether any tangible changes in cortical function take place shortly after a single sitting of brainwave self - regulation .
This was done by applying a short magnetic pulse externally to the scalp to stimulate the motor cortex , producing a muscle twitch which remained proportional to the level of neural responsiveness ( or " excitability " ) of the cortex .
Ros and colleagues observed that the cortical response following activating neurofeedback ( which involved suppressing alpha brainwaves ) was significantly enhanced and accompanied by a disinhibition of intracortical synaptic function of up to 150 % .
Such after - effects persisted for at least 20 minutes following termination of training , a time - course indicative of neuroplastic change .
I ’m currently reading The Hacker Ethic .
It ’s a great book , but if you do n’t have the time for it you can just read a blog post made yesterday by Kevin Bush , called : Why I Want My Daughter to be a Hacker .
That post is so inspiring , so perfect that it ’s really hard for me not to copy and paste it in its entirety .
How ’s this for a list of rules to live by :
1. Hackers are not consuming lemmings ;
2. Hackers avoid “ The Knowledge Trap ” ;
3 . Hackers can hack anything ;
4. Hackers favor open systems .
See what I mean ?
But seriously , go there now and read the whole post — and leave a comment , like I did .
Share it with everyone you know — I mean it , the world needs more parents , teachers , citizens like Kevin Bush .
Go ahead , do it now .
I ’m not going anywhere .
All done ?
Cool .
Now back to the book …
It ’s probably not the best idea to attempt a book review when I ’m only halfway through the book , but The Hacker Ethic is similarly inspiring ( if a little more long - winded ) .
The author , Pekka Himanen , uses “ hackerism ” as an equivalent to that third point in Kevin ’s blog post — that hacking is a methodology towards anything rather than a specific feat accomplished on an electronic device .
The first few chapters might just blow your mind a little bit with an explanation of how the Protestant work ethic elevated the ongoing doom of your typical office drone to near saintly - hood , and how a generation of hackers and other 21st century inhabitants have refused to resign themselves to the same fate .
On the subject of religion Himanen updates the allegory of The Cathedral and the Bazaar to The Academy and the Monastery , with this telling pair of quotes to illustrate the difference :
Plato : “ No free person should learn anything like a slave . ” Saint Benedict : “ Shut up and do as you ’re told . ”
I may have paraphrased that second one a bit , but you get the idea …
Since The Hacker ’s Ethic qualifies as a “ classic ” ( it was first published in 2001 ) I might write about it again should any more revelations come to light .
In the meantime , you need to understand that whenever you see hackers demonized in newspapers and on television , it ’s just the old guard of the 20th century trying to capitalize on your ignorance .
And now you know otherwise — hey , I just hacked the media ! 😎

Credit card balances declined in February as a troubled job market continued to hold back spending .
HOW MUCH CREDIT CARD DEBT
HAVE AMERICANS SHED ?
Americans ’ credit card debt has fallen by almost $ 118 billion from its September 2008 total of $ 975.7 billion — including a drop of about $ 9.5 billion in February .
The chart below shows how steadily consumers have pecked away at that debt — or had it charged off .
That ’s an average of $ 2,178 eliminated per household with credit card debt .
The Fed ’s monthly G.19 consumer credit report , released Wednesday , showed that overall consumer debt fell 5.6 percent to $ 2.448 trillion in February .
In addition , consumer credit card balances fell 13.1 percent in February , as U.S. consumers erased nearly $ 9.5 billion in debt .
The latest drop in card balances marks the 16th decline in 17 months — and save for an upward revision in the January figures , it would have been 17 straight .
The consumer credit report includes a broad variety of consumer debt , including revolving credit — a loan category comprised almost entirely of credit card debt — as well as nonrevolving debt , which includes such debt as auto loans , student loans and loans for mobile homes , boats and trailers .
Card balances remain under pressure .
The revolving debt component fell to $ 858.1 billion from $ 867.6 billion in January .
U.S. credit card debt stood at $ 975.7 billion in September 2008 , representing a plunge of $ 117.6 billion up through the latest data .
That means the average U.S. household with credit card debt — of which there are roughly 54 million , according to government data — has eliminated roughly $ 2,178 in credit card debt during that period , as borrowers either paid down debt or had it charged off as uncollectable .
“ Consumershave been actively trying to slim down their budgets and take on lessdebt , ” says James Chessen , chief economist with the American Bankers Association banking trade group .
Job woes
In part , that ’s due to ongoing job woes .
According to the latest data from the Labor Department , unemployment remained at 9.7 percent in March , the third straight month at that elevated level .
In a speech Wednesday , Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke emphasized that despite signs of economic recovery , “ we are far from being out of the woods .
Many Americans are still grappling with unemployment or foreclosure , or both , ” Bernanke said .
Those struggles appear to have prompted a shift in consumers ’ attitudes toward debt , as evidenced by the latest G.19 data .
“ These numbers show that in the weak economy , consumersdo n’t feel confident enough to borrow to make their purchases , ” Chessen says .
That may not be a bad thing , however .
“ From my standpoint , I think it ’s very positive thatconsumers are building a base that helps them weather poor economic times , ” Chessen says .
“ They ’reless vulnerable today because they ’ve reduced their debt levels and put awaysavings . ”
There are signs , however , that consumers are tentatively dusting off their plastic .
The January revolving credit numbers were revised to show an uptick in card balances at the start of 2010 , while the latest data from MasterCard Advisor ’s Spending Pulse indicated that retail sales rose in March .
So what happened in between ?
“ February was a hellacious month in terms of weatherfor the East Coast and down to the south , ” says CraigThomas , senior economist with PNC Financial Services Group of Pittsburgh .
That nasty weather may have kept shoppers indoors .
“ Now that you see consumers returning to the stores , you would expect to see the credit card balances begin to rise , ” Thomas says .
“ The only thing that would keep it down is an aversionto credit cards in favor of debit cards , ” Thomas says .
With consumer spending gaining 0.3 percent in February as personal incomes remained unchanged , consumers certainly appear to be tapping into their bank accounts — rather than lines of credit — to make purchases .
Until unemployment declines , some experts believe debt fears will continue to limit credit card use .
That means the revolving credit numbers are n’t likely to post a sustained recovery just yet .
“ I do n’t think we ’ll see much stability until the jobcreation numbers start to improve , ” Chessen says .

Inquiring minds are listening to California Treasurer Bill Lockyer who testified at an informational hearing on budget reform on October 22 , 2009 .
The highlight of his rant is about pension reform .
" It ’s impossible for this legislature to reform the pension system , and if we do n’t , we bankrupt the state .
And I do n’t think anybody can do it here , because of who elected you .
You ’re just captive of the current environment and I do n’t see any way out . "

PHOENIX — The Arizona Senate passed one of the most stringent immigration laws in the country on Monday , marking a new level of influence for a Republican state senator who not long ago was seen by many as an eccentric firebrand .
Passage of the law , which would , among other things , allow the authorities to demand proof of legal entry into the United States from anyone suspected of being in the country illegally , testified to the relative lack of political power of Arizona Latinos , and to the hardened views toward illegal immigration among Republican politicians both here and nationally .
As if to underscore how the political landscape will be changed by the law , Senator John McCain , Republican of Arizona , who had refused to back the most extreme anti-immigration measures , came out in support of it just hours before its passage .
“ I think it is a good tool , ” said Mr. McCain , who is being challenged in a primary by a conservative former congressman who is thumping him on immigration .
Mr. McCain added that he believed the bill reflected frustration that the federal government had not done enough to secure the border and enforce immigration law .
A woman who recently went to Kabul for the first time has often posted on her facebook about public sexual harassment on the streets of Kabul .
To be honest , sexual harassment is quiet common in Muslim countries where women are restricted not to have public appearance .
But , specifically , in the Afghan culture and society which is extremely religious and traditional , public sexual harassment is not only common but people enjoy if they harass women either by their looks or words .
Even in less conservative city like Kabul , women are facing intimidation and regular sexual assault on a daily bases .
But when it comes to school girls they are often victimized by male carrying knifes and acid .
In 2009 , the Ministry of Education has reported that within eight months , 138 students and teachers have died and 172 have been wounded in criminal and terror attacks .
About 651 schools have closed and another 122 school buildings have been blown up or burned down .
Based on United Nations Population Fund in Afghanistan ( UNFPA ) , about 31 % of Afghan women suffer physical violence and another 30 % suffer from psychological violence .
Nevertheless , she ( who requested that her name to be removed ) has written this sentence on her facebook wall that made me to laugh :
“ I called a harasser on a motorbike " mordagow " and he almost crashed into a sewer .
AWESOME . ”
It is uncommon to respond back to a harasser on the streets of Kabul .
First , Afghan women do n’t have that courage to call on harasser “ mordagow ” because of predominantly male oppression .
Second , because public harassment is so pervasive in Afghan society that women are used to it .
The word “ mordagow ” is Farsi ( Dari / persian ) word which is only used among Afghan Farsi speakers .
The word that panicked the harasser means “ cuckold ” ; a married man with an adulterous wife .

The Israeli government , its brutal war crimes in Gaza exposed in detail in the U.N. report by Justice Richard Goldstone , has implemented a series of draconian measures to silence and discredit dissidents , leading intellectuals and human rights organizations inside and outside Israel that are accused — often falsely — of assisting Goldstone ’s U.N. investigators .
The government of Benjamin Netanyahu is attempting to shut down Israel ’s premier human rights organizations , including B’Tselem , the New Israel Fund ( NIF ) and the Association for Civil Rights in Israel .
It is busy expelling or excluding peace activists and foreign nationals from the Palestinian territories .
The campaign , if left unchecked , will be as catastrophic for Palestinians as it will be for Israel .
The Goldstone report , which is over 500 pages , investigated Israel ’s 22 - day air and ground assault on Gaza that took place from Dec. 27 , 2008 , to Jan. 18 , 2009 .
The United Nations and the European Parliament have endorsed the report .
The report found that Israel used disproportionate military force against Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip while failing to take adequate precautions to protect the civilian population against the military assault .
The Israeli attack killed 1,434 people , including 960 civilians , according to the Palestinian Center for Human Rights .
More than 6,000 homes were destroyed or damaged , leaving behind some $ 3 billion in destruction in one of the poorest areas on Earth .
No Israelis were killed by Hamas rockets fired into Israel during the assault .
The report did not limit itself to the 22 - day attack ; rather , it went on to indict the occupation itself .
It examines the beginning of the occupation and condemns Israel for the border closures , the blockade and for the wall or security barrier in the West Bank .
It has two references to the right of return , investigates Israeli torture and criticizes the willful destruction of the Palestinian economy .
“ The impact of the Goldstone report is tremendous , ” the Middle East scholar Norman Finkelstein said when I reached him in New York .
“ It marks and catalyzes the breakup of the Diaspora Jewish support for Israel because Goldstone is the classical Diaspora Jew .
He is a lawyer and upholder of human rights and a liberal .
He has distinguished himself in the field of law and he is also a lover of Zion .
He calls himself a Zionist .
His mother was an activist in the Zionist movement .
His daughter did aliyah .
He sits on the board of governors of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem .
He has an honorary degree from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem .
He has said over and over again that he is a Zionist .
He believes Jews have a right to a state in Palestine .
His is a mostly emblematic profile of the classically liberal Jew . ”
“ Liberal has a distinct connotation , ” Finkelstein went on .
“ It means to believe in the rule of law .
It means to believe in international institutions .
It means to believe in human rights .
Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch are liberal organizations .
What the Goldstone phenomenon registers and catalyzes is the fact that it is impossible to reconcile liberal convictions with Israel ’s conduct ; too much is now known about the history of the conflict and the human rights record and the so - called peace process .
It is impossible to be both liberal and defend Israeli policy .
That was the conflict that confronted Goldstone .
I very much doubt he wanted to condemn Israel . ”
“ Israeli liberalism always had a function in Israeli society , ” said Finkelstein , whose new book , “ This Time We Went Too Far , ” examines the Israeli attack a year ago on Gaza .
“ When I talk about liberals I mean people like A.B. Yehoshua , David Grossman and Amos Oz .
Their function was to issue these anguished criticisms of Israel which not only extenuated Israeli crimes but exalted Israeli crimes .
‘ Is n’t it beautiful , the Israeli soul , how it is anguished over what it has done . ’
It is the classic case of having your cake and eating it .
Not only were any crimes being committed extenuated , but they were beautiful .
And now something strange happened .
Along comes a Jewish liberal and he says , ‘ Spare me your tears .
I am only interested in the law . ’ ”
“ Goldstone did not perform the role of the Jewish liberal , ” Finkelstein said , “ which is to be anguished , but no consequences .
And all of a sudden Israeli liberal Jews are discovering , hey , there are consequences for committing war crimes .
You do n’t just get to walk into the sunset and look beautiful .
They ca n’t believe it .
They are genuinely shocked .
‘ Are n’t our tears consequences enough ? ’
Are n’t our long eyes and broken hearts consequences enough ? ’
‘ No , ” he said , ‘ you have to go to the criminal court . ’ ”
The campaign against Israeli dissidents has taken the form of venomous denunciations of activists and jurists , including Justice Goldstone .
It includes a bill before the Israeli parliament , the Knesset , which will make it possible to imprison the leaders of Israeli human rights groups if they fail to comply with crippling new registration conditions .
Human rights activists from outside Israel who work in the Palestinian territories are being rounded up and deported .
The government is refusing to issue work visas to employees of 150 NGOs operating in the West Bank and East Jerusalem , including Oxfam , Save the Children and Médecins Sans Frontières ( Doctors Without Borders ) .
The new tourist visas effectively bar these employees from Palestinian territory under Israeli occupation .
Professor Naomi Chazan , the Israeli head of the NIF , which has donors in the United States , is being publicly vilified by ultranationalist groups such as Im Tirzu .
Foreign donors to the NIF , as well as other human rights groups , are being pressured by Israeli officials to halt contributions .
Billboards have sprouted up around Tel Aviv and Jerusalem with a grotesque caricature of Chazan , who has been branded by groups such as Im Tirzu as an agent for Hamas and Iran , with a horn growing from her forehead .
“ Naomi- Goldstone - Chazan ” the caption on the billboard reads .
Im Tirzu , the front organization behind many of the attacks , includes among its financial backers the John Hagee Ministries and the New York Central Fund , which also support extremist settler organizations .
The purge is under way because of the belief within the Netanyahu government that these groups and activists provided evidence of Israeli war crimes in Gaza to Justice Goldstone .
Israel has no intention of lifting the blockade on Gaza , halting settlement expansion , including the 1,600 new homes to be built in East Jerusalem , or reversing its division of the West Bank into impoverished ghettos of Palestinians .
The growing brutality and violence of the occupation , no longer easy to deny or hide , coupled with Israel ’s growing status as an international pariah , have unleashed a crackdown against all those within the Jewish state who are blamed for the bad publicity .
Yuli Edelstein , the Diaspora affairs minister , summed up the witch hunt when he announced that the Cabinet had been “ concerned for a time with a number of groups under the guise of NGOs that are funded by foreign agents . ”
The Knesset bill , if passed , will force human rights groups to register as political bodies and turn over identification numbers and addresses of all members to the government .
These groups will lose their tax - exempt status .
Most governmental organizations , such as the European Union , which is a large donor to Israeli human rights organizations , cannot legally pay taxes to another government , and the new law will effectively end European Union and other outside funding .
The groups will be mandated to provide the government with the records of all foreign donations and account for how these donations were spent .
Any public statement , event or speech , even if it lasts half a minute , by these groups must include a declaration that they are being supported and funded by a foreign power .
Those who fail to follow these guidelines , including local volunteers , can face a year in jail .
“ This is the first time the human rights dimension of the Israel Palestine conflict has moved center stage , ” Finkelstein said .
“ It has temporarily displaced the fatuous peace process .
It is the first time that human rights reports have counted .
There are literally , because I have read them , tens if not hundreds of thousands of pages of accumulation of human rights reports condemning Israel going back roughly to the first intifada to the present .
The human rights organizations since the 1990s have been quite sharp in their criticism of Israel human rights policy , but nobody ever reads the reports .
They are never reported on , with maybe a couple of exceptions , in the mainstream media .
The Goldstone report was the first time the findings of these human rights organizations moved center stage .
People stopped talking about the peace process and started talking about Israel ’s human rights record . ”
There is a growing disenchantment among Israelis with the endless occupation of Gaza and the West Bank as well as endemic government corruption .
Maj. Gen. Avi Zamir , the head of the Israeli military ’s Personnel Directorate , admitted recently to UPI that increasing numbers of Israelis are refusing to serve in the occupied territories .
“ Taking into consideration Israeli Arab youth , we ’re facing a situation in which 70 percent of youths will not enlist in the military , ” the general told the news agency .
The discontent , along with the international condemnation , is inhibiting Israel ’s ability to muster international support for further attacks .
“ Israel attacked Gaza to restore what it called its deterrence capacity , its ability to terrorize the Arab world into submission , ” Finkelstein said .
“ But it actually diminished its deterrence capacity because it ca n’t attack .
If they were to attack now , anywhere , all hell would break loose and they would n’t get sympathy . ”
The numbers of so - called refuseniks are proliferating with groups such as the Courage to Refuse , Shministim and New Profile supporting those who will not serve in the Israeli Defense Forces .
It is not that many Israelis lack a conscience , it is not that many cannot delineate right from wrong ; it is that the Netanyahu government is determined to see that these courageous voices within Israel will be silenced along with those of the Palestinians .
The Public Transport Users Association of Australia has a great press release and analysis on the need to re-think the ideal of a “ metro , ” and to question why Australians should wait decades for them .
The major cities of Australia ( Sydney , Melbourne , Brisbane , Adelaide , Perth ) all have rather similar urban transit networks , dominated by a product that might be called European - scale commuter rail : trains with overhead - catenary power running mostly on a dedicated network .
Within the first 40 km or so of radius , these networks usually run at frequencies of 15 - 30 minutes , but there ’s a huge surge of additional service during the peak commute period to handle the flows of commuters into and out of the central city .
Further out , many of the lines branch , or introduce diverse stopping patterns , which have the effect of increasing longer - distance speeds but reducing frequencies further , at least at minor stations .
A crucial feature of these networks is that they are ( a ) almost totally radial , offering few if any substantial opportunities to travel between non-CBD centres , and ( b ) designed to cover a huge range of urban densities with the same basic product .
There ’s no difference — in fleet , station facilities , staffing , ticketing , etc — between a train that you ’d ride 3 km to a dense inner-city suburb and one that you ’d ride 50 km or more to low - density suburbs on the outermost edges of your city .
There is often a difference in frequency — it ’s usually lower further out as routes branch or introduce stopping patterns — but not always .
In some cases , such as the Inner West line in Sydney , the denser inner city stations are served by just one stopping pattern at a relatively low frequency , while most trains fly through these stations nonstop aiming for destinations further out .
As commonly happens with commuter rail , the government focus is so much on the peak - period commuter that it often misses out on opportunities to do other good things with its trains and infrastructure .
Density is high enough to support high all - day demand in the inner city ( roughly comparable to the extent of each city in 1945 ) and at key regional centres further out .
But this demand is everywhere - to - everywhere , not just to the CBD , so it requires ( a ) good connection opportunities throughout the network , especially between trains and buses and ( b ) high enough frequencies that these connections are worth the wait .
Many of the major inner-city urban rail lines in Australia could easily run every 5 minutes or better if there were a commitment to fund operations and build connection opportunities .
For a variety of political and cultural reasons , many of these opportunities have not been pursued .
Instead , in Sydney and Melbourne especially , we ’ve been encouraged to long for something called a “ metro . ”
Many Australians have been to Europe and often to some of the East Asian megacities .
The word “ metro ” is meant to refer to the high - frequency , high - capacity rail transit , usually underground , that laces the dense cores of those cities .
It ’s been easy to jump from those desires to the notion that since Australia does n’t have metros now , it needs to build them .
But Bowen ’s work in Melbourne ( and our own work on the Sydney Morning Herald inquiry ) are pointing out that our cities already have a network of grade - separated rail lines covering the areas of European density , and that the quickest way to get a “ metro ” level of mobility is simply to run these lines much more frequently .
There are some barriers to this ( notably the two - man crews still required on Sydney trains ) but most would be easy to address if there were a conceptual shift .
The conceptual problem is that as long as our rail bureaucracies understand the peak commute to be their primary product , they will continue to care about running time more than they do about frequency .
Running time matters more than frequency only for relatively long trips ( because we tolerate longer waits to go longer distances ) and for rigidly scheduled trips such as classic commutes ( because we select a particular schedule trip to use ) .
Everywhere else — throughout the inner city all day , for example — people experience frequency as maximum wait time , and are not willing to wait long to travel short distances .
Even a 15 - minute frequency is on the outside of tolerable if you ’re just going 3 km or so .
If you just miss one , take a cab or even a bus , and you may reach your destination sooner .
Having said all that , I do like driverless , fully - automated metros , which sever the link between frequency and labor cost and thus make it possible to run every 4 minutes even at midnight .
They have done wonders in Vancouver , not just for mobility but for urban form .
Sydney had a proposed driverless metro that would have broken ground this year , but the Government cancelled it in February 2010 after three years of confusion and acrimony .
In Sydney ’s case , the process was too fast .
A long driverless metro line from the city to the northwest suburbs was suddenly announced in 2007 , using a corridor that had never been identified for rapid transit in any land use plans .
When that proved too ambitious , it was hacked back to a tiny metro that barely got out of the CBD , which proved to be too disruptive to the life of the city and yet not long enough to do much good .
From the beginning , too , the media treated the metro as a political attack on the existing rail system and its unions .
That was n’t entirely untrue , but it was certainly exaggerated , and while inter-agency spite can be a powerful political force in planning , most people agreed that it was n’t a very good basis for a multi-billion - dollar infrastructure investment .
Even if Sydney had proceeded with starting a driverless metro system , the vast majority of the city would have continued to depend on the existing rail product , and would have needed to see further investment in all - day frequency to make the existing lines more “ metro ” - like .
So now , in a way , Sydney has a clearer path .
We have the tracks , the wires , the stations , and the trains .
All we need is a new commitment to all - day service .
It ’s not cheap , but compared to an all - new all - underground automated metro , it ’s a bargain .
I ’ve mentioned a number of software laws in various posts , like Cargill ’s Ninety Nine Rule , or Occam ’s Razor .
And there are tons of laws that you probably already know , like Metcalfe ’s Law or Moore ’s Law .
I ’ve found a very complete list of the laws regarding software development ( I highly recommend reading that link .
I ’ll wait , go ahead ) .
But from that list , we seem to have developed a complete blind spot for five in particular .
Let ’s look at these five and how our collective ignorance of them continues to impact software development today :
Gene Amdahl first published this notion in a 1967 paper .
This law is about the mistaken notion that “ All We Need Are More Parallel Processors and Our Software Will Run Faster ” .
The Damning Evidence : Pop quiz : have you bought a new machine in the past 4 years that was multi-core ?
Were you a little disappointed when you checked the processor usage and found that not every one of those shiny , new cores was busy all the time , no matter which of your apps you ran ?
We buy new hardware with the mistaken impression that our old programs will continue to run even faster than before because we expect our software to take advantage of all those friggin cores !
But software never runs as fast we expect it to on the multi-core hardware , because the parallel component of the program is often missing , underdeveloped , or poorly understood by the developer .
Thus , our software continues to disappoint us on even on shiny , new multi-core hardware .
Exceptions :
Some applications have been expressly written to be massively parallel and they continue to kick ass and take names on new multi-core hardware ( e.g. rendering , scientific and encoding applications ) .
By and large , most applications simply do n’t benefit from those extra cores because they were n’t written to do so .
Law # 2 : The Law of False Alerts
First introduced by George Spafford in this article , the law states that the more the user is presented with false or erroneous alerts , the more they will ignore real alerts in the system .
The Damning Evidence : Windows Vista is the classic current example .
Every bloody operation in it required your permission from the user authentication module .
After while , you just madly clicked “ Yeah , sure whatever … ” for every warning that popped up .
This , of course , robs the operating system of any ability to protect you from a real threat because you ’ve been annoyed by the feature in the first place .
Of course , people still design applications like this :
“ Are you sure you want to delete ? ”
“ No , really , are you REALLY sure you want to delete ? ” .
“ OK , look , I ’ve asked already but just so I ca n’t be blamed for anything , are you SUPER - DUPER - ABSOLUTELY , 110 % sure you want to delete ? ”
Stop the insanity .
If they click delete and they were n’t supposed to , how about offering an undo operation ?
Too hard you say ?
Then you ’re not trying hard enough .
Do n’t punish the users for bad design .
From Jakob Nielsen , web usability guru , who states that users only spend a small fraction of time on your site , compared to all other sites .
Therefore , your site experience should be similar to all other sites to minimize learning curve and maximize usability .
The Damning Evidence : Well , things like Firefox Personas aside , which distract your users from the actual content of the sites , we still ca n’t seem to come up with a consistent way to develop user interfaces on sites .
Thanks to Web 2.0 , everyone is now trying to copy the success of sites like Facebook , Twitter , and other social networks to create wild , experimental web pages that are just plain awful to use .
Do n’t get me wrong here : I ’m not saying different is bad , I ’m saying that different is hard to get right .
Users ( especially “ Normals ” ) do n’t like to be made to think how to use things .
But that does n’t seem to stop us creating web pages with crazy stuff on them .
Exceptions : Sometimes , user interfaces are giant evolutionary steps that simply lie outside the normal boundaries we ’ve come to expect and that ’s acceptable .
The iPhone was a perfect example : no one really had mastered the touch interface until Cupertino &
Co came out with it and they did n’t exactly follow any of the old school rules .
But it was still a major success and now sets the standard for all smartphones .
However , most everyone else thinks they ’re creating the exception when they ’re just breaking the rules poorly .
Law # 4 : The Pesticide Paradox
Attributed to Bruce Beiser , the law states that every method you use to prevent or find bugs leaves a residue of subtler bugs against which those methods are ineffectual .
The Damning Evidence : Things like Test Driven Development and Unit Testing give us the false impression that we ’ve quashed the major bugs in the system when all we ’ve really done is quash the obvious bugs , leaving the more subtle , painful , and difficult ones behind .
Many of these types of bugs are related to concurrency or particular complex data conditions that are difficult to express as unit tests .
Before anyone rants about this comment section claiming I think TDD is bad , or unit testing is evil , please hear me correctly :
Unit testing and TDD leave a false sense of security that we ’ve managed to create stable software .
They are a starting point to more complete testing , but they are not the end .
The meaningful problems are often in integration with other systems and modules , that are often left out of testing plans because of time constraints , schedule pressures , laziness and sometimes plain arrogance .
Exceptions : Small , simpler systems rarely suffer from these issues because testing is much easier .
This is mostly a complex software problem , at a level of enterprise development , large applications ( e.g. Microsoft Word ) , or operating systems .
While this law stems from genetic research by R.A.
Fisher , the application in software is somewhat obvious :
The more highly adapted an organism becomes , the less adaptable it is to any new change .
The Damning Evidence :
We strive to create complex , interesting , and highly useful frameworks : Hibernate , Struts , Flex , ExtJS , and jQuery to name a few .
But every version we release generates new requests by the users for missing features or enhancements .
Each change adds more complexity .
And the more complex the software , the lower the chance those changes can be easily accommodated in subsequent versions .
For example , Struts went through a major rewrite for version 2.0 , which speaks volumes about the original version ’s adaptability to change .
Spring did a major update for AOP that was a breaking change from 1.0 .
ExtJS did the same for their 1.0 and 2.0 releases .
Exceptions : Probably none–this seems to be the inherent nature of frameworks .
But if you know of something , please prove me wrong in the comment section .
I ’d love to hear about some piece of software that did n’t follow this rule .

From Al Gore 's article "
We Can’t Wish Away Climate Change
" in today 's NY Times :
" It would be an enormous relief if the recent attacks on the science of global warming actually indicated that we do not face an unimaginable calamity requiring large - scale , preventive measures to protect human civilization as we know it .
Of course , we would still need to deal with the national security risks of our growing dependence on a global oil market dominated by dwindling reserves in the most unstable region of the world , and the economic risks of sending hundreds of billions of dollars a year overseas in return for that oil .
And we would still trail China in the race to develop smart grids , fast trains , solar power , wind , geothermal and other renewable sources of energy — the most important sources of new jobs in the 21st century .
But what a burden would be lifted !
We would no longer have to worry that our grandchildren would one day look back on us as a criminal generation that had selfishly and blithely ignored clear warnings that their fate was in our hands .
We could instead celebrate the naysayers who had doggedly persisted in proving that every major National Academy of Sciences report on climate change had simply made a huge mistake .
I , for one , genuinely wish that the climate crisis were an illusion .
But unfortunately , the reality of the danger we are courting has not been changed by the discovery of at least two mistakes in the thousands of pages of careful scientific work over the last 22 years by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change .
In fact , the crisis is still growing because we are continuing to dump 90 million tons of global - warming pollution every 24 hours into the atmosphere — as if it were an open sewer . "
MP : In 2007 , Al Gore 's mansion in Nashville burned through an average of 17,720 kWh of electricity per month ( see Al Gore 's energy bills from 2005 to mid-2008 here , via the Tennessee Center for Policy Research , which first reported on Al Gore 's energy usage in 2007 electricity consumed by the average U.S. household ( 936 kWh ) , and almost 3 times as much electricity as the average U.S. commercial customer ( 6,408 kWh ) , see chart above ( Dept. of Energy ) , which is almost 19 times as much as the monthlyconsumed by the average U.S. household ( 936 kWh ) , and almost 3 times as much electricity as the average U.S. commercial customer ( 6,408 kWh ) , see chart above ( Dept. of Energy data here ) .
So it 's just a little hard to take Al Gore 's preaching about climate change too seriously when his own household 's contribution to the " climate crisis " is almost 20 times greater of the average American household , and almost three times greater than even the average commercial user of electricity .
So it 's classic Al Gore .
He talks about a " criminal generation that selfishly and blithely " dumps " global - warming pollution into the atmosphere as if it were an open sewer . "
However , if personal energy usage was " criminal , " Al Gore might be at the top of " America 's Most Wanted List , " see chart above .
Terms that come to mind to describe Al Gore 's carbon footprint include " Bigfoot , " " Paul Bunyan , " " Brobdingnagian , " " Sasquatch , " or " the elephant in the room . "
To paraphrase blues pianist Mose Allison , " If polluting was criminal , he 'd live a life of crime . "

Maybe the article could have been titled , " We Can't Wish Away Climate Change , But We Can Reduce Our Personal Carbon Footprint , But Only If We Really Want To : I 'm Not Willing to Change My Lifestyle , But the Rest of You Should . "
Even some outspoken cheerleaders of Internet technology have begun to grapple with some of its more vexing side effects .
Steven Johnson , a founder of the online magazine Feed , for instance , wrote in an article in The Wall Street Journal last year that with the development of software for Amazon.com ’s Kindle and other e-book readers that enable users to jump back and forth from other applications , he fears “ one of the great joys of book reading  the total immersion in another world , or in the world of the author ’s ideas  will be compromised . ”
He continued , “ We all may read books the way we increasingly read magazines and newspapers : a little bit here , a little bit there . ”
Mr. Johnson added that the book ’s migration to the digital realm will turn the solitary act of reading  “ a direct exchange between author and reader ”  into something far more social and suggested that as online chatter about books grows , “ the unity of the book will disperse into a multitude of pages and paragraphs vying for Google ’s attention . ”
WORRYING ABOUT the public ’s growing attention deficit disorder and susceptibility to information overload , of course , is hardly new .
It ’s been 25 years since Neil Postman warned in “ Amusing Ourselves to Death ” that trivia and the entertainment values promoted by television were creating distractions that threatened to subvert public discourse , and more than a decade since writers like James Gleick ( “ Faster ” ) and David Shenk ( “ Data Smog ” ) described a culture addicted to speed , drowning in data and overstimulated to the point where only sensationalism and willful hyperbole grab people ’s attention .
Now , with the ubiquity of instant messaging and e-mail , the growing popularity of Twitter and YouTube , and even newer services like Google Wave , velocity and efficiency have become even more important .
Although new media can help build big TV audiences for events like the Super Bowl , it also tends to make people treat those events as fodder for digital chatter .
More people are impatient to cut to the chase , and they ’re increasingly willing to take the imperfect but immediately available product over a more thoughtfully analyzed , carefully created one .
Instead of reading an entire news article , watching an entire television show or listening to an entire speech , growing numbers of people are happy to jump to the summary , the video clip , the sound bite  never mind if context and nuance are lost in the process ; never mind if it ’s our emotions , more than our sense of reason , that are engaged ; never mind if statements have n’t been properly vetted and sourced .
People tweet and text one another during plays and movies , forming judgments before seeing the arc of the entire work .
Recent books by respected authors like Malcolm Gladwell ( “ Outliers ” ) , Susan Faludi ( “ The Terror Dream ” ) and Jane Jacobs ( “ Dark Age Ahead ” ) rely far more heavily on cherry - picked anecdotes  instead of broader - based evidence and assiduous analysis  than the books that first established their reputations .
And online research enables scholars to power - search for nuggets of information that might support their theses , saving them the time of wading through stacks of material that might prove marginal but that might have also prompted them to reconsider or refine their original thinking .
“ Reading in the traditional open - ended sense is not what most of us , whatever our age and level of computer literacy , do on the Internet , ” the scholar Susan Jacoby writes in “ The Age of American Unreason . ”
“ What we are engaged in  like birds of prey looking for their next meal  is a process of swooping around with an eye out for certain kinds of information . ”
TODAY ’S TECHNOLOGY has bestowed miracles of access and convenience upon millions of people , and it ’s also proven to be a vital new means of communication .
Twitter has been used by Iranian dissidents ; text messaging and social networking Web sites have been used to help coordinate humanitarian aid in Haiti ; YouTube has been used by professors to teach math and chemistry .
But technology is also turning us into a global water - cooler culture , with millions of people sending each other ( via e-mail , text messages , tweets , YouTube links ) gossip , rumors and the sort of amusing - entertaining - weird anecdotes and photographs they might once have shared with pals over a coffee break .
And in an effort to collect valuable eyeballs and clicks , media outlets are increasingly pandering to that impulse  often at the expense of hard news .
“ I have the theory that news is now driven not by editors who know anything , ” the comedian and commentator Bill Maher recently observed .
“ I think it ’s driven by people who are ” slacking off at work and “ surfing the Internet . ”
He added , “ It ’s like a country run by ‘ America ’s Funniest Home Videos . ’ ”
The above headline might seem like a joke .
It is n't .
Senior staffers at the Securities and Exchange Commission were surfing Internet pornography when they should have been policing the financial system .
A deeply disturbing SEC memo to Senator Chuck Grassley ( R - IA ) exposing this problem was reported Thursday night by ABC News .
Here are some highlights via the Associated Press :
_A senior attorney at the SEC's Washington headquarters spent up to eight hours a day looking at and downloading pornography .
When he ran out of hard drive space , he burned the files to CDs or DVDs , which he kept in boxes around his office .
He agreed to resign , an earlier watchdog report said .
_ An accountant was blocked more than 16,000 times in a month from visiting websites classified as " Sex " or " Pornography . "
Yet , he still managed to amass a collection of " very graphic " material on his hard drive by using Google images to bypass the SEC 's internal filter , according to an earlier report from the inspector general .
The accountant refused to testify in his defense and received a 14 - day suspension .
_ Seventeen of the employees were " at a senior level , " earning salaries of up to $ 222,418 .
_ The number of cases jumped from two in 2007 to 16 in 2008 .
The cracks in the financial system emerged in mid-2007 and spread into full - blown panic by the fall of 2008 .
On one hand , two cases in 2007 means that either it was n't that widespread of a problem or it had n't yet been detected .
On the other hand , the fact that this behavior seems to have been so prevalent among senior level employees is particularly troubling .
They 're the ones who should have been closely watching the financial industry and leading the way to help prevent the system from collapsing .
A few things should be concluded from this revelation .
First , government computers must need better firewalls to block out this content .
Second , this is a pretty grim verdict on the effectiveness of regulators .
When on the verge of the most major economic crisis in around 80 years , they were watching porn instead of the financial system .
This certainly is n't the kind of publicity the SEC needs as it begins to prosecute its high - profile case against Goldman Sachs .
This memo damages the credibility of the regulator .
Though , it does begin to explain why it took the SEC more than three years to bring the complaint against Goldman : its employees had other things on their minds .

The rise of the Web has caused a revolution in business — from music to journalism old models are buckling .
And the upheaval is driven by the transformation of tangible goods into digital information in combination with fortuitous quirk of human nature .
That ’s according to Clay Shirky , a new media scholar from New York University who spoke yesterday at the South by Southwest conference in Austin .
Shirky referenced Michael Tomasello of the Max Planck Institute who says that humans share three kinds of commodities : goods , services and information .
Imagine you are walking down the street and you see an elderly woman .
She asks you for money .
How would you feel ?
Now imagine that she asks you to help her cross the street .
A different feeling .
Now imagine she just asks for directions .
A different feeling again .
It is this last case , the sharing of information , that humans do freely and actually want to do , according to Shirky .
Speaking about the demise of the music industry , he reminded us that we held on to our compact discs , goods we could touch .
But when the music - sharing site Napster launched — and music became a digital file easily copied — sharing took off , and “ the music industry freaked out . ”
Shirky ’s catchphrase serves as a guideline to predict future events : Behavior is motivation filtered through opportunity .

A group of Brazilian lottery players who thought they had won a $ US30 million ( $ 33.4 million ) jackpot had their euphoria turn to dismay when they found out their precious ticket had not been registered , police said .
Investigators believe the shop where the group of 40 players had bought their ticket did not enter their numbers into the national lottery computer system , invalidating their win .
" We know that the ticket was paid for and if the ticket was not properly issued then fraud was committed , " a local police chief , Clovis da Silva , said .
The government financial agency responsible for the lottery has suspended the shop in the southern city of Novo Hamburgo , and the bitter would - be winners are looking at launching a lawsuit .

Number of Chinese billionaires ' second only to US '
By Michael Bristow
BBC News , Beijing
China 's leaders say they are worried by the growing rich - poor gap China now has more billionaires than any other country besides the United States , according to Forbes magazine .
There are a total of 64 people in that bracket in mainland China , the magazine says in its annual list of the world 's richest people .
The figure is perhaps not surprising considering that China 's economy has seen rapid growth over recent years .
China is set to overtake Japan as the world 's second - biggest economy sometime this year .
According to Forbes , the world now has 1,011 billionaires .
The country with the biggest concentration is the US , with 403 .
But China comes second with 64 living in the mainland .
That figure jumps to 89 if Hong Kong is included .
The former British colony was returned to China in 1997 , but largely governs its own affairs .
On Forbes ' list of billionaires there are a total of 97 new additions - and 27 of those are from mainland China .
They include people such as Li Shufu , who is chairman of Geely , a car - maker that is currently poised to buy Sweden 's Volvo .
The richest man in China , Zong Qinghou , runs a multi-billion - dollar firm , the Wahaha Group , that makes soft drinks .
In an interview with Forbes , he hinted at why his firm has become so successful .
" We 're not afraid of competition .
To meet competition , however , you have to continuously innovate , " he said .
Wealth gap China 's increasing prominence on this rich list reflects its growing economic muscle , confirmed on Wednesday with a report that exports rose in February by nearly 50 % compared to a year earlier .
But the news that there are now more billionaires in China might not be welcomed by everyone in the country .
Many people , including some officials , say that the gap between rich and poor is already too large .
Just a few days ago in a speech at the start of China 's on - going parliamentary session , Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said the government must reverse the widening income gap .
" We will not only make the ' pie ' of social wealth bigger by developing the economy , but also distribute it well , " he said .
Mr Wen added : " [ We will ] make our society fairer and more harmonious . "

Yet in a culture in thrall to the god of physical attractiveness , where image , as the slogan goes , is everything , women are not alone in their vulnerability .
Men , too , suffer from eating disorders , though at lower rates than women .
And new research suggests that the number of men who have significant symptoms of eating disorders may be greater than was once believed : in a study of 10,000 residents of Ontario , for example , University of Toronto researchers found that 1 of every 6 people who qualified for a full or partial diagnosis of anorexia was male -- substantially more than the 1 in 10 usually reported in studies of patients in eating - disorder programs .
Some experts also suspect , though data are still scarce , that eating disorders among men are on the rise , increasing along with the pressures men feel to conform to the lean and chiseled stereotypes purveyed by Hollywood and Madison Avenue .
'' We are seeing a tremendous increase in men 's distress about their body shape , '' said Dr. Arnold Andersen , a professor of psychiatry at the University of Iowa College of Medicine , who specializes in eating disorders .
'' I think that men are simply following a decade or two behind women in terms of being exposed to body images that are increasingly difficult to achieve . ''
Women with eating disorders may be driven by their desire to be thin , but men often express their preoccupation in different terms .
Instead of a low body weight , they seek well - defined muscles , sleek abs and sculptured pecs .
Achieving this goal , however , usually means excising every stray ounce of fat .
If the anorexic or bulimic woman 's nightmare is being told that she has '' a little meat on her thighs , '' many men live in fear of being told that they '' still have a little fat on those delts . ''
For example , Dr. Holbrook , who is 57 , said he did not consciously worry about being overweight until 1976 , when an injury forced him to stop running his customary 15 miles a day .
'' When I could n't run any more , I panicked , '' he wrote in '' Making Weight : Men 's Conflicts with Food , Weight , Shape and Appearance , '' ( Gurze , 2000 ) , which he wrote with Dr. Andersen and Leigh Cohn .
'' I started weighing myself every day , and even though I was not gaining weight , I started feeling fatter .
For the next 12 years , I did everything I could to rid my body of ' the fat . ' ''
MOSCOW —
The president of Kyrgyzstan was forced to flee the capital , Bishkek , on Wednesday after bloody protests erupted across the country over his repressive rule , a backlash that could pose a threat to the American military supply line into nearby Afghanistan .
Opposition politicians , speaking on state television after it was seized by protesters , said they had taken control of the government after a day of violent clashes that left more than 40 people dead and more than 400 wounded .
The instability called into question the fate of a critical American air base in the country .
Riot police officers fired rounds of live ammunition into angry crowds of demonstrators who gathered around government buildings to rally against what they termed the government ’s brutality and corruption , as well as a recent decision to increase utility rates sharply .
Witnesses said that the police seemed to panic , and that there was no sign of supervision .
In several cases , demonstrators wrested their weapons away from them .
By early Thursday morning , opposition officials occupied many government buildings in Bishkek , and were demanding that the president , Kurmanbek Bakiyev , sign a formal letter of resignation .
Mr. Bakiyev has issued no public remarks since the protests began .
An official at the Bishkek airport said Mr. Bakiyev was flying to Osh , a major city in the southern part of the country .

Like the canary in the coal mine , the timber rattlesnake may be telling us something about the environment we share .
Cornell University researchers -- using cutting - edge tools including fine - scale molecular genetics and microsatellite markers -- tracked the rattlesnakes to understand how wildlife habitats are affected by even modest human encroachment .
" We used this species as a model to investigate general processes underlying population - level responses to habitat fragmentation , " said the authors , led by Cornell post - doctoral researcher Rulon Clark , in the paper " Roads , Interrupted Dispersal and Genetic Diversity in Timber Rattlesnakes , " currently available online and to be published in the journal Conservation Biology .
Researchers discovered that fragmentation of natural habitats by roads -- even smaller , low - traffic highways -- has had a significant effect over the past 80 years on genetic structure of timber rattlesnakes in four separate regions of upstate New York .
Less genetic diversity means populations become more susceptible to illness or environmental changes that threaten their survival .
" Our study adds to a growing body of literature indicating that even anthropogenic habitat modifications that does not destroy a large amount of habitat can create significant barriers to gene flow , " said researchers .
While the rattlesnakes shorter lifespan and method of travel may help make the impact of roadways relatively quick and dramatic , the new findings reinforce earlier work on other terrestrial animals -- from grizzly bears to frogs -- and provides a fresh warning about habitat fragmentation that all plans for future human development must consider .
Researchers used fine - scale molecular genetics as well as behavioral and ecological data to look at timber rattlesnakes from 19 different hibernacula -- shared wintering quarters -- in four regions in New York : the Adirondacks , Sterling Forest , Bear Mountain and Chemung County .
In each case they used microsatellite markers to track how populations dispersed from their winter dens , their subsequent reproductive patterns , and how roads in these areas altered that gene flow .
The roads themselves -- all paved roadways built in the late 1920s to early 19030s for motorized traffic -- were examined for use and relationship to natural barriers .
Tissue samples were examined from more than 500 individual snakes .
" Over all four regions and 19 hibernacula , none of the genetic clusters … spanned either major or minor roads ; hibernacula belonging to the same genetic deme were always on the same side of the road , " the paper states .
" This fine - scaled analysis , repeated over four geographic regions , underscores the significance of roads as barrier to dispersal and natural population processes for timber rattlesnakes and perhaps other species . "
The research team also included Kelly Zamudio , Cornell University ecology and evolutionary biology professor ; William Brown , professor of biology at Skidmore College , Saratoga Springs , N.Y. ; and Randy Stechert , an environmental consultant for the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation .
Clark is currently an assistant professor at San Diego State University .
The research was funded by the National Science Foundation and the New York State Biodiversity Research Institute .
NEW YORK CITY —
Two weeks ago , parents of children at the Manhattan East School for Arts and Academics , a public middle school in New York City ’s East Harlem neighborhood , received an alarming letter from the PTA president .
It seems that the PTA and the school ’s leadership had just heard , quite by accident , that discussions were underway at the city ’s Department of Education to evict and relocate Manhattan East to provide space for a charter school , the Harlem Success Academy .
While the DOE has an official – and very controversial – policy of moving “ underperforming ” schools to make way for “ smaller , better and more efficient ” charter schools , ” more is at play in the case of Manhattan East .
Manhattan East is a successful school .
So what could the reason for the move be , asked parents at the emergency meeting held in the school ’s auditorium on February 8 ?
Harlem Success Academy ’s interest in Manhattan East ’s space may have to do with the many improvements that have been made in the 15 years the school has been there , including a fully equipped science lab , sound - proof music room , rooftop garden and gym .
One parent said , “ ME is not an under - performing school in any sense of the words … it is the pride of its community , and beyond .
It ’s shocking that such a decision could be made about its future by the DOE with no involvement of its administrators , families , students or community . ”
Rose Jimenez , PTA president of the Mosaic Preparatory Academy , a nearby public K - 8 school , described what happened when the Harlem Success Academy moved in to their school .
“ First they took over half of one floor , and then the whole floor .
Then they installed playground equipment and put a fence around it to separate it from the area where the children from Mosaic have recess . ”
After a big fight , the fence was taken down .
The story is emblematic of the elitism that parents and educators charge characterizes the charter schools .
State Senator Bill Perkins points to the concentration of charter schools in Harlem ( 24 of 29 in Manhattan are located north of 96 Street , traditionally the dividing line ) , and says that this creates a system that is “ separate and unequal . ”
Manhattan
East families are being urged to send letters and make phone calls to the city ’s 311 help line , the education department , elected officials and the media , and to participate in a demonstration called by the Coalition for Educational Justice on Tuesday , February 23 .
The theme of the rally is , “ Make all schools good schools – No more pitting of schools against schools and parents against parents . ”
While the eviction of Manhattan East may be averted , the bigger picture of encroachment on the public schools by charter schools is a sobering one .
Last month , the DOE decided to close 19 schools , despite protests and a demonstration of 2,000 people outside the meeting .
Opponents charge that the closings are part of the city ’s attempt to abandon the neediest and most at risk students and open the door for more charters .
Coming soon :
On charter schools , what exactly does it mean to be “ privately run and publicly funded ? ’
Are there any McClatchy newspapers in Kentucky ?
Oh it does n't matter .
Bunning 's a lame duck .
Opposition Republicans are using the delaying tactic at a record - setting pace .
" The numbers are astonishing in this Congress , " says Jim Riddlesperger , political science professor at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth .
The filibuster , using seemingly endless debate to block legislative action , has become entrenched like a dandelion tap root in the midst of the shrill partisanship gripping Washington .
But the filibuster is nothing new .
Its use dates to the mists of Senate history , but until the civil rights era , it was rarely used .
A tactic unique to the Senate , the filibuster means a simple majority guarantees nothing when it comes to passing laws ...
As a matter of political philosophy , the concept of the filibuster arises from a deep - seated , historic concern among Americans that the minority not be steamrolled by the majority .
It is a brake and protective device rooted in the same U.S. political sensibility that gave each state two senators regardless of population .
The same impulse gave Americans the Electoral College in presidential contests -- a structure from earliest U.S. history designed to give smaller population states greater influence in choosing the nation 's leader .
Given recent use of the filibuster by minority Republicans and the party 's success in snarling the legislative process in this Congress , Democrats say the minority has gone way beyond just protecting its interests .
The frequency of filibusters -- plus threats to use them -- are measured by the number of times the upper chamber votes on cloture .
Such votes test the majority 's ability to hold together 60 members to break a filibuster .
Last year , the first of the 111th Congress , there were a record 112 cloture votes .
In the first two months of 2010 , the number already exceeds 40 .
That means , with 10 months left to run in the 111th Congress , Republicans have turned to the filibuster or threatened its use at a pace that will more than triple the old record .
The 104th Congress in 1995 - 96 -- when Republicans held a 53 - 47 majority -- required 50 cloture votes .
So , the Department of Transportation as of Monday morning , furloughed 2,000 federal workers .
DOT says that number could climb if this stalemate over funding drags on .
Employees affected include federal inspectors overseeing highway projects on federal lands .
If the inspectors are n't there , the projects must shut down .
DOT says that will affect 41 critical construction projects from Alaska to the U.S. Virgin Islands .
“ As American families are struggling in tough economic times , I am keenly disappointed that political games are putting a stop to important construction projects around the country , ” said Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood .
“ This means that construction workers will be sent home from job sites because federal inspectors must be furloughed . ”
Without the highway trust fund dollars , the federal government also cannot reimburse states for any ongoing construction projects .
There is usually a federal - state match and the states get reimbursed on a real - time basis .
States are scheduled to get some $ 768 million dollars from the feds this week .
They will get the money eventually , but will have to figure out how to make do without , for now .
The American Medical Association warned of this last week : " A Medicare meltdown now seems certain , as the U.S. Senate has left early for the weekend , abandoning seniors , military families and baby boomers , " reads an AMA statement from Friday .
" The Senate failed to repeal the Medicare physician payment formula that will cause a drastic 21 percent payment cut to physicians who care for Medicare and TRICARE patients .
On Monday , the 21 percent cut goes into effect , forcing many physicians to limit the number of Medicare and TRICARE patients they see in order to keep their practice doors open . "
Unemployment insurance " does n't create new jobs .
In fact , if anything , continuing to pay people unemployment compensation is a disincentive for them to seek new work , " Kyl said during debate over whether unemployment insurance and other benefits that expired amid GOP objections Sunday should be extended .
Senate Republicans sought Tuesday to insulate themselves from the damage caused by Sen. Jim Bunning ’s ( R - Ky . ) filibuster of a bill that would extend unemployment and health benefits and highway programs .
Sen. Susan Collins ( R - Maine ) took to the floor Tuesday morning to ask that the Senate vote within hours on the bill so that thousands of furloughed federal highway workers could go back to work and the unemployed could see a resumption of their jobless benefits ...
Collins said she was proffering the request on behalf of herself and “ numerous ” other GOP Senators with whom she had spoken .
New York State is the biggest loser if the Senate fails to renew unemployment benefits soon .
The Labor Department projects that 54,300 claimants in the Empire State will lose their coverage if Congress fails to act on extending jobless benefits by Mar. 13 .
“ Hard - working Americans facing a tough economy do n’t deserve this .
Putting benefits in jeopardy for hundreds of thousands , and potentially millions , of unemployed workers for the sake of a partisan political argument is an abuse of power , and should be treated as one ...
When it ’s this easy for one person to make a bad situation worse , voters are right to be angry .
Playing politics with peoples ’ economic security , their homes , their children ’s welfare and their livelihoods is n’t leadership and should n’t be tolerated by any party that claims to represent the American people .
This is not an abstract debate about principle or philosophy .
These are real people who are trying hard to find work and get back on their feet .
Cutting off badly needed assistance at a time like this will only spread insecurity and greater hardship .
Sen .
Bunning did himself , his state and his country a great disservice and his colleagues should prevail upon him until he relents . ”
Short of pitchforks and torches , it looks like every major political problem in America begging for a solution comes down to either sudden enlightenment in the old slaveholding states or -- more likely -- something akin to the British Parliament Act of 1911 , which profoundly changed , and democratized , the British legislative branch by removing the veto from the anti-democratic upper chamber .
It was n't easy .
In fact , it was more " impossible " than it would be to reform the U.S. Senate .
It even took the death of a king to finally get it done .
But they did get it done , and the British government became far more responsive to its citizens as a result .
The filibuster , which is being abused by a radical right GOP opposing Change and refusing to recognize Obama as a legitimate president , is a tool of obstruction against the will of the people .
An analysis by A.P. yesterday concludes that conservative obstructionism in the Senate is making the nation ungovernable .
The latest eruption of populist anger and liberal angst against the Senate has been caused by senile and retiring Kentucky crepuscular Jim Bunning 's one - man circus act -- an act very much supported by his party behind the scenes , if not openly -- to halt a planned extension of unemployment and health insurance benefits for unemployed people .
11.5 million Americans have been thrown out of work , largely due to wrong - headed conservative policies Bunning and his party implemented -- with a vengeance -- while they had Bush in the White House with a signing pen .
They 've done nearly as much damage to America as the combined efforts of Calvin Coolidge , Warren Harding and Herbert Hoover did in the 1920s , and for the same ideological mania : unregulated , antisocial greed and selfishness .
It turns out that the GOP 's tantrum is a tactic to get the Democrats to agree to lowering the tax rates on the 400 richest families in America at the time when wealth is passed between generations ( i.e. , the estate tax , the bane of plutocracy ) .
Bunning 's stunt has also caused an abrupt halt on Highway Trust Fund expenditures for 30 days -- no pay for any of its programs or its employees
The GOP bullshit also led to a 21 % fee cut for already strapped doctors who accept Medicare , furthering GOP ambitions to destroy the system entirely .
Another big victim of Republican game - playing and Bunning 's psychosis is the job the Small Business Administration is doing to resuscitate the economy by helping small businesses .
As voters are starting to grow furious with Bunning , the GOP is beginning to withdraw the support they 've been surreptitiously giving him .
But the two right - wing loons running for Bunning 's seat in Kentucky , Rand Paul and Trey Grayson , have both publicly endorsed his idiocy Late last night Ryan Grim at HuffPo exposed the Republican caucus ' anti-working - family jihad .
Arizona extremist Jon Kyl , second in command at the GOP , who 's been cheering Bunning on from the sidelines , argued that unemployment benefits dissuade people from job - hunting " because people are being paid even though they 're not working .
" This morningpointed out that even some Republicans -- they singled out mainstream conservative Susan Collins of Maine -- were running away from the Bunning disaster as fast as their hind legs could take them .
Collins pointed out that " there are 500 Mainers whose benefits expired on Sunday , " A friend of mine from Auburn , John Lavoie , who was laid off from a great manufacturing job because of criminal trade policies perpetrated by the Bushes and Clinton and crooked corporate - backed congressional scumbags on both sides of the aisle , is far more angry at Bunning than Ms. Collins .
But no one is as angry as New Yorkers
The mistake being made by the media is to buy into the solo gunman theory .
Thisabout a senile and hateful old kook from Kentucky .
It 's about the heart and soul of American conservatism .
I like the way Raúl Grijalva ( D - AZ ) , chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus , framed the issue :
Labels : Jim Bunning , obstructionist Republicans , Raul Grijalva

Some sights still trouble Elena de Villaine .
" Even now , I ca n't bear the sight of snow , " she says .
" For me , snow is blood .
And I think my brother Kyril is the same . "
She is talking about events in her childhood more than 90 years ago , when she and her brother were growing up in St Petersburg in the midst of the Russian revolution .
This month sees the anniversary of Lenin 's return to Russia in 1917 , the event that signaled the beginning of the end for the old regime .
Kyril and Elena are now some of the last people alive who lived through that time and can still remember it in detail .
And , thanks to their family 's position , they had a ringside seat to a revolution .
The two saw Rasputin relaxing in the street , witnessed street battles between Bolshevik and government troops , saw soldiers mutiny against their officers , and survived famine and death threats , before escaping to the West .
I went to visit Kyril Zinovieff at his home in Chiswick , west London .
Now 99 years old and completely blind , he nevertheless looks and talks like a man at least 20 years younger .
He has nearly a full head of white hair , and illustrates each point with emphatic , sweeping hand gestures .
His voice , now slightly hoarse , is a charming mix of 1920s BBC announcer ( he went to an English public school after leaving Russia ) , and the occasional Slavic rolled " r " .
As he can no longer read , he uses cassette tapes and audio books , played with a bulky tape machine which he works by feel .
Along with a self - depreciating sense of humour , he retains a photographic memory of his early childhood .
Elena is also becoming physically frail , but has the same clarity of mind .
When I spoke to her on the phone at her home in rural France , she was happy to be interviewed at length in English : merely her third language , after Russian and French .
" I always thought I 'd probably marry an English man , " she laughs when I ask her about this .
" Although [ in St Petersburg ] we did n't speak English – we spoke French and Russian .
But then I married a French man and came to France . "
Speaking to both of them , there is sense of a lost era of European culture : the same cultured and cosmopolitan Russian elite that produced Tolstoy and Turgenev and later Diaghilev and Nabokov .
Kyril himself went on to be an acclaimed translator of Russian literature into English .
At one point , he tells me : " If there is one book that sums up the world of our childhood , it would be Anna Karenina .
But that does n't matter in the least , now .
It 's all gone for ever . "
In 1917 , it was a world that still existed , albeit precariously .
Kyril was just seven years old , Elena was eight , and they and their siblings were growing up in one of the more powerful families in tsarist Russia .
Their grandfather Alexander Zinovieff had been the governor of St Petersburg .
Their father was a " Marshal of Nobility " .
" A silly title , like being chairman of a county , " Kyril explains , " except , of course , the counties were usually the size of France or Germany . "
All this should have made for an easy , comfortable childhood .
In fact , it marked them out as possible enemies of the revolution once the Bolsheviks came to power .
There were already signs that things were changing .
On one occasion , the two children were walking in a smart area of the city when they saw a carriage stop by the side of the road .
" It had two men in it – they both had rather big beards and very white flashing teeth .
And they were fairly laughing their heads off , " Kyril remembers .
" And so , of course , I asked my nanny , ' Who 's that man ? ' "
He pauses .
" She said , ' Well , that is a man called Rasputin . ' "
A turning point in the fall of the old regime took place outside the family home in St Petersburg .
A military parade was being held near Tsar Nicholas 's former residence , the Winter Palace .
Kyril and Elena remember watching from their nursery window , and seeing the marching suddenly stop .
Then an officer separated himself from the ranks .
Kyril describes peering down at the scene , and wondering what had gone wrong .
" Why are n't they marching ?
Why is he talking to them ?
What 's happening ? "
And then , without warning , the officer dropped to the ground .
Ninety - three years later , Kyril mimes the way the man 's arms flew back as he fell into the snow .
" We realised then , " Elena says , " that the soldiers had begun shooting their officers . "
Sitting with their nurse and their mother , the Zinovieff children watched as the parade turned first into a mutiny , and then into a massacre .
At one point , their nurse unwisely shouted down to the soldiers , and was told in no uncertain terms to keep her head down .
For the young Kyril , this was as shocking as the violence itself .
" I thought , my God , they 're brave !
To speak to my nurse like that !
The whole thing was so extraordinary .
So amazing .
I thought the end of the world had come . "
Elena remembers the effect of the gunfire on the buildings in the street .
" The windows were trembling , some of them were broken , and they were shooting at the Winter Palace .
We could see it !
We could see all the blood that was on the snow . "
That evening , for the first time , they all slept on the floor on mattresses to avoid stray bullets .
As the revolution progressed , supplies of food began to break down , and famine took hold .
At first , wealthy families such as the Zinovieffs were better placed than most to cope .
Kyril describes how peasants from their rural estate would arrive laden with bags of food .
" They would walk there on foot .
It must have been about 40 miles .
And it always the same – dried vegetables .
It was lighter to carry , you see . "
Then that arrangement began to fail , as the revolutionary government tightened its control on private enterprise .
The peasants who had once helped them were arrested : " They were all shot , poor things . "
Eventually , even the Zinovieff children themselves began to suffer from starvation .
Elena remembers the amazed reaction of a doctor who later examined them in England .
" He said to my mother , ' You 'll never be able to get your children healthy again .
With children who have suffered from famine as they have , you wo n't be able to save them . ' "
Telling the story now , she pauses .
" But , as you can see , Kyril is nearly 100 , and I am 100 , so ... "
As well as shortages of food , the early days of the revolution and civil war were marked by arbitrary violence , later known as the Red Terror .
Kyril still sounds amazed at what they lived through during this period .
" Our friends were being killed – that 's what we saw .
Somebody would enter your house and then would murder – murder !
– everybody .
' You are not fit to live – you certainly are not ! '
Bang , bang , bang , and they were killed . "
For Elena , one of the greatest shocks came with an attack on her grandfather , a senior general in the tsarist army .
Seized by a group of Red Guards , he was saved from summary execution when one of his captors recognised him , and allowed him to play dead after a beating .
" They left him like that on the pavement .
He was the one who suffered most – most physically – of all of us . "
Some time later , there was an anonymous phone call about their father , Leo .
" They did n't say hello , they did n't say goodbye .
They just said , ' Leo is on the list . '
That 's all , " Elena explains .
" We knew then that my father was to be shot . "
The family decided to leave that night .
A coachman whose mother had once been helped by the family agreed to smuggle them into Estonia .
He was later executed for helping refugees .
The family 's overweight cook also helped them , and followed them into exile .
" Do n't worry , " Kyril remembers her saying .
" I have such large breasts , you can hide your banknotes under them .
The guards will never be able to lift them . "
For the adults , it must have been a terrifying journey .
But some of the children reacted differently .
Kyril remembers nothing but excitement during the night - time dash to the border .
He was fascinated with the new communist placards and slogans that covered the frontier .
One had a quotation from a poem which he can still quote word for word in Russian : " It means : ' To annoy all the bourgeoisie in the world , we will now set alight a world fire ! ' "
Elena , a little older , understood the danger better .
" I can remember it all very well .
We were woken up in the middle of the night , and we were dressed to go away .
I had a sort of a trembling fit – I trembled like anything ! "
They made it to Estonia , but they were among the last to do so by that route .
The next day , the border crossing was closed .
The family lived for some time on their estates in Estonia , before eventually settling in London .
Kyril 's first impressions of coming to Britain in 1918 are vivid .
" I 'll never forget how garden - like London was .
This vast number of trees and parks , you know ?
And it was so warm .
April ...
April in St Petersburg , you needed a dozen coats to go out .
And then suddenly this warmth .
This sun all the time ...
Well , it was n't winter any longer . "
It was a more modest and middle - class , but safer , life than they had been used to .
In St Petersburg , the family had had their own box at the ballet , with butlers serving dinner in the interval .
In London , in the 1920s , Kyril watched his favourite Russian ballerinas from the gallery at Sadler 's Wells .
" Of course , there was no box to go to , so it was different .
Yes , it was different ... "
He trails off for a second .
" But , still .
I enjoyed it very much , very much indeed . "
He , Elena and other White Russians of their generation were young enough to make new lives in the West .
Kyril married an English woman , took British citizenship and worked for the Foreign Office .
In the run-up to the Second World War , he was one of the Foreign Office staff in Prague when Hitler invaded Czechoslovakia .
Elena grew up in London and moved to France to live with her husband .
I ask if she now feels at all Russian .
The question has her dancing back and forth between different answers .
" No , I 'm French !
But ... I 'm Russian , yes I 'm Russian .
But French also .
But somehow ... somehow ... one never feels differently than Russian . "
The full results of India 's national census will be released in mid-2011 India is launching a new census in which every person aged over 15 will be photographed and fingerprinted to create a biometric national database .
The government will then use the information to issue identity cards .
Officials will spend a year classifying India 's population of around 1.2 billion people according to gender , religion , occupation and education .
The exercise , conducted every 10 years , faces big challenges , not least India 's vast area and diversity of cultures .
Census officials must also contend with high levels of illiteracy and millions of homeless people - as well as insurgencies by Maoists and other rebels which have left large parts of the country unsafe .
President Pratibha Patil was the first person to be listed , and appealed to fellow Indians to follow her example " for the good of the nation " .
" Everyone must participate and make it successful , " she said in Delhi . ' Unstoppable '
This is India 's 15th census and the first time a biometric element has been included .
Current population : 1,139,965,000 ( 2008 ) Fifteenth national census since 1872 " House listing " begins on 1 April Physical count of residents takes place from 9 to 28 February 2011 Every person above the age of 15 to be photographed , fingerprinted and given 16 - digit identity number ; new National Population Register Full census results in mid-2011
" India has been conducting a national census since 1872 , " the man leading the exercise C Chandramouli told the AFP news agency .
" Nothing - floods , droughts , even wars - has been able to stop it .
" The trick is to get things right the first time .
There is no question of a re-census . "
Over the next year , some 2.5 million census officials will visit households in more than 7,000 towns and 600,000 villages .
The officials , many of them teachers and local officials , will first begin the process of house listing - which records information on homes .
This count will , for the first time , also attempt to gather information on the use of the internet and the availability of drinking water and toilets in households .

The physical count of residents will take place from 9 - 28 February 2011 .
The mammoth registration exercise will stretch over 11 months , consume more than 11 million tonnes of paper , and cost 60bn rupees ( $ 1.3bn ; £ 880 m ) .
India 's Home Minister , P Chidambaram , has described the process as the biggest of its kind in human history .
" An exercise of this kind has not been attempted anywhere else in the world , " he told reporters in the capital .
SOUTIK BISWAS'S INDIA Although China may have the biggest head count in the world , India carries out the most comprehensive census , say demographers
Read Soutik 's blog
The national census is the only source of primary and credible data in India and is used not just to formulate government policies but also by private companies to identify markets for their products , says the BBC's Sanjoy Majumder in Delhi .
The first 16 - digit identity numbers are due to be issued starting in November .
The full census results will be released in mid-2011 .
The collation of biometric information on a national database raises questions about possible infringement of civil liberties in the future .
BBC correspondents say many Indians support the new ID cards , believing they will make it easier to receive help and benefits from the state and remove the current need for multiple personal documents .
I think it is good that we are creating the national database of all our citizens .
This will help maintain law and order , minimise crimes and help in locating people responsible for crimes .
This will also ensure government benefits reach everybody and we will know who is left out .
It will help individuals in getting house or land registrations , opening bank accounts and getting employment easier .
These things usually take a lot of time because of background checks and the numerous documents required .
I think this is a great job that the government is doing .
Sandeep Singh , Bangalore , India
It 's high time we kept up with technology .
US citizens have a social security number .
We also need a database of all citizens living in this country .
I am sure it will be worth the time and money spent .
Javs , Mumbai , India I feel very uncomfortable about this fingerprinting and face - photographing exercise .
Tomorrow they may ask each one of us to have a chip , so that " they " can always know where we are .
Whatever happened to freedom and liberty ?
But given the terror attacks that have already happened in India we , the sheep , will willingly undergo this national haircut !
Kailash , Chandigarh
It sounds like a good initiative as it will help people in remote and underprivileged areas to come in direct contact with government policies made for them - until now the government has been dependent on corrupt local bodies .
The influx of people from villages to towns and from towns to big cities can be checked more efficiently and measures can be taken accordingly .
But the data should be treated as extremely confidential and should not be used for profit - making activities .
Faizan , New Delhi Issuing unique ID numbers to all citizens as a part of biometric census is overdue .
It will greatly improve tax collection .
It will check corruption as well as loopholes in implementing social welfare measures in India .
Due to these reasons all society conscious people are eagerly awaiting the results .
In no way will the biometric national database infringe on people 's civil rights .
I think this project will itself bring the Congress Party into power again in next elections .
Sambasiva Rao Gogineni , Vijayawada , India I support the process .
It is important .
It will result in less corruption .
It will benefit all law - abiding people .
K.Venkataraman , New Delhi , India Some infringement of rights notwithstanding , this exercise will go a long way in improving the internal security of the country .
It will bring the entire 1.2 billion population of India under one database .
Hats off , a mammoth exercise for a gigantic country .
Wishing all the best to the officials conducting it !
Anubhav Saxena , Mumbai India

A quick comparison of Florida 's primary statistics between the past two NHL seasons understandably highlights yet one more cause for pain and doubt among fans ; in almost every major category ( including such heavyweights as wins , points , goals per game , power play , and penalty killing , to name but a few ) the Panthers regressed .
Like that 's news to any of us .
It was n't all bad , though .
Look a bit deeper and several minor silver linings can be located amongst the wreckage .
Sorting through numbers collected from the Cats ' 2008 -09 and 2009 - 10 seasons ( via NHL.com , which is not allowing for a direct link to FLA 's stats .
Apologies . ) , a few positives were found ; obviously not enough to trend an overall improvement for the club , but fascinating no less .
In the " Real Time " statistical category , numbers suggest Florida actually made progress in a small variety of areas from Year One to Year Two of the DeBoer Era .
Among the rather surprising positives :
HITS : up from 1562 to 1810
from 1562 to 1810 BLOCKED SHOTS : up from 1105 to 1403
from 1105 to 1403 MISSED SHOTS : down from 910 to 897
from 910 to 897 GIVEAWAYS : down from 602 to 512
from 602 to 512 TAKEAWAYS : up from 494 to 514
from 494 to 514 FACEOFFS : winning % up from 47.9 to 49.9
Granted , goal scoring was predictably down this season ( 202 , from 231 in 08-09 ) , effectively negating these improvements .
But still , it 's something ...
The challenge for next year is in building on this foundation while ratcheting up the offense .
Too much to ask from this lineup ... or this coaching staff ?
Are we seeing buried in the numbers a commitment from the players to Peter DeBoer 's strategy , which was wobbly at best a year ago ?

Creative artist , Peter Root , showcases his latest project , a city model created only out of stacked staples .
Named “ Ephemicropolis “ , Root ’s staple model , depicts a fragile micro city that could collapse at the slightest wind blow or vibration .
He used over 100,000 staples , for this project , and spent 40 hours stacking them .
Some of the staple skyscrapers of Ephemicropolis are up to 12 cm tall , while some of the smaller buildings are represented by a single staple .
The city covers a floor surface of 6 m x 3 m .
Ephemicropolis is n’t the first time Peter Root has chosen staples as his art medium , but it is his largest staple project , yet .

Gay marriage law comes into effect in Mexico City
Judith Vazquez and Lol - kin Castaneda hope to marry soon A law allowing gay and lesbian couples to marry comes into effect on Thursday in Mexico City .
The law , which was passed by the city 's local assembly in December , gives gay people full marital rights , including the right to adopt .
Several gay couples are now expected to register to get married as early as next week .
Mexico City is one of the first capitals in Latin America to fully recognise gay marriages .
Judith Vazquez and partner Lol - kin Castaneda hope to become one of the first couples to marry under the new law .
Please turn on JavaScript .

" It 's the end of our fight and the beginning of life in freedom in Mexico City , " Ms Vazquez told the BBC .
" This is a great , historic moment for the whole of society in Mexico City , " added Ms Castaneda .
' Symbolic closet '
With this law - and previous legalisation on abortion and some form of euthanasia - the Mexican capital has become a liberal and progressive island in what remains a mostly conservative nation , says the BBC 's Julian Miglierini in Mexico City .
But local gay activists say homophobic attacks are still frequent across the country , where people continue to face discrimination in the workplace for being gay or are attacked when displaying public affection to a person of the same sex , our correspondent adds .
Both the Catholic Church and conservative groups oppose the legislation , and the centre - right government even tried to get a ruling by the Supreme Court to block Mexico City from issuing gay marriage licences ; they have so far been unsuccessful .
Despite the move in the capital , a gay marriage law at a federal level in Mexico remains unlikely .
Judith Vazquez says : " Our real battle is with our people in Mexico ...
Now we will have to leave our symbolic closet because we will be [ considered ] citizens and we have to go out to live in freedom . "
In Latin America , only Uruguay has legalised civil unions nationwide and allowed same - sex couples to adopt children .
A handful of cities - in Argentina , Ecuador and Colombia - allow gay unions .

The bill has sharply divided the American public A package of amendments to the landmark US healthcare reform law , which extends coverage to 32 million more Americans , has passed its final Congress vote .
The US House of Representatives backed amendments by 220 votes to 207 .
The vote was needed after a number of Republican objections .
The Senate earlier voted for the package by 56 - 43 .
Two points , which Democrats say are minor , were deleted .
President Barack Obama has already signed the main bill into law .
He will now be able to apply a final signature , which is expected within days .

The BBC's Richard Lister in Washington says that in recent days Democrats have begun to seize back control of the healthcare argument , and opinion polls suggest that more Americans now believe this reform is a good idea .
However , he says , Republicans are threatening to reform or repeal this legislation should they gain control in the mid-term elections in November .
On Thursday , President Obama responded to that challenge , saying : " I welcome that fight . "
He was speaking during a visit to Iowa , as he embarked on a campaign to sell the new programme to the American public .
Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said : " Republicans ... will continue to fight until this bill is repealed and replaced with commonsense ideas that solve our problems without dismantling the healthcare system we have and without burying the American dream under a mountain of debt . "
' Serious threats '
Mr Obama signed the healthcare bill into law without delay after the previous House vote on Sunday , as he did not need to wait for the Senate and House votes on Thursday .
Those votes were on amendments submitted under a process known as budget reconciliation .
The amendments have to relate to budgetary rather than policy issues .
On Wednesday , Senate Republicans submitted 30 amendments - which were all rejected by Democrats during a marathon overnight voting session .
However , Senate parliamentarian Alan Frumin upheld two Republican challenges on points of order under budget reconciliation rules , Senate Democratic aides said .
Jim Manley , spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , said : " After hours of trying to find a way to block this , they ( Republicans ) found two relatively minor provisions that are violations of Senate procedure which means we 're going to have to send it back to the House . "
The House vote brought an end to a process the president had labelled " a year of debate and a century of trying " .
After Sunday 's vote , some supporters of the bill had received threats and abusive messages , prompting them to call police and the FBI .
Democratic House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said more than 10 Democratic politicians had reported incidents some of which he described as " very serious " .
Republicans accused Democrats of playing politics with the threats .
" By ratcheting up the rhetoric , some will only inflame these situations to dangerous levels .
Enough is enough .
It has to stop , " said House Republican Whip Eric Cantor .
Two Republican politicians have said they too were threatened .

A reforma do Cristo O Rio ganhou de volta nesta quarta - feira , 30 , totalmente reformada , a estátua do Cristo Redentor .
Foram quatro meses de obras para a reposição dos mosaicos de pedra- sabão , drenagem de 300 litros de água e reparo de pequenas rachaduras na estátua e rejunte .
Foi a maior reforma já feita na estátua , que tem mais de 30 metros de altura .
Prestas a completar 80 anos , o monumento também apresentava infiltrações .
O acesso continua sendo um problema .
O trenzinho que parte do Cosme Velho continua parado , e o acesso de carro segue restrito a táxis e vans , ainda por causa dos estragos da chuva de abril .
Segundo a administração do Parque Nacional da Tijuca , onde está localizado o monumento , o Cristo Redentor recebe por ano uma média de 1,8 milhão de turistas .
Confira as imagens durante e após a reforma .

First of all the GOP Primary Challengers :
Manfred Shreyer
At first glance this guy seems like a Tea Bagger .
Hopefully this guy will force Boehner even farther right through some sort of contest of conservative purity .
This is the only link I have found so please post any links you find below .
Especially if you find a donation link .
I am sending this guy $ 20 .
Tom McMasters
This guy seems like a Tea Bagger as well .
The only evidence I can find of his campaign are some comments he made in response to a Journal news article that I linked to above .
Again , if you find any info on this guy post it in the comments .
I want to give him $ 20 as well .
There is nothing like a little money coming in to keep you running .
I hope both of these guys go after Boehner hammer and tong .
They have plenty to bloody him up with .
Finally I would like this guy , Justin Coussoule , to win .
He at least has a website with a place to donate .
He is running as a Democrat , and he uses the word " progressive . "
Yea !!!
This is all the info I have on him but this article has a nice run down of the Ohio - 8 election scenario .
If you send this guy some bucks remember to add the .01 so we can tell him where it came from .
I actually thought Boehner was going to run unopposed this cycle .
With Obama 's election we made huge GOTV gains in Ohio - 8 .
I hope we can still capitalize on these gains and dump Boehner .
While watching last night 's V episode , something sort of clicked into place for me , about why the new series just is n't quite working : our heroes are creating a resistance group , rather than a public - relations campaign .
Seriously , twice during last night 's episode , someone asked a really simple question : " Name one bad thing the Visitors have done since they got here . "
And both times , Erica looked like she 'd just been asked the capital of Lithuania .
This should n't be a hard question to answer — and yes , I know that Tyler has the fancy jacket with the spy camera in it , and she does n't want to tip her hand .
But still .
Dude .
Advertisement
And meanwhile , you get Ryan telling his girlfriend Valerie that the Visitors are everywhere , and they 've infiltrated the police , the government , the phone company , the pizza company , etc. etc .
( Which makes me wonder :
When was the last time we actually saw this instead of being told it ?
I know that Erica 's partner was a V infiltrator , but has there been anybody since then ? )
And so they do n't know who they can trust , and the Vs have a secret advantage .
Okay , sure .
So the part I do n't get is ... why run a resistance campaign ?
If you 're fighting against people whose two main weapons are a PR offensive and secrecy , why not fight them by exposing their secrets to the world ?
Advertisement
You run a resistance against a successful invasion — which this is n't ... yet , anyway .
You run a resistance against a government that 's turned despotic .
You do not run a resistance movement against people who claim to come in peace but are actually up to something nefarious but nebulous .
It 's the wrong set of tactics .
Blowing shit up and killing people is not going to win the PR war .
The alien leader , Anna , knows this — which is why she 's been moderately careful to avoid slaughtering humans when there are witnesses or TV cameras nearby .
She 's obsessed with getting Chad Decker to be her media slutmonkey , and even when she sends her supersoldier to hunt down Ryan and Valerie , she 's canny enough to have a cleanup crew on standby to eliminate any damage .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
So are we supposed to be scratching our heads and wondering why the resistance is so inept ?
As various people have pointed out , the resistance members have had dead or injured Visitors on their hands several times , and they 've never thought to un -skin them in front of a handy television camera .
But it goes beyond that — the resistance does n't have any plan or idea for changing public opinion .
Instead , it 's a " dogfight , " as Ryan puts it .
Advertisement
And it 's obvious why the show is doing this — it wants to ask questions about terrorism and torture and what tactics are too extreme .
In the preview for next week 's episode , the Necessary Evil guy with the beard , who 's so boring I can't be bothered to look up his name , even says " We 're terrorists now . "
Just in case you missed it .
You know the interesting thing about terrorists ?
They cause terror .
It 's even in their name .
The main reason you employ terrorism is to intimidate the civilian population of a democracy .
Last time I checked , Erica and her friends were not trying to strike fear into the people of the United States .
And trying to strike fear into Anna and her people , who are safely on their motherships , seems like a bit of a waste of time .
Advertisement
As for the torture thing , it feels weirdly shoehorned into an episode that did n't need it — that random captive guy is just there so that Erica , Father Jack and Beardy McEvil can grope the dilemma .
Oh sure , captive guy has the address of the Fifth Column member that Ryan has gone into hiding with — because Ryan did n't trust Erica with that information , but it was on a hard drive which captive guy stole , and Ryan was dumb enough to tell Erica the last name of the people he did n't want her knowing about .
And they have to torture captive guy so that they can magically transport themselves from Manhattan to Nyack so they can shoot the " V soldier " in the nick of time , television episode - style , and save Valerie and the hybrid baby .
It all makes perfect sense .
Advertisement
So this episode did logical gymnastics just to set up a plot where we ask , " Is torture justified ? "
And the answer ?
I have no clue .
Yes , I guess .
Torture is justified , but only if it's from the Inquisition , because that ties in with Father Jack being Catholic .
I feel like there are two problems with this show 's approach to the whole terrorism / torture thing :
1 ) It does n't make sense , given that they 're not fighting an occupying force or their own government .
See above .
Advertisement
2 ) It 's not 2005 , and we 're not as obsessed with Abu Ghraib as we were five years ago .
This stuff worked when BSG did it , partly because it was a different era .
Plus , BSG did it first .
Also , it helps to have actual moral complexity , rather than fake complexity .
I 'm going to say something I never thought I would say about a television series :
This show is trying too hard to be like Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles .
Advertisement
Regular readers of this site will know that I have a fervent admiration for T:SCC , despite some uneven episodes , and dearly wish it was still on the air .
I would brave the Nasty Catholic Fork Of Neck Pain to be recapping an episode of T:SCC instead of V right now .
But I feel like V is borrowing a lot of stuff from T:SCC , and not in a good way .
V's writing staff includes T:SCC veterans Natalie Chaidez and John Wirth , and in fact Wirth co-wrote last night 's episode .
But stuff worked in Sarah Connor Chronicles that I do n't think is working here .
For one thing , Sarah Connor took place in a world where almost nobody believed there were robots from the future trying to kill people .
In V , everybody believes there are aliens from outer space in our midst — so the kind of paranoid " resistance cell " thing that worked so well in Sarah Connor just does n't work here .
It just seems genuinely nutty and counter - intuitive , for reasons I mentioned above .
The Visitors want secrecy , so give them the opposite .
Advertisement
And then there 's Tyler , Erica 's son , who is reminding me uncomfortably of the moments when I could n't quite get into Thomas Dekker 's portrayal of John Connor .
He 's doing the same bratty " rebelling against his mom " thing , with the same floppy hairdo and weird jaw acting .
The difference is , John Connor is John Connor — we know he 's going to grow up to be a legend , and we also know that he's on our side and when the chips are down , he 's going to set aside his drama and do the right thing .
With Tyler , we only know he 's vaguely " special , " and his destiny seems to be to become infinitely more annoying every time he 's on screen .
Oh , and as commenter Honu_Harry points out , the " Soldier V " is basically a Terminator .
Advertisement
I can't believe I 'm asking for a show to be less like Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles , not to mention less like the best parts of Battlestar Galactica .
But I am .
This show needs to find its own identity , and a storyline that actually makes use of the " they 've infiltrated the government , and they 're smarter at manipulating the media than we are " thing .
I 'm not even going to get into the thing where Anna says Ryan and Valerie 's hybrid baby is dangerous because it can feel love .
I do n't even know what to say about that .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama will offer changes to his healthcare overhaul this week , the White House said on Monday , and a leading Democrat said the president was preparing a smaller version of his broad bid to revamp the $ 2.5 trillion industry .
President Barack Obama pauses as he gives a statement outside of the Oval Office of the White House in Washington February 27 , 2010 .
REUTERS / Yuri Gripas
After a healthcare “ summit ” last week failed to win Republican converts , Obama and his fellow Democrats have been expected to launch a final push for an overhaul using a process known as reconciliation to get the measure through the Senate without opposition support .
“ The president will speak on this later in the week , likely on Wednesday , ” said White House spokesman Robert Gibbs .
“ He ’ll discuss process and policy . ”
Nancy Pelosi , the speaker of the House of Representatives , said Obama would soon propose a healthcare bill “ much smaller ” than either the bill passed by the House or the one passed by the Senate .
With virtually no Republican votes , Democrats in the Senate and House approved the bills last year to reshape healthcare by cutting costs , regulating insurers and expanding coverage to tens of millions of Americans who now lack it .
But efforts to merge the two measures and send a final version for Obama to sign into law collapsed in January after Democrats lost their crucial 60th Senate vote in a special election in Massachusetts .
“ In a matter of days , we will have a proposal , ” Pelosi said during an event in Denver , according to Fox News .
“ It will be a much smaller proposal than we had in the House bill , because that ’s where we can gain consensus .
But it will be big enough to put us on a path of affordable , quality healthcare for all Americans that holds insurance companies accountable . ”
CAN WASHINGTON ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING ?
The push for a healthcare overhaul is seen as politically risky for both Republicans and Democrats , before congressional elections in November in which more than one third of the Senate and every seat in the House will be up for grabs .
With the public focused on an unemployment rate hovering just below 10 percent , some Americans consider the healthcare push an unwelcome distraction from the economy .
But failure to do anything to control skyrocketing costs or ease the plight of the tens of millions of Americans without insurance coverage could add to the perception that Washington is too wrapped up in partisanship and pleasing special interests to do anything meaningful to help voters .
A healthcare revamp received some support on Monday from investor Warren Buffett , the world ’s second richest man , who said the country badly needed a change .
But he said he would prefer a program focused on out - of - control costs .
“ It ’s like a tapeworm eating at our economic body , ” Buffett said on CNBC television .
“ If it was a choice today between Plan A , which is what we ’ve got , or Plan B , which is the Senate bill , I would vote for the Senate bill , ” he said .
“ But I would much rather see a Plan C that really attacks costs , and I think that ’s what the American public wants to see . ”
Rising costs , Buffett said , are holding back an economy that faced an “ economic Pearl Harbor ” in late 2008 when capital markets seized up .
Republicans insist that Obama should scrap the existing healthcare plans and start over .
They condemn any talk of reconciliation , which would allow the Democrats to pass a healthcare plan in the Senate -- where they control 59 seats -- with a simple majority of 51 votes .
The White House says Obama ’s healthcare plans include many Republican ideas , and that Republicans have used reconciliation to pass many sweeping pieces of legislation -- including major tax cuts -- when they held Senate majorities .
So today ’s Human Rights Campaign rally in D.C. , happening right now after the Senate Armed Services Committee hearings wrapped , was supposed to be a feel good event with Kathy Griffin .
Then Lt. Dan Choi bounded on to the stage after Griffin , told her that Do n’t Ask Don’t Tell is not a joke , and says he ’s going to the White House to , uh , chain himself to the fence to protest the law that might get him kicked out of the military .
Tweets reporter Kerry Eleveld : “ This does not sound like it was part of the HRC script . ”
Maybe not but it was certainly planned : “ According to this source , who is close to Lt. Choi , a number of people tried to talk him out of his plan .
With the repeal underway and the study going full throttle , it is a delicate time in the repeal of DADT .
This means that anything that could be seen as being problematic or aggrandizing or taking this issue less than seriously could bolster the position of those in opposition to the MREA and make passage that much more difficult . ”
UPDATE : Photos and video below .
Indeed , as Choi ’s march to the White House proceeds ( as we ’re typing this ) , this does not appear to be part of HRC ’s official plan .
Choi “ essentially asked Joe Solmonese to go with him , ” tweets Eleveld .
There are also fliers being handed out ( meaning they were printed ahead of time ) with instructions to follow Choi to the White House .
More from Americablog ‘s Joe Sudbay : “ Lieut .
Dan choi heads to white house to fight for #dadt .
Griffin and HRC ’s Solmonese stay for photo ops .
Welcome to gay dc . ”
And : “ Dan Choi speaking in front of white house .
No kathy griffin .
She blew him off . ”
More : Choi is with Capt. Jim Pietrangelo , who ( unsuccessfully ) tried taking his legal challenge of DADT to the Supreme Court .
DC Agenda tweets : “ Secret Service is pushing everyone away from the White House fence and to the street . ”
Kathy Griffin is here to film an episode of My Life on the D - List ; are her cameras really not catching this ?
HAPPENING NOW : Choi has cuffed himself to fence .
“ Dan Choi still has both arms chained to the White House fence .
He ’s standing there stoically and silently .
…
Police are not attempting to disperse the crowd at this time .
We believe about 20 Secret Service agents are now on scene . ” ( via ) JOINING IN : “ Captain Jim Pietrangelo has also chained himself against the white house fence ” in front of crowd of 50 , now down to 30 . ( via )
FIRST ARREST ?
“ Robin McGehee of @GetEQUAL just arrested for “ disorderly conduct ” for helping Dan Choi cuff himself to the White House . ” ( via ) Robin tweeted earlier : “ Just told @JoeSolomonese to tell the President that the crazy ass mother from Fresno wo n’t leave . ”
See photos at right .
TWITTER BACKLASH BEGINS : Zach Oldham tweets : “ memo to Lt Choi , et al : Obama does n’t really care about you .
move along & be patient–he may have use for you in 2012 . ”
HRC BACKLASH BEGINS : “ Sick of hearing abt @LtDanChoi and # DADT .
If anyone should be arrested over failure to repeal # DADT , it ’s Joe Solmonese & # HRC . ” ( via )
PRAYER : “ One female woman is kneeling in the crowd with hands raised , praying for the souls of gay people . ” ( via )
CROWDS CLEARING : “ Police just warned that all must leave the sidewalk in front of White House or be arrested .
Choi & Pietrangelo are only two remaining . ” ( via )
INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE : “ Gibbs finally asked about Choi ’s #DADT protest , says WH got no heads up & there were no plans for the President to meet with him . ” ( via )

PRESS RELEASE : PR firm Sunshine & Sachs already blast press release :
Discharged U.S. Army Lieutenant Walked to the White House Demanding Full Equality and Gay Rights Openly Gay Lt. Dan Choi Urged President Obama to Take Action Against Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell WASHINGTON , D.C. – After participating in the Human Rights Campaign march on Freedom Plaza Thursday afternoon , former United States Army Lieutenant Dan Choi made a public statement and marched over to the White House to demand the Obama administration take a firm stance in repealing Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell .
Joined by former U.S. Captain Jim Pietrangelo , honorably discharged in 2004 under Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell , Lt. Choi made a public call to action in front of the White House .
Their actions are a result of a general unrest among the LGBT community after Congressman Barney Frank confirmed this week that the White House has been “ ambiguous ” about repealing Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell this year .
The following statement was read by Lt. Choi outside Freedom Plaza before he set off to the White House : “ Hello .
My name is Lt. Dan Choi .
I am being discharged from the US Army because I am gay and dared to say it out loud .
Today , I am here on a mission with Capt .
Jim Pietrangelo , and we are asking you all to join us .
We ’re calling you to action because we are at a turning point — a moment in time where talk is no longer enough , and action is required .
Equality is not going to happen by itself .
You have been told that the President has a plan .
But Congressman Barney Frank confirmed to us this week that the President still is not fully committed to repealing Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell this year .
And if we do n’t seize this moment it may not happen for a very long time .
Some may tell you that I am one of the lucky ones .
I have been welcomed back by my unit with open arms .
And it would be easy for me to stay quiet and hope that change will happen .
But what I was taught at West Point and learned in war is — hope is not a strategy .
As officers , James and I both find it a dereliction of our moral duty to remain silent while thousands of our brothers and sister are not allowed to serve openly and honestly .
Capt .
Pietrangelo was honorably discharged under Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell in 2004 and I will be subject to the same shortly .
As officers we are here today fighting for those in the ranks , and we need our Commander in Chief to do the same .
Our fight is not here at Freedom Plaza , it is at the White House .
We are walking to the White House right now to send the President a message .
So …take out your cell phones and your cameras .
Document this moment .
Join us as together — we make history . ”

Terrain Model of Mars ' Mojave Crater
› Larger image
A digital terrain model generated from a stereo pair of images provides this synthesized , oblique view of a portion of the wall terraces of Mojave Crater in the Xanthe Terra region of Mars .
This view ( above ) , in which the vertical dimension is exaggerated three - fold compared with horizontal dimensions , shows the ponding of material backed up behind massive wall - terrace blocks of bedrock .
Hundreds of impact craters on Mars have similarly ponded features with pitted surfaces .
These " pitted ponds " are thought to result when material melted by the crater - causing impacts is captured behind the wall terraces .
Mojave Crater is approximately 60 kilometers ( 37 miles ) in diameter , centered at 327.0 degrees east latitude , 7.5 degrees north latitude .
The portion of its northwestern edge shown here spans about 3.5 kilometers ( about 2.5 miles ) in width halfway between the bottom and top of the image .
The above view is toward the north .
Mojave is one of the freshest large craters on Mars .
A survey of its features indicates very few overprinting craters on them , and an analysis of that infrequency suggests the crater may be as young as about 10 million years , very young for a crater of this size .
The depth of the crater -- about 2.6 kilometers ( 1.6 miles ) -- also demonstrates that Mojave has experienced little infilling or erosion .
Mojave gives us a glimpse of what a very large complex crater looks like on Mars .
In a sense , it is a " Rosetta Stone " of craters , given that it 's so fresh and most others - especially this size - have been affected by erosion , sedimentary infilling and overprinting by other geologic processes .
Such fresh craters give insight into the impact process : ejecta , melt - generation , deposition , etc .
Mojave 's fans and channels , as seen in the main image and Figure 1 are most intriguing .
They hint that impacts such as Mojave 's may have unleashed water or water - ice from the subsurface to flow across the surface and , perhaps , condense as rain or snow for a brief period of Martian time .
This further suggests that early climate on Mars could have been heavily influenced by the intense bombardment about 3.9 billion years ago when impacts creating craters Mojave 's size and far larger were more common .
The digital terrain model yielding this view combines data from a pair of images taken by the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment ( HiRISE ) camera on NASA 's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter .
The model provides detailed topographical information for for an area covering portions of the crater 's northwestern wall terraces , rim and ejecta blanket .
Such digital terrain models are superior to standard stereo images viewed with blue - red glasses , which show only relative changes in elevation instead of absolute numerical data .
Digital terrain models can be used for rendering perspective views from any angle or even fly - by movies .
More importantly , they can be used for detailed quantitative analysis , such as profiles , slopes , morphometry , numeric modeling , etc .
Figures 2 and 3 show the whole area included in this model -- about 5 kilometers ( 3 miles ) wide and four times that in length .
Figure 2 is viewed from the southeast and highlights the the crater interior .
Figure 3 is viewed from the northwest and highlights the crater rim and ejecta blanket .
The HiRISE observations used for generating this digital terrain model are PSP_001481_1875 , taken on Nov. 19 , 2006 , and PSP_002167_1880 , taken on Jan. 12 , 2007 .
Figure 4 shows how the imaged area fits into a larger view of Mojave Crater .

Mr. Brown did not respond to interview requests .
The February filings to the Federal Election Commission show that the Republican committee spent $ 17,500 on travel by private jet , in addition to about $ 15,000 on limousines .
The report also listed several hotel charges ranging in the thousands of dollars , including the W Hotel in Washington ( $ 15,000 ) , the Beverly Hills Hotel ( $ 9,000 ) and the Four Seasons in Philadelphia ( $ 7,000 ) .
Mr. Heye said the expenses were simply the cost of doing business and raising money .
He said that Mr. Steele ’s travel was “ overwhelmingly on commercial airlines — that is the standard mode . ”
But he added , “ There are times when there is a route that does n’t exist . ”
When Mr. Steele took over the committee last year , it had $ 22 million in cash on hand .
This month , records show , that amount is $ 9.46 million .
In a radio interview earlier this year , Mr. Steele brushed aside criticism of the party ’s spending , as well as assertions that some contributors had stopped donating or lowered their contributions .
Mr. Steele told KTRS radio in St. Louis : “ I am in this chair .
If they want it , take it from me .
Until then , shut up , step back and get in the game and help us win . ”
A New York Times review of the Democratic National Committee spending in the month of February found that the party spent about $ 11,000 on car services and limousines , with the largest expense being $ 9,800 for a private car service in Dallas .
Other expenditures included a $ 32,000 bill at the Capital Skyline Hotel in Washington , for what party officials said was a weeklong staff retreat , and $ 256,000 on catering and equipment rental at the Washington Hilton for the winter meeting of the Democratic National Committee .
The Democratic National Committee seized on the Republican financial report on Monday .
A spokesman for the party , Brad Woodhouse , said : “ If limos , chartered aircraft and sex clubs are where they think their donors ’ money should be spent , who are we to judge ? ”

Sure , we all hate suburban sprawl , right ?
" Wrong . "
So says libertarian John Stossel as he attempts to debunk the sprawl - is - bad argument in his Myths , Lies and Nasty Behavior series on ABC .
" Should everyone have to live the way I do ? " he asks .
He likes his apartment , but it 's not for everyone .
He also says the idea that open space is disappearing in America is " a total myth , " and reproaches anti-sprawl " busybodies " for dictating how and where people should live .
Liberals are predictably debunking his debunking .
More surprising is Austin Bramwell of the American Conservative , who offered one of the first and most thorough rebuttals .
This Has Been Debunked ' about 100 Times ' " If Stossel wants to to expand Americans ' lifestyle choices , he should attack the very thing he was defending , " says Austin Bramwell : " For the 101st time : sprawl - - an umbrella term for the pattern of development seen virtually everywhere in the United States -- is not caused by the free market . "
Instead , government regulations , zoning laws , building codes , and street design regulations actually " mandate " it .
Bramwell is perplexed : " You would think that libertarians would instinctively grasp the deeply statist nature of suburban development . "
Agreed : ' Walkable Urbanism Is Illegal in Most of the Country ' Matthew Yglesias takes as his text the zoning regulations of a Phoenix suburb :
If you want to build a mult - family structure in those places , you can't .
If you find yourself an R2 zone you can , but it can only be a two family structure .
Also your building can't be taller than 40 feet , " There shall be a front yard having a depth of not less than 20 feet , " the year yard needs to be 25 feet , and the side yard needs to be at least 5 feet .
On average , buildings can only occupy at most 50 percent of the lot .
And there have to be two parking spaces per dwelling unit .
And you can go so on and so forth throughout the whole thing .
The point , however , is that walkable urbanism is illegal in most of the county .
This Is n't Really a Libertarian Objection " John Stossel , like a lot of self - described libertarians , is n't so much ' libertarian ' as he is an anti-liberal , " theorizes blogger Jamelle at United States of Jamerica .
Across the blogosphere at Unqualified Offerings , Jim Henley agrees , though phrases it differently : " anti-anti - sprawl libertarianism will exist so long as there are libertarians who hate hippies more than they hate central planning -- which is to say , it will exist for a long time . "

WASHINGTON —
The plutonium that is the key ingredient in thousands of nuclear weapons sidelined in the new arms control treaty between the United States and Russia is likely to be around for decades at least , according to experts .
They say the process for destroying plutonium has not yet started to whittle down the surplus already created by previous agreements .
Plutonium can be consumed in nuclear power reactors , creating the possibility of a swords - to - plowshares conversion that would have the added benefit of making redeployment of the weapons impossible .
But converting the weapons plutonium for civilian reactor use has proved much slower than expected .
Since the late 1990s , the United States has been trying to build a factory at the Savannah River Site , near Aiken , S.C. , that would convert the plutonium to reactor fuel .
Government officials once hoped that such fuel could be loaded into reactors in 2002 .
But construction did not begin until 2007 and even if all goes well , the plant will not be finished until 2016 .
The cost of the plant , once estimated at $ 2.3 billion , is now $ 4.8 billion .
The plant is the largest nuclear construction project in the country .
The plan is to use the amount already declared surplus , 34 tons , over about 15 years , so if the new arms agreement results in more plutonium being declared surplus , it would not start to be converted to fuel until the 2030s , at the earliest , people involved in the project say .

The Law Offices of Richard I. Fine & Associates ( richardfinelaw.com ) web site says he established the firm in 1974 .
His credentials include a Doctor of Law from the University of Chicago , a Ph.D in International Law from the London School of Economics , a Certificate from the Hague Academy of International Law , among his many other awards , including Lawyer of the Decades 1976 - 2006 .
He 's also been widely published in legal journals with regard to antitrust , comparative and international law .
Fine 's resume is long and impressive .
Before entering private practice , he " founded and was chief of the first municipal antitrust division in the United States , for the City of Los Angeles . "
He was also Special Counsel to the Government Efficiency Committee of the LA City Council , and a member of the US Department of Justice Antitrust Division .
In addition , he practiced law in London and with another firm before establishing his own .
He was also Norway 's Southern California Consul General .
Background on Fine's Case
Detailed information can be found on Home ( Free Richard fine ) ....( sites.google.com/site/freerichardfine /Home ) , established by his friends and associates seeking justice in return for Fine 's years of public service as a taxpayer - advocate attorney .
From the early 1990s until his illegal disbarment and March 4 , 2009 jailing , Fine challenged and corrected state corruption , returning about " $ 350 million to California taxpayers which state , county and municipal governments ( unlawfully took from ) ' special funds ' and ' trust funds ' in a series of taxpayer cases filed in federal " and state courts , specifically :
-- $ 6 million returned to the Tidelands Trust Fund ( TTF ) in Malibu Video , et al. v. Wilson , et al . ;
-- in other cases against California cities and ports , another $ 350 million prevented from being unlawfully spent from TTF ;
-- the class action Lido v. State of California returned funds not paid to small and minority businesses during California 's budget crises ;
-- in Shinkle , et al. v. City of Los Angeles , Fine got the city to change its " sewer service charges " calculation method , saving residents " tens of millions of dollars " annually ;
-- in Amjadi and LACAOEHS v. LA Board of Supervisors , et al. , LA County had to establish a special environmental inspection fee fund from wrongfully deposited funds in its General Fund ; also freeze its environmental inspections fees until an initial $ 11 million deposit was spent , as well as deposit about $ 40 million annually into a " special fund " for environmental inspection fees ; and
-- many other legal victories against corrupt state officials saving California taxpayers about " $ 1 billion , " illegally " enrich ( ing ) developers , and blatantly trampl ( ing ) the people 's rights ; " Fine calls it " a true story .... wrapped up in one man 's personal nightmare . "
Overall , he stopped " Twenty - Six Years of California 's Annual Budget Crisis , " and was the first lawyer to " Challenge , In Court , The Unconstitutional Payments Given By Los Angeles County ( Supervisors ) To The Los Angeles County Superior Court Judges , " over $ 300 million since the late 1980s .
Over the same period , these " judges decided cases and made orders in favor of the County to the exclusion of the opposing parties in cases before them . "
For example , from 2005 - 2007 , no one won a case against the county in courts presided over by LA Superior Court judges .
Over many years , as a result , Californians were swindled out of hundreds of millions of dollars , and most troubling of all , county judges knew " taking payments from LA County was unconstitutional , " in violation of the Code of Judicial Ethics and Political Reform
Act for not disclosing them .
The same practice was common around the state , but not like in LA County , where state legislators exempted judges and county supervisors from prosecution .
For his many years of crime fighting , Fine was charged with " contempt of court " and " moral turpitude , " disbarred by California 's Supreme Court and jailed by Superior Court Judge David Yaffe " in retaliation for bringing the cases and exposing the unconstitutional payments , " ones later held to be unconstitutional .
Fine 's case is currently before the US Supreme Court .
The California Bar waived its right to respond , meaning his appeal is unopposed .
Also in his favor was a late 2009 decision in Sturgeon v. LA County ( brought by Judicial Watch ) deciding that county payments to judges are illegal .
Yet , with the help of California Supreme Court Chief Justice Ronald M. George , state - paid lobbyists got legislators to pass " a midnight bill " ( SBX2 - 11 ) at the peak of last year 's budget crisis , changing the law to make the payments appear legally authorized to continue , besides giving everyone involved retroactive immunity from criminal prosecution .
Note : immunity is never given when no crime was committed .
The latest on SBX2 - 11 immunity is that it's not in the " official Code " like the rest of the bill , Fine 's friends and associates asking , " Why are they hiding this pardon of over Ten Million Felonies from the public . "
They further say the bill " is an ex post facto law .
Its immunity provisions will ultimately be repealed , " so complicit judges are n't off the hook .
As of mid-April , 2010 , Fine remains in LA County Men 's Central Jail , the " worst jail in the United States , " according to an ACLU investigation and report ( aclu.org/prisoners-rights/aclu-releases - report ) calling it " nightmarish " because of severe overcrowding ( with over 20,000 detainees ) , violence , and overall conditions causing serious mental illness .
Fine is held in solitary confinement under horrendous conditions to punish him - with no fresh air , bright all - night overhead lighting , and no pen and paper to petition a higher court , a right ever serial killers get .
Also , reporters ( at least until now ) were denied permission to interview him .
He 's not allowed to post bond or get a hearing , and is ordered to stay in jail until he relents and withdraws his charges .
In a Full Disclosure.net April 7 , 2010 interview , Fine states :
" This is the beginning of what happens when you lose a democracy .
There is absolutely no question I 'm a political prisoner , " held without bail , without trial , and with every state appeal denied .
The issue is " a straight out - an - out abuse of power , and I 'm the person who went in and called them on it .... This is the biggest judicial scandal and judicial bribery scheme in American history .
My being in jail for ( over a year ) should show you that no one is immune from this abuse of power . "
Fine 's case exposes the dark underside of California politics and appalling level of official malfeasance , involving greedy developers , corrupt LA County Supervisors and judges , the state Supreme Court , its Bar Association , and the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals , co-conspiring to protect ongoing criminality and punish anyone challenging it .
On April 9 , Contra Costa Times writer Troy Anderson headlined , " Supreme Court to hear Fine case , " quoting Brooklyn Law School Professor Jayne Ressler , an expert in " coercive confinement " saying :
" The fact the Supreme Court is involved in any way is a big deal .
It certainly speaks volumes to the importance of this case , and it's quite intriguing . "
At issue is Fine 's " coercive confinement , " but he also hopes California corruption will be addressed .
The issue of judges ' pay is currently before the California Supreme Court , but given how judges and legislators conspire , it 'll likely go nowhere to let illegal behavior continue .
The state Supreme Court disbarred Fine .
Superior Court Judge David Yaffe jailed him for allegedly practicing law while being inactive and refusing to answer questions about his assets to pay court - ordered attorney fees in connection with a Marina del Rey case .
The US Supreme Court will hear his case on April 23 .
It gets thousands of applications annually , but considers about 80 or 90 at most .
His appeal cites the precedent of a Los Angeles newspaper reporter jailed in 1972 , in contempt , for refusing to divulge sources relating to the Charles Manson case .
After six weeks in confinement , the US Supreme Court ordered him released while his case was considered by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals .
" Lower courts later determined that lengthy confinements for contempt " are to punish in violation of " legal limits on punitive sentences for contempt . "
The US Supreme Court has the final say .
Meanwhile , at age 70 and in deteriorating health , Fine remains incarcerated , his freedom very much in jeopardy .
Also at issue is due process and judicial fairness , fast disappearing in America and denied anyone challenging corrupt power and privilege effectively .
Fine did it courageously and expertly .
He 's now paying the price .

SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) -- Cisco Systems Inc. says it will make a major announcement on Tuesday , news that the technology giant says " will forever change the Internet . "
Shares of Cisco CSCO , +0.84 % gained 3.65 % to close at $ 26.13 Monday , hitting a new 52 - week high of $ 26.36 intraday , as some analysts speculated that the tech giant is rolling out new gear to help wireless phone companies cope with rising video Web traffic .
The San Jose , Calif . - based Cisco had sent out invitations to analysts and the media for a " significant announcement " that it says " will forever change the Internet and its impact on consumers , businesses and governments . "
The invitation followed Google Inc.'s GOOG , +0.01 % February announcement that the Internet giant was working on building a high - speed broadband network that would be 100 times faster than today 's connections .
This triggered some speculation that Cisco may be planning a similar initiative .
But spokesman David McCulloch reiterated in an e-mail , " our strategy remains to partner very closely with service providers to enable advanced new telecommunications services versus building out public networks ourselves . "
In fact , other analysts believe Cisco will unveil new technology related to the rising tide of video traffic on the Internet , a growing challenge for wireless phone companies .
Cisco dominates the market for information technology equipment , or what 's known as the plumbingused to connect computer systems in a network or with the Internet .
Ticonderoga Securities analyst Brian
White said in a note that the announcement likely " will focus on Cisco 's core technology platforms . "
Analysts cite Cisco 's recent acquisition of Starent Networks , which makes gear that helps mobile carriers connect wireless phone users to the Internet .
" The single largest opportunity in networking today on the carrier side is in mobile networking , " Yankee Group analyst Zeus Kerravala said .
" Starent was a key acquisition for them . "
Steve Allen of Sierra Tech Research said high - definition video content on the Web is " starting to dominate " leading to the need for " a much more robust system . "
" This is something that has been brewing for a couple of years , " he said .
" Video is not just more data .
It 's a different type of data . "
Allen also speculated that , while Cisco may not be following Google 's lead in developing in its own network , the timing and dramatic tone of the announcement may , in fact , have something to do with the Internet powerhouse .
" One thing that may be leading them to be more dramatic is the Google announcement , " Allen said .
" They might need to remind the world that Google is not the leader in Internet infrastructure .
It 's Cisco . ...
It 's all about letting the world know , ' All this is being brought to you by Cisco . ' "
Rajan Varadarajan , an analyst with Primary Global Research , speculated that Cisco 's announcement also may involve the big phone companies such as AT&T T , +0.74 % and Verizon VZ , +0.42 % .
AT&T , Verzon and Sprint Nextel Corp.
S , -5.00 % shares rallied , helping make telecoms the best - performing S&P 500 SPX , +0.82 % index .
" The carriers may be threatened by what Google is up , " he said , and the announcement may be way of affirming that , " Cisco is standing by them , " and saying , " Hey , do n't worry about this Google threat . "
Ticonderoga 's
White also noted that the Federal Communications Commission is set to deliver the National Broadband Plan to Congress .
" Growing broadband initiatives are positive for the networking industry at large and Cisco should be an important beneficiary through its deep product portfolio , " White wrote .
Stephen Lunn , Australian ( Sydney ) , April 20 , 2010
GRASSROOTS concern about Australia ’s burgeoning population is being ignored by the “ hopelessly conflicted ” major parties and needs a fresh voice in Canberra , says political hopeful William Bourke .
Mr Bourke , a Sydney small businessman and founder of the newly established Stable Population Party of Australia , plans to field candidates in all states at the next federal poll , running on a platform of restricting the nation ’s population to 23 million .
Mr Bourke says population growth might be a single issue , but it cuts across national policy agendas from health , housing and education to water , climate change–and particularly immigration .
He denies the fledgling party , formed in February , will be a honeypot for rednecks and racists , saying Australians are “ capable of a mature and rational debate on the issue ” .
Nevertheless , he says massive cuts are needed to Australia ’s current immigration intake , including from the skilled migration program , family reunions , the high volume of New Zealanders allowed in , and overseas students .
Net overseas migration , the difference between those entering Australia with plans to stay for more than a year and those leaving with the same intention , was 297,000 in the year to September last year .
Mr Bourke , who says he has never been a member of a political party , thinks that figure should be reduced to zero .
“ We need a balanced migration program , with immigration set at between 50,000 to 80,000 a year , matching the emigration that happens each year , ” he told The Australian .
“ The major parties are hopelessly conflicted between the will of the people and the will of their big business donors , and both sides are just as bad .
“ They keep using this measurement of higher gross domestic product to indicate our wellbeing , but of course it ’s going to grow if you have a bigger population .
The measure they should be using is GDP per capita , and that has fallen for the past five quarters in a row . ”
BRISTOL , England ( Reuters ) -
The two main candidates to lead Britain after a May 6 election sought on Thursday to fend off a surprise challenge from a smaller party in a lively TV debate , but there was no undisputed winner .
Britain's Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg listens to members of the Infant , Mother and Pre School group at the Community Church in Greenway during an election campaign visit to Bristol , western England April 22 , 2010 .
The Liberal Democrats have doubled their projected vote share in Labour - held marginal constituencies but the swing comes mainly from voters who were previously not sure they would vote , a poll showed on Thursday .
REUTERS / Gareth Fuller / Pool
Frontrunner David Cameron of the center - right opposition Conservatives and Prime Minister Gordon Brown of the Labour Party were under pressure to halt the rise of Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg after he outshone them in an earlier debate .
“ An awful lot of fire was turned on Clegg , and I think they got him on the ropes , but not on the canvas , ” Jon Tonge , politics professor at Liverpool University , told Reuters .
Thursday ’s clash , on issues from Afghanistan to Europe and pensions to immigration , was the second of a series of three planned for the campaign -- the first time in British history that the main party leaders have taken part in TV debates .
Two snap polls after Thursday ’s contest gave conflicting results , though both suggested that the performances were more balanced than a week ago when Clegg was the clear winner .
A YouGov poll for the Sun newspaper put Cameron in first place with 36 percent , Clegg in second with 32 percent , and Brown last with 29 percent .
A ComRes poll for ITV News put Clegg ahead with 33 percent , with Brown and Cameron both on 30 .
Opinion polls on the election itself , which until a few months ago pointed to a Conservative win , have in recent weeks suggested that no party may win an overall majority .
That could hand the balance of power to the previously little - known Clegg .
His star turn in the first debate led to a surge in the popularity of the Liberal Democrats , a previously ignored centrist party presented by Clegg as “ real change ” from the two big parties , who have alternated in power since World War Two .
“ Something really exciting is beginning to happen .
People are beginning to believe , beginning to hope , that we can do something different this time , ” he said in his closing remarks .
CAMERON COMEBACK
Cameron , who also has campaigned on the theme of change after 13 years of Labour government , mounted a strong fightback .
Criticized for being unusually stiff in the first debate , he regained his usual fluency and telegenic style in round two .
He argued that far from being different , the Liberal Democrats had been tainted just like Labour and the Conservatives by a huge scandal last year over legislators ’ dubious expense claims that infuriated millions of voters .
“ Frankly , Nick , we all had problems with this ...
Do n’t anyone try and put themselves on a pedestal , ” he said .
The Conservatives say that if they do not win a clear victory on May 6 , squabbling between the parties to form a ruling coalition will delay tough decisions on cutting a worrisome budget deficit and leave Britain weak and divided .
They fear that Labour could hang on to power with support from the Lib Dems .
They have tried to halt Clegg ’s rise with the slogan “ Vote Clegg , Get Brown . ”
Cameron ’s improved performance will be a huge relief to the Conservatives after a week during which the campaign has been dominated by talk of Clegg ’s sudden ascendancy .
Brown , who is the first to admit presentational skills are not his strength , gave the most awkward performance of the three but tried to present himself as the strongest on substance .
“ If it is all about style and PR , count me out .
If it ’s about the big decisions , if it ’s about judgment , if it ’s about delivering a better future for this country , I ’m your man , ” he said in his opening statement .

One of RNC Chairman Michael Steele 's closest advisers has also cut ties to the committee -- an indication that a full - scale bloodletting is under way .
Shakeup : RNC chief of staff resigns
Republican National Committee chief of staff Ken McKay resigned Monday , becoming the highest - ranking official to depart the committee after revelations that the national party spent nearly $ 2,000 at California sex club .
McKay ’s departure in turn prompted one of RNC Chairman Michael Steele ’s closest advisers to cut ties to the party — an indication that a full - scale bloodletting is under way at the troubled committee .

Doug Heye , communications director for the RNC , declined to say if McKay was forced out but indicated the move was directly related to the money spent at the now - infamous Voyeur Club and broader concerns about the party ’s fundraising and the performance of Steele .
" This is about ensuring that we have the tightest financial controls in place and to ensure that every nickel we spend is done with the goal of winning in November , ” said Heye .
Steele was more explicit in an e-mail message sent Monday night to committee members and donors , many of whom were caught by surprise about the decision .
“ Leadership requires that I can safely assure you , our donors , and the American people that our mission is what drives every dollar we spend , every phone call we make , every e-mail we send and every event we organize , ” Steele wrote in the e-mail , obtained by POLITICO .
“ Recent events have called that assurance into question and the buck stops with me .
That is why I have made this change in my management team and why I am confident about going forward to November with renewed focus and energy . ”
McKay did n’t immediately respond to an e-mail requesting comment .
But his apparent firing has roiled the close - knit world of GOP operatives , and Monday night , longtime Republican strategist and Steele adviser Curt Anderson said his consulting firm would no longer be working with the RNC .
“ Ken McKay ’s departure is a huge loss for the Republican Party , ” Anderson said in a statement to POLITICO .
“ Ken steered the party through very successful elections last fall that have given us tremendous momentum .
He ’s a great talent .
Given our firm ’s commitments to campaigns all over the country , we have concluded it is best for us to step away from our advisory role at the RNC .
We have high personal regard for the chairman and always have ; we wish him well . ”
Anderson , who brought McKay in to run the committee ’s day - to - day operations last year , said he was not consulted on the decision to replace the chief of staff .
The departure of the duo suggests Monday ’s moves represent the culmination of a power struggle within the committee .
Steele is “ circling the wagons , ” said a GOP operative close to the committee .
“ He ’s putting loyalists in to run things , ” the operative said , noting that both Leavitt and Heye , who joined the committee earlier this year , both worked on Steele ’s Senate campaign .
McKay was Rhode Island Gov. Don Carcieri's campaign manager in 2002 and 2006 and previously served as the governor 's chief of staff .
Starting immediately , Mike Leavitt will become the new RNC chief of staff .
Leavitt worked at the committee with Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell ’s campaign last year , and in February became deputy chief of staff .
“ Mike played a critical role in Gov. McDonnell ’s victory in 2009 , where he directed the most successful grass - roots operation in Virginia history , ” said Phil Cox , McDonnell ’s campaign manager .
“ He ’s talented , dedicated and experienced . ”
Leavitt ran Steele ’s unsuccessful U.S. Senate campaign in 2006 and has also held posts on Sen. John McCain ’s 2008 presidential bid and the now - defunct conservative third - party group Freedom ’s Watch .
“ As chief of staff , Mike will be able to make sure such problems do n’t occur in the future , ” said a party official .
Having just suffered through the most difficult week of his controversy - marked tenure , Steele is plainly hoping to reassure unhappy party officials , operatives and activists that he is instituting more accountability .
The decision to replace the chief of staff comes just days after a former counsel to the party and veteran Republican campaign finance attorney was brought on to oversee spending .
But many senior Republicans have deep worries about Steele himself .
There is no appetite among committee members to push him out , but the sex club expenditure has amplified complaints about the chairman ’s fundraising and spending .
And after remaining quiet in the immediate wake of last week ’s report , the chairman used an interview Monday morning on ABC ’s “ Good Morning America ” to argue that , as an African - American , he ’s being held to a higher standard .
Those comments brought forth a new wave of grumbling among GOP professionals about Steele .
Aside from embarrassing headlines , the most practical consequence of Steele ’s travails may be on just how many races Republicans can fund this fall .
Fewer major donors are giving to the committee , in part because they have little faith in Steele .
Former Ambassador Sam Fox , a top bundler for President George W. Bush who was one of the co-chairmen of the Republican Regents — the RNC 's top - level fundraising board — left his post , GOP sources told POLITICO on Monday .
And social conservative donors are being urged directly to not contribute by the Family Research Council ’s Tony Perkins .
Steele has , though , increased the number of small - dollar donors to the committee since he took over .
And , despite not having a Republican president in the White House , he has kept pace with the DNC ’s fundraising .
Still , Steele ’s intraparty critics show no sign of letting up .
“ A firing squad will not solve the current mistakes that have embarrassed the activists on the ground , who are very busy in their respective states , trying to field candidates , referee primaries , fund their parties , build victory programs and win elections , ” said former South Carolina GOP Chairman Katon Dawson , who lost to Steele in the RNC chairman ’s race .
“ The RNC leadership and staff should get off the front page of the papers and focus on November .
The sooner the better . ”

What do we meet at the corner of Assertiveness and Cooperation ?
The Thomas - Kilmann assessment suggests that it ’s Collaboration .
Their assessment , which is the basis for many others , explores different styles people use when handling conflict .
For some of you this work may be familiar , but I only learned of it a few days ago from my sister , a professional mediator .
Here is a free version which gives you a quick view of the five areas measured by the Thomas - Kilmann assessment .
It identifies five styles of handling conflict between two people : the Avoider , the Accommodater , the Compromiser , the Competitor and the Collaborator .
These types are arrayed in a graph with Assertiveness ( defined as concern for the task , or as " thinks of self " ) on one axis , and Cooperation ( defined as concern for people , or " thinks of others " ) on the other .
In the lowest left hand corner is the Avoider , someone who ’d rather not deal with conflict at all , and in the upper right hand corner , the corner where the highest level of Cooperation meets the highest level of Assertiveness , is the Collaborator .
( Smack dab in the middle , as you ’d expect , is the Compromiser , but we ’ll save that for another day . )
What fascinated me about this model is the light it sheds on Collaboration : where its power comes from , and what distinguishes it from Compromise .
Certainly , there are situations in which compromise is adequate and even worthwhile .
I ’d like to go out for dinner , you ’d like to stay home .
Taken a step further , I ’d like not to cook tonight , and you ’d like not to get dressed up or spend a lot of money .
A compromise on a nearby casual restaurant fits the bill perfectly , and you and I probably do n’t need to spend a minute more on a " conflict " like this .
But a compromise is always a meeting in the middle , so each gets a little of what they want , and compromise often gets to a gray solution , not really satisfying to anyone but sort of appeasing everyone .
In art , it ’s mixing a lot of colors to get mud .
Collaboration gets its power because it uses the energy of Assertiveness–ideas and real points of view , championed by people who care–and the energy of Cooperation–a willingness to make things work for all involved .
From collaboration comes the best result , the idea or solution which is fashioned from everyone ’s input and is better than what any one person could have come up with on her or his own .
And a key point in all of this , a key ingredient in collaboration , is that it starts with conflict , but it does n’t end there .
It takes the energy of the conflict–opposing or differing views , needs and goals–and the attitude of collaboration –the willingness to reach the best solution for all concerned –to get somewhere we ’ve never been before , and somewhere we could n’t go alone .
I ’ll close with a quote from Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr .
" A leader is n’t a seeker of consensus , but a molder of consensus . "

Game tech musings from the past and present
The many demanding feats that David Beckham is forced to ‘ perform . ’
Posh and David one can arguably say lead the perfect life .
He is the much ballyhooed captain of the English soccer team , makes lots of money showing off his stomach muscles on the side and gets to live an idyllic life in Los Angeles .
Victoria too can savor a successful recording career , a myriad of modeling gigs , which coincedentally have her showing off her stomach muscles and to boot ( pun intended ) the couple have 3 boys .
Well that it seems is the problem .
That they have 3 boys and not one girl and of course Posh has decided that life wont be perfect again until the little pitter patter of a little girl is heard around the house .
Sounds fine right ?
Well , there ’s a catch and the world is wondering if David can hold on .
The Daily Telegraph out of Australia explains in no uncertain terms …
Broody Victoria Beckham demands sex with David five times daily to fall pregnant
Not a problem for most lads , but a problem when you ’re carrying a series of injuries that sometimes prevent you from getting out of bed , let alone ‘ performing ’ in it .
Posh , who longs for a daughter , has set up a baby chart showing the best times to conceive .
The 35 - year - old former Posh Spice and Queen WAG kicked off the plan during the family ’s Easter break in the Caribbean that left injured English soccer idol Becks flat on his back .
Golden Balls , 34 , has told friends he is struggling to keep up with his rampant missus as he limps around with strapping on his Achilles tendon .
Really , the problem is that the missus has worked out that David has the best possible genes in the world and that no real good will be done until they too can conceive a female version of their benevolent selves .
Of course as appealing and rigorous are the demands of certain married lives , we think that David in due course will be able to score the goal his precious wife is ‘ rooting ’ for him to score .
One way or another we ’re rooting ’ for David .

OAKLAND , Calif . —
Tim Westergren recently sat in a Las Vegas penthouse suite , a glass of red wine in one hand and a truffle - infused Kobe beef burger in the other , courtesy of the investment bankers who were throwing a party to court him .
It was a surreal moment for Mr. Westergren , who founded Pandora , the Internet radio station .
For most of its 10 years , it has been on the verge of death , struggling to find investors and battling record labels over royalties .
Had Pandora died , it would have joined myriad music start - ups in the tech company graveyard , like SpiralFrog and the original Napster .
Instead , with a successful iPhone app fueling interest , Pandora is attracting attention from investment bankers who think it could go public , the pinnacle of success for a start - up .
Pandora ’s 48 million users tune in an average 11.6 hours a month .
That could increase as Pandora strikes deals with the makers of cars , televisions and stereos that could one day , Pandora hopes , make it as ubiquitous as AM / FM radio .
Children WILL face ' naked ' airport scans , Government rules
All selected children will have to go through the new full - body ' naked ' scanning machines being introduced at airports , the Government said today .
Transport Secretary Lord Adonis clarified the ruling as he announced a consultation process on the use of scanners .
Civil rights groups have raised legal and privacy concerns about the scanners , which have been introduced at Manchester and Heathrow airports following the failed transatlantic plane bomb attack last Christmas .
Gatwick and Birmingham will have the devices by the end of the year .
Baring all : A security officer puts himself through a full - body scanner at Manchester Airport , left .
Objects hidden under his clothes - as well as the outline of his body , including genitals , buttocks and torso - are visible to the operator monitoring the resulting images , right
The Government said in its new code of practise : ' We will be requiring all children who are selected to be screened using the scanners .
To do otherwise would risk undermining the effect of these new measures .
' Airport security staff have all been cleared to Government security - vetting level , which includes a check of criminal and security service records .
' Staff have received comprehensive initial training and regular refresher training in aviation security and customer service . '
The code went on : ' Staff have been trained in how to conduct their duties in a sensitive and proportionate manner . '
Just last week a scanner operator at Heathrow received a police warning for making a lewd comment to a colleague as she accidentally passed through the scanner .
Campaigners say the scanners , which act like a mini radar device ' seeing ' beneath ordinary clothing , are an invasion of privacy .
Concern : Children will have to submit to ' naked ' scans before flying
The Equality and Human Rights Commission has warned that the scanners breach privacy rules under the Human Rights
Act for their naked images .
The exemption of under 18s from being scanned , which was in place during the trial of the machines in Manchester , has also been removed .
The Department for Transport has published an interim code of practice for the scanners .
The officer operating the machine never sees the image , and the employee viewing the scan must be in another room .
The Government said it noted concerns expressed under the Protection of Children Act but added that the Act also contained a section dealing with processes necessary for the purposes of prevention , detection or investigation of crime .
The Government said it believed its privacy controls were ' sufficient to give assurance to all passengers ' , but it was aware of the possibility that ' some individuals , such as transgendered , disabled or elderly passengers , or passengers with particular religious or other beliefs might , notwithstanding the existing privacy controls , have concerns about undergoing a security scan . '
The code went on : ' We believe that in such a situation the security officers have the necessary skills to be able to deal with the situation sensitively . '
Last week a House of Commons Transport Committee report supporting the use of scanners was published .
Some passengers , including two women travelling to Pakistan friom Manchester , have refused to go through the scanners and have been barred from boarding their plane .
my ramblings for everyone to see
“ I said I would be glad to get her one , ” Mosher said , which he did , but to no avail .
The agent looked into it further and said , “ She ’s still flagged .
She ’s on a No Fly List . "
“ But she ’s a first - grader ! ” Mosher said he pleaded , noting that the airline had her date of birth and middle name .
But the agent told the frustrated father there was “ nothing ( he ) can do , ” Mosher said .
It ’s not just an inconvenience , ” he said .
“ It makes us less safe because they ’re spending time investigating a 6 - year - old , instead of actually going after real terrorists
In a call to Phil Orlandella , Director of Media Relations at Logan Airport Sunday morning , when asked about the Tiny Terrorist Allison Mosher , Orlandella said he could not confirm if she was able to board the flight .
He suggested calling United Airlines for more information on the Mosher families travel status .
He said they would be the ones who would know for sure .
He had no way to know at this time .
TSA says they do not list Children on the No Fly List but the facts show that there are Tiny Terrorists on their list on passengers who may not board an airline .
Kim I. Hartman
Logan International Airport Security Officer Mr. Drew told the Digital Journal that he could not give out specific details on the No - Fly Fiasco because of security reasons and department policy .
Drew said in that thick Boston accent that " they had to be " politically correct " when ( not ) responding - which meant no information could be shared on this continuing news story by his department .
He recommended calling Phil Orlandella in Media Relations .
Traveling with Your Tiny Terrorist ?
Check the TSA No - Fly List before booking that flight .
Kim I. Hartman
Customer Service Representatives with United Airline said Sunday morning when asked if young Allison was able to go on vacation with her family " they could not give out information on passenger boarding lists .
It was against company policy .
This would violate the privacy of the individuals involved and it was security risk . "
At this time we can not confirm if the Mosher family were allowed to board the flight with their youngest daughter or if she has been left " home alone . "
' We have to screen everyone , regardless of age ( even babies ) , before they can go through the security checkpoint .
We will not ask you to do anything that will separate you from your child or children .
We specially train our Security Officers and they understand your concern for your children .
They will approach your children gently and treat them with respect .
If your child becomes uncomfortable or upset , security officers will consult you about the best way to relieve your child 's concern .
Are any of these faces in the TSA 's database for Tiny Terrorists ?
Kim I. Hartman
You spend long hours continuously searching for flight deals , hotel bargains and planning that wonderful family vacation and when the big day arrives , the Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) grounds your six year daughter .
This is exactly what happened when a Massachusetts man tried to print out tickets and found his young child on the TSA 's No Fly List according to the Boston Herald .
As first reported on Digital Journal by K.J. Mullins : Allison Mosher 's father Peter learned of his daughter being on the list yesterday after he was unable to get a boarding pass for her .
Mosher had no problems printing tickets for the rest of the family including another child who is 9 years old .
But when it came to pint - sized Allison , he hit a dead end .
So Mosher phoned United Airlines , where an agent told him his daughter had “ been flagged by TSA security , ” probably because she did n’t have a frequent - flyer number , Mosher tells the Boston Herald . .
” Ann Davis , a TSA spokeswoman , said that because there are no children on the No Fly List , airlines can let kids younger than 12 bypass the tighter security .
“ If they observe a 6 - year - old standing before them , they can forgo additional procedures , ” and allow them to board their designated flight .
Mosher contacted Sen. Scott Brown R-Mass who then had an aide phone up TSA agents at Logan International Airport to tell them to fix the mess mix - up quickly and a call to Sen .
Brown office confirmed they were assisting the Mosher family with the situation .
When he was last contacted by the Boston Herald , an exasperated Mosher said " he would have to wake his kids at 2 a .m. to get to Logan hours early to deal with the foul - up and still was n't sure if his tiny terrorist daughter would be allowed to board the United Flight for the family vacation to the Grand Canyon .
" The Transportation Security Administration has this say to on traveling and children :
Our Fading Heritage : Americans Fail a Basic Test on Their History and Institutions is the third major study conducted by ISI on the kind of knowledge required for informed citizenship .
In 2006 and 2007 , ISI published the first ever scientific surveys of civic learning among college students .
Each year , approximately 14,000 freshmen and seniors at 50 schools nationwide were given a 60 - question , multiple - choice exam on basic knowledge of America ’s heritage .
Both years , the students failed .
The average freshman scored 51.7 % the first year and 51.4 % the next .
The average senior scored 53.2 % , then 54.2 % .
After all the time , effort , and money spent on college , students emerge no better off in understanding the fundamental features of American self - government .
This year , ISI sought to learn more about the real - world consequences of this collegiate failure .
ISI crafted a study to measure the independent impact of college on the acquisition and maintenance of civic literacy over a lifetime .
First , a random sample of 2,508 American adults of all backgrounds was surveyed , allowing comparisons to be made between the college and non-college educated .
They were asked 33 straightforward civics questions , many of which high school graduates and new citizens are expected to know .
Respondents were also asked several questions concerning their participation in American civic life , their attitudes about perennial issues of American governance , and other behaviors that may or may not contribute to civic literacy .
Finally , the results were run through multivariate regression analysis , allowing ISI to compare the civic impact of college with that of other societal factors .
Do Americans possess the knowledge necessary to participate wisely in the affairs of the nation ?
Read below to find out .
Major Findings
Finding 1 :
Americans Fail the Test of Civic Literacy
Seventy - one percent of Americans fail the test , with an overall average score of 49 % .
Liberals score 49 % ; conservatives score 48 % .
Republicans score 52 % ; Democrats score 45 % .
Fewer than half of all Americans can name all three branches of government , a minimal requirement for understanding America ’s constitutional system .
Finding 2 :
Americans Agree :
Colleges Should Teach America ’s Heritage
Americans remain divided over many issues , but on one they have forged a deep consensus .
A large majority agrees that colleges should prepare citizen leaders by teaching America ’s history , key texts , and institutions .
Seventy - three percent in the West , 69 % in the Midwest , 74 % in the Northeast , and 74 % in the South agree .
Seventy - four percent of conservatives agree , as do 71 % of liberals .
Seventy - two percent with a high school diploma and 74 % with a graduate degree agree .
The civic knowledge gained from engaging in frequent conversations about public affairs , reading about current events and history , and participating in more involved civic activities is greater than the gain from a bachelor ’s degree alone .
Finding 3 :
College Adds Little to Civic Knowledge
Earning a college degree does little to increase knowledge of America ’s history , key texts , and institutions .
The average score among those who ended their formal education with a bachelor ’s degree is 57 % , or an “ F . ”
That is only 13 percentage points higher than the average score among those who ended their formal education with a high school diploma .
Only 24 % of college graduates know the First Amendment prohibits establishing an official religion for the United States .
Finding 4 :
Television — Including TV News — Dumbs America Down
ISI examined whether other factors add to or subtract from civic literacy and how they compare with the impact of college .
The survey revealed that in today ’s technological age , all else remaining equal , a person ’s test score drops in proportion to the time he or she spends using certain types of passive electronic media .
Talking on the phone , watching owned or rented movies , and monitoring TV news broadcasts and documentaries diminish a respondent ’s civic literacy .
In contrast to these negative influences , the civic knowledge gained from the inexpensive combination of engaging in frequent conversations about public affairs , reading about current events and history , and participating in more involved civic activities is greater than the gain from an expensive bachelor ’s degree alone .
Finding 5 :
What College Graduates Do n’t Know About America
By the time an American earns a bachelor ’s degree , it is highly unlikely that he or she will have a solid command of the founding and Civil War eras , core constitutional principles , and market economics .
Pre -college education tends to increase knowledge of themes from twentieth - century American history at the expense of economics and pre-twentieth - century themes that tend to be the foundation of much subsequent political discourse .
Colleges begin to reverse this trend , but not enough to close significant gaps in these crucial categories of civic knowledge .
Only 54 % can correctly identify a basic description of the free enterprise system , in which all Americans participate .
Additional Finding
Elected Officials Score Lower than the General Public
Officeholders typically have less civic knowledge than the general public .
On average , they score 44 % , five percentage points lower than non-officeholders .
Thirty percent of elected officials do not know that “ life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness ” are the inalienable rights referred to in the Declaration of Independence .
Conclusion
A Call to Reform
ISI calls on administrators , trustees , donors , faculty , parents , and elected officials to reevaluate curricula and standards of accountability so that colleges can better prepare their graduates for the responsibilities of informed citizenship .
Do colleges require courses in American history , politics , economics , and other core areas ?
Do colleges assess the civic or overall learning of their graduates ?
Do elected officials link college appropriations to real measures of civic or overall learning ?
Do parents make college selection choices based upon a school ’s actual academic performance ?
After all the time , effort , and money spent on college , students emerge no better off in understanding the fundamental features of American self - government .
Tomorrow night can be a sad night at the Rock .
The Devils , who outplayed the Penguins all year and clinched second in the division , can be eliminated in the first round of the players for the third consecutive season .
Down 3 - 1 , and with the way the Devils have played , this looks almost certain .
The Devils face a steep uphill climb to just get a victory tomorrow night .
Despite the odds , the Devils can still stage a comeback .
But , in order to be competitive , the team needs leadership , and those leaders need to step up quickly .
Who can step up to provide the leadership necessary to lead the team ?
Here are a few of my options :
1. Coach Jacques Lemaire
Lemaire has n’t been doing so well in this series .
It looks like Flyers ’ coach Peter Laviolette has thoroughly outcoached him .
The Flyers ’ forecheck has been terrific , they ’ve continually attacked the Devils ’ defense , and the team has never stopped moving since game one .
Lemaire has seem subdued , almost emotionally detached to the situation going on around him .
But I believe Lemaire can begin a Devils ’ turnaround by making a few simple adjustments .
First , Lemaire needs to actually coach .
While watching the games , Lemaire seems to take a hands - off approach , especially when the Devils need him most .
Lemaire needs to get in the face of his players .
He needs to be there , getting in players ears .
He needs to make the adjustments in between periods to keep this team sharp .
I know Lemaire has been hands - off , but down 3 - 1 , it ’s time to break the mold .
I ’d like to see Lemaire get a little more proactive on the bench and institute in - period changes .
It ’s the only way to keep up with a Flyers team that has outworked the Devils in four of the series five games .
Lemaire also has the background to help the team rescue the series .
In 2003 , with the Minnesota Wild , Lemaire pulled his team back from two 3 - 1 series deficits .
They first came back against the Colorado Avalanche in the Western Conference quarterfinals , effectively ending Patrick Roy ’s career .
They repeated the feat in the next round , defeating the Vancouver Canucks .
His experience in this situation can and should be used to help the team respond .
Lemaire knows the time for speeches and talking is over .
“ It ’s been four speeches that we put on and there will be a fifth one , ” Lemaire said to Tom Gulitti of the Bergen Record .
“ There ’s a time for speeches .
You ca n’t look for speeches .
You ’ve just got to get the work done . ”
2. Colin White
In 2000 , the Devils had great leadership throughout the locker room .
Scott Stevens was the unquestioned leader of the team , but they also had great leadership from Ken Daneyko and Scott Niedermayer .
White was also on that squad .
With the defense playing subpar during this series , the Devils need someone to step up and lead the blue line .
While
White may not be the best blueliner , he ’s the senior leader of that group .
White needs to step up and get the defense playing well .
The defense has n’t played well in their own zone , and White needs to be the one to hold people accountable .
He should be the vocal leader of the group , reminding the defenseman to move the puck and make the smart play .
He should be riding defenseman when they take dumb penalties or take a shift off .
I have n’t seen anyone step up this season to be the leader of the defense .
In this situation , the team needs someone to do that , and White ’s been around long enough to know what the Devils expect from their defenseman .
He should step up , carry the torch and lead the defense .
3. Patrik Elias or Zach Parise
There ’s a certain reason that two guys on the team become assistant captains .
While not the true captain , these players are still looked toward to lead both on and off the ice .
With Jamie Langenbrunner failing to inspire the troops , it ’s time for these two to step up .
And Elias has already picked up the slack , speaking about the positive mindset he believes the team has .
“ We have a team that we feel that we can beat them , so it ’s the same thing ( as 2000 ) , ” Elias said to Gulitti .
“ We ’ve got to make sure that we believe in it .
We ’ve go to go out and just worry about – as it is , you ca n’t worry about the end result .
You ’ve got to go and do your job every shift and believe that we ’ll get it done . ”
Elias is saying the right thing now , but can he step out on the ice and lead ?
The same question goes for Parise .
These two guys need to step up their game .
They need to be , like I suggest for White , getting in the faces of the forwards and making sure everyone is playing responsible , smart hockey .
If they can continue to bring these positive vibes and push everyone to play harder , smarter hockey , then Elias and Parise will be doing their job and leading this team .
There ’s something to be said for the quality of good leadership .
If the Devils can get leadership from these players , it will be a big step in the right direction .
Many of the players realize this is n’t the year 2000 .
But , with both Simon Gagne and Jeff Carter slated to miss the rest of the series , the Devils will finally catch a break in the series .
By getting some positive leadership , I ’d expect the Devils to come out tomorrow night and play an inspired game .
You never know what one great performance can bring .
But , in order to realize their potential , some unsung leaders will have to rise in the Devils ’ locker room .

Verizon Wireless April 15 said it will begin selling the HTC Droid Incredible April 29 for $ 199 with a $ 100 mail - in rebate and a two - year contract .
The Incredible is based on the Android 2.1 operating system and runs the 1GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon processor that impressed users of the Google Nexus One smartphone .
The gadget has a 3.7 - inch WVGA ( 480 by 800 ) AMOLED capacitive touch screen .
Incredible employs the HTC Sense experience , including a seven - panel home screen with " Leap " view to let users quickly access their weather , social media and other widgets with one touch .
Customers will also be able to access such exclusive Verizon apps as NFL Mobile and Skype mobile , the long - awaited mobile VOIP app that lets Verizon customers make and receive unlimited Skype - to - Skype voice calls to any Skype user ; call international phone numbers at Skype Out calling rates ; and send and receive instant messages to other Skype users .
The device will also have a button for Android Market , where users can choose from more than 30,000 Google applications , and integration with Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync for those who need to check their corporate e-mail .
The Incredible is the first high - end smartphone based on Google Android from the top U.S. wireless carrier since its November 2009 launch of the Motorola Droid , which just got an upgrade to Android 2.1 .
It 's also the first Verizon gadget to sport an 8 - megapixel camera , which boasts dual LED with flash .
An integrated GPS and 802.11b/g WiFi are on board .
The Incredible 's hype reached its zenith when Boy Genius Report posted equipment documentation about the device April 13 .
That same day , eWEEK showed the documentation to a Verizon spokesperson , who confirmed the device but declined to say when it might be available to Verizon customers and consumers in the market for a new smartphone .
" Looks like a great Android device .
Everyone will want one .
No comment , " the spokesperson said .
Others reported the Incredible would hit stores April 29 .
As it turned out , they were right .
Verizon confirmed the rumors in this press release today .
If all goes according to plan , the Incredible will hit the street a full seven weeks before the iPhone 4.0 , giving it a good jump on the hot smartphone that has shipped more than 50 million units to date .
Verizon wants to offer the iPhone and suggested Apple is the reason for the hold - up .
Customers interested in getting the device when it 's available may preorder it beginning April 19 at Verizon Wireless ' Website here .
The $ 100 rebate will come to customers as a debit card , which customers can use anywhere debit cards are accepted .
Those who buy the phone must subscribe to a Verizon Wireless Nationwide Talk and an Email and Web for Smartphone plan .
Nationwide
Talk plans begin at $ 39.99 per month .
Email and Web for Smartphone plans start at $ 29.99 for unlimited access .
At Writer ’s Digest , we host an event twice a year called the Writer ’s Digest Editors ’ Intensives .
It is completely staff run and presented , hosted at our headquarters in Cincinnati , and offers an opportunity to get the first 50 pages of your manuscript critiqued .
Chuck Sambuchino and I usually serve as the key presenters .
After a recent event , I realized — after talking to one of the attendees — that Chuck and I had delivered some starkly different advice .
Now , this in itself is not unusual .
Many times you ’ll find varying perspectives among editors and agents .
But our disagreement was this :
Chuck advised writers not to post their work online , as it might adversely affect future potential for the work .
I advised writers not to worry about it — that writers often benefit from posting their work online .
Talk about a mixed message !
I recently read this blog post that also advises writers not to post their stuff online , and it ’s not uncommon advice .
But I find it an utterly archaic sentiment given where the publishing industry is headed .
Here ’s why :
Test marketing is one of the best things you can do to improve your work and build an audience .
Agent Michael Larsen even recommends it in his classic , How to Write a Book Proposal .
Getting feedback on your work ( whether you ’re specifically asking for a critique , or just hoping for reader comments ) can be critical to a writer ’s development .
No writer should ever be discouraged from posting their work online in a critique environment , EVER .
No sane agent or editor would disagree with points 1 or 2 , since doing these things advance the quality and marketability of your work .
Hiding your work in a closet until you feel it is “ ready ” for a “ professional ” to consider it ?
Folly .
Has n’t anyone told you that the gatekeeper era is coming to a swift end ?
If we ’re talking about novel - length works , then sharing pieces of it , or even serializing it , over a long period is NOT going to affect its market value .
( Anyone who says it does has a very antiquated view of online media , as well as where traditional publishing is headed . )
Offering a work online , whether in serialized format or in an alternate media ( e.g. , audio ) , can increase interest and demand for a physical , print product .
This is proven out by people like Scott Sigler and Seth Harwood who serialized their work as podcasts , made them absolutely free , and secured traditional book publishing deals after developing a significant following .
People who post their work online can do so in a very smart , strategic , and targeted way that feeds into demand for a traditional book that a publisher would love to produce ( or that an agent would love to sign ) .
Posting your work online is not to be feared .
Wake up .*
* Unless you ’re in the MFA community .
It ’s true that the literary market is stuck in the Dark Ages .
All of you poets and short story writers who want to strike it rich in the literary journals or academic presses ?
Sorry !

CB SLANG AND TECHNICAL TERMS
1962-1998
( from the book " Woody's World Of CB " )
The list below represents just about every CB - ism you 'll run across .
Please keep in mind that if you jump on the air with a sentence full of slang words and phrases below you 'll sound like an idiot .
These are words that you 'll run across throughout a variety of conversations , and it 's helpful to know what they mean .
My best advice I can give you is : 1 ) .
Listen well before you speak , many parts of the country differ on their protocols and terminology .
2 ) . Always be polite 3 ) .
Minimize the " Slang " .
When you talk to someone on the radio , use it like you would a telephone with one added restraint - do n't use profanity .
It does n't take a BIG man to swear , it 's takes a BIG man to convey his thoughts and feelings WITHOUT swearing .

An incorrect impedance match can cause some of the transmitted signal to " reflect " back to the transmitter , which can reduce your signal , and possibly damage the Finals section of your transmitter .

In my opinion , if you have two identical stations , at the same location , with one station having an SWR reading of 1.2:1 and another at 1.7:1 , a receiving station at the other end , wont see a noticeable difference between the two signals .
Sometimes referred to in the plural sense ( SWRS ) which makes about as much sense as " We " ( see WE in the " W " section ) .

Phil Wilson MP tells why he is speaking about the mining heritage of County Durham at a Hope Not Hate rally in his Sedgefield constituency today .
THERE are still rows of colliery terraces in the former mining villages around Sedgefield .
Where housing is not terraced , there are estates of council - built homes .
I grew up on one of those estates in Trimdon .
I remember that , back in the Sixties , my dad and almost every other man of working age along our street worked down the local colliery .
Entertainment was also a shared experience .
The working men ’s club , now the Labour Club , was the social hub of the village .
The club hosted the leek show ; the pigeon lads met there and still do .
One day every summer , the club organised a family day out .
Twenty buses would drive in convoy the 20 miles to Redcar beach .
Community spirit was strong .
Still is .
During the coal mining era community was a necessity because for many people self - help was n’t enough .
For example , at least 1,560 men and boys lost their lives down the many collieries in Sedgefield .
The community had to rally round to help those families pull through .
The shared lives of those generations led to shared values .
Compassion and solidarity can be traced through the genetic code of the local people .
The union lodges , one for each colliery , were the basic building blocks of the code .
They were the centres where compassion ensured that the sick and aged were provided for , where solidarity meant defending the many .
Co-operation was the watchword .
Each lodge had its own identity expressed through the famous banners carried through the streets of Durham City on Big Meeting day .
Each banner was an expression of the miners ’ hopes and values .
They contained emblems portraying scenes from the colliery , portraits of political leaders and religious symbolism .
Each had a motto .
For example , Deaf Hill ’s expressed its faith in the parable of the Good Samaritan , “ Go thou and do likewise ” ; Trimdon Grange ’s was “ Unity is Strength ” .
One of my favourites is from my father ’s colliery of Fishburn : “ The cause of labour is the hope of the world ” .
The banner became as important to the miners as a flag to a regiment .
Years after the collieries closed , the banners still hang on the walls of local community centres .
They are still taken down on special occasions , such as the Big Meeting , to be paraded once again as a symbol of local values .
Mottos sewn into the fabric of the banners need to be articulated in a different way for a new generation which remembers little of those times .
There must be no appeal to nostalgia , yet the language of new Labour needs to be given an accent understood by those who feel left behind as well as by those who have moved on .
It is 16 years since the last colliery in the Durham coalfield closed .
Communities are not broken .
People are relatively better off and their needs are changing .
Club life is not as vibrant and there is no longer the communal trip to the seaside .
Instead , today , the equivalent to my dad ’s record player , which could stack six LPs , is an iPod .
To hold a conversation is to text .
But even as times change , some things stay the same .
Nothing could be more profoundly true than the values proclaimed on those banners .
Compassion and solidarity are still needed because self - help is still not enough .
As Labour learns to articulate for a new generation , some in communities where the mining values gained foundation look for another set of standards where compassion is made callous and discord replaces solidarity .
CHANGE has breathed life into the far right , especially in those communities where industrial change has been the most dramatic .
But for all the extremists proclaim that they are the saviours of the white working class , they are the complete opposite to every sentiment on every lodge banner carried through the street of Durham on every Big Meeting day from the 19th Century to the 21st .
The far right and the British National Party are a canker on the soul of the white working class .
I know they will not succeed because at every Big Meeting there is a banner present from the Dean and Chapter lodge in Ferryhill .
The banner ’s emblem is a portrait of three men meeting in friendship .
One is white , one is black and another is Asian .
The motto beneath reads : “ Fellowship is life .
Fellowship for all ” .
The banner , words , portrait and sentiment are of the white working class .
I am proud to be of the white working class too , and I honour the heritage that they created because fellowship is life and fellowship is for all .
■ Today ’s rally at Trimdon Labour Club starts at 9.30 am with a colliery brass band .
Speeches , including one by the Home Secretary Alan Johnson , start at 10.30 am .
Making plans for tolerance
THE lead singer of a seminal Seventies punk band will sprinkle a little showbiz celebrity sparkle on today ’s Hope Not Hate gathering .
Feargal Sharkey was in the Irish band The Undertones and sees parallels between the way the religious divide broke up his community and what is happening now with the rise of the right .
“ I grew up in Northern Ireland through the Sixties and Seventies , where differences of opinion , shall we say , were an every - day event , ”
he said in his trademark , tremulous voice .
“ Someone said that there is no racism in Ireland , as we are all too busy being bigoted with one another !
“ But this has given me some knowledge and experience of the damage that sectarianism can inflict on a community , and of the futile and illogical cycle of division that hatred breeds .
“ Unfortunately , some parts of our society have n’t evolved , but the objective of this modern world should be tolerance for other people , respect for other people regardless of their beliefs , sectarian backgrounds , religions or colour of skin .
Anything that helps that must be encouraged . ”
The Undertones had hits with Teenage Kicks and My Perfect Cousin , before Sharkey went solo and in 1985 had a worldwide No 1 , A Good Heart .
He now heads UK Music , an industry umbrella group , and believes passionately that music can have a key role in bringing communities together .
“ Music is one thing that we all have in common : we all like it , ” he said .
“ The whole idea of music bridging divides and combating racism is something with a fine tradition – just look to the civil rights protests of the late - Sixties , the Rock Against Racism movement in the late - Seventies . ”
He remembers the region from his touring days .
“ North - East audiences were always hugely affectionate , very warm and welcoming , ” he said .
“ Even if we did n’t get the right chord in the right place they did n’t seem to mind . ”
A tolerant place .
Exclusive : Kakai , Stealthy No More–It ’s a Kindle for Students and Much More
Founded last May , Kakai is one of the start - ups in Silicon Valley in the deepest of stealth modes , despite a panoply of high - profile players involved .
But while there have been sketchy reports suggesting that the start - up may be working on some kind of e-reader , BoomTown has found out exactly what it ’s up to via reports of a concept video the company has shown potential investors and interviews with several sources close to the situation .
In simplest terms , it ’s essentially a Kindle for students .
But that ’s just the tip of what is perhaps one of the more ambitious and innovative efforts on the part of a Silicon Valley entrepreneur who already has one hit under his belt .
That would be Osman Rashid , whose other start - up is fast - growing online textbook rental leader Chegg .
Chegg recently hired former Yahoo ( YHOO ) exec Dan Rosensweig as its CEO , taking over from Rashid , who wanted to focus on Kakai .
Interestingly , you can pretty much draw a straight line from Chegg to Kakai .
But rather than focusing on making an old business better via the Web , as Chegg does , Kakai is plunging right into the competitive tablet market that now includes Amazon ( AMZN ) , Apple ( AAPL ) , Samsung , Dell ( DELL ) , Hewlett - Packard ( HPQ ) and , reportedly , Google ( GOOG ) .
While these efforts , including Apple ’s iPad , for example , are mostly aimed at broader media markets , sources said Kakai ’s effort focuses solely on the educational niche , offering a Linux - based foldable double - screened device .
Gesture - based and portable , it is designed to feel like a mix of a notepad and a book .
While Kakai declined to comment , sources said a key part of the endeavor goes well beyond the tablet itself by including robust software and seamless
Web site to deliver course material , allowing for note - taking and offering other audio and video capabilities .
Santa Clara , Calif . - based Kakai , which is nearing 50 employees , is now prepping the device to be ready for a demo in several months .
It ’s paying for all this with almost $ 10 million in funding from prominent venture players like Andreessen Horowitz and First Round Capital , along with investors Mike Maples and Ron Conway .
In addition , Marc Andreessen is now on Kakai ’s board .
Rashid , who founded Kakai with Babur Habib , has worked in companies related to the consumer electronics industry .
Until he reveals more specifics , though , do n’t expect much from Kakai ’s homepage ( see below ) , which has a very funny trio of jokes that play with the company name , asking “ Which Kakai are you looking for ? ”
The possibilities include Kakai Bautista , a singer - comedienne in the Philippines ; Neferirkare Kakai , third Pharaoh of Egypt during the Fifth dynasty ; and Kakai , an Austrian pumpkin that yields valuable oil that promotes prostate health . ”
Not looking for the singer , the pharaoh or the pumpkin ? , ” reads the bottom of the Kakai homepage .
“ Well , we wish we could tell you more , but you ’ll just have to cool your jets . ”
Perhaps now it ’s time to start heating them up .

On the Aberdeen Peninsula , at the westernmost point of the little African country of Sierra Leone , there stands an elegant lighthouse .
It was built by the Portuguese more than 200 years ago to guide ships from the Atlantic into Freetown , the best deep - water harbour for 1,000 miles or more .
The haven is the reason that a British colony of freed and rescued slaves was founded here in 1792 .
But now the plastered walls of the structure are crumbling and pieces of crucial ironwork have fallen to the ground .
The lighthouse keeper , Yamba Banday , told me he could n't get up the collapsed stairs to service the workings of the light .
The generator and its back - up had failed and so the light was now connected to the city power supply – which frequently gives out – by a simple domestic cable .
In fact , Banday agreed sorrowfully , the light was less reliable now than at any time since the Portuguese built it .
" This is the sad truth about our country , " he said .
" Everywhere you look , there 's always more to be done . "
But things had improved a lot , he agreed , since we had last met .
That was 10 years ago , when Sierra Leone was in the grip of a notoriously savage civil war and the capital itself was under threat .
Banday remembered the sudden arrival in May 2000 of a British force – some had come ashore on the beach opposite the lighthouse – of paratroops and Royal Marines .
Under David Richards ( then a brigadier , now chief of the general staff ) , Operation Palliser was first billed as a simple evacuation mission for expatriates .
But that was a nervous Downing Street cover story .
The real task was to bolster a UN operation that was on the point of losing control of Freetown to the vicious militias that controlled most of the country and had taken hundreds of peacekeepers hostage .
There was no strategic or commercial interest in the adventure , and none among the British public ; this was the Blair / Cook " foreign policy with an ethical dimension " in its purest , most altruistic form .
But the Sierra Leone intervention worked – uniquely well , in the history of modern military interventions in Africa .
The rebel forces were scared away from the city , the UN got off its knees and the government army was revitalised .
Eighteen months later , Sierra Leone 's 11 - year civil war was brought to an end .
In the streets of Freetown at the time the graffiti read : " Queen Elizabeth for king ! " and " Return to us our colonial mother ! "
Tony Blair remains more popular here than anywhere else on the planet .
He still visits the country every couple of years , and officials from his office are seconded into the finance and health ministries .
Several Sierra Leoneans said they would personally campaign for Blair to be the country 's president .
A young Freetown documentary - maker , Arthur Pratt , told me : " We think we are to him as a favourite child . "
Robin Cook promised that Britain would " rebuild Sierra Leone " .
Today it receives more British aid money per capita than any other country in Africa .
Has this aid done any good ?
On most conventional indicators , Sierra Leone is still what it was 10 years ago – one of Africa 's poorest countries , with the worst maternal mortality rates in the world .
One in eight Sierra Leonean women dies in childbirth .
But 10 years on we drove to the diamond - mining district of Kenema , source of much of Sierra Leone 's troubles , on an immaculate new road built by the Chinese .
It was almost empty of cars , but on the verges a new business had sprung up – old ladies selling piles of rocks they had gathered from their fields to passing construction workers .
In 2000 , Freetown 's Aberdeen Peninsula was the base of UN peacekeeping operations and the journalists ' hotel .
Now the war - ruined buildings had been turned into red-lantern - hung hotels and casinos with Chinese names .
Even the hotel gardeners were Chinese – the Sierra Leonean gate guard at the Bintumani Hotel told me that the only jobs available for Africans there were security work .
The prostitutes in the casinos and the nearby beaches looked less bedraggled than when they depended on UN peacekeepers for a living .
There were the beginnings of an adventure tourism trade .
There is now a new attempt , organised by the Department for International Development ( Dfid ) with the Sierra Leonean government , to address the problem of basic health services in a country of six million that has 95 midwives and six obstetricians .
I visited some of the health clinics in Freetown that British taxpayers ' money is supporting .
It took me to places such as the slums of Dwarzak Farm that were among the scariest in Africa 10 years ago .
On the compound wall of a clinic in George Brook , the graffiti announced this was " West Side Niggaz " territory .
These were one of Sierra Leone 's chief terrors : teenage gunmen in big shorts , styled straight from hip - hop videos .
They raped and killed , and assisted in the wholesale amputation of hands and arms .
The West Side Boys ' ( the British media felt obliged to rename them ) greatest moment was the kidnapping in August 2000 of 11 soldiers of the Royal Irish Regiment who were training recruits for the government army .
A bloody rescue by the SAS left most of the West Siders dead , as well as one British soldier .
But that turned out to be the last significant event in Sierra Leone 's long civil war .
The graffiti are long faded and people laughed when I asked about it .
" That is history , " said one shopkeeper .
There were successful elections in 2007 and the bullet holes that pocked the grand colonial buildings of downtown Freetown have been plastered over .
Nevertheless , as Arthur Pratt says : " The youth unemployment , the desperate inequalities , are still present . "
Much depends on stability in Liberia , whose own vicious wars have always spilled over into Sierra Leone .
At least the surface diamond fields of Kenema and Kono , which financed rebel movements and encouraged the interference of Liberian dictators , are now exhausted .
I was told , again and again , that the country now knows what war means .
" Everybody smelled the war , everyone felt it , " said Ibrahim Moseray , the dynamic organiser of the Fair Trade cocoa co-op in Kenema ( it supplies British chocolate company Divine ) .
Yamba Banday , ever - confident , said he had high hopes that USAid would come up with some funds to repair the lighthouse .
And he asked me to give his best wishes to Tony Blair .
The Smartest Books We Know
FORTUNE offers the ultimate reading list : 75 books that teach you everything you really need to know about business .
( FORTUNE Magazine ) –
In a perfect world , we 'd each have our own consigliere .
You know , a Robert Duvall , an oracle of Delphi - - someone to follow us around 24/7 and whisper wise words .
Paper , not plastic .
Google , not Infoseek .
No , your boss will not enjoy your Mr. Burns impression .
But wait .
You do have a wise counselor at your disposal -- one that will sit patiently until called upon and even fit in your bag .
It 's called a book .
During the Cuban missile crisis of 1962 , John F. Kennedy took counsel from Barbara Tuchman 's The Guns of August and its account of Europe 's stumble into World War I .
" I am not going to follow a course , " the President told his brother , " which will allow anyone to write a comparable book about this time , The Missiles of October . "
You can't always have the perfect book at the ready .
But you can have the perfect reading list on hand .
Which is why FORTUNE called upon its staffers to select 75 books that will stir your brain -- and maybe even stir you to action .
This is n't some dusty business - book Hall of Fame .
For one , some of these " business books " are n't really about business .
Barnes & Noble might shelve Michael Lewis's Moneyball in the sports section , but it has more to say about investing ( and hiring ) than any consultant 's text .
Also , it 's not boring .
My Years at General Motors is boring -- even if it is a classic .
Some classics we love .
Reminiscences of a Stock Operator was penned in 1923 , but it still holds its own next to Barbarians at the Gate .
Neither of those is a how - to book -- and in general , we 've avoided titles that self - consciously dispense wisdom in favor of those that embed it in a great read .
And there 's nothing better than the source .
Because why read about Warren Buffett when you can read Warren Buffett himself ?
It would , of course , take about 75 years to read everything here .
But here 's our own piece of advice :
Do n't resist starting a book just because you do n't have time to finish it .
Open the cover .
Read the intro .
Skip to Chapter 9 .
Or simply save this list and put it in a drawer .
Because there 's gold in them thar books .
And they 're just waiting for you to mine it .

THE GENERAL THEORY OF EMPLOYMENT , INTEREST , AND MONEY , CHAPTER 12 by John Maynard Keynes ( 1936 ) .
For all his fame as a wordsmith , too much of Keynes 's work is dense and dated .

Trollope 's classic satire about Victorian London , where speculators and trust - fund fops " had but a confused idea of any difference between commerce and fraud , " feels eerily familiar to observers of modern corporate miscreants .
Globalization
BEIJING JEEP : THE SHORT , UNHAPPY ROMANCE OF AMERICAN BUSINESS IN CHINA by Jim Mann ( 1989 ) .

Hamburg Bürgerschaftspräsident tritt nach " Glatteis - Affäre " zurück
Die " Glatteis - Affäre " hat Konsequenzen : Hamburgs Bürgerschaftspräsident Berndt Röder hat seinen Rücktritt erklärt .
Der CDU - Politiker war unter Druck geraten , weil er in einer Privataktion nur in seiner Wohnstraße Schnee und Eis räumen ließ .
Röder entschuldigte sich für seinen Fehler .
South Park is known for pushing the envelope .
But for those of you who watched last night ’s episode “ 201 ” ( a continuation of last week ’s “ 200 , ” a celebration of the 200th episode ) , you may have been a bit confused by the bleeps and image blocks surrounding the animated version of the Prophet Muhammad ( and in a bear costume , no less ) .
Those censors were the result of threats made last week by the New York - based Islamist group Revolution Muslim .
On their website , author Abu Talhah Al - Amrikee wrote that South Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker would “ probably end up like Theo Van Gogh , ” the director who was murdered in 2004 by an extremist over his film Submission .
It focused on the treatment of Islamic women .
Muslims consider any physical representation of their prophet to be sacrilegious , and Al - Amrikee told The Associated Press that his posting was made to raise awareness and prevent this from happening again .
He also said that Stone and Parker “ should feel threatened by what they did . ”
( Note that Revolution Muslim ’s server is currently down . )
This is certainly not the first South Park - related drama to make headlines : the use of the Virgin Mary , Steve Irwin . and the Queen of England have all gotten a rise out of certain viewers , and in 2006 , Comedy Central banned Stone and Parker from featuring Muhammad in an episode .
On their official website , SouthParkStudios , which normally streams full episodes , the following advisory note can be found :
But certainly not everyone views Stone and Parker as the heroic creative types who strive for free thinking .
Former Comedy Central employee Lindsay Robertson describes the creators as “ gigantic assholes . ”
On her Tumblr , she explains :
They owe an apology to every Comedy Central employee they ’ve put in danger in pursuit of their own glory and publicity .
Hopefully , and probably , nothing will happen except a few hundred people having anxiety for a few weeks , but if god forbid something does , it is on Trey Parker and Matt Stone ’s shoulders .
No word as to when the updated “ 201 ” will be live , but we ’re curious to see the unedited version in the midst of all this ruckus .
If you ’re not sick of all this yet , check out Boing Boing ’s interview with Parker and Stone on their 200th episode , and decide for yourself whether they ’re assholes or not .
Winter 's back - at least for a day or so .
Forecasters say temperatures will sink to a brisk minus 8C overnight Thursday , but an emerging cold front will make Friday — and the start of the weekend — feel much colder , a harsh minus 20C .
Throughout the day , the Friday sunshine will be deceiving so remember to wear layers , meteorologists warn , especially since Friday night ’s temperature is expected to dip to a significant low of minus 5C .
Winds will make it feel even colder .
Temperatures will remain about 7 degrees below seasonal norms — meaning no patio weather , especially with rain forecast for Sunday , along with 4C temperatures .
“ It 's still March , so you have to remember , we 're normally not that warm .
We might have had warm weather lately , but it was n't here to stay , ” said Desjanelle Matthews , a meteorologist with Environment Canada .
The good news is temperatures should rise back to double digits by Monday and a high of 13C predicted for next Wednesday , said Dave Phillips , Environment Canada meteorologist .
CAT scan cancer fear : Radiation ' could trigger the disease in one in 80 patients '
Women are at particular risk from CAT scans as they are more sensitive to the effects of radiation
Having a CT - or CAT - scan puts patients at far greater risk of developing cancer than previously thought , scientists claim .
The radiation generated by the scans - an increasingly popular diagnostic tool - may trigger the disease in as many as one in 80 patients .
This is far higher than the often used figure of one in 1,000 - with women at particular risk as they are more sensitive to the effects of radiation .
Researchers now believe the dose of radiation delivered by a CT scan can vary wildly according to where on the body it is used .
In some cases , they suggest , a single scan can be the equivalent of 442 chest X - rays .
Although the scans - CT stands for computed tomography - can be lifesaving in detecting disease or brain damage , the new U.S. study will heighten fears the ' worried well ' paying for them privately could be suffering unnecessary harm .
If the American findings were applied to the UK , it could mean CT procedures are causing thousands more cancer cases than previously thought .
Unlike an MRI scan - which uses magnetic fields and radio waves and has no known harmful effects - a CT scan generates ionising radiation so each dose causes a slight increase in the lifetime risk of cancer .
The scans allow doctors to build detailed 3D images of internal organs , blood vessels , bones or tumours .
They were already known to carry a greater risk than ordinary X - rays , such as those used for breast screening , but the latest research suggests a bigger problem .
It found the dose of radiation received was larger than thought , although this varied according to the part of the body being scanned and the age and sex of the patient .
The researchers concluded there was an average 13 - fold variation between the highest and lowest doses experienced by patients , says a report in the journal Archives Of Internal Medicine .
University of California Professor Rebecca Smith - Bindman , who led the study , said : ' The risk associated with obtaining a CT is routinely quoted as around one in 1,000 patients who undergo CT will get cancer .
' In our study , the risk of getting cancer in certain groups of patients for certain kinds of scans was as high as one in 80 . '
The typical dose delivered by a single CT scan was the equivalent of 74 mammograms or 442 chest X - rays , the professor said .
Researchers reviewed 1,119 patients in San Francisco who had been scanned in three body areas - the head and neck , the chest , and the abdomen and pelvis .
The scientists then worked out the radiation dosage of each scan and estimated the associated lifetime risk of cancer .
A heart examination might involve three scans , looking at different phases of the pumping cycle .
Prof Smith - Bindman said : ' This increases the information that we can get from the CT procedure , but increases the radiation dose by a factor of three . '
She said doctors need to reduce unnecessary use of scans .
In the UK , the Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment does not recommend whole body CT scanning for healthy people because the risks outweigh the benefits .
It advises against CT scans for spinal conditions , osteoporosis and assessing body fat as there are better tests that do not rely on radiation .
Schlechte Noten fürs Grossraumbüro Eine neue Studie zeigt , dass es einem Arbeitnehmer in einem kleinen , eigenen Büro besser geht als den Kollegen im Grossraumbüro .
Diese leiden häufiger – und nannten die grössten Übel .
Gereizte , brennende oder juckende Augen : Angestellte in einem Grossraumbüro .
Wer in einem Grossraumbüro arbeitet , ist häufiger krank und unzufriedener , als jemand , dem ein kleines Büro zur Verfügung steht .
Zudem sind die Grossraumbüro - Arbeitskräfte weniger produktiv .
Das ergab eine Befragung des Seco und der Hochschule Luzern .
Befragt wurden 1230 Personen in 125 Betrieben , wie das Staatssekretariat für Wirtschaft ( Seco ) am Dienstag zu der Studie schreibt .
Ermittelt wurde in der schweizerischen Befragung in Büros ( SBiB ) die Häufigkeit von Beeinträchtigungen aus der Umgebung .
Erhoben wurden die Daten von März bis Mitte April 2009 .
Lärm als grösste Beeinträchtigung
Die am häufigsten genannten Beeinträchtigungen aus der Umgebung waren Lärm im Raum , etwa durch Gespräche und Telefonate im Hintergrund , gefolgt von trockener oder schlechter Luft , Problemen mit der Temperatur , ungenügendem Licht und Zugluft .
Je grösser das Büro war , desto häufiger wurden Zugluft und trockene Luft sowie Lärm im Raum genannt .
In grösseren Büros wurde die Temperatur als zu niedrig , in kleineren als zu hoch eingestuft .
Räume mit Klimaanlagen kamen generell schlechter weg , als solche mit natürlicher Lüftung .
Allgemein stuften die Befragten die Verhältnisse in kleinen Büros besser ein , als in den grossen .
Brennende Augen
Häufigste gesundheitliche Beeinträchtigung der Befragten am Arbeitsplatz waren gereizte , brennende oder juckende Augen , Konzentrationsschwierigkeiten , schwere Köpfe und Kopfschmerzen sowie Müdigkeit .
Diese Symptome nannten Arbeitskräfte in kleinen Büros signifikant seltener als jene in Grossraumbüros .
Bei den arbeitsorganisatorischen Faktoren ergab die Studie ebenfalls deutliche Unterschiede zwischen den Bürogrössen :
In kleinen Büros waren die Angestellten generell zufriedener , unterbrachen die Arbeit weniger häufig und bewerteten die Attraktivität ihrer Arbeitsplatzes höher .
Zudem gaben Personen in solchen Büros häufiger an , ihr Arbeitsplatz erlaube ihnen , produktiv zu sein .
Schalldämmende Trennwände
Grosse Büros verzeichneten mehr krankheitsbedingte Absenzen als kleine .
Das ist gemäss
Seco bezogen auf diesen wichtigen Kostenfaktor ein weiterer Nachteil für Grossraumbüros .
Das Seco kommt zum Schluss , dass in Grossraumbüros der grösste Konfliktfaktor der Lärm ist .
Das sollte bei der Planung und beim Betrieb berücksichtigt werden , etwa durch eine schalldämmende Trennung oder speziell abgetrennte Arbeitsbereiche .
Auch technische Einrichtungen wie Beleuchtung und Lüftung sollten bedürfnisgerecht gestaltet werden .
So könnten die Unternehmen mittel - und langfristig Kosten etwa wegen mehr Absenzen vermeiden , schreibt das Seco .

Presenting the newest wave of nuttiness coming from the secession - minded sovereignty movement :
Republicans push for Minnesota sovereignty Senate Republicans introduced a constitutional amendment Wednesday that would make Minnesota the first state to require a two - thirds majority vote in the legislature to approve federal laws affecting the state .
“ Minnesotans enjoy inherent , natural , God - given rights , ” the bill states , and “ Citizens of Minnesota are sovereign individuals , subject to Minnesota law and immune from any federal laws that exceed the federal government ’s enumerated constitutional powers . ”
The bill was introduced by state Sens. Mike Parry of Waseca , Bill Ingebrigtsen of Alexandria , and David Hann of Eden Prairie , and is a companion to a House bill introduced by Reps .
Steve Drazkowski of Mazeppa , Bruce Anderson of Buffalo , and Tom Emmer of Delano last month .
At least when so - called " tenthers " claim state sovereignty under the tenth amendment , they have a thin connection to the U.S. Constitution .
But this ?
This idea -- that State Legislatures have the power to approve acts of Congress -- is absolutely unconstitutional .
In our constitutional system , when Congress passes a bill it goes to the President , who can veto it or sign it into law .
If that bill is vetoed , Congress can override the veto .
And if the bill becomes law -- either through a presidential signature or a veto override -- it is the law of the land , unless the Federal court system invalidates it .
Anyone who believes state legislatures have the power to approve individual acts of Congress has zero understanding of the U.S. Constitution .
This is an idea that could only be embraced by the lunatic fringe , and the fact the state senators who are proposing it belong to the Republican Party underscores the fact that inside the GOP , the lunatic fringe is the new mainstream .
Hot on the heels of my Phonon PulseAudio integration , here is another set of patches for kdemultimedia that adds PulseAudio support to KMix \o /
Quick screenie before a more detailed description :
What does this mean ?
Well it means you will typically get three or four tabs in KMix that represent ( in order ) , " Playback Devices " , " Capture Devices " , " Playback Stream " and " Capture Streams " .
All the physical ( and virtual ) cards ' output " sinks " will appear under " Playback Devices " .
I 'm sure the names are pretty obvious so I wont explain further !
The functionality is close to pavucontrol , but with three important exceptions :
There is no equiv of the " Configuration " tab to change " Profile " for a given card .
There is no way to change " Ports " for a given Sink / Source ( not all sound hardware supports this and it is intended to make this automatic in some cases - i.e.
Headphone Jack Sensing - once it becomes reliable upstream in ALSA , but sometimes it will still be user choice ( e.g. Amplified vs. Non-Amplified ) )
There is no way to move an given application from one output to another .
For 1 and 2 I intend to ( eventually ) provide a KCM to go alongside the Multimedia tab .
For 3 you can move " categories " of applications to different devices via the Phonon settings in System Settings ->
Multimedia already thanks to my previous patches .
Where can I get it ?
It 's already in Mandriva Cooker or you can grab it from my Git repo here : http://colin.guthr.ie/git/kdemultimedia/log/?h=pulse
The master branch is upstream svn .
The pulse branch is my changes .
Do a clone then issue :
git diff master .. pulse >mypatch.patch
or just build it directly .
Hopefully it'll be committed to trunk soon and if all goes well it can be easily backported to Mandriva 2010 too .
Caveats
Every time a new slider appears it is added to the " Shortcuts " system .
This is OK for hardware devices , but for every application it can get a bit much ....
I 'll try and find a way to disable this ( see " What 's Left " below ) .
PulseAudio supports a pretty crazy limit on the number of channels a device or stream can have .
Kmix only has support for a fairly standard set of elements .
In come cases not all channels of a given device / stream may be shown in kmix due to this limitation .
Stereo -> 5.1 setups should work fine tho ' .
You Suck , I use PA but I want a Real Man's ALSA mixer !
Whatever floats your boat baby !
$ KMIX_PULSEAUDIO_DISABLE=1 kmix
Knock yourself out !
What 's Left ?
I have two remaining issues that I do not think are show stoppers :
Everytime a new device shows up a new Global Shortcut dialog appears .
I do n't think this is any different to ALSA but as I now have per-app volume control , this dialog is also shown everytime a new application plays sound .
It only happens the first time a given application plays a sound , but it could still be considered annoying by some .
If there are no capture streams running at startup the tab for that will never be displayed - likewise if the stream restore module in PA is not loaded ( unlikely ) the " Playback Streams " tab will never be displayed .
There are various things that could be more efficient ( e.g. refreshing the GUI for a new device or application current redraws all tabs , not just the one that has changed when a new application appears or disappears ) Make KMix dumber !
KMix is pretty clever and it tries to do some smart things like saving and restoring volume for you .
But when PA is used , it knows better , so I need to ensure that KMix does not do any saving / restoring of actual volume values .
Use application icons for per-application streams .
Just for eye candy , it would be nice to use the applications own icon in the GUI .
Most insulin- secreting pancreatic β- cells are irreplaceably lost in type 1 diabetes .
In a mouse model , pancreatic α- cells seem to sacrifice their identity to replenish the low stock of β- cells1 .
Two experts discuss what this means for understanding the basic cell biology involved and its relevance to treating diabetes .
boxed - text
The paper in brief Thorel et al . 1 ( page 1149 of this issue ) chemically destroyed more than 99 % of β- cells in adult transgenic mice .
The mice were kept alive with insulin treatment , and β- cell regeneration was studied .
Replication of the rare surviving β- cells could not account for the regenerated population .
Instead , the new β- cells arose from direct reprogramming of pancreatic α- cells .
190,000 time - lapse movies of 19 million cell divisions were generated .
Kenneth S. Zaret
Pancreatic α- and β- cells are normally very stable : the cells live for a year or more , and when they divide , α- cells make α-cells and β- cells make β- cells .
However , various types of damage to the pancreas and other internal organs can cause unexpected changes in cell type .
In rats , for example , a toxic diet can cause liver cells to form in the pancreas2 and intestinal cells to form in the liver3 .
Also , chronic tissue damage such as that caused by stomach - acid reflux into the oesophageal epithelium can lead to similar abnormal cell - type changes , as well as cancer4 .
For the most part , these ' transdifferentiation ' phenomena have remained at the fringes of cell biology , largely because the events are rare and the initiating cells in which the conversions occur were not identified .
Thorel and colleagues ' study1 provides a notable advance because the authors were able to genetically mark and follow the conversion of α - cells to β- like cells under conditions of extreme damage to the pancreatic β- cells ( Fig. 1 ) .
Their observations set the stage for dissecting and controlling the cell - conversion process .
Figure 1 : A helping hand from α-cells .
The islets of Langerhans in the pancreas contain both insulin- secreting β- cells and glucagon - secreting α-cells .
Insulin lowers the level of glucose circulating in the bloodstream , whereas glucagon has the opposite effect .
Thorel et al.1 used diphtheria toxin to destroy almost all pancreatic β- cells in mice .
The authors ' cell - lineage tracing indicates that , following treatment with insulin over time , a population of α- cells passes through a bihormonal step ( producing both insulin and glucagon ; green cells ) before becoming new β- cells .
Full size image
Is the generation of β- like cells from α-cells , after extreme β- cell damage , a mechanism of last resort that has evolved for the animal 's survival ?
In times of starvation , animals may eat food far outside their normal diet .
Toxic substances that are thereby ingested could acutely damage vital organs , favouring extreme mechanisms of regeneration that might result in cells that are only partially functional .
Alternatively , could it be that the emergence of the β- like cells reflects an inherent plasticity of the differentiated state that , although fascinating to biologists , has no true physiological advantage ?
In either case , understanding the signals that elicit such regeneration could provide unexpected insight into ways of manipulating cell differentiation for regenerative therapy .
Specifically , defining the crucial extracellular components that initiate and maintain α- cell to β- cell conversion , as well as the necessary response pathways within the α-cell , should allow the conversion process to be enhanced by adding appropriate agonists of β- cell fate and antagonists of α - cell fate .
( Such information might be more easily gleaned from in vitro assays of the α- to β- cell conversion . )
The relevant signalling pathways would probably include those involved in the initial selection of α- and β- cells from their common progenitors during development , and pathways associated with sensing local damage and triggering inflammatory responses in the relevant tissue .
Thorel and colleagues ' approach to cell reprogramming differs strikingly from those used previously 5,6 , which typically involved virus - mediated introduction of regulatory genes to short - circuit a differentiated state and convert cells directly to another fate .
The use of viral vectors can lead to unwanted inflammatory effects , which themselves may facilitate cell conversion7 .
It is important , therefore , to understand the signalling milieu in both of these contexts 1,5,6 .
Such information could help to enhance the generation of β- cells from stem cells , rather than from their sister α- cells .
Until there is a cure for type 1 diabetes , we are not in a position to reject any unforeseen means by which β- cells can be regenerated .
Morris F. White
Pancreatic β- cells secrete insulin , a hormone that is essential for the maintenance of physiological levels of blood glucose .
In diabetes , β- cells are destroyed ( type 1 diabetes ) or their numbers and function are insufficient to compensate for insulin resistance ( type 2 diabetes ) .
Both types of diabetes result in abnormally high blood glucose levels and can cause kidney , eye and nerve damage , as well as cardiovascular disease .
Finding ways to restore the pancreatic β- cell population in patients with type 1 diabetes , or replace dysfunctional β- cells in patients with type 2 disease , is a challenging problem of top clinical priority .
The transplantation of donor islets of Langerhans might eventually work , but this strategy is impractical in the near future , because high - quality donor islets are in short supply and have a limited useful lifespan after transplantation .
So new ways to come up with healthy β- cells and cure diabetes are under investigation in laboratories around the world ; these approaches include inducing the generation of β- cells from embryonic stem cells , the replication of existing β- cells and the conversion of other pancreatic cells into functional β- cells8 .
There has been progress on all fronts , especially in identifying transcriptional programs and signalling cascades that can be exploited to make β- cells from stem cells9 .
But Thorel et al.1 avoided investigating elaborate cell - based or pathway - based strategies for coaxing stem cells into β-cells .
Instead , they carefully manipulated mice to show that mammals facing a fatal shortage of β- cells due to damage to the islets can restore them naturally by converting pre-existing glucagon - producing α- cells into insulin - producing cells — at least when an autoimmune response typical of type 1 diabetes is out of the picture .
The process is slow , taking nearly five months before there are sufficient numbers of β- cells to control glucose levels .
And no cell division is involved , as all the new β- cells come from pre-existing α- cells .
Previous experiments10 , in which most of the pancreas was surgically removed to approximate β- cell deficiency , indicated that β- cell regeneration occurs by the replication of pre-existing β- cells .
So what determines the pathway to regeneration ?
The transdifferentiation process observed by Thorel et al. might arise because α-cells are completely spared the damage inflicted by the diphtheria toxin , whereas β- cells are almost totally destroyed .
But even so , it seems odd that , once new β- cells have been made from the conversion of α- cells , β- cell replication does n't take over to further expand their repertoire .
Eventually , it might also be important to replace the converted / depleted α-cells to maintain a correct glucagon–insulin ratio .
Although some of the new cells seem to produce both insulin and glucagon , suggesting that the conversion is difficult to achieve completely ( Fig. 1 ) , Thorel and colleagues ' result is truly surprising .
It reveals a previously unknown flexibility in the functioning of the pancreas in relation to hormone secretion , with the potential for exploiting it to cure diabetes .
Indeed , an ideal solution would be to produce an oral medicine that could orchestrate this process1 reproducibly and quickly in humans , and drive the total conversion to β-cells to avoid problems created by the co-secretion of insulin and glucagon .
The possibility of pursuing this work1 as a starting point for research into alternative therapies for diabetes is especially intriguing , because , in patients with diabetes , α-cells are usually healthy and abundant .
So the inter - conversion of α- to β-cells could provide a revolutionary approach to curing diabetes .
But we 're not there yet , and tough roadblocks lie ahead before such an approach becomes feasible .
As with all strategies , the destruction of new β- cells through autoimmunity in patients with type 1 diabetes will need to be managed .
And it remains to be seen whether sufficient β- cells differentiate and survive in patients to cure their diabetes for life .
Let us hope that Thorel and colleagues ' work sparks other studies to achieve such a cure .
Box 1 : The paper in brief Thorel et al .
1 ( page 1149 of this issue ) chemically destroyed more than 99 % of β- cells in adult transgenic mice .
The mice were kept alive with insulin treatment , and β- cell regeneration was studied .
Replication of the rare surviving β- cells could not account for the regenerated population .
Instead , the new β- cells arose from direct reprogramming of pancreatic α- cells .

A special award to the first politician to argue that young women should be getting up the duff rather than married for the benefit of society , and full marks to the first one that realises that such complex social problems ca n’t be solved by simple solutions whether that be marriage , pregnancy or whatever else is flavour of the month ( Americans : ‘ up the duff ’ is British slang for ‘ blessed with child ’ ) .
Motherhood and criminal desistance in disadvantaged neighborhoods Criminology , Volume 48 Issue 1 , Pages 221 – 258 Derek A. Kreager , Ross L. Matsueda , Elena A. Erosheva Evidence from several qualitative studies has suggested that the transition to motherhood has strong inhibitory effects on the delinquency and drug use trajectories of poor women .
Quantitative studies , however , typically have failed to find significant parenthood or motherhood effects .
We argue that the latter research typically has not examined motherhood in disadvantaged settings or applied the appropriate statistical method .
Focusing on within - individual change , we test the motherhood hypothesis using data from a 10 - year longitudinal study of more than 500 women living in disadvantaged Denver communities .
We find that the transition to motherhood is associated significantly with reductions in delinquency , marijuana , and alcohol behaviors .
Moreover , we find that the effect of motherhood is larger than that of marriage for all outcomes .
These results support the qualitative findings and suggest that the transition to motherhood ‚Äîand not marriage ‚
Äîis the primary turning point for disadvantaged women to exit delinquent and drug-using trajectories .

Slide from RNC fundraising presentation depicts top Dems as ' The Evil Empire . ' | Courtesy Exclusive : RNC document mocks donors , plays on ' fear '
The Republican National Committee plans to raise money this election cycle through an aggressive campaign capitalizing on “ fear ” of President Barack Obama and a promise to " save the country from trending toward socialism . "
The strategy was detailed in a confidential party fundraising presentation , obtained by POLITICO , which also outlines how “ ego - driven ” wealthy donors can be tapped with offers of access and “ tchochkes . ”
Advertisement
The presentation was delivered by RNC Finance Director Rob Bickhart to top donors and fundraisers at a party retreat in Boca Grande , Florida on February 18 , a source at the gathering said .
In neat PowerPoint pages , it lifts the curtain on the often - cynical terms of political marketing , displaying an air of disdain for the party ’s donors that is usually confined to the barroom conversations of political operatives .
The presentation explains the Republican fundraising in simple terms .
" What can you sell when you do not have the White House , the House , or the Senate ...? " it asks .
The answer : " Save the country from trending toward Socialism ! ”
Manipulating donors with crude caricatures and playing on their fears is hardly unique to Republicans or to the RNC – Democrats raised millions off George W. Bush in similar terms – but rarely is it practiced in such cartoonish terms .
One page , headed “ The Evil Empire , ” pictures Obama as the Joker from Batman , while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leaders Harry Reid are depicted as Cruella DeVille and Scooby Doo , respectively .
The document , which two Republican sources said was prepared by the party ’s finance staff , comes as Chairman Michael Steele struggles to retain the trust and allegiance of major donors , who can give as much as $ 30,400 a year to the party .
Under Steele , the RNC has shifted toward a reliance on small donors , but the document reveals extensive , confidential details of the strategy for luring wealthy checkwriters , which range from luxury retreats in California wine country to tickets to a professional fight in Las Vegas .
The 72 - page document was provided to POLITICO by a Democrat , who said a hard copy had been left in the hotel hosting the $ 2,500 - a- head retreat , the Gasparilla Inn & Club .
Sources at the event said the presentation was delivered by Bickhart and by the RNC Finance Chairman , Peter Terpeluk , a former ambassador to Luxembourg under President George W. Bush .
The RNC reacted with alarm to a question about it Wednesday , emailing major donors to warn them of a reporter ’s question , and distancing Steele from its contents .
“ The document was used for a fundraising presentation Chairman Steele did not attend , nor had he seen the document , ” RNC Communications Director Doug Heye said in an email .
“ Fundraising documents are often controversial .
“ Obviously , the Chairman disagrees with the language and finds the use of such imagery to be unacceptable .
It will not be used by the Republican National Committee – in any capacity – in the future , ” Heye said .
The most unusual section of the presentation is a set of six slides headed “ RNC Marketing 101 . ”
The presentation divides fundraising into two traditional categories , direct marketing and major donors , and lays out the details of how to approach each group .
The small donors who are the targets of direct marketing are described under the heading “ Visceral Giving . ”
Their motivations are listed as “ fear ; ” “ Extreme negative feelings toward existing Administration ; ” and “ Reactionary . ”
Major donors , by contrast , are treated in a column headed “ Calculated Giving . ”
Their motivations include : “ Peer to Peer Pressure ” ; “ access ” ; and “ Ego - Driven . ”
The slide also allows that donors may have more honorable motives , including “ Patriotic Duty . ”
A major Republican donor described the state of the RNC ’s relationship with major donors as “ disastrous , ” with veteran givers beginning to abandon the committee , which is becoming increasingly reliant on small donors .
The party ’s average contribution in 2009 , according to the document , was just $ 40 , and the shift toward a financial reliance on the grassroots may help explain Steele ’s increasingly strident tone toward the Obama Administration .
While the crude portrayal of Obama may be - as Steele ‘s spokesman put it - “ unacceptable , ” other elements of the presentation may be of equal interest to close political observers .
The RNC plans to raise $ 8.6 million from major donors alone in 2010 , less than 10 % of its total 2009 fundraising take , which was primarily from small donors . "
The center of that plan is an extensive , and colorful , schedule of events .
Along with traditional fundraisers with conservative luminaries including Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol and former presidential candidate Steve Forbes , the party plans to raise $ 80,000 for a trip to London to meet David Cameron , the British Conservative Party leader , on September 17 .
The RNC ’s “ Young Eagles ” – younger major donors and the only group , according to a major donor , continuing to pull its weight financially – are invited to a “ professional bull riding event ” in October , expected to raise $ 50,000 , and to a no-holds - barred Ultimate Fighting Championship fight in Las Vegas the same month , expected to raise $ 60,000 .
The RNC ’s aim , according to one section of the document : “ Putting the Fun Back in FUNdraising . ”
CORRECTION : The RNC raised a total of $ 81 million in 2009 .
An earlier version of this story understated that figure .
India signed five deals Friday to purchase more than $ 7 billion in hardware and expertise from Russia , including an aircraft carrier , a fleet of MIG - 29 fighters , defense and space technology and at least 12 civilian nuclear reactors .
On the minds of both parties , analysts said , was a nation not present at the signing .
“ China will be the ghost in the room , ” wrote analyst C. Raja Mohan in an opinion piece this week in the Indian Express .
Having a working aircraft carrier -- India ’s only carrier , the 50 - year - old British - built Viraat , rarely leaves port -- should allow India to expand its presence in the Indian Ocean .
India has watched China in recent years forge strategic port alliances with Pakistan , Sri Lanka and Myanmar as part of Beijing ’s South Asian “ string of pearls ” strategy .
China does n’t have an aircraft carrier , although U.S. intelligence reports suggest it could within five years .
Nor is it expected any time soon to base military craft in the Indian Ocean .
But Beijing is heavily outspending India on defense and is keen to safeguard its seaborne oil trade with the Middle East , a lifeline for its hyper - charged economy .

“ China is not now in the Indian Ocean , but we do n’t know what will happen in 15 years , ” said Rahul Bhonsle , a retired Indian brigadier general and head of Security - Risks.com , a military analysis firm .
“ They ’ve already showed their capabilities in the Pacific , and we need to be ready . ”
Russia is also concerned about China ’s expansion .
Although Moscow and Beijing recently settled several long - simmering border disputes , China ’s growing economic and political clout has Russia looking over its shoulder , particularly amid fears of encroachment in its sparsely populated Far East region .
Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin , who met with senior Indian officials , including Prime Minister Manmohan Singh , wants India - Russia trade to expand to $ 20 billion a year by 2015 from the current $ 8 billion .
Russia sees India as a strategic counterweight to China .
Moscow and New Delhi also have a shared interest in tamping down regional violence , drug production and Islamic fundamentalism in South Asia .

As China and the rest of East Asia grow ever - thirstier for energy , the Indian Ocean has grown in strategic importance .
About 60 % of the world ’s oil moves past India ’s shores .
The Russian carrier Admiral Gorshkov is slated for delivery in 2012 with a complement of 45 MIG - 29 fighter jets .
Having the ship also will allow India to send adversary Pakistan a message when it sees fit .
The nuclear - armed neighbors have fought threemajor wars since their division in 1947 .
“ A carrier puts constraints on whatever Pakistani naval capacity , especially if they come close to our shores , ” said Kanwal Sibal , a former Indian foreign secretary .
“ We can keep watch on Pakistani subs and other boats they have that may be up to no good . ”
Friday ’s carrier deal follows years of broken promises and hurt feelings .
In 2004 , Moscow agreed to sell the carrier and 16 MIG - 29 fighter jets for $ 1.5 billion .
Advertisement
Three years later , however , it upped the price to about $ 2.5 billion .
India stewed , but eventually -- with few alternatives and the Viraat rapidly becoming a museum - in - waiting -- agreed to Friday ’s estimated $ 2.34 billion price tag .
Russia has for decades supplied about 70 % of India ’s military hardware .
Indian attempts to develop indigenous weapons programs have been beset by technical problems , cost overruns and lapsed deadlines .
In the last decade , India has acquired more U.S. and Israeli weaponry .
But its arsenal of Russian weapons guarantees significant contracts for Moscow to provide maintenance , replacements and parts for some time .
India also agreed Friday to acquire 29 additional MIG - 29s for $ 1.9 billion .
The two nations are mulling joint development of a military transport aircraft and a fifth - generation fighter .
Advertisement
Putin also played salesman for his nation ’s MIG - 35s .
India ’s air force is shopping for 126 fighter jets , valued at about $ 11 billion .
International rivals for the contract include Lockheed Martin ’s F - 16 and Boeing ’s Super Hornet .
On the civilian nuclear front , Russian and French firms enjoy an advantage , given that U.S. companies were not allowed to supply reactors and related technology until 2008 , when Indian and American officials hammered out a civilian nuclear agreement .
Energy - hungry India is expected to sign at least $ 150 billion worth of nuclear power deals in coming decades .
State - backed Russian firms are already involved in building four reactors here and are looking for more opportunities .
“ We need energy from anywhere and everywhere , ” said C. Uday Bhaskar , director of the New Delhi - based National Maritime Foundation , a think tank .
“ Russia has been a source for a long time , although I ’d imagine India ’s direction should also energize the industry in America . ”

Static apnoea , as practiced by Stephane Mifsud ( Image : Philippe Joachim / UWPress.com )
Most people find it hard to hold their breath for more than a minute , so imagine the extreme self - control Stephane Mifsud mustered on 8 June last year when he held his breath for 11 minutes and 35 seconds , setting a new world record for stationary breath - holding , or “ static apnoea ” .
Competitors float face down in a chilled pool , not to stop them cheating but to induce the mammalian diving reflex : when your face is submerged in cold water , outer blood vessels constrict , directing blood away from the extremities and towards the heart and brain .
Your heart rate slows , reducing the rate at which oxygen is pumped around the body .
With training , experienced breath - holders can drop their heart rate by twice that of non-divers upon immersion in cold water .
Hyperventilation before a prolonged breath - hold is also vital .
This is because the brain monitors the amount of carbon dioxide in the blood to decide when to trigger the gasp reflex .
Purging this CO 2 with rapid deep breathing increases how long you can go before the urge to gasp becomes irresistible .
Having large lungs is a natural advantage .
So have we reached the breath - holding limit yet ?
Not at all , says physiologist Johan Andersson at Lund University in Sweden , who studies the effects of breath - holding in divers .
“ Elite breath - hold divers expect the limit to be extended to about 15 minutes before record - setting will level off . ”
They may be dicing with danger , though .
Andersson found that static apnoea attempts on dry land caused a brief 37 per cent rise in the level of …
A large meteor blazed across the midwestern U.S. sky Wednesday night .
Igniting over Wisconsin , Iowa , Illinois , and Missouri around 10:15 p.m. , local time , the fireball briefly turned night to green - tinged day and unleashed a sonic boom heard for hundreds of miles around .
Based on video of the fireball , astronomer Mark Hammergren thinks the meteoroid — the space rock that causes the meteor , or fireball — may have been up to six feet ( 1.8 meters ) wide and weighed roughly a thousand pounds ( 453 kilograms ) or more .
" One of the misconceptions about bright meteors is that they 're due to very tiny objects , " said Hammergren , of the Adler Planetarium in Chicago , who did n't catch the fireball sky show himself .
But " if something is bright enough to light up the sky like daytime and cause sonic booms throughout the entire area , it 's big .
It was major , " he said .
" If it was daytime , people would have undoubtedly seen smoke trails . "
Video : Meteor Over Midwest , April 14 ( Via YouTube )
The fireball 's greenish color came from a combination of the heating of oxygen around the meteoroid and the mix of minerals ignited as the rock enters Earth 's atmosphere .
The color , though , gives no clue to the meteoroid 's composition , Hammergren said .
Determining a space rock 's makeup is more complicated than , say , identifying a metal by holding it over a bunsen burner .
" People see the greenish color and say , Aha , that must be due to copper — I remember that from high school chemistry , " he said .
" That 's not the case . "
Fireball Not Part of Meteor Shower
The annual Lyrid meteor shower is scheduled to begin Friday and peak on April 22 , but the midwestern fireball 's timing is just a coincidence , Hammergren said .
( Related : " Sky Show Tonight : Lyrids Kick Off Meteor Season " [ 2004 ] . )
Meteorites — what meteoroids are called once they reach the ground — are n't associated with meteor showers , which usually result when the Earth passes through the dusty tail of a comet , he said .
( However , that has n't stopped scientists from theorizing that a meteor shower caused Ice Age extinctions . )
The comet debris that results in meteor showers " is thought to be quite weak , almost fluffy material , and it 's usually not very big " — so it 's generally incinerated before it reaches the ground , he explained .
Instead , the Wisconsin fireball was most likely a defector from our solar system 's asteroid belt , the ring of space rocks that lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter , Hammergren said .
Meteoroids from the asteroid belt " come in fairly randomly , and they 're distributed all over the surface of the Earth , " he said .
" Most of them will fall into the ocean , because there 's more ocean on the Earth .
But they can come in any time , day or night . "
Meteor Rock Landed in Wisconsin ?
Based on radar images of the material shed by the meteor during its passage through the atmosphere , Hammergren thinks the bulk of the space rock landed somewhere in Wisconsin .
" It looks like it passed over Livingston [ map ] and continued southeast , " he said .
( See pictures of major meteor craters on Earth . )
Before it hit the ground , the meteor would have fragmented into dozens or hundreds of pieces , each about the size of a football or smaller .
No meteorite injures have been reported as of press time .
Meteorite hunters heading for Wisconsin should n't worry about approaching the solar system souvenirs , Hammergren added .
" The material they 're made of is common rock forming minerals , " he said .
" There 's nothing dangerous about them , nothing poisonous , nothing radioactive . "

My Anticipated 2010 Appalachian Trail Thru -Hike & Atlantic Coast Bike
Tour departure date is Monday , March 1st .
As the departure approaches a focus on March 01 , 2010 as the target date has become firm and only 90 days from now , the date I register on CrazyGuyOnABike .
They say the devil is in the details !
What does that mean !
The details :
The plan ; when I leave my home in Gwinnett County , Georgia I will not return for roughly 10 months .
I will trek the Appalachian Trail ( 2,178 miles ) South to North , from Springer Mountain in Georgia to Baxter State Park in Maine , reaching the summit of Mt. Katahdin sometime in September 2010 .
Then I will take a couple of weeks to explore Canada , perhaps visiting Quebec before making my turn around , exchanging backpack for panniers in Bar Harbor , Maine for my southbound Atlantic Coast bike ride to Key West , Florida ( 2,670 miles ) .
The entire journey will take me through all 4 seasons , leaving with the last 3 weeks of winter 2010 and ending the following winter December 2010 or January 2011 .
The destination Key West , arrival target date is New Years 2011 .
I do want to get through New England in September , October and into the Southern States in November , doing Florida in December .
The objective is to stay ahead of winter while riding the touring bike south .
Starting in October , the prevailing wind direction along the Atlantic coast is from the north for the most of fall and winter .
The wind will be at my back , something every cyclist prays for .
( Of course we know the wind can't read The Weather Almanac , so it will blow from the south from time to time . )
Hurrah !
This thing is going to work ...
The force will be with me !!!!
Traveling North to South in the Fall is really going to work for me !
Whereas in the spring beginning in April and going to October you can expect the wind to shift , blowing in from the south in the spring and summer .
The following includes my inspiration , thoughts and additional details of my planned thru - hike and bike tour :
Here 's how this hiking / biking tour began to take shape .
The book Walking the Appalachian Trail by Larry Luxenberg is the first book I purchased when I first began reading and exploring the options of my own Appalachian Trail thru -hike .
The dream of my very own personal ' adventure of a lifetime ' began to appear as a real possibility , an achievable goal .
Always the optimist , I believe I 'm capable of pulling this off .
In Luxenberg 's inspiring book he writes that the A.T. thru -hike , is ' more like a jumping - off point into the world of adventure . '
He writes ...'
In 1989 , Noel " the Singing Horseman " DeCavalcante completed an A.T. thru -hike .
In 1990 , he paddled the Mississippi River for three and a half months .
That same year , one of Noel 's 1989 hiking companions , Carol " Lagunatic " Moore , happened upon Jim " the Geek " Adams , who was hiking the A.T. with his cat , Ziggy .
The Geek was near the end of what he called " the ultimate triathlon vacation . "
He and Ziggy had paddled the Ohio and the Mississippi the previous fall .
After hiking the A.T. , they would complete their adventure by bicycling from Maine to their starting point in Pennsylvania . '
Having read this and other tidbits of others who were orbited into a continuing grand adventure after first completing an A.T. thru -hike , my own dream and planning began to take form and the idea quickly gained momentum .
By October 2008
I begin setting my course , researching and purchasing backpacking gear .
I commit to a 2010 thru - hike , I purchase a touring bicycle , a Surly Long Haul Trucker , with a plan to ship it to the State of Maine and to follow Adventure Cycling Association 's ( ACA ) Atlantic Coast Bicycle Route from Bar Harbor , Maine to Key West , Florida , with Key West being the final destination .
After contemplating the logistics back to my home in Atlanta , GA .
I come to a decision to take a portion of ACA 's Florida Connector map to create a loop encompassing Fort Lauderdale , Key West and Fort Myers Beach , taking a ferry from Key West to Fort Myers Beach where it is possible to join the Florida Connector .
This sounds like a plan .
I will continue a course picking up ACA 's Southern Tier Route in the Florida panhandle to possibly Pensacola Florida before heading north towards Birmingham , Alabama then east to Atlanta completing a vast and monumental circle .
Thus the final destination is home , however long that takes .
I estimate a total trip time of about 10 months , give or take !
I know I 'll not be the first to ride a bike back from completing an A.T. thru -hike , but I may be the first to travel this long distance home .
When I talk to others about my plans their first response is " that 's so unbelievable , you are crazy " !
Yes , the concept , the plan is amazing , but I know it is so possible !
CrazyGuyOnABike is filled with the odysseys of those who have done what naysayers called impossible !
In my heart and soul , I believe my trek is to be the beginning of a never ending journey , finding that my home is the trail and that home is the open road before me !
Common to the 2,000 - milers is a spirit of adventure .
Everyone who backpacks the A.T. experiences discomfort .
I believe I have the wherewithal to shrug off the unavoidable complaints and miseries , and experience the joys along with the sorrows , blisters , cold , hunger and thirst , while at the same time enjoying panoramic views , and an abundance of good fellowship hiking northbound on the Appalachian Trail .
I believe I can join the energetic wanderers , open to their dreams .
Each requires a powerful impetus to keep going six months , up and down steep mountains , through all kinds of weather .
Only those who can shrug off the miseries and savor the joys of the trail will last .
I 'm discovering that long distant hikers and long haul tour bikers have without a doubt what we call the " free spirit " , they have the optimistic spark in the eye , are self - assured and full of life , they savor with pride the experience of the journey .
Hiking and biking gives you the opportunity to experience the world with all your senses , overcoming physical discomfort and feeling the rush of physical power .
I 've felt this time and again !
I 've experienced smelling the air and noticing how it changes from mile to mile .
hiking / biking is about feeling the wind , the sun , the rain , the heat and the cold on your skin .
It 's about enjoying food as fuel for your body .
It 's all about focusing on the richness of the journey , not the destination .
For as the philosopher says the good traveler has no fixed plans and is not intent upon arriving .
For me a journey is a never ending road , a discovery that there is so much more to bind us together than tear us apart , these are the dreams that we hold in the palms of our hands .
Asians believe that every traveler is looking for some truth about himself or herself .
I 'm told that you can't help but discover truths about yourself while on a long distant hike or long haul bike tour .
As with any challenging endeavor , hiking and riding a bicycle long distances will push you to grow in ways more than physical .
You will become aware of your ability to tolerate discomfort and frustration .
You will learn that you can push yourself farther than you ever thought possible .
Your emotional strength will be challenged and enhanced .
You will find how easy it is to feel satisfied and to be filled up , to appreciate the simple things in life , to become aware of the joy of simplicity .
After reaching the A.T. northern terminus Mount Katahdin , with its panoramic views , which stands alone , the centerpiece of the Maine wilderness , I anticipate a visit into Quebec , Canada in the month of September 2010 .
I know I will follow a course most people will never travel .
But this is my choice to chase a rainbow that is my own adventure of a lifetime , a rediscovery of America .
Beginning the Atlantic coast trek south on the Surly Long Haul Trucker , in the Northeast , United States , per ACA publications I 'll enjoy the flavor of quiet Maine coastal towns , New England villages , the rural countryside , and bucolic Amish farmlands .
Once crossing the Mason - Dixon Line , which is the boundary between Pennsylvania and Maryland , I 'll ride into the South and get some flavor for Civil War history by visiting the battlefields at Fredericksburg , Virginia , and the city of Richmond , Virginia .
Spurs lead into the various larger cities along this route .
Leaving Richmond , I head south through the farmlands of Virginia and encounter some swamps when crossing into North Carolina .
In contrast , I 'll pass through some highly developed areas in Florida to which throngs of tourists flock and where many people have retired .
There are numerous wildlife refuges to see .
Biking the Outer Banks , I 'll have a treat biking along the sandy beaches of the Atlantic Ocean .
Researching this route I 'm assured it can be ridden year - round , but the northern part can be quite cool in the winter , so while pedaling south I 'll have a constant navigational thought of staying ahead of winter .
At present I am right on track with physical , mental and financial preparations as the approaching target departure date nears .
At the age of 56 and after having total hip replacement surgery a little over 2 1 / 2 years ago , I know I must make this journey now !
Now rather than reaching retirement age or declining physical abilities that come with aging and wishing I had done some of the things I 've always wanted to do while younger !
I hear the trail beckoning me !
Calling my name !
My orthopedic surgeon has given me her nod of approval .
I told her the exact nature of my plans , she asked me if I had read Bill Bryson's , " A Walk In The Woods " , she let me know she was aware of the physical demands and encouraged me to go for it .
Also noteworthy is quitting smoking in October 2007 ( 2 yrs . ) .
I 've been hiking , biking , going to the gym the past year and I feel good !
Ahhh Haaa !
Lungs are clear , I 'm fine tuning the body , and clearing the static from my head !
Ready for the flow experience !
So to both young and old adventures , those of you who have dared to dream dreams and make those dreams happen , I give you a high five and a thank you for inspiring me .
Thank you for the powerful motivation you have shown me in your travel stories , books and journals !
I am now ready to make my own trek and journey of rediscovery of America , to live my own dream !
God bless every one of you as you experience yours !
This life is about living every moment of every day -- mentally , physically , and emotionally -- not as a tourist , but as a participant .
While on a long distant trek , what a relief it is to only have a few possessions to worry about .
What will not fit in your backpack or panniers is overflow , you do n't need it .
What fun it is to feel the wind dry the sweat as you hike or bike down a hill .
How wonderful a hot shower feels at the end of a day .
How good simple food tastes .
Thank you for showing me these pleasures can be mine , and that if I want something in life , all I have to do is reach out and grab it .
... MY LIFE IS NOW !
Cheers !

" So many people live within unhappy circumstances and yet will not take the initiative to change their situation because they are conditioned to a life of security , conformity , and conservatism , all of which may appear to give one peace of mind , but in reality nothing is more dangerous to the adventurous spirit within a man than a secure future .
The very basic core of a man 's living spirit is his passion for adventure .
The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences , and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon , for each day to have a new and different sun . "

Anthropologist David Graeber recently sent in his essay on the 5000 year history of debt ( orignally published in Mute and Eurozine ) .
Aside from being an interesting read in general , this effort ( which he is just now finishing as a book ) is an interesting resource for the Eternal Coin and the Long Finance project .
Debt :
The first five thousand years by David Graeber
What follows is a fragment of a much larger project of research on debt and debt money in human history .
The first and overwhelming conclusion of this project is that in studying economic history , we tend to systematically ignore the role of violence , the absolutely central role of war and slavery in creating and shaping the basic institutions of what we now call “ the economy ” .
What ’s more , origins matter .
The violence may be invisible , but it remains inscribed in the very logic of our economic common sense , in the apparently self - evident nature of institutions that simply would never and could never exist outside of the monopoly of violence – but also , the systematic threat of violence – maintained by the contemporary state .
Let me start with the institution of slavery , whose role , I think , is key .
In most times and places , slavery is seen as a consequence of war .
Sometimes most slaves actually are war captives , sometimes they are not , but almost invariably , war is seen as the foundation and justification of the institution .
If you surrender in war , what you surrender is your life ; your conqueror has the right to kill you , and often will .
If he chooses not to , you literally owe your life to him ; a debt conceived as absolute , infinite , irredeemable .
He can in principle extract anything he wants , and all debts – obligations – you may owe to others ( your friends , family , former political allegiances ) , or that others owe you , are seen as being absolutely negated .
Your debt to your owner is all that now exists .
This sort of logic has at least two very interesting consequences , though they might be said to pull in rather contrary directions .
First of all , as we all know , it is another typical – perhaps defining – feature of slavery that slaves can be bought or sold .
In this case , absolute debt becomes ( in another context , that of the market ) no longer absolute .
In fact , it can be precisely quantified .
There is good reason to believe that it was just this operation that made it possible to create something like our contemporary form of money to begin with , since what anthropologists used to refer to as “ primitive money ” , the kind that one finds in stateless societies ( Solomon Island feather money , Iroquois wampum ) , was mostly used to arrange marriages , resolve blood feuds , and fiddle with other sorts of relations between people , rather than to buy and sell commodities .
For instance , if slavery is debt , then debt can lead to slavery .
A Babylonian peasant might have paid a handy sum in silver to his wife ’s parents to officialise the marriage , but he in no sense owned her .
He certainly could n’t buy or sell the mother of his children .
But all that would change if he took out a loan .
Were he to default , his creditors could first remove his sheep and furniture , then his house , fields and orchards , and finally take his wife , children , and even himself as debt peons until the matter was settled ( which , as his resources vanished , of course became increasingly difficult to do ) .
Debt was the hinge that made it possible to imagine money in anything like the modern sense , and therefore , also , to produce what we like to call the market : an arena where anything can be bought and sold , because all objects are ( like slaves ) disembedded from their former social relations and exist only in relation to money .
But at the same time the logic of debt as conquest can , as I mentioned , pull another way .
Kings , throughout history , tend to be profoundly ambivalent towards allowing the logic of debt to get completely out of hand .
This is not because they are hostile to markets .
On the contrary , they normally encourage them , for the simple reason that governments find it inconvenient to levy everything they need ( silks , chariot wheels , flamingo tongues , lapis lazuli ) directly from their subject population ; it ’s much easier to encourage markets and then buy them .
Early markets often followed armies or royal entourages , or formed near palaces or at the fringes of military posts .
This actually helps explain the rather puzzling behaviour on the part of royal courts : after all , since kings usually controlled the gold and silver mines , what exactly was the point of stamping bits of the stuff with your face on it , dumping it on the civilian population , and then demanding they give it back to you again as taxes ?
It only makes sense if levying taxes was really a way to force everyone to acquire coins , so as to facilitate the rise of markets , since markets were convenient to have around .
However , for our present purposes , the critical question is : how were these taxes justified ?
Why did subjects owe them , what debt were they discharging when they were paid ?
Here we return again to right of conquest .
( Actually , in the ancient world , free citizens – whether in Mesopotamia , Greece , or Rome – often did not have to pay direct taxes for this very reason , but obviously I ’m simplifying here . )
If kings claimed to hold the power of life and death over their subjects by right of conquest , then their subjects ’ debts were , also , ultimately infinite ; and also , at least in that context , their relations to one another , what they owed to one another , was unimportant .
All that really existed was their relation to the king .
This in turn explains why kings and emperors invariably tried to regulate the powers that masters had over slaves , and creditors over debtors .
At the very least they would always insist , if they had the power , that those prisoners who had already had their lives spared could no longer be killed by their masters .
In fact , only rulers could have arbitrary power over life and death .
One ’s ultimate debt was to the state ; it was the only one that was truly unlimited , that could make absolute , cosmic , claims .
The reason I stress this is because this logic is still with us .
When we speak of a “ society ” ( French society , Jamaican society ) we are really speaking of people organised by a single nation state .
That is the tacit model , anyway .
“ Societies ” are really states , the logic of states is that of conquest , the logic of conquest is ultimately identical to that of slavery .
True , in the hands of state apologists , this becomes transformed into a notion of a more benevolent “ social debt ” .
Here there is a little story told , a kind of myth .
We are all born with an infinite debt to the society that raised , nurtured , fed and clothed us , to those long dead who invented our language and traditions , to all those who made it possible for us to exist .
In ancient times we thought we owed this to the gods ( it was repaid in sacrifice , or , sacrifice was really just the payment of interest – ultimately , it was repaid by death ) .
Later the debt was adopted by the state , itself a divine institution , with taxes substituted for sacrifice , and military service for one ’s debt of life .
Money is simply the concrete form of this social debt , the way that it is managed .
Keynesians like this sort of logic .
So do various strains of socialist , social democrats , even crypto-fascists like Auguste Comte ( the first , as far as I am aware , to actually coin the phrase “ social debt ” ) .
But the logic also runs through much of our common sense : consider for instance , the phrase , “ to pay one ’s debt to society ” , or , “ I felt I owed something to my country ” , or , “ I wanted to give something back . ”
Always , in such cases , mutual rights and obligations , mutual commitments – the kind of relations that genuinely free people could make with one another – tend to be subsumed into a conception of “ society ” where we are all equal only as absolute debtors before the ( now invisible ) figure of the king , who stands in for your mother , and by extension , humanity .
What I am suggesting , then , is that while the claims of the impersonal market and the claims of “ society ” are often juxtaposed – and certainly have had a tendency to jockey back and forth in all sorts of practical ways – they are both ultimately founded on a very similar logic of violence .
Neither is this a mere matter of historical origins that can be brushed away as inconsequential : neither states nor markets can exist without the constant threat of force .
One might ask , then , what is the alternative ?
Towards a history of virtual money
Here I can return to my original point : that money did not originally appear in this cold , metal , impersonal form .
It originally appears in the form of a measure , an abstraction , but also as a relation ( of debt and obligation ) between human beings .
It is important to note that historically it is commodity money that has always been most directly linked to violence .
As one historian put it , “ bullion is the accessory of war , and not of peaceful trade . ”
The reason is simple .
Commodity money , particularly in the form of gold and silver , is distinguished from credit money most of all by one spectacular feature : it can be stolen .
Since an ingot of gold or silver is an object without a pedigree , throughout much of history bullion has served the same role as the contemporary drug dealer ’s suitcase full of dollar bills , as an object without a history that will be accepted in exchange for other valuables just about anywhere , with no questions asked .
As a result , one can see the last 5 000 years of human history as the history of a kind of alternation .
Credit systems seem to arise , and to become dominant , in periods of relative social peace , across networks of trust , whether created by states or , in most periods , transnational institutions , whilst precious metals replace them in periods characterised by widespread plunder .
Predatory lending systems certainly exist at every period , but they seem to have had the most damaging effects in periods when money was most easily convertible into cash .
So as a starting point to any attempt to discern the great rhythms that define the current historical moment , let me propose the following breakdown of Eurasian history according to the alternation between periods of virtual and metal money :
I. Age of the First Agrarian Empires ( 3500 - 800 BCE ) .
Dominant money form : Virtual credit money
Our best information on the origins of money goes back to ancient Mesopotamia , but there seems no particular reason to believe matters were radically different in Pharaonic Egypt , Bronze Age China , or the Indus Valley .
The Mesopotamian economy was dominated by large public institutions ( Temples and Palaces ) whose bureaucratic administrators effectively created money of account by establishing a fixed equivalent between silver and the staple crop , barley .
Debts were calculated in silver , but silver was rarely used in transactions .
Instead , payments were made in barley or in anything else that happened to be handy and acceptable .
Major debts were recorded on cuneiform tablets kept as sureties by both parties to the transaction .
Certainly , markets did exist .
Prices of certain commodities that were not produced within Temple or Palace holdings , and thus not subject to administered price schedules , would tend to fluctuate according to the vagaries of supply and demand .
But most actual acts of everyday buying and selling , particularly those that were not carried out between absolute strangers , appear to have been made on credit .
“ Ale women ” , or local innkeepers , served beer , for example , and often rented rooms ; customers ran up a tab ; normally , the full sum was dispatched at harvest time .
Market vendors presumably acted as they do in small - scale markets in Africa , or Central Asia , today , building up lists of trustworthy clients to whom they could extend credit .
The habit of money at interest also originates in Sumer – it remained unknown , for example , in Egypt .
Interest rates , fixed at 20 percent , remained stable for 2,000 years .
( This was not a sign of government control of the market : at this stage , institutions like this were what made markets possible . )
This , however , led to some serious social problems .
In years with bad harvests especially , peasants would start becoming hopelessly indebted to the rich , and would have to surrender their farms and , ultimately , family members , in debt bondage .
Gradually , this condition seems to have come to a social crisis – not so much leading to popular uprisings , but to common people abandoning the cities and settled territory entirely and becoming semi-nomadic “ bandits ” and raiders .
It soon became traditional for each new ruler to wipe the slate clean , cancel all debts , and declare a general amnesty or “ freedom ” , so that all bonded labourers could return to their families .
( It is significant here that the first word for “ freedom ” known in any human language , the Sumerian amarga , literally means “ return to mother ” . )
Biblical prophets instituted a similar custom , the Jubilee , whereby after seven years all debts were similarly cancelled .
This is the direct ancestor of the New Testament notion of “ redemption ” .
As economist Michael Hudson has pointed out , it seems one of the misfortunes of world history that the institution of lending money at interest disseminated out of Mesopotamia without , for the most part , being accompanied by its original checks and balances .
II . Axial Age ( 800 BCE – 600 CE ) .
Dominant money form : Coinage and metal bullion
This was the age that saw the emergence of coinage , as well as the birth , in China , India and the Middle East , of all major world religions .
From the Warring States period in China , to fragmentation in India , and to the carnage and mass enslavement that accompanied the expansion ( and later , dissolution ) of the Roman Empire , it was a period of spectacular creativity throughout most of the world , but of almost equally spectacular violence .
Coinage , which allowed for the actual use of gold and silver as a medium of exchange , also made possible the creation of markets in the now more familiar , impersonal sense of the term .
Precious metals were also far more appropriate for an age of generalised warfare , for the obvious reason that they could be stolen .
Coinage , certainly , was not invented to facilitate trade ( the Phoenicians , consummate traders of the ancient world , were among the last to adopt it ) .
It appears to have been first invented to pay soldiers , probably first of all by rulers of Lydia in Asia Minor to pay their Greek mercenaries .
Carthage , another great trading nation , only started minting coins very late , and then explicitly to pay its foreign soldiers .
Throughout antiquity one can continue to speak of what Geoffrey Ingham has dubbed the “ military - coinage complex ” .
He may have been better to call it a “ military - coinage - slavery complex ” , since the diffusion of new military technologies ( Greek hoplites , Roman legions ) was always closely tied to the capture and marketing of slaves .
The other major source of slaves was debt : now that states no longer periodically wiped the slates clean , those not lucky enough to be citizens of the major military city - states – who were generally protected from predatory lenders – were fair game .
The credit systems of the Near East did not crumble under commercial competition ; they were destroyed by Alexander ’s armies – armies that required half a ton of silver bullion per day in wages .
The mines where the bullion was produced were generally worked by slaves .
Military campaigns in turn ensured an endless flow of new slaves .
Imperial tax systems , as noted , were largely designed to force their subjects to create markets , so that soldiers ( and also , of course , government officials ) would be able to use that bullion to buy anything they wanted .
The kind of impersonal markets that once tended to spring up between societies , or at the fringes of military operations , now began to permeate society as a whole .
However tawdry their origins , the creation of new media of exchange – coinage appeared almost simultaneously in Greece , India , and China – appears to have had profound intellectual effects .
Some have even gone so far as to argue that Greek philosophy was itself made possible by conceptual innovations introduced by coinage .
The most remarkable pattern , though , is the emergence , in almost the exact times and places where one also sees the early spread of coinage , of what were to become modern world religions : prophetic Judaism , Christianity , Buddhism , Jainism , Confucianism , Taoism , and eventually , Islam .
While the precise links are yet to be fully explored , in certain ways , these religions appear to have arisen in direct reaction to the logic of the market .
To put the matter somewhat crudely : if one relegates a certain social space simply to the selfish acquisition of material things , it is almost inevitable that soon someone else will come to set aside another domain in which to preach that , from the perspective of ultimate values , material things are unimportant , and selfishness – or even the self – illusory .
III .
The Middle Ages ( 600 CE – 1500 CE ) .
The return to virtual credit money
If the Axial Age saw the emergence of complementary ideals of commodity markets and universal world religions , the Middle Ages were the period in which those two institutions began to merge .
Religions began to take over the market systems .
Everything from international trade to the organisation of local fairs increasingly came to be carried out through social networks defined and regulated by religious authorities .
This enabled , in turn , the return throughout Eurasia of various forms of virtual credit money .
In Europe , where all this took place under the aegis of Christendom , coinage was only sporadically , and unevenly , available .
Prices after 800 AD were calculated largely in terms of an old Carolingian currency that no longer existed ( it was actually referred to at the time as “ imaginary money ” ) , but ordinary day - to - day buying and selling was carried out mainly through other means .
One common expedient , for example , was the use of tally - sticks , notched pieces of wood that were broken in two as records of debt , with half being kept by the creditor , half by the debtor .
Such tally - sticks were still in common use in much of England well into the 16th century .
Larger transactions were handled through bills of exchange , with the great commercial fairs serving as their clearing houses .
The Church , meanwhile , provided a legal framework , enforcing strict controls on the lending of money at interest and prohibitions on debt bondage .
The real nerve centre of the Medieval world economy , though , was the Indian Ocean , which along with the Central Asia caravan routes connected the great civilisations of India , China , and the Middle East .
Here , trade was conducted through the framework of Islam , which not only provided a legal structure highly conducive to mercantile activities ( while absolutely forbidding the lending of money at interest ) , but allowed for peaceful relations between merchants over a remarkably large part of the globe , allowing the creation of a variety of sophisticated credit instruments .
Actually , Western Europe was , as in so many things , a relative late - comer in this regard : most of the financial innovations that reached Italy and France in the 11th and 12th centuries had been in common use in Egypt or Iraq since the 8th or 9th centuries .
The word “ cheque ” , for example , derives from the Arab sakk , and appeared in English only around 1220 AD .
The case of China is even more complicated : the Middle Ages there began with the rapid spread of Buddhism , which , while it was in no position to enact laws or regulate commerce , did quickly move against local usurers by its invention of the pawn shop – the first pawn shops being based in Buddhist temples as a way of offering poor farmers an alternative to the local usurer .
Before long , though , the state reasserted itself , as the state always tends to do in China .
But as it did so , it not only regulated interest rates and attempted to abolish debt peonage , it moved away from bullion entirely by inventing paper money .
All this was accompanied by the development , again , of a variety of complex financial instruments .
All this is not to say that this period did not see its share of carnage and plunder ( particularly during the great nomadic invasions ) or that coinage was not , in many times and places , an important medium of exchange .
Still , what really characterises the period appears to be a movement in the other direction .
Most of the Medieval period saw money largely delinked from coercive institutions .
Money changers , one might say , were invited back into the temples , where they could be monitored .
The result was a flowering of institutions premised on a much higher degree of social trust . ”
IV .
Age of European Empires ( 1500 - 1971 ) .
The return of precious metals
With the advent of the great European empires – Iberian , then North Atlantic – the world saw both a reversion to mass enslavement , plunder , and wars of destruction , and the consequent rapid return of gold and silver bullion as the main form of currency .
Historical investigation will probably end up demonstrating that the origins of these transformations were more complicated than we ordinarily assume .
Some of this was beginning to happen even before the conquest of the New World .
One of the main factors of the movement back to bullion , for example , was the emergence of popular movements during the early Ming dynasty , in the 15th and 16th centuries , that ultimately forced the government to abandon not only paper money but any attempt to impose its own currency .
This led to the reversion of the vast Chinese market to an uncoined silver standard .
Since taxes were also gradually commuted into silver , it soon became the more or less official Chinese policy to try to bring as much silver into the country as possible , so as to keep taxes low and prevent new outbreaks of social unrest .
The sudden enormous demand for silver had effects across the globe .
Most of the precious metals looted by the conquistadors and later extracted by the Spanish from the mines of Mexico and Potosi ( at almost unimaginable cost in human lives ) ended up in China .
These global scale connections that eventually developed across the Atlantic , Pacific , and Indian Oceans have of course been documented in great detail .
The crucial point is that the delinking of money from religious institutions , and its relinking with coercive ones ( especially the state ) , was here accompanied by an ideological reversion to “ metallism ” .
Credit , in this context , was on the whole an affair of states that were themselves run largely by deficit financing , a form of credit which was , in turn , invented to finance increasingly expensive wars .
Internationally the British Empire was steadfast in maintaining the gold standard through the 19th and early 20th centuries , and great political battles were fought in the United States over whether the gold or silver standard should prevail .
This was also , obviously , the period of the rise of capitalism , the industrial revolution , representative democracy , and so on .
What I am trying to do here is not to deny their importance , but to provide a framework for seeing such familiar events in a less familiar context .
It makes it easier , for instance , to detect the ties between war , capitalism , and slavery .
The institution of wage labour , for instance , has historically emerged from within that of slavery ( the earliest wage contracts we know of , from Greece to the Malay city states , were actually slave rentals ) , and it has also tended , historically , to be intimately tied to various forms of debt peonage – as indeed it remains today .
The fact that we have cast such institutions in a language of freedom does not mean that what we now think of as economic freedom does not ultimately rest on a logic that has for most of human history been considered the very essence of slavery .
Current Era ( 1971 onwards ) .
The empire of debt
The current era might be said to have been initiated on 15 August 1971 , when US President Richard Nixon officially suspended the convertibility of the dollar into gold and effectively created the current floating currency regimes .
We have returned , at any rate , to an age of virtual money , in which consumer purchases in wealthy countries rarely involve even paper money , and national economies are driven largely by consumer debt .
It ’s in this context that we can talk about the “ financialisation ” of capital , whereby speculation in currencies and financial instruments becomes a domain unto itself , detached from any immediate relation with production or even commerce .
This is of course the sector that has entered into crisis today .
What can we say for certain about this new era ?
So far , very , very little .
Thirty or forty years is nothing in terms of the scale we have been dealing with .
Clearly , this period has only just begun .
Still , the foregoing analysis , however crude , does allow us to begin to make some informed suggestions .
Historically , as we have seen , ages of virtual , credit money have also involved creating some sort of overarching institutions – Mesopotamian sacred kingship , Mosaic jubilees , Sharia or Canon Law – that place some sort of controls on the potentially catastrophic social consequences of debt .
Almost invariably , they involve institutions ( usually not strictly coincident to the state , usually larger ) to protect debtors .
So far the movement this time has been the other way around : starting with the ’ 80s we have begun to see the creation of the first effective planetary administrative system , operating through the IMF , World Bank , corporations and other financial institutions , largely in order to protect the interests of creditors .
However , this apparatus was very quickly thrown into crisis , first by the very rapid development of global social movements ( the alter - globalisation movement ) , which effectively destroyed the moral authority of institutions like the IMF and left many of them very close to bankrupt , and now by the current banking crisis and global economic collapse .
While the new age of virtual money has only just begun and the long - term consequences are as yet entirely unclear , we can already say one or two things .
The first is that a movement towards virtual money is not in itself , necessarily , an insidious effect of capitalism .
In fact , it might well mean exactly the opposite .
For much of human history , systems of virtual money were designed and regulated to ensure that nothing like capitalism could ever emerge to begin with – at least not as it appears in its present form , with most of the world ’s population placed in a condition that would in many other periods of history be considered tantamount to slavery .
The second point is to underline the absolutely crucial role of violence in defining the very terms by which we imagine both “ society ” and “ markets ” – in fact , many of our most elementary ideas of freedom .
A world less entirely pervaded by violence would rapidly begin to develop other institutions .
Finally , thinking about debt outside the twin intellectual straitjackets of state and market opens up exciting possibilities .
For instance , we can ask : in a society in which that foundation of violence had finally been yanked away , what exactly would free men and women owe each other ?
What sort of promises and commitments should they make to each other ?
Let us hope that everyone will someday be in a position to start asking such questions .
At times like this , you never know .
SALEM , Oregon –
The sad news has been confirmed .
Jack Herer , author of Emperor Wears No Clothes and renowned around the world for hemp activism , has died at 11:17 a.m. today , Thursday April 15th 2010 , in Eugene , Oregon .
Jack Herer suffered a heart attack last September just after speaking on stage at the Portland HempStalk festival .
The last seven months have proven to be a huge challenge to the man , with several health issues making his recovery complicated .
Jack Herer ’s health has been poor lately , this last week there have been reports of the severity , and an outpouring of prayers on his behalf .
“ It ’s shocking news , even after these last seven , trying months , ” said Paul Stanford , THCF Executive Director .
“ Jack Herer has been a good friend and associate of mine for over 30 years .
I was there when he had the heart attack at our Hempstalk festival and I know he would n’t appreciate the quality of life he ’s endured these last months .
Still he will be greatly missed .
I honor his memory . ”
“ No other single person has done more to educate people all across the world about industrial hemp and marijuana as Jack Herer .
His book is translated into a dozen different languages , it ’s a bestseller in Germany , ” added Stanford .
“ The Hempstalk stage will forever be the Jack Herer Memorial stage .
And , a Memorial is planned to be built where he fell that day , ” Stanford said .
“ His legacy will continue to inspire and encourage for generations to come . ”

Apparently that 's considered " misuse " of the scanners .

Now whether this fellow intentionally misused the equipment for his own perverse kicks or whether he accidentally took a scan out of habit , the young lady was left very shaken :
I can't bear to think about the body scanner thing .
I 'm totally traumatised .
I 've spoken to the police about it .
I 'm in too much of a state to go to work .

Geez .
So how am I supposed to feel once I have to walk through one of these full - body scanners in most airports ?

VATICAN CITY — Pope Benedict XVI , making a rare direct comment on the sexual abuse crisis , promised Wednesday that the Roman Catholic Church would take action to deal with the widening scandal .
During his weekly audience here , Benedict told pilgrims and tourists in St. Peter ’s Square that he met with abuse victims during a recent trip to Malta and “ assured them of church action . ”
“ I shared their suffering and emotionally prayed with them , ” the pope said , describing his visit on Sunday with eight Maltese men who said they had been molested by priests as youths .
After that meeting , the Vatican issued a statement saying that the pope had told the men that the church would investigate the allegations and bring to justice those responsible for the abuse .
It would also “ implement effective measures designed to safeguard young people in the future , ” the statement said .

DISNEYLAND
Paris is investigating after two of its employees committed suicide in the past six weeks .
A Disneyland kitchen chef in his 40s hanged himself at his home in Marne - la - Vallee near Paris last Friday , in an incident which the Disneyland division of French union Force Ouvriere ( FO ) believed was associated with poor working conditions , it emerged today
It followed the death of a 30 - year - old employee at the park , also a chef , who threw himself in front of a train on February 21 .
FO said the staffer was forced to work in " humiliating " conditions after returning to the resort from a period of sick leave .
A day before his suicide , another 22 - year - old worker threatened to kill himself in the attraction park after the announcement of his dismissal .
In a statement , FO slammed " the working conditions and the pressure put on the employees within the business " of Disneyland Paris .
" In this difficult situation , the union requires Eurodisney ... to begin a health and safety inquiry , to communicate to and listen to its employees , " it said .
Questioned by AFP , FO representative Mary Lyn Lesueur admitted that the union had yet to establish a concrete link between the latest employee suicide and work conditions , acknowledging that personal problems also contributed to his death .
" But it is certain that there is a real problem of management at Disney , " she added .
Work - related deaths became a big issue in France last year after it was revealed that France Telecom had been plagued by a spate of suicides .
At least 44 members of staff killed themselves at the company since 2008 , in a phenomenon unions blamed on harsh management culture .

The housing bubble and subsequent crash were the result of extreme incompetence on the part of the country 's top economic policymakers .
Somehow these people could not see , or did not care about , the dangers of an $ 8tn housing bubble .
Unfortunately , economic policymaking is not like most jobs where workers get fired when they make serious mistakes .
In economics , they just keep getting promoted .
Therefore , the people who sank the economy are for the most part the same group of people still designing policy today .
Now this group of incompetent economists is telling the rest of us that we are going to have to endure five more years of high unemployment .
However , the rest of the country should not be forced to suffer even more just because those determining economic policy cannot do their jobs .
We know how to get the unemployment rate down .
Keynes taught us more than 70 years ago that we just have to spend money to eliminate mass unemployment .
People work for money , if the government spends , people will work .
It 's pretty straightforward .
But , the deficit hawks seems to have largely closed this route .
Members of Congress somehow think that they are helping our children by putting their parents out of work .
Fortunately , we can even find a way to create jobs that can keep the deficit hawks happy .
It 's called " work - sharing " .
The basic point is so simple that even an economist can understand it .
Instead of paying workers to be unemployed – in the form of unemployment benefits – we pay workers to stay employed , but work fewer hours .
In effect , to avoid one worker from being laid off , several workers put in somewhat less time on the job and take a small cut in pay .
Germany and the Netherlands have used this path to keep their unemployment rates from rising even though they have experienced steeper downturns than the US .
The way the system works in Germany , a firm will cut back the hours of its workers by 20 % .
The government then replaces 60 % of the lost pay ( 12 % of total pay ) .
The firm is expected to kick in 20 % of the lost pay ( 4 % of total pay ) and the worker ends up taking home 4 % less pay .
In this scenario the worker ends up working 20 % fewer hours for 4 % less pay .
This can mean , for example , that the worker ends up working a four - day week instead of a five - day week .
Given the savings on work - related expenses , like transportation and childcare , most workers would almost certainly end up better off under a work - sharing arrangement than they are now .
While the economy is past its period of rapid job loss , a huge number of workers still lose their jobs each month through the economy 's normal job churning .
Each month , companies lay off or fire close to 2 million workers .
These job losses are largely offset by hiring by other firms , so that the net change in jobs has been a small negative in recent months .
However , if we could just reduce the rate of job loss by 10 % , then it would be equivalent to creating an additional 200,000 jobs a month or 2.4 million jobs a year .
This would get us back to full employment in two years , rather than five or six , as is currently projected .
There are other potential benefits from work sharing .
The reduction in work time could give companies an opportunity to adopt more family friendly work practices .
For example , they could adopt a policy of paid family leave or paid sick days on a trial basis during the downturn .
There would also be environmental benefits to reducing work hours .
Suppose everyone worked a four - day week so that we reduced the number of commutes by 20 % .
This would substantially reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emissions associated with getting to and from work .
The fact that Europeans tend to work far fewer hours than we do is undoubtedly one of the main reasons that their per person carbon emissions are about half of the US level .
There are already 17 states that have work - sharing programmes in place .
There are bills in both the House and Senate that would strengthen these programmes and give support to other states to set up their own programmes .
If Congress is serious about addressing unemployment , it will act on these bills .
Buenos Aires , Argentina ( CNN ) --
Officials in Argentina 's Mendoza province have authorized chemical castration for rapists after a significant increase in sexual assaults last year .
Mendoza authorities convened a scientific legal committee and authorized the voluntary chemical castration by decree .
" By using medication that lowers the person 's sexual desire and with psychological treatment , the person can be reintroduced into society without being a threat , " Mendoza Governor Celso Jaque said .
Eleven convicted rapists in the province have agreed to the treatment in return for reduced sentences .
Several members of the legal committee said the treatment must be voluntary or it would violate international law and Argentina 's constitution .
" Actually , it 's a right they have like I have the legal right to tie my tubes .
I have the right to use contraceptives , " said Nelly Minyersky , a family and bioethics lawyer .
" Also , theoretically , if I go to a doctor and tell him I 'd rather not because it bothers me ... it 's a right . "
But some experts caution that the treatment is reversible and its effectiveness is relative .
" This leaves out a large number of sexual delinquents who have perverted pathologies , " said Enrique da Rosa , a forensic sexologist and psychologist .
" That is to say , I can't have the chemical impulse , the hormonal impulse , but in reality I can enjoy making the victim submit . "
The term " chemical castration " is a misnomer because the practice involves medication , not surgical intervention .
Its effectiveness also stops when treatment is discontinued .
The practice in Mendoza follows measures adopted in several European countries and eight U.S. states : California , Florida , Georgia , Montana , Oregon , Wisconsin , Louisiana and Iowa .
Depending on the success of the program in Mendoza , the rest of Argentina could follow suit , officials said .
With Linh ’s help , Helen finds that Vietnam , a place she once considered “ backward , ” has become home .
She has “ slipped beneath the surface of the war and found the country ” only to grow uneasy with her identity as a war photographer who has gone native .
She finds it “ such a cliché to expose the war , or even wanting to test one ’s self against it , ” yet she risks her life to capture images of the violence around her , sure that “ the sacrifice had been worth it . ”
Helen ’s restlessness and grappling , her realization that “ a woman sees war differently , ” provide a new and fascinating perspective on Vietnam .
Vivid battle scenes , sensual romantic entanglements and elegant writing add to the pleasures of “ The Lotus Eaters . ”

Soli ’s hallucinatory vision of wartime Vietnam seems at once familiar and new .
The details — the scorched villages , the rancid smells of Saigon — arise naturally , underpinning the novel ’s sharp realism and characterization .
In an author ’s note , Soli writes that she ’s been an “ eager reader of every book ” about Vietnam she has come across , but she is never overt or heavy - handed .
Nothing in this novel seems “ researched . ”
Rather , its disparate sources have been smoothed and folded into Soli ’s own distinct voice .
Still , readers familiar with writing about Vietnam might recognize models for Soli ’s characters among the flesh - and - blood photojournalists of the war — Sean Flynn , Henri Huet , Catherine Leroy and Dickey Chapelle , the first American female war correspondent to die in action .
Chapelle , with her signature Australian bush hat , fatigues and pearl earrings , covered the battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa for National Geographic , was captured and jailed for more than a month during the Hungarian uprising and arrived in Vietnam in the early ’60s .
In her 1962 book “ What ’s a Woman Doing Here ? ” Chapelle writes of her work as a correspondent : “ They were stories , yes .
Telling them fed me , yes .
But their substance was not innocent .
I had become an interpreter of violence . ”
Like Chapelle , Helen is acutely ambivalent about her moral position as a war journalist .
She is intent on pondering whether those who represent war — through reporting or photography — are doing anything but replicating the violence they depict .
Does war journalism change public opinion , or does it merely lead , as one photojournalist in “ The Lotus Eaters ” asks , to “ a steady loss of impact until violence becomes meaningless ” ?
Do gruesome images of war foster revulsion and opposition to violence on the part of the public , or do the images simply translate into war porn ?
Soli does n’t offer simple answers to these questions , but leaves her characters in a state of discomfort about their work .
After getting an “ incredible shot of a dead soldier / woman / child ; a real tearjerker , ” the journalists would turn away from one another with “ a kind of postcoital shame . ”
Helen finds that “ in the face of real tragedy , they were unreal , vultures ; they were all about getting product .
In their worst moments , each of them feared being a kind of macabre Hollywood , and it was only in terms of the future that they regained their dignity , became dubious heroes . ”
Yet Helen believes in the redemptive power of her work .
Indeed , she believes that “ every good war picture is an antiwar picture . ”
When accused of being a mere tourist of the war , she is chagrined by the realization that her early months in - country were a charade , a time when she had played at war , when “ the whole country had merely served as backdrop for her adventure . ”
After a short debate , the House voted 128 - 17 in favor of the bill , which implements an expansion of the existing medical marijuana law .
In a November 2009 referendum , 59 percent of voters supported allowing nonprofit dispensaries to open across the state .
Rep. Sally Lewin , R - Eliot , said she worries that , because marijuana is illegal on the federal level , the state should not expand access to it by setting up a dispensary system .
" In my judgment , this is a bill to legalize marijuana use , " she said .
" I believe it 's rather like Swiss cheese , full of holes . "
But Rep. Anne Haskell , D - Portland , shared a personal story about her daughter 's battle with cancer and how much marijuana helped her cope with the nausea caused by intensive chemotherapy .
" There are real people out there for whom this herb has been a valuable resource , " she said .
Last year , medical - marijuana advocates said that while Maine was one of 14 states to allow the use of medicinal marijuana with a doctor 's permission , it was difficult for many people to get it legally .
The law passed in 1999 allowed patients to grow it themselves or to designate someone to grow it for them .
Advocates said that left people no option but to buy it on the black market .
After a successful signature drive and a low - key campaign , Maine voters supported an overhaul to the law that allows Maine to create a dispensary system .
The bill to implement the new system makes several changes to the measure approved by voters .
It limits , at least for the first year , the number of dispensaries to eight across the state .
It gives the state Department of Health and Human Services until July 1 to adopt rules establishing application and renewal fees for patients , care givers and dispensaries .
Dispensary fees will be set by the department , but the bill requires the fee be no less than $ 5,000 and no greater than $ 15,000 per year .
It allows marijuana to be sold to patients in food and " other preparations . "
And , it will eventually require all medical marijuana patients to register with the state -- a system that was voluntary in the original citizen initiative .
All patients will be required to register with the state by January 2011 .
That change concerns the Maine Civil Liberties Union , which believes it violates patient - doctor privacy .
" Cancer and AIDS patients using medical marijuana for months or years will now have to register with the state or risk prosecution , " Maine Civil Liberties Union Executive Director Shenna Bellows said .
" It should be voluntary for patients , especially when state law conflicts with federal law . "
Kathy Bubar , who served on the medical marijuana task force last winter , said the biggest challenge for the state will be setting guidelines for determining which dispensaries are allowed to open in the first year .
" We 've had a ton of inquiries , " she said .
Yet the bill allows only eight , one in each health district throughout the state .
That means heavily populated areas such as York and Cumberland counties will get only one per county .
A large geographical area such as central Maine -- which is defined as Kennebec and Somerset counties -- will also be allowed only one dispensary .
After the first year , the department will review the performance of the dispensaries and decide whether to allow additional ones to open , Bubar said .
Rep. Michael Celli , R - Brewer , voted to support the final measure but said there are many parts of the bill that will have to be changed in the years to come .
" I do feel sorry for anyone on the health and human services ( committee ) for the next 50 years , " he said .
" They are going to get this bill back time after time after time . "
A public hearing on rules to govern the state 's medical marijuana dispensaries will be held in May or June .

The St Petersburg Times in Florida is certain that Charlie Crist , the state 's governor , will tomorrow announce that he is leaving the Republican party and running as an independent for Florida 's vacant senate seat in November .
The paper 's politics blog reports : " Gov Charlie Crist expected to announce Thursday in St Petersburg that he will run as an independent candidate for Florida 's open US Senate seat " .
It explains :
Crist 's nonpartisan bid would allow him to forego an anticipated thrashing by former House Speaker Marco Rubio in the GOP primary and pave the way for a potentially competitive three - way contest against Rubio as the likely GOP nominee and US Rep Kendrick Meek of Miami as the likely Democrat .
That means Florida 's next senator could be elected November 2 with as little as 34 % of the vote , upending the usual quest for mass appeal in an increasingly diverse state of 11 million voters .
Quite what this means for Florida and the Republican party remains to be seen .
Just under two years ago Crist was mentioned as a possible vice presidential running mate for John McCain .
Now he 's out of the party .
It 's a Republican version of Joe Lieberman .
A new dinosaur relative found in Tanzania is the oldest known creature of its kind — a discovery that pushes back the origin of dinosaurs by at least ten million years , paleontologists say .
Dubbed Asilisaurus kongwe , the Labrador retriever - size creature was a silesaur , the closest relatives to true dinosaurs .
The newfound animal lived 243 million years ago , during the middle Triassic period .
Since silesaurs and true dinosaurs diverged from a common ancestor , the two groups should have existed during the same time frame .
But the oldest known true dinosaurs date back to just 230 million years ago .
Finding a silesaur that 's ten million years older makes " a big difference , " said study co-author Christian Sidor , curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture in Seattle .
Asilisaurus 's age suggests that some early forms of dinosaurs must have also been plodding around in the middle Triassic .
( See a prehistoric time line . )
" When people think about dinosaurs , we think about the extreme forms , the ones that have gone off in their ... own weird directions , " such as Stegosaurus and Tyrannosaurus rex , said Thomas R. Holtz , Jr. , a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Maryland , who was not involved in the research .
" But they all came from a common ancestor , and fellows like Asilisaurus help us understand what that original dino state looked like . "
Early Dinosaur Relative an Omnivore ?
Parts of at least 12 Asilisaurus skeletons were found in 2007 in southern Tanzania 's Ruhuhu Valley .
With no intact specimen to study , Sidor and his team had to piece together a composite skeleton .
What emerged looked nothing like what paleontologists had imagined .
Instead of resembling the " typical hatchet - headed , blade - toothed meat - eaters , " Asilisaurus was a light , slender - limbed animal with peg - like teeth and a small beak - like structure on its jaw , the University of Maryland 's Holtz said .
The shape of the beak suggests Asilisaurus tore into tissue , which means the animal might have eaten plants — or both plants and meat , the researchers say .
Mysteriously , the long - tailed animal ran on all fours — even though the vast majority of early dinosaurs were two - legged carnivores , according to the study , to be published tomorrow in the journal Nature .
" It 's making the picture a little bit murkier , because we have a possible herbivore and quadruped very close to the dinosaur lineage , " said study co-author Sidor , who received funding for the research from the National Geographic Society 's Committee for Research and Exploration .
( The National Geographic Society owns National Geographic News . )
Dinosaurs ' World in Transition
In a way , Asilisaurus 's discovery " is an elegant fulfillment of a prediction , " said Christopher Brochu , a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Iowa who also was n't part of the study group .
That 's because paleontologists know dinosaurs belong to the archosaurs .
Within this group , dinosaur ancestors are divided into two main branches : a line that includes silesaurs and shares skeletal features with modern birds , and a line that has more in common with crocodilians .
Since a crocodilian dinosaur - ancestor from the middle Triassic had already been found , unearthing an animal like Asilisaurus was just a matter of time .
But the new research goes beyond that , Brochu said .
" It 's part of a larger , growing realization that the earliest archosaurs were far more diverse than we ever thought . "
( Take a dinosaur quiz . )
In addition to finding Asilisaurus , study leader Sidor and colleagues have already collected several other archosaur species from the Ruhuhu Valley — many more than in other archosaur hot spots .
It 's unknown why the lush , wet valleys of prehistoric Tanzania produced so many strains of dinosaur relatives , paleontologists say .

BAE Systems , a British firm , took the top spot as the world 's largest arms manufacturer in 2008 .
This is largely because the company has pursued a strategy of expanding the American side of its business in recent years .
The next five places and most of the top 20 are made up of American firms that specialise in selling arms or have a defence division .
America 's huge defence budget — it should reach some $ 700 billion in 2010 — provides an inviting target for the country 's home - grown defence industry .

So this is what it looks like in black and white : a week ’s eating and exercising as the restaurant critic of The Times .
It is not entirely representative of everyday life for me .
I was on the road from Wednesday on , eating in a city not my own .
( Guess which one . )
But the amounts I consumed match up to my duties here in New York City , and if there was more running than gym work than there usually is , I imagine the calories burned through exercise are about the same .
The stats : 24,560 calories consumed ; 4,180 calories expended through exercise .

Why Do America 's Churches Support Tyranny ?
By David J. Stewart | September 2008
“ If Tyranny and Oppression come to this land , it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy . ” — James Madison
Tyranny : A form of government in which the ruler is an absolute dictator ( not restricted by a constitution or laws or opposition ) .
The entire basis upon which the Bush Administration invaded Iraq was alleged Weapons Of mass Destruction ( WMD's ) , which have yet to be found .
The American people have been sold one lie after another .
First the Bush Administration blamed Iraq for being involved in the 911 attacks ( which they were n't ) .
Then they claimed that Saddam was a madman who needed to be removed from power ( nevermind the millions killed by Nixon and Reagan ) .
Yet , once Saddam was removed from power , the Bush Administration continued killing and pillaging in Iraq .
To date , there is not one valid reason why America ever attacked Iraq , except to steal their oil .
Congress , nor the American people ever approved of this war .
It 's called " tyranny . "
Is Sarah Palin ’s God a Liar and a War Criminal ?
In June , 2008 , Alaska Governor Sarah Palin , now Republican Senator John McCain ’s choice for his running mate as vice - president , spoke to a group of ministry students at her Wasilla , Alaska Assembly of God Church .
Palin asked these church leaders to pray for soldiers , including her own son , who would soon be deployed to Iraq , in these words : " that our leaders , our national leaders , are sending [ U.S. soldiers ] out on a task that is from God .
That 's what we have to make sure that we 're praying for , that there is a plan and that that plan is God 's plan . "
Would God ’s plan include lying about , and misrepresenting crucial information about , the alleged reasons for going to war against Iraq ?
Would it include commission of the “ supreme international crime ” of waging an unprovoked , unnecessary war of aggression against a nation and its people who never threatened the United States ?
What kind of God would have such a plan ?

Invading Iraq ... " a plan from God " ?
It is disturbing indeed that so many professed Christians nowadays fail to think for themselves and actually believe that God approves of what we 're doing to the Iraqi people .
The Bible teaches in Proverbs 6:16 - 19 that God HATES : a proud look , a lying tongue , hands that shed innocent blood , a heart that deviseth wicked imaginations , feet that be swift in running to mischief , a false witness that speaketh lies , and he that soweth discord among brethren .
The Bush Administration is guilty on all charges .
President George Bush Jr. spit in the face of every American citizen , soldier , veteran and family of killed soldiers when he mocked and laughed at a elite dinner party about not being able to find alleged Weapons Of Mass Destruction .
Clearly , there never were any to begin with , which is why he is joking about it .
The filthy rich people in the room are n't fools , they know exactly what is going on ; but the average American is in complete and utter darkness , duped by the lying newsmedia .
Sadly , this includes most Christians .
People are predictably gullible and prone to go along with the common consensus that 's propagated by the mainstream newsmedia .
The Iraqi War was about stealing Iraq 's oil and gaining control over the nation ...
Greenspan admits Iraq was about oil , as deaths put at 1.2 million " The man once regarded as the world 's most powerful banker has bluntly declared that the Iraq war was ' largely ' about oil .
Appointed by Ronald Reagan in 1987 and retired last year after serving four presidents , Alan Greenspan has been the leading Republican economist for a generation and his utterings instantly moved world markets .
In his long - awaited memoir - out tomorrow in the US - Greenspan , 81 , who served as chairman of the US Federal Reserve for almost two decades , writes : ' I am saddened that it is politically inconvenient to acknowledge what everyone knows : the Iraq war is largely about oil . ' " SOURCE : Greenspan admits Iraq was about oil , as deaths put at 1.2 m | World news | The Observer ( 09 - 16-07 )
The American public has been lied to repeatedly .
The average American is woefully ignorant , and even worse , willfully ignorant of so many things .
This includes professed Christians .
The newsmedia are nothing more than highly paid liars .
While trillions of taxpayer dollars have been stolen by the Federal Reserve Banksters , the newsmedia is more concerned about Sandra Bullock 's MTV award and Tiger Wood 's golf record .
We get what we deserve as a sin-loving nation .
America loves war !
We are good at it .
We 've had 10 - wars in just a little over 200 - years .
We can't build a decent car in America , nor can we educate our children , nor can we build a TV or VCR anymore , nor can we provide healthcare for our elderly ; but we sure know how to bomb and destroy other countries .
It 's the American way .
The United States is the ONLY nation that has troops policing foreign nations !
The U.S. has troops in DOZENS of foreign nations !
If we followed the U.S. Constitution , we 'd bring all the troops home and mind our own business !
The truth is that America is being exploited by it's overlords at The Council On Foreign Relations , to bring to fruition a global system of economics , government , religion , law and control .
This will be the Beast System of the coming Antichrist .
This was the intended purpose for America 's inception , plotted by Freemasonry occultists for centuries .
Very few people understand the things I am saying , because they are too apathetic to study and search for the truth .
The truth is very plain and simple if you desire to have it .
Sarah Palin speaks lies .
She is an illuminati puppet , a wannabe at the U.S. Presidency , and she may get her chance in 2012 . . .
Republican vice presidential candidate , Alaska Governor Sarah Palin , with her daughter Willow holding her son Trig , campaigns at a rally in Henderson , Nevada .
Notice how Palin makes a Satanic sign with both hands !
Boy was she desperate to get elected !
Sarah Palin is a sell - out , clearly showing her willingness to spiritually fornicate with the Devil , i.e. , " wickedness in high places " ( Ephesians 6:12 ) .
I Don't Support the Troops , and Neither Should You !
I know I am going to be very unpopular here , but I have to stand for the convictions that I believe to be pleasing to God .
No one should be loyal to people over principle , or tradition over truth , or religion over righteousness .
I am not loyal to any institution nor organization ; but rather , to the Word of God and to what is right .
All across America , naive pastors uplift and support the evils that are being committed by The White House .
This is sinful .
Our troops are being used as Herod 's henchman to kill innocent people in Iraq .
The same pastors and Christians supporting our troops would have also supported the Roman troops killing all the Jewish babies in Jesus ' time .
They would have rallied behind Adolf Hitler as the ruler of the people .
At what point does an afflicted society , including it 's Christian citizens , have a God - given right to dissent and rise up against it 's oppressors ?
America would n't be here today if our founding fathers had n't resorted to violence to get their point across .
It was President John F. Kennedy who rightfully said , " Those who make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable . "
It 's coming down to a standoff in America between the people and the government .
The offshore Banksters who are behind the New World Order are going to send foreign troops into America , to smash the resistance , and they will win !
You will witness Chinese troops marching on U.S. soil and Americans will be enslaved !
God has given us over to tyranny because of our nation 's wickedness .
Judgment Day is upon us !
A Police State is being setup !
We are now witnessing the fall of America !
I cannot support the troops , because what they are doing is evil .
I am not against the military .
I am not against war .
But the Bible says go to make war with " good advice " ( Proverb 20:18 ) .
Our nation lied its way into war with Iraq .
The New World Order gang is stealing Iraq 's oil .
Over one million Iraqi's have been murdered .
America 's troops did this !
If you support the troops , then you are ignoring God 's Commandments which forbid bearing false witness , stealing and killing .
I am tired of people who claim to love America at all cost , evil if it means lying , stealing , conniving and cheating to do so .
In reality you only love yourself and do n't care about America 's reputation .
It 's so idiotic !
The very same pastors and Christian leaders who think they are being patriotic by supporting the troops , are defending acts of treason and wickedness that have betrayed America 's integrity and character .
You 're not patriotic because you look the other way and support a wicked agenda , you 're part of the problem , a coward , a shame to your nation , and as unpatriotic as can be for selling out your nation .
Patriotism is not supporting evil .
Patriotism is not supporting a particular political party or White House administration .
No Sir !
Blind loyalty is not patriotism , it 's stupidity !
Most people support the troops because that 's what everyone else is doing .
And you 're too much of a coward as a Christian leader to go against the crowd .
We should never go along to get along !
I realize that most of the troops are just young men and women doing what they 're told , but that does n't make murdering the innocent and stealing their wealth ok .
Anyone can label a foreign power as " terrorist " and target them .
Our troops are not fighting for America 's freedom .
The bogus claims about freedom fighters is all a bunch of fabricated lying propaganda .
The military 's psyops unit does nothing but manipulate the public ( and it works ! ) .
This is why Homeland Security has a paid operative working in Hollywood , incorporating brainwashing government propaganda into the movies and television that Americans watch .
Are you sure you want to watch TV ?
I have to say this , because it 's the truth .
I DON'T support the troops in Iraq !
How can I ?
They 're doing so much evil .
I do not hate the troops .
I have seen dozens and dozens of Christian websites boast , " We Support Our Troops . "
May I ask " why " ?
Do you support tyranny ?
Do you support shedding innocent blood ?
Do you support murdering over one million Iraqis to steal their oil ?
People mindlessly support the troops because they were handed a bumper sticker or because they have read the catchy phrase so much that they mindlessly accept it .
If you want to support murder , theft and false witness , then that 's your decision ; but I have a conscience before God .
I support being honest .
I support doing unto others as I want done unto me .
Those are my neighbors in Iraq , and yours too .
What have we done to those poor people ?
Why are we still invading their nation ?
We went in to take out ONE MAN , Saddam , and instead have taken over ONE MILLION LIVES !
Yet , nutcase Americans support the troops ?
What is wrong with people ?
The problem is that people are not right with God , so they do n't care .
The Bible says in 1st Peter 5:7 that God cares .
If you know God as a born - again Christian , then you will CARE .
Caring is the hallmark quality of being a Christian , which includes a desire to win souls to Jesus Christ .
It all comes down to caring .
Most people do n't care nowadays because most people do n't know God at all .
I CARE !
Perhaps you say , " I do n't support the war , I only support our troops because they 're just doing what they 're paid to do . "
So then you must also support the prostitute on the street whose pimp is controlling her , right ?
So then you must also support the people who killed Terri Schiavo because they were just doing their job , right ?
How about the State lawyer who is just doing his job to persecute good parents for not allowing their child to be guinea pigs , for not bowing to the drug companies ?
How about the abortion doctor who 's just doing his job ?
Do you support such doctors ?
At what point does a person become accountable to God for the job they do ?
Is the abortion doctor just doing his job ?
Our troops are responsible to God for every person they murder under the pretense of bringing " freedom " to Iraq , and the greater sin is upon our nation as a whole for allowing it .
Just because the government hands a young man a loaded gun and misleads him to think he 's killing for freedom — does n't relieve him of the responsibility of his actions .
Defending America is one thing ; lying , killing the innocent and stealing natural resources from another nation is evil .
Those are fathers and sons being murdered in Iraq ( and many women and children too ) .
What if that were us ?
What if China falsely accused the U.S. and invaded our nation ?
Would not our men go to war to defend our nation ?
Yes , of course .
And what if the Chinese killed over one million of our citizens in the name of " freedom " and then started to steal our natural resources ?
Would we still support the troops ?
No way !
If we truly lived the GOLDEN RULE as Jesus taught it , then we never would have invaded Iraq in the first place ...
" Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you , do ye even so to them : for this is the law and the prophets " ( Matthew 7:12 ) .
Like it or not , the truth is that U.S. troops are being used as PAID mercenaries , i.e. , one paid to fight another 's war .
Only an ignorant fool believes that our troops are fighting for " freedom " in Iraq .
Communism usually comes in the form of Democracy .
The worst forms of tyranny are always shielded behind so - called law and justice .
I am not trying to be unkind , just honest .
I cannot support what our troops are doing in Iraq , regardless of how sincere they may be .
People are needlessly dying .
The average Christian believer could n't care less in America , blindly supporting whatever a Republican President does .
It 's time for Christians to wake up and stop supporting tyranny .
Consider this powerful quote from the man of God , Dr. John R. Rice ...
" So , as an honest Bible preacher , obeying the plain commands of God , I must speak out against corruption and immorality .
Waste , corruption , the taking away of men's freedom and the seizing of men's property , these sins every honest preacher must condemn and every honest Christian must disavow .

Here Are More Questions ; Question : Should politics and religion be mixed ? ; by Dr. John R. Rice , pg. 249 , Sword of the Lord Publishers ; 1973 , ISBN : 0-87398-157-X
Amen !
I am speaking out against corruption , the taking away of men's freedom and lives , and the seizing of men's property and natural resources by the U.S. led coalition in Iraq .
It is our duty as believers to refute such works of darkness ( Ephesians 5:11 ) .
What is wrong with so - called Christians today ?
The lesser problem is woeful ignorance .
The greater problem is human nature , i.e. , people do n't think for themselves .
It 's so much easier to allow your pastor or the newsmedia to tell you what to think .
However , Jesus commanded us to SEARCH THE SCRIPTURES in John 5:39 .
The Bible condemns tyranny , shedding innocent blood , bearing false witness , murder and stealing .
I dread to think what will happen if McCain and Sarah Palin get elected to office .
McCain has already publicly stated : " I disagree with what the majority of the American people want . "
McCain has also committed America to potentially remain in Iraq for another 100 - years .
Satan ( I mean Sarah ) Palin errantly thinks that the Iraqi invasion is " God 's plan . "
It 's sickening that so many religious Americans arrogantly think God always supports us — just because we are Americans , no matter what we do , or how much we sin , or how many millions of human lives we murder , or how rotten and evil we are , or how many nations we bomb and destroy , or who we steal from ...
Would God ’s plan include lying about , and misrepresenting crucial information about , the alleged reasons for going to war against Iraq ?
Would it include commission of the “ supreme international crime ” of waging an unprovoked , unnecessary war of aggression against a nation and its people who never threatened the United States ?
What kind of God would have such a plan ?

I agree with the author of the preceding quote .
Certainly , Sarah Palin does not speak for the God of the Bible .
The Scriptures condemn : a proud look , a lying tongue , hands that shed innocent blood , a heart that deviseth wicked imaginations , feet that be swift in running to mischief , a false witness that speaketh lies , and he that soweth discord among brethren " ( Proverb 6:16 - 19 ) .
The Bush Administration is guilty on all charges .
God is NOT a part of such evil and brutal oppression , and no Christian should support it either .
The bottom line is that most people do n't know God , do n't want truth , do n't care about what 's right and do n't listen to reason .
The Bible speaks of " unreasonable and wicked men " ( 2nd Thessalonians 3:2 ) .
Most people do n't care how many Iraqi 's die , they 're still going to support the troops , no matter what they do .
Most people just do n't care , they 're stubborn and wicked .
I see so many people defending evil , whether it be abortionists or a crook who takes advantage of others .
In Mark 7:9 , Jesus plainly stated that the Jews openly and fully rejected God 's Word .
They could n't have cared less about obeying God , just as most people today do n't care either .
The big question is :
Do you care about anyone other than yourself ?
If you care , then the fate of the victims of 911 should bother you .
The killing of Iraqis should bother you .
The theft of trillions of taxpayer dollars should bother you .
But you probably do n't care either .
I heard a man say that he did n't care about the victims of 911 , because they were n't his family .
That 's such a selfish and wicked attitude to have .
Philippians 2:21 , " For all seek their own , not the things which are Jesus Christ's . "
Churches support tyranny because they do n't care about the things of Jesus Christ .
If you 're planning to jump out of a plane at 120,000 feet and break the sound barrier , you need a really fancy suit .
Austrian skydiver Felix Baumgartner has been working with a company that makes space suits for astronauts in an effort to pull off a record - setting jump with the Red Bull Stratos project that he hopes will also lead to safer flight suits for future astronauts .
Baumgartner , the Red Bull star who has done everything from crossing the English Channel during free fall using a carbon fiber wing , to BASE jumping off the tallest buildings in the world , is planning to ascend to the stratosphere in a pressurized capsule carried by a massive helium balloon .
Once reaching 120,000 feet , the plan is to depressurize the capsule , open the door and step off .
The current record for a skydive was set way back in 1960 when U.S. Air Force Colonel ( Retired ) Joseph Kittinger jumped from 102,600 feet .
In addition to breaking that record , Baumgartner ( like Kittinger did ) is working with several scientists to research new , safer suit designs for pilots and future space travelers .
The hope is to develop the next generation of full pressure suits that would help increase survival if the need to bail out of a spacecraft should ever arise at extremely high altitudes .
The new suit being used by Baumgartner is made by David Clark , the same company that made Kittinger 's suit as well as full pressure suits for astronauts and military pilots flying at the edge of the atmosphere in aircraft such as the SR - 71 Blackbird , the U - 2 and the X - 15 .
The suits provide an artificial atmosphere that allows pilots to survive in what would otherwise be a a deadly environment .
For Baumgartner 's jump , temperatures are expected to be colder than minus 58 degrees Fahrenheit , and the air pressure will be so low that a condition known as ebullism would kill him if the pressure suit were to fail .
The condition is explained by everybody 's favorite formula from chemistry class , the ideal gas law .
Ebullism can strike at 62,000 feet , but at 120,000 feet , the outside air pressure is less than one pound per square inch , making it even easier for gas bubbles to form in the blood , basically allowing the blood to boil .
Another potential problem is maneuvering during free fall .
In order to achieve Mach 1 , Baumgartner will have to adjust his position during free fall and a normal suit is too restrictive to allow sufficient freedom of movement .
One of the worries is what would happen if a person were to begin tumbling .
Skydivers use their arms and legs to maneuver , but with the limited motion in a space suit , mobility is greatly restricted .
The David Clark suit gives Baumgartner more flexibility to move during free fall .
So far the Red Bull Stratos team has tested the new suit in wind tunnels , low pressure chambers and several jumps from 25,000 feet .
Baumgartner has been fine tuning his " delta " position that he will use to achieve the supersonic jump .
No person has ever broken the sound barrier during free fall , though it is thought if a person were forced to bail out of a spacecraft at altitudes much higher than 120,000 feet , they would achieve supersonic speeds involuntarily .
Baumgartner wants to help researchers better understand the possible effects of supersonic speeds on a person falling through the atmosphere as well as the effects on the suit .

A man is behind bars after allegedly assaulting an off - duty Easton police captain and his two daughters at Citizens Bank Park .
Capt .
Michael Vangelo and his 16 - and 11 - year - old girls drove down from the Lehigh Valley to watch the Phillies take on the Washington Nationals Wednesday night when the alleged assault occurred , police said .
Vangelo , 43 , says from the moment his family took their seats , a group of unruly men starting disturbing anyone near them .
" They were yelling vulgarities , obscene language , " Vangelo said Thursday .
Vangelo and his older daughter asked the men to stop , but that seemed to just cause more trouble , he said .
" I had beer thrown on me and water and then one individual started spitting at the back of my daughter 's chair and he actually spit on my 11 - year - old daughter , " he said .
Vangelo went to report the men to ushers , who promptly ejected them from the game .
The man says everything seemed fine until another fan got involved .
That fan -- identified by police as Matthew Clemmens of Cherry Hill , N.J. -- was sitting with another , unrelated group of fans who were also disciplined for acting out when he allegedly did what Vangelo describes as the " most disgusting thing " he 's ever seen .
Clemmens , 21 , positioned himself behind the 11 - year - old 's chair , stuck his fingers down his throat and vomited on the girl and her father , police said .
" He leaned forward , he projectile vomited all over me and my daughter , " Vangelo said with a look of hurt splashed across his face .
Clemmens then began wailing on Vangelo after he pushed him away from the girl -- hitting the off - duty officer in the head and neck , causing his ear to bleed , police said .
Surrounding fans jumped in to help subdue Clemmens before he was arrested .
" He was still vomiting on the other fans that were holding him down , " Vangelo said .
“ It ’s unfortunate that one fan could impact the perception that thousands of Phillies fans have anything but a positive experience when they come out to Citizens Bank Park , " said Phillies Vice President Bonnie Clark .
" We are sorry that the officer and his daughters were subject to such treatment .
We are in the process of reaching out to them to express our concerns personally . ”
Clemmens faces several charges including Aggravated Assault , Simple Assault , Harassment and Resisting Arrest .
There was no answer at the door of Clemmens ' Cherry Hill , N.J. home Thursday .
But his uncle did speak on Friday , saying that Clemmens would never do something like that intentionally .
" He 's not a monster !
He 's a kid , " said Dave Clemmens .
" I think he just had a couple of extra beers that might have got him a little sick , and he accidentally vomited , putting put his hand in front of his mouth and vomited on the person in front of him , which was the picked the wrong person . "
After all the disruptions and vile acts , the 11 - year - old was able to come out of the game with a smile , her father said .
A nearby fan caught a foul ball and gave it to the girl .

Algorithm X in 30 lines !
If you were ever interested in writing a Sudoku solver , then you probably heard about the exact cover problem .
It asks whether , for a given set X and a collection Y of subsets of X , there exists a subcollection Y* of Y such that Y* forms a partition of X .
Here 's an example of the problem written in Python .
X = { 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7} Y = { ' A ' : [ 1 , 4 , 7 ] , ' B ' : [ 1 , 4 ] , ' C ' : [ 4 , 5 , 7 ] , ' D ' : [ 3 , 5 , 6 ] , ' E ' : [ 2 , 3 , 6 , 7 ] , ' F ' : [ 2 , 7 ] }
The unique solution in this case is [ ' B ' , ' D ' , ' F ' ] .
The exact cover problem is NP - complete .
Algorithm X was invented by Donald Knuth to solve it .
He even suggested an efficient implementation technique called Dancing Links , using doubly - linked circular lists to represent the matrix of the problem .
However , Dancing Links can be tedious to code , and very hard to get right .
That 's where the magic of Python comes in !
One day I decided to write Algorithm X in Python , and I came up with a very interesting variation on Dancing Links .
The algorithm
The main idea is to use dictionnaries instead of doubly - linked lists to represent the matrix .
We already have Y . From it , we can quickly access the columns in each row .
Now we still need to do the opposite , namely a quick access from the columns to the rows .
For this , we can modify X by transforming it into a dictionnary .
In the above example , it would be written like this
X = { 1 : {' A ' , ' B'} , 2 : { ' E ' , ' F'} , 3 : { 'D ' , ' E'} , 4 : { ' A ' , ' B ' , ' C'} , 5 : { ' C ' , ' D'} , 6 : { 'D ' , ' E'} , 7 : { ' A ' , ' C ' , ' E ' , ' F'}}
The sharp eye will notice this is slightly different from how we represented Y .
Indeed , we need to be able to quickly remove and add rows to each column , which is why we use sets .
On the other hand , and Knuth does n't mention this , rows actually remain intact throughout the algorithm .
Here 's the code for the algorithm .
def solve ( X , Y , solution= [ ] ) : if not X : yield list ( solution ) else : c = min( X , key=lambda c : len ( X[ c ] ) ) for r in list ( X[ c ] ) : solution .append (r ) cols = select ( X , Y , r ) for s in solve ( X , Y , solution ) : yield s deselect ( X , Y , r , cols ) solution . pop ( ) def select ( X , Y , r ) : cols = [ ] for j in Y[r ] : for i in X[j ] : for k in Y[ i ] : if k != j : X[ k ].remove(i ) cols.append ( X.pop(j ) ) return cols def deselect ( X , Y , r , cols ) : for j in reversed ( Y[ r ] ) : X[j ] = cols.pop ( ) for i in X[j ] : for k in Y[ i ] : if k != j : X [ k ] .add( i )
There , 30 lines exactly !
Formatting the input
Before solving an instance of the problem , we need to transform the input into the format described above .
We can simply use
X = {j : set ( filter ( lambda i : j in Y[ i ] , Y ) ) for j in X}
But this is slow .
If the size of X is m and the size of Y is n , then the number of iterations will be m*n .
In the case of a Sudoku grid of size N , this of the order of N^5 .
We can do better .
X = {j : set ( ) for j in X} for i in Y : for j in Y[ i ] : X[ j ] .add( i )
This still has O ( m*n ) complexity , but only in degenerate cases .
On average it will perform much better , because it wo n't iterate over all the empty cells .
In Sudoku for example , there are exactly 4 entries in each row of the matrix , regardless of size , so this will have complexity N^3 .

The easy part : Speaking to Aipac the powerful pro-Israel lobby
Gidi Kleiman , a producer with the BBC Middle East bureau in Jerusalem , was part of the press team accompanying Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on his visit to Washington .
This is his account of the unusually tense and difficult trip .
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seemed relaxed , in his informal clothes , as he worked his way down the aisle of the plane , chatting with the travelling press .
The greeting ritual is customary during these flights , on which we accompany the prime minister on his all - important visits to Washington .
But it 's never quite clear when he 's going to drop by the press section , which poses a tricky question : do we stay in our business attire or risk having to greet Israel 's leader in the T - shirts and tracksuit bottoms we 've brought to sleep in on the 13 - hour flight ?
The US - Israel relationship is special .
But the plane is n't .
Mr Netanyahu 's office charters a regular commercial plane .
His team are in business class ; the journalists in economy .
The food choice - as on many Israel - US flights - is chicken or beef .
Row in the background
As the prime minister and his wife Sara left the press cabin , the plane 's screens were showing the evening news - transmitted several hours earlier - on which US Middle East envoy George Mitchell confirmed that Mr Netanyahu would meet US President Barack Obama during his visit .
The hard part :
Not the usual welcome for an Israeli PM at the White House
Mr Netanyahu was travelling to the US capital to address the annual conference of the powerful pro-Israeli lobby group American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( Aipac ) .
But , with a recent row over settlement building in East Jerusalem in the background , there had been questions over whether he would get to meet Mr Obama and whether Mr Obama was going to give him a hard time .
We touched down in Washington on Monday morning .
Mr Netanyahu spent the day meeting with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , preparing his speech for Aipac , and later having dinner with US Vice - President Joe Biden .
After the meeting with Mrs Clinton , Mr Netanyahu and his staff were in buoyant mood .
The jokes and banter flowed .
Enormous wedding party
Then on to Aipac .
The conference looked like an enormous wedding party , with large dinner tables set for some 7,500 guests and delegates in a hall stretching hundreds of metres .
Mr Netanyahu was due to speak at 2130 , but was late from dinner with Mr Biden , the man Israel had , in the US 's own words , " insulted " only a week ago by announcing the approval of settler homes in East Jerusalem as Mr Biden visited to try to launch indirect peace talks .
It was just as well .
Many of the guests had not got into the hall either , stuck in huge queues as congressmen and dignitaries struggled to make it through the security checks and metal detectors .
Inside , in the youth section , exhausted teenagers and students held their heads in the hands , trying to stay awake , as the announcers read out a long list of eminent conference attendees , filling the time until Mr Netanyahu arrived .
When he was called onstage , the crowd lit up .
The sympathetic audience listened carefully to his speech , applauded and embraced him .
But it was the end of the easy part of the visit .
The meeting with Mr Obama the following day was a different story .
Waiting
It began at 1730 , shortly after the news had emerged of the granting of permits for another controversial building project in East Jerusalem .
We waited at the hotel for indications of how the meeting had gone .
The signs were ominous for Mr Netanyahu - only official photographers , no public handshake or remarks in the presence of the press .
Sometime after 1900 it emerged that the meeting was over .
A senior Israeli official told me there would be time for a drink in the bar before a statement came .
There turned out to be enough time , had we wanted it , for a tour of Washington 's bars .
And still no statement came from the White House or the Netanyahu staff .
Later , we heard that there a second meeting between the president and the prime minister .
Netanyahu 's advisers stayed in the White House long past midnight in attempts to reach a joint statement with the Americans .
Still nothing .
At odds
The following morning , all media engagements for Netanyahu were cancelled .
His staff would n't say a word , but it was written all over their faces that things were not good for the prime minister .
A group of senior Obama administration officials , headed by US Middle East envoy George Mitchell , arrived at the hotel to meet Mr Netanyahu and his advisers .
But after hours more waiting , it emerged that no agreement had been reached and Mr Netanyahu would leave Washington DC at odds with the Americans .
In the hotel lobby , a group of Mr Netanyahu 's staff walked past , returning from dinner .
They looked completely exhausted .
Only one of them mustered a smile .
We were whisked back to the waiting plane with the prime minister 's motorcade .
But as we stowed our bags in the overhead lockers , there was a flurry of activity .
An adviser rushed up the stairs , and shouted out a statement Mr Netanyahu had just given on the airport tarmac .
" We 're finding the golden path , " the prime minister had said , " we 've moved forward . "
After take - off the physical and mental exhaustion of the past few days caught up .
It was eyes shut for everyone .
Most of us will do this all again in early April when Mr Netanyahu is due to attend the Nuclear Security Summit in Washington DC .
The questions remains : will there be a meeting with the president ?
And will Mr Netanyahu have to go through the same ordeal again ?
In mid-April , a coalition of privacy groups filed a brief in federal district court in Colorado , defending Yahoo against attempts by the federal government to obtain the contents of Yahoo Mail messages without first obtaining a warrant .
One month earlier , the Justice Department filed a 17 - page brief arguing that Yahoo Mail messages do not fall under current statutory protection because , once opened , those messages are not considered to be in " electronic storage . "
The privacy coalition — which included Google — came to Yahoo's defense , arguing that users with e-mail stored in the cloud have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of that e-mail , and should thus be protected from warrantless searches by the government .
( Hopefully the irony of Google opposing robust searches is not lost on Google 's attorneys . )
Unfortunately , the protections afforded by the warrant requirement have not yet been fully extended to the digital " cloud . "
This handy metaphor for the ethereal Internet as a storage and access hub is coming to have other implications : can we really conceal our data inside this cloud , shielding it from government intrusion ?
In fact , there is not even any guarantee that e-mails stored locally on a personal home computer will be afforded such protection .
But as this novel question has remained unanswered by the sloth - like pace of legal innovation , a dozen more questions have cropped up .
Meanwhile , the technological innovators are demanding faster answers .
The fourth amendment and reasonable expectations of privacy
The Fourth Amendment to the US Constitution provides that the people shall " be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures ... "
The Fourth Amendment also provides a method by which an otherwise unreasonable search might be characterized as " reasonable " and , therefore , constitutionally valid : by aid of a warrant , issued " upon probable cause , supported by Oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized . "
Requiring law enforcement to properly justify itself before conducting invasive searches offers an essential layer of constitutional privacy protection which , if breached , renders the improperly seized evidence inadmissible in court against the person whose privacy was violated .
But a warrant is not always necessary to make a search reasonable .
In some situations a search and seizure is reasonable without the need for a warrant , such as when items are in plain view , or when a person consents to being searched .
Over time , the courts have developed a standard for determining when a search requires a warrant and when it is reasonable on its own .
This standard , which requires a warrant only if there exists a " reasonable expectation of privacy , " originated from a 1967 Supreme Court case involving the wiretapping of a phone booth .
In that case , because the phone booth had a door which could be shut behind the user , he was deemed to have reasonably expected that nobody was listening in .
The presence of a physical barrier also acted as a legal one .
The " reasonable expectation of privacy " test actually has two requirements .
First , the person must have had a subjectively reasonable expectation that the item was private .
Second , that item must also be something that society in general is willing to objectively recognize as reasonably private .
In other words , it 's not enough that you think your fenced - in backyard is private if society as a whole would find it unreasonable to think so .
Sunbathers beware .
Nuances in this standard have developed in the years since the phone booth case .
One such nuance is the " third - party doctrine . "
For example , the police do not need a warrant to obtain a list of the phone numbers you have dialed and when those calls were made , because , unlike the content of your calls , the transactional data is part of the business records of a third party — the service provider .
Similarly , receipts and checks exchanged with a bank or retailer are not considered to enjoy Fourth Amendment protection , because society is not prepared to reasonably expect privacy in those documents .
This third - party doctrine has narrowed the situations in which a warrant is required to conduct a search .
Of course as the courts have narrowed these protections vis-à - vis the Constitution , Congress has passed legislation fortifying the constitutional protections and filling in the gaps created by new technologies .
But there are two major problems with those fortifications .
First , statutes can be overturned or repealed , whereas constitutional protections provide more permanent safeguards .
Second , most of these laws are decades old and have hardly been updated to account for changing technologies .
Among these laws is the Stored Communications Act ( SCA ) , which was passed in 1986 .
The SCA is at the heart of the dispute between Yahoo and the Justice Department , and the government 's position is that e-mails in the cloud that have already been opened are no longer in " electronic storage , " and thus fall outside the protection of the statute .
Updating these statutes is one short - term option .
But , just as Google and the other groups defending Yahoo have argued , there is a basis for interpreting the " reasonable expectation of privacy " standard to cover these new cloud computing and storage uses , shielding at least parts of the cloud with the protection of the warrant requirement .
The differing evolutions of technology and law
The linchpin in extending Fourth Amendment protection to the cloud rests with the reasonableness of society 's expectations governing privacy in the cloud .
But societal expectations change over time .
The linchpin in extending Fourth Amendment protection to the cloud rests with the reasonableness of society 's expectations governing privacy in the cloud .
But societal expectations change over time , especially as technology and our uses of that technology change .
With massive increases in bandwidth , wireless access , and mobile device use over the past decade , remote storage ( and cloud computing generally ) has changed the way in which the Internet is used .
Rather than being a purely public medium , the Internet has become a means of private storage and mobile or remote access .
This is in stark contrast to ten or fifteen years ago , when data was often uploaded for the intended purpose of sharing it with a mass audience .
Bandwidth and access limitations made it unfeasible for everyday Internet users to rely on the cloud to efficiently store and access their private files , and mobile devices were not yet powerful enough or pervasive enough for consumers to even need such " everywhere access . "
Unfortunately , the law generally does not evolve as quickly as technology .
The 1967 phone booth case was the first time telephone conversations were recognized as constitutionally protected from unreasonable searches — nearly one hundred years after the telephone was invented .
The Internet and cloud computing have taken a fraction of that time to reach wide market penetration , and show little sign of slowing down .
But since Moore 's Law does not apply to legal innovation , the disparities between technology and the law are likely to become even greater .
Take , for example , the case City of Ontario v. Quon , currently pending before the US Supreme Court .
Although the case is not precisely within the scope of what we often think of as " cloud computing " ( online storage and manipulation of e-mails , photos , documents , and so on ) , it deals in a similar realm — the storage of text messages within the servers of a service provider .
The city of Ontario , California , contracted with Arch Wireless to provide text messaging services for , among others , the city 's police department .
Although the police department had no official policy regarding use of the pagers for personal versus work - related messaging , the unofficial policy was that if an officer went over the limit but paid the overcharge fee , their messages would not be audited .
The department later decided it would audit some of these texts and found a significant number of sexually explicit personal messages .
Several officers sued , claiming their Fourth Amendment rights were violated because the department , being an agent of the government , should have been required to obtain a warrant first .
The district court and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals both agreed that the officers had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the content of their texts , and analogized the stored text messages to e-mail , among other things .
The Supreme Court just heard oral arguments in Quon on April 19th , and based on the Justices ' questions and demeanors , they did not seem overly sympathetic to the officers ' privacy concerns — at least not enough to extend Fourth Amendment protections to their stored text messages .
In part this may be because the facts in this case were simply not compelling enough ; society is likely not prepared to recognize that police officers should have an expectation of privacy in their city - issued ( and taxpayer - funded ) work pagers .
Though the future of Fourth Amendment protection in the cloud will probably not be foreclosed by this case , it may create a hurdle for privacy groups and entities such as Yahoo and Google who are looking for more favorable Fourth Amendment treatment by the Supreme Court .
The Court 's decision in Quon should come out later this summer .
Whatever the ultimate decision may be , these groups will undoubtedly be looking for any helpful language in the opinion that can be used in the inevitable next case to be brought concerning this issue .
People hate Burzum .
A passing mention of Varg Vikernes ’ longstanding one - man black metal project is enough to kick - start a heated debate .
( I know , it happened to me in a bar last night .
And a few weeks ago on - line .
And etc. )
The issues here , of course , involve the Right Wing , Nationalistic , Racialist , Odalist , etc. , views held by Vikernes and disseminated on his website and in off - line writings .
So why listen ?
And why “ sit down ” with the man for the following interview ?
Personally , I like the music .
Belus , his first album in 11 years , is one of the best black metal albums released this year .
Yeah , of course , admitting to enjoying Burzum in public raises a number of questions and opens you up for attack .
For starters , what are my “ responsibilities ” as a listener and a consumer ?
Huge questions , but questions fans of extreme music , art , etc. , will inevitably have to face at some point unless they ’re willfully keeping their eyes closed .
I ’ve always tried to unpack and understand things that challenge me and my beliefs .
I read difficult books , enjoy difficult art , etc .
( When I went to grad school , I focused on and wrote about Dennis Cooper , a gay author who ’s received death threats from people who think he ’s promoting gay - on - gay violence .
People could n’t understand why I , a straight male , would be so into his writing — a view I always found frustratingly simplistic . )
This summer , as part of my ongoing self - questioning about Burzum , I collaborated with the German artist Kai Althoff on an installation that started , in part , with our discussions about Vikernes and what listening to his music meant about us .
We ended up with a 50 - page dialog , more questions .
To simplify , as we wrote in our statement : “ Brandon admires Varg ’s music .
Kai wants to follow Varg and wonders how it all goes together with Brandon wanting the country to be governed by Barack Obama , while also listening to Varg …
And Kai thinks Varg Vikernes would be a man he truly wanted to follow , denying his false conception to love a man in the W R O N G way , which will automatically lead to his self - perception as scum in the eye of Varg . ”
( The results of our talks became a deeply personal , self - lacerating existential exorcism that ’s too complex to unpack here , but there were interesting attempts to break it down in ARTFORUM a couple times and in Art In America . )
So , what conclusions did we reach ?
That ’s something I ’m still figuring out .
One way to get closer to the issue , though , is to interview the man himself .
Vikernes was recently released from prison after serving almost 16 years of a 21 - year sentence for burning historic churches and for the 1993 murder of his Mayhem bandmate Øystein Aarseth , aka Euronymous , a catalyst for the early Norwegian black metal scene through his Deathlike Silence Productions record label and Helvete , record shop , etc .
( This is shorthand .
Folks should do some outside reading on there own because there ’s plenty of interpretations .
I dug into it fairly deeply in the Believer , a couple of years ago . )
Shortly after he got out , rumors of a new album circulated :
His seventh full - length , Belus , arrived yesterday .
I jumped at the chance to talk to Vikernes about it , about black metal , and about his politics .
He ’s only doing interviews via email , which did n’t allow for a full - on discussion , and in some ways plays into his hand as a rhetorician , but I think interesting and important ideas came out in our Q&A .
I ’m happy I did it .
Also : I should thank my friend Drew Daniel ( Matmos , Soft Pink Truth , Burzum fan ) who suggested and framed a couple of the questions to me .
We ’ve discussed all of this stuff a number of times , in private , too .
Before digging into the interview , it ’s important to have some background on Belus .
It ’s being described as “ an attempt to explore the myths about the ancient indo - aryan solar deity of light and innocence and unveil the oldest roots of European cultural heritage .
The album deals with the death of Belus , his somber journey through the realm of death and his magnificent return . ”
As Varg has written :
My ambition with Belus is to create something I , and hopefully others , can listen to for years without ever growing tired of it , and at the same time share with my audience the experience of getting to know Belus , as he might have been perceived by the ancient Europeans .
The combination of lyrics and music makes this a fairy tale different from most others , and should appeal to all those who like transcendental music and love to see different things from a different perspective .
If I can make you dream when listening to this album , I believe I have done a good job .
Our discussion , which involves perhaps the most sinister use of a smiley face ever …
STEREOGUM : What ’s the noise in “ Lukans Renkespill ( Introduksjon ) ” ?
I ’ve read your explanation of the album art , etc. , and that you see this as a concept album .
If all the songs are connected to the story of Belus , the source of the sound in this introduction is important .
It ’s the first recorded musical sound people have from you in 11 years .
VARG VIKERNES :
It ’s the sound of a hammer striking an anvil .
Leuke is best known as Hephaistos , Loki or Vulcan ; the smith of the gods .
STEREOGUM : Belus is very catchy .
More so than anything you ’ve done previously .
There are a number of subtle hooks .
For instance , what ’s the whistle - like sound amid the guitars of “ Glemselens Elv ” ?
The repeated spoken / chanted phrase in “ Kaimadalthas Nedstigning ” ?
I would n’t say this is a “ pop ” album , but for all the brutality , there ’s something highly listenable in its layers .
Was this your intention ?
VARG VIKERNES :
You know , Brandon , I make music I like .
If it ’s “ this ” or “ that , ” if it fits a specific category or not , or whatever , does not matter to me .
I only want to make music I like , and that I can enjoy myself , and be proud of .
I have n’t heard a whistle - like sound on “ Glemselens Elv ” myself , but I guess it ’s either the humming voice in the background of the vocal parts , or actually the guitars you are hearing .
The repeated phrase in “ Kaimadalthas Nedstigning ” is – translated – “ I travel to the deep of darkness , where everything is dead , ” and then “ I travel to Kelio ( Hel ) . ”
STEREOGUM : There ’s a change in the vocal sound on Belus …
Is this a result of aging ?
A reaction to the reception of your past work ?
VARG VIKERNES : I never liked the old vocals , so I changed it for Filosofem , and I changed it again for Belus .
If I knew how to I would sing like I did on Belus on all the albums .
I actually could have , but I did n’t know how to until Belus .
STEREOGUM : After the synthesized albums , what was it like working with a guitar again ?
VARG VIKERNES :
It was great .
I am first and foremost a guitarist after all .
I have to say , though , that I made Dauði Baldrs on the guitars as well , and I never really stopped playing the guitars .
STEREOGUM : On the record , did you try applying the Belus myth to your life personally ?
A reference to your freedom ?
To contemporary Norwegian culture ?
Culture in general ?
VARG VIKERNES : I understand how you want to read more into this , but I think you should try to appreciate the album for what it is instead .
Belus is about the death and rebirth of a European solar deity .
The song titles refer to the mythological events , the lyrics to the pre-mythological traditions .
STEREOGUM : You ’ve said you ’re not interested in the contemporary Norwegian black metal scene ( outside of Darkthrone ) .
Or black metal in general : “ Black metal is not a label I use for my music any longer . ”
Why not ?
What should it be labeled instead ?
VARG VIKERNES : My main problem with Norwegian Black Metal is that almost all the bands from 1992 - 1993 are made up of rats , who ratted each other out and blamed me for everything that went wrong in the scene .
I really do n’t want to be associated with them in any way .
I should stress that neither the guys in Darkthrone nor the guys in Mayhem ratted anybody out , but pretty much everyone else did .
Emperor .
Enslaved .
Immortal .
Hades Almighty et cetera .
These guys are fucking rats , or they play in bands with rats – which is not much better !
Further , I really do n’t want to be associated with the low - brow Black Metal genre .
If you want to know what I mean when I say that just have a look at an Immortal video on YouTube or something .
It ’s so dumb I do n’t know what to say , really , and it ’s so ridicules we can barely tell the difference between the real stuff and the parodies .
STEREOGUM : What are you listening to at this point ?
VARG VIKERNES : The Cure , Depeche Mode , Das Ich ( Die Propheten ) , Goethes Erben , New Order , Tchaikovsky ( Swan Lake and The Nutcracker in particular ) and other classical music , balalaika , old German and Soviet marches , Lillebjørn Nilsen , Dead Can Dance ( Within The Realm Of A Dying Sun ) .
Yeah , that ’s pretty much it .
STEREOGUM : You wrote that you did n’t expect the original Belus title “ The White God ” to cause such a ruckus .
I ’m surprised .
It was a smart move to change it — allowing people to focus more on the music , etc. — but I assume you must have at least had an inkling that people would think it was a race - based “ white . ”
No ?
Do you see your books and other writings as being separate from Burzum ?
VARG VIKERNES :
The original working title was Baldurs Tlbakekomst ( The Return of Baldur ) , by the way , and Den Hvite Guden ( The White God ) too was just a working title .
I have said and written a lot of things much worse than that over the years , so to speak , and nobody said anything about it , so I was surprised when all of a sudden an innocent working title like that caused such a ruckus .
Why ?
Why now ?
My books have nothing to do with Burzum .
STEREOGUM : I know you ’re not a fan of [ the book ] Lords Of Chaos .
Are you happy with how [ the documentary ] Until The Light Takes
Us turned out ?
Related to this :
Has anyone from the Lords Of Chaos film contacted you ?
VARG VIKERNES : Sorry , but I have n’t seen Until The Light Takes
Us yet , so I can say very little about it .
I have never heard from anyone from the Lords Of Chaos film production .
I tried to contact them myself twice , to ask them what they were doing and to tell them I disapprove of what they did , but they never responded .
STEREOGUM : A lot ’s happened in black metal over the past couple of decades , especially in the last handful of years .
It ’s fascinating to me — all the hybrids and shifts .
American black metal , for instance , has a higher / more respectable profile .
And has developed a more unique sound .
A ways back I interviewed one of the bigger of the American bands Wolves In The Throne Room — a good group , and one clearly influenced on a sonic level by Burzum .
I asked them : “ In our last interview you talked about listening to Filosofem while working the fields .
No black metal musicians have really spoken up much about Varg ’s release from prison .
What are your thoughts ? ”
Their drummer Aaron Weaver ’s response :
My feeling is that people are interested in an idealized image of Burzum , which is only tenuously connected to the man .
Burzum ’s post - Filosofem recorded output reveals a man of limited musical ability , and his mystical - Nazi writing seem paranoid and off - base .
It seems like he is just another wingnut spouting off about Jewish conspiracies .
People who create powerful and revolutionary art in their teens and early twenties rarely sustain any relevance .
..
What are your thoughts on this sort of opinion ?
Especially that last sentence .
VARG VIKERNES : I could n’t care less about what they do or say .
I have n’t even heard about them before , and I would n’t have heard about them either if they had n’t said things like that about me .
What do they know anyway ?
Belus is better and more relevant than anything I have ever done before , and that just proves how little they know — and I am sure he will regret ever having said such a thing when he realizes this .
STEREOGUM : How do you feel about having gay fans ?
Black fans ?
Jewish fans ?
Christian fans ?
Do you feel that you ’ve failed to transmit your message properly if people who are n’t from your white / Nordic / heterosexual / pagan demographic feel something in the music that is n’t tied to shared membership in that demographic ?
Does it mean the music has failed to transmit its message properly ?
VARG VIKERNES :
And what is my message ?
When did Burzum ever address political / racial matters ?
I do n’t think Burzum has ever even addressed religious matters , other than describing different European myths .
Burzum is not a political or religious band , or even an anti-religious band .
Burzum is music ; art if you like , and the interpretation of art lies in the eye of the beholder .
I might be Nordic , heterosexual and have a Pagan ideology myself , but why would I expect the fans of my music to be just like me ?
I am a narrow - minded ultra-conservative anti-religious misanthropic and arrogant bigot , alright , and I have a problem with just about everything and everyone in this world , but I am not demented , and if those who are not like me are able to enjoy my music that is all fine by me .
Be a Christian - born black gay feminist converted to Judaism for all I care , or worse ; a Muslim .
Just stay off my lawn … :-)
Oh , and I may add that I have a problem with most Nordic heterosexuals with a Pagan ideology as well .

FOR DEVICE REQUESTS SEE POST #3
Hello all , I just completed an app I 'd like to share with you all .
It 's called Search2 Play , it lets you play and pause your music by pressing a button on your device .
On most devices , it is the search key .
Currently , the Nexus & MyTouch 3G both use the Search key , whereas the Droid uses the Camera key .
If you have physical keys ( i.e. Droid , MT3G , G1 , etc ) then it will work when the phone is locked , but if you have capacitive keys ( Nexus , Moment , Eris , Incredible , etc ) then the screen must be on ( lockscreen works , and fully unlocked of course ) .
It is available on the market under the name " Search2 Play ( Root Required ) " .
It 's totally free .
It requires root permissions to install .
It also requires that you have a version of BusyBox that supports the " cp " command .
Only Droid users probably have to worry about the busybox version , as most other custom ROMs have that already .
Droid users , I recommend CyanogenMod for Droid or Bugless Beast as I know both of them have the right version .
It does not run in the background or install a service , just makes some changes to a few files on the / system partition .
The UI is very simple , just two buttons and some text explaining the app .
Once you hit install , it will ask for permission to use root , you must hit accept or the app wo n't serve its purpose
The other button , " Restore " , lets you remove the mod and go back to stock settings , where the search button brings up search , etc.NexusSpicaHero ( GSM & CDMA ) Galaxy S devices ( all US variants and probably the i9000 as well .

Every day a new SEO myth is born ; unfortunately , not every day does an old SEO myth die off .
The net result is a growing population of myths .
These are nearly impossible to squash because the snake - oil salesmen of our industry keep perpetuating them — bringing them back from the brink , even .
You can talk at conferences till your blue in the face .
You can develop SEO checklists like this one , or even author a book .
You ’ll still get asked how to write good meta keywords .
You can even pre-empt myths before they take hold , as Matt Cutts attempted in his recent post , Google Incorporating Site Speed in Search Rankings .
Despite Matt ’s best efforts , I am sure this wo n’t be the last time we hear ( or read ) the myths “ site speed is a major new factor in determining Google rankings ” and “ the site speed signal will help big sites who can pay more for hosting . ”
Sometimes the myths get debunked , only to end up coming back with a vengeance .
Take the meta keywords tag for instance .
Google never did support this worthless tag .
But apparently , Yahoo had been “ supporting ” the tag for some time .
Remember when Yahoo went on the record ( at the SMX East 2009 conference ) to say they were no longer giving any credence to the meta keyword tag ?
Then , within days Danny Sullivan published his findings from some of his own tests .
Turned out Yahoo ’s assertion on the meta keywords tag was wrong .
In Yahoo it apparently still is a signal ( albeit an incredibly minor one . )
Oops .
I , for one , hate misinformation and disinformation , and our industry , unfortunately , is rife with it .
I ’m going to do my part in fighting this menace and spreading the truth — by exposing some of the more insidious myths in this very article .
I think this is only fitting , considering Covario ’s oft - stated goal is to be “ the source of truth ” for our clients on the performance of their SEO and SEM .
And now , without any further ado , the list …
Our SEO firm is endorsed / approved by Google .
The following comes from an actual email a friend of mine received from an SEO firm last year :
We are …Google Approved , a partner with Google , they endorse us as an optimizer , and their list includes very few partners , and we are one of them !.
To find us on their list please go to : http://www.google.com/websiteoptimizer/woac.html and select region : United States ; scroll to the middle of the page and find National Positions . ”
Hmm …. you wo n’t find them listed there anymore .
Do n’t use Google Analytics because Google will spy on you and use the information against you .
This one comes straight from the conspiracy theorists .
Google has made numerous assurances that they are n’t using your traffic or conversion data to profile you as a spammer .
Your PageRank score , as reported by Google ’s toolbar server , is highly correlated to your Google rankings .
If only this were true , our jobs as SEOs would be so much easier !
It does n’t take many searches with SEO for Firefox running to see that low - PageRank URLs outrank high - PR ones all the time .
It would be naive to assume that the PageRank reported by the Toolbar Server is the same as what Google uses internally for their ranking algorithm .
Having an XML Sitemap will boost your Google rankings .
I just heard this one from a fellow panelist in an SEO session at a conference I presented at within the last month ( I wo n’t mention who , or which show . )
This made me cringe , but I bit my lip rather than embarrass and contradict them in front of the audience .
Should I have spoken up ?
Did I do the audience a disservice by leaving this myth unchallenged ?
I struggled with that .
In any event , Google will use your sitemaps file for discovery and potentially as a canonicalization hint if you have duplicate content .
It wo n’t give a URL any more “ juice ” just because you include it in your sitemaps.xml , even if you assign a high priority level to it .
Since the advent of personalization , there is no such thing as being ranked # 1 anymore because everyone sees different results .
Although it is true that Google personalizes search results based on the user ’s search history ( and now you do n’t even have to be logged in to Google for this personalization to take place ) , the differences between personalized results and non-personalized results are relatively minor .
Check for yourself .
Get in the habit of re-running your queries — the second time adding &pws=0 to the end of Google SERP URL — and observing how much ( or how little ) everything shifts around .
Meta tags will boost your rankings .
I ’m so sick of hearing about meta tags .
Optimizing your meta keywords is a complete waste of time .
Period .
They have been so abused by spammers that the engines have n’t put any stock in them for years and years .
What about other meta tags — such as meta description , meta author , and meta robots — you ask ?
None of the various meta tags are given any real weight in the rankings algorithm .
It ’s good practice to include a meta robots tag specifying index , follow .
This is a corollary to the myth immediately preceding .
It ’s totally unnecessary .
The engines all assume they are allowed to index and follow unless you specify otherwise .
It ’s helpful if your targeted keywords are tucked away in HTML comment tags and title attributes ( of IMG and A HREF tags . )
Since when have comment tags or title attributes been given any weight ?
Having country - specific sites creates “ duplicate content ” issues in Google .
Google is smart enough to present your .com.au site to Google Australia users and your .co.nz site to Google New Zealand users .
Not using a ccTLD ?
Then set the geographic target setting in Google Webmaster Tools ; that ’s what it ’s there for .
Where ’s the problem here ?
You can keep search engines from indexing pages linked - to with Javascript links .
There are many documented cases of Google following JavaScript - based links .
Google engineers have stated that they are crawling JavaScript links more - and - more .
Of course , do n’t rely on Google parsing your JavaScript links , but do n’t assume it will choke on them either .
Googlebot does n’t read CSS .
You ’d better believe Google scans CSS for spam tactics like hidden divs .
You should end your URLs in .html .
Since when has that made a difference ?
You can boost the Google rankings of your home page for a targeted term by including that term in the anchor text of internal links .
Testing done by SEOmoz found that the anchor text of your “ Home ” links is largely ignored .
Use the anchor text “ Home ” or “ San Diego real estate ” — it ’s of no consequence either way .
It ’s important for your rankings that you update your home page frequently ( e.g. daily . )
This is another fallacy spread by the same aforementioned fellow panelist .
Plenty of stale home pages rank just fine , thank you very much .
Trading links helps boost PageRank and rankings .
Particularly if done on a massive scale with totally irrelevant sites , right ?
Umm , no .
Reciprocal links are of dubious value : they are easy for an algorithm to catch and to discount .
Having your own version of the Yahoo directory on your site is n’t helping your users , nor is it helping your SEO .
Linking out ( such as to Google.com ) helps rankings .
Not true .
Unless perhaps you ’re hoarding all your PageRank by not linking out at all — in which case , that just looks unnatural .
It ’s the other way around , i.e. getting links to your site — that ’s what makes the difference .
It ’s considered “ cloaking ” — and is thus taboo and risky — to clean up the URLs in your links selectively and only for spiders .
If your intentions are honorable , then you have nothing to fear .
All the major search engines have said as much .
You are helping the engines by removing session IDs , tracking parameters and other superfluous parameters from the URLs across your site — whether it ’s done by user - agent detection , cookie detection or otherwise .
After all , if it were bad , would Yahoo be doing it ?
Check it for yourself : visit the Yahoo.com home page with the Googlebot user agent string ( e.g. with Firefox using the User Agent Switcher extension ) .
You ’ll notice the “ ylt ” parameter has been stripped from all the links .
If you define a meta description , Google uses it in the snippet .
We already learned from my last column ( “ Anatomy of a Google Snippet “ ) that this is oftentimes not the case .
The bolding of words in a Google listing signifies that they were considered in the rankings determination .
Also discussed in my last column , this phenomenon — known as “ KWiC ” in Information Retrieval circles — is there purely for usability purposes .
H1 tags are a crucial element for SEO .
Research by SEOmoz shows little correlation between the presence of H1 tags and rankings .
Still , you should write good H1 headings , but do it primarily for usability and accessibility , not so much for SEO .
There are some unique ranking signals for Google Mobile Search , and they include the markup being “ XHTML Mobile ” .
Google Mobile Search results mirror those of Google Web Search .
By all means , create a mobile - friendly version of your site ; but do it for your users , not for SEO .
SEO is a black art .
And it ’s done , usually in a dark room , by some rogue SEO consultant , without requiring the involvement of the client / rest of the company .
If SEO were like that , our lives would read like spy novels .
The Disallow directive in robots .
txt can get pages de-indexed from Google .
As I explained in my article “ A Deeper Look at Robots. txt “ , disallows can lead to snippet - less , title - less Google listings .
Not a good look .
To keep pages out of the index , use the Noindex robots .
txt directive or the meta robots noindex tag — NOT a Disallow directive .
SEO is a one - time activity you complete and are then done with .
How many times have you heard someone say “ We actually just finished SEOing our site ” ?
It makes me want to scream “ No ! ” with every fiber of my being .
SEO is ongoing .
Just like one ’s website is never “ finished , ” neither is one ’s SEO .
Catalog marketers get this better than anyone else : they are used to optimizing every square inch of their printed catalog .
There is always more performance to be wrung out .
The “ set it and forget it ” misconception is particularly prevalent among IT workers — they tend to treat everything like a project so that they can get through assignments , close the “ ticket ” and move on , and thus maintain their sanity .
I ca n’t say I blame them .
Automated SEO is black - hat or spammy .
There is nothing wrong with or inappropriate in using automation .
Indeed , it signals a level of maturity in the marketplace when industrial - strength tools and technologies for large - scale automation are available .
Without automation , it would be difficult to impossible for the enterprise company to scale their SEO efforts across the mass of content they have published on the Web .
Chris Smith paints a compelling picture for SEO automation in this classic post .
A site map is n’t for people .
A good ( HTML , not XML ) site map is designed as much for human consumption as it is for spiders .
Any time you create pages / copy / links solely for a search engine , hoping they wo n’t be seen by humans , you ’re asking for trouble .
There ’s no need to link to all your pages for the spiders to see them .
Just list all URLs in the XML Sitemap .
Orphan pages rarely rank for anything but the most esoteric of search terms .
If your web page is n’t good enough for even you to want to link to it , what conclusion do you think the engines will come to about the quality and worthiness of this page to rank ?
Google will not index pages that are only accessible by a site ’s search form .
This used to be the case , but Google has been able to fill out forms and crawl the results since at least 2008 .
Note this does n’t give you permission to deliberately neglect your site ’s accessibility to spiders , as you ’d probably be disappointed with the results .
Placing links in teeny - tiny size font at the bottom of your homepage is an effective tactic to raise the rankings of deep pages in your site .
Better yet , make the links the same color as the page background , and / or use CSS to push the links way out to the side so they wo n’t detract from the homepage ’s visual appearance !
( I am being facetious here , do n’t actually do this . )
Using a service that promises to register your site with “ hundreds of search engines ” is good for your site ’s rankings .
If you believe that , then you may also be aware that there is a Nigerian prince who desperately needs your help to get a large sum of money smuggled out of his country , for which you will be richly rewarded .
Home page PageRank on a domain means something .
As in : “ I have a PageRank 6 site . ”
In actuality it means nothing .
As I already stated , toolbar PageRank is misleading at best , completely bogus at worst .
Furthermore , a high PageRank on one ’s home page does n’t necessarily equate to high PageRank on internal pages .
That ’s a function of the site ’s internal linking structure .
Outsourcing link building to a far - away , hourly contractor with no knowledge of your business is a good link acquisition solution .
And a sound business decision …
NOT !
As it is , the blogosphere is already clogged enough with useless , spammy comments in broken English from third - world link builders .
No need to make it worse by hiring them to “ promote ” your site too .
The clickthrough rate on the SERPs matters .
If this were true then those same third - world link builders would also be clicking away on search results all day long .
Keyword density is da bomb .
Ok , no one says “ da bomb ” anymore , but you get the drift .
Monitoring keyword density values is pure folly .
Hyphenated domain names are best for SEO .
As in : san - die go - real - estate - for - fun- and - profit.com .
Separate keywords with hyphens in the rest of the URL after the .com , but not in the domain itself .
Great Content = Great Rankings .
Just like great policies equals successful politicians , right ?

Despite previous governors ' refusals , McDonnell issues Confederate history month proclamation
Gov. Bob McDonnell ( R ) has quietly declared April 2010 Confederate History Month , bringing back a designation in Virginia that his two Democratic predecessors -- Mark Warner and Tim Kaine -- refused to do .
Republican governors George Allen and Jim Gilmore issued similar proclamations .
But in 2002 , Warner broke with their action , calling such proclamations , a " lightning rod " that does not help bridge divisions between whites and blacks in Virginia .
This year 's proclamation was requested by the Sons of Confederate Veterans .
A representative of the group said the group has known since it interviewed McDonnell when he was running for attorney general in 2005 that he was likely to respond differently than Warner or Kaine .
" We 've known for quite some time we had a good opportunity should he ascend the governorship , " Brandon Dorsey said .
" We basically decided to bide our time and wait until we had more favorable politicians in Richmond . "
Dorsey said the governor 's stamp of approval would help the group publicize the month and aide tourism efforts in the state .
" As I read it , this proclamation is more designed to get people to study the issue rather than simply being a tribute , " he said .
" We would like everyone in the state to honor the sacrifice of the brave men who went out and died in battle .
At the very least , we 'd like them to study why they went out and did it .
And I think the proclamation could be construed either way . "
The language can be seen on the governor 's Web site .
Richmond is the former capital of the Confederacy .
Sen. A. Donald McEachin ( D - Richmond ) said he was " stunned " to learn of McDonnell 's decision and even more stunned that the proclamation did not include any reference to slavery .
" It 's offensive , '' he said .
The proclamation is one of about two dozen McDonnell has issued since his inauguration in January .
Many , but not all , are posted on the office 's Web site .

IT COULD hardly get worse .
Sex scandals are breaking over the Catholic church with such fury ( see article ) that the Vatican has felt bound to defend Pope Benedict XVI himself .
Children at some Catholic schools in Germany have been systematically abused ; paedophiles were transferred to other jobs , rather than dismissed or prosecuted .
Abuse has surfaced in Austria and the Netherlands .
In Ireland Cardinal Sean Brady , the primate , has admitted that he was present in 1975 when two teenage boys were persuaded to sign oaths of silence about their abuse by Father Brendan Smyth .
The church defrocked Smyth , but nobody , including Cardinal Brady , told the police about his crimes and he remained free to abuse boys for two decades .
Yet denial still reigns .
Bishop Christopher Jones , head of the Irish episcopate 's committee on family affairs , has complained that the church is being singled out , when most abuse happens inside families and other organisations .
“ Why this huge isolation of the church and this huge focus on cover - up in the church when it has been going on for centuries ? ” he asked .
He is right that other secretive outfits ( orphanages in authoritarian countries , say ) are home to shameful abuse , but that misses the point .
No church can expect to be judged merely against the most depraved parts of the secular world .
If you preach absolute moral values , you will be held to absolute moral standards .
Hence , for Catholics and outsiders alike , the church hierarchy 's inability to deal with the issue is baffling .
The church now has exemplary child - protection rules — so strict , in fact , that they sometimes stifle healthily affectionate behaviour .
It is the scandals from the past that are so toxic .
Applying modern standards to conduct long ago is tricky .
The hierarchy in the past often saw paedophilia not as a crime with victims but as a sin that endangered the perpetrator 's soul : along the lines of alcoholism , or pilfering church funds .
A priest who “ erred ” deserved a rebuke , pastoral attention ( perhaps ) and a fresh start .
The dreadful damage done to the victims of the abuse was not appreciated , or was ignored .
A second delusion — still lingering in some church circles — was the conflation of paedophilia and homosexuality .
A sexual relationship between a priest and a teenage boy was regarded as wrong , just as a liaison between two priests would be .
But it did not count as a revolting abuse of trust .
Some add celibacy to the charge list .
Those cut off from family life may not appreciate the horror parents feel about abuse .
In a sex - obsessed age abstinence sounds unnatural and thus a cause of sexual deviancy .
Yet a moment 's reflection shows how unfair that is .
The childless care about children too .
Parents are some of the worst child - abusers .
And nobody has shown a statistical link between celibacy and paedophilia .
As in so many scandals , the cover - up compounds the original sin .
The guilty secrets of the past must be flushed out .
And bishops must admit their part in them .
It is odd that an institution founded on honesty and penitence should struggle so .
Today 's Catholic leaders might also recall that clerical abuses of power , defended by legalistic quibbling , greatly angered an itinerant preacher in Palestine two millennia ago .
MIT researchers have found a new way to use shape - memory alloys — metals that change shape when heated — to create small mechanical “ muscles ” for electronic devices .
The mechanical muscles — or actuators — can produce three to six times as much torque as electric motors of similar size but weigh no more than one - 20th as much .
Previous experimental actuators have used springs made from shape - memory alloys .
But the new actuator is easier to manufacture , since it can be cut out of a flat sheet of metal , and to mount , since the sheet can be bolted to a mechanical device ’s moving parts .
And since only a small section of the new actuator heats up when electrically charged — as opposed to the entire length of the spring — it should dissipate heat more easily and consume less energy .
Eduardo Torres - Jara , a postdoctoral associate in the lab of Professor of Computer Science and Engineering Daniela Rus , designed the actuators and fabricated them with the help of graduate student Kyle Gilpin and research assistant Josh Karges .
The researchers envision the actuators ’ use in devices too small for electric motors , such as the moving parts at the tips of minimally invasive surgical devices , or the tiny cameras built into laptops .
Hoo boy .
The American Beverage Association is n’t going to like this news one bit .
Food companies now add significant amounts of phosphates to soda and other processed foods .
And now researchers have found evidence that phosphates may accelerate aging ( via Science Daily ) :
High phosphate levels may also increase the prevalence and severity of age - related complications , such as chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular calcification , and can also induce severe muscle and skin atrophy .
“ Humans need a healthy diet and keeping the balance of phosphate in the diet may be important for a healthy life and longevity , ” said M. Shawkat Razzaque , M.D. , Ph.D. , from the Department of Medicine , Infection and Immunity at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine .
“ Avoid phosphate toxicity and enjoy a healthy life . ”
“ Soda is the caffeine delivery vehicle of choice for millions of people worldwide , but comes with phosphorous as a passenger ” said Gerald Weissmann , M.D. , Editor - in - Chief of the FASEB Journal .
“ This research suggests that our phosphorous balance influences the aging process , so do n’t tip it . ”
This has nothing to do with sweeteners , food coloring or any other previously established badness associated with soda and processed food — it ’s a “ new and improved ” risk .
And what , pray tell , are these phosphates doing there in the first place ?
According to other scientists , food companies starting adding them at high levels only in the last 20 years :
… [ W ] hile a moderate level of phosphate plays an essential role in living organisms , the rapidly increasing use of phosphates as a food additive has resulted in significantly higher levels in average daily diets .
Phosphates are added to many food products to increase water retention and improve food texture .
“ In the 1990s , phosphorous - containing food additives contributed an estimated 470 mg per day to the average daily adult diet , ” he said .
“ However , phosphates are currently being added much more frequently to a large number of processed foods , including meats , cheeses , beverages , and bakery products .
As a result , depending on individual food choices , phosphorous intake could be increased by as much as 1000 mg per day . ”
“ Increase water retention and improve food texture ” ?!
That ’s worth shaving years off our lives for sure !
We ’re all lab rats now .

A paper in Proceedings of the NAS showed that scientists were able to successfully predict who owned which keyboard and mouse based on the bacteria left behind on the keys .
Each of us carries a wealth of micro-organisms ( you 've got 100 times more non-human cells in your body than human cells ! ) and that microbial nation is distinctive — maybe as distinctive as a fingerprint .
Wired talked to a microbiologist who was n't impressed with the technique for criminal forensics ( we do n't know yet if microbial nations are static or if they change over time , nor how unique each one truly is ) , but they do note that microbes are useful in forensically distinguishing between identical twins .
" The results demonstrate that bacterial DNA can be recovered from relatively small surfaces , that the composition of the keyboard - associated communities are distinct across the three keyboards , and that individuals leave unique bacterial ' fingerprints ' on their keyboards , " wrote Knight and his colleagues at the University of Colorado , Boulder in a new paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences …
" If humans are thought of as a composite of microbial and human cells , the human genetic landscape as an aggregate of the genes in the human genome and the microbiome , and human metabolic features as a blend of human and microbial traits , then the picture that emerges is one of a human ' supra- organism ' , " argued a 2007 Nature paper lead - authored by Peter Turnbaugh , a Harvard microbiologist .

I like how the IT dominates the career fields on there .
IT can certainly be very rewarding and they pay is typically pretty good .
The biggest thing is that you can be really hit and miss with some companies .
One company can be high stress , lots of overtime , barely any paid vacation .
While another company is relatively low stress , lots of paid vacation , and almost no overtime .
So pick companies wisely .

Nick Clegg 's bandwagon appeared to have kept up its momentum last night at the end of a second far more personalised leaders '
TV debate in which he made an emotional final appeal : " Do n't let anyone tell you that this time it can't be different – it can . "
Expecting a backlash from Gordon Brown and David Cameron following a week in his which his popularity has surged , Clegg appeared to hold his own , and a slew of instant polls showed continuing and robust support for his party – a Guardian / ICM poll last night gave Clegg victory .
But all the party leaders appeared to have upped their game from last week .
Gordon Brown , giving a far more prime - ministerial performance , opened by admitting : " If it is all about style and PR , count me out . "
But he made some pointed attacks and rounded on Clegg in particular over the Liberal Democrats ' stance on nuclear disarmament , telling him to " get real " .
David Cameron was noticeably more relaxed , although he failed to deliver the key knockout blow against Clegg that he needs at some point if he is to secure an overall majority at the election .
The Tory leader repeatedly argued that his was the only party that could deliver change .
" It 's clear from last week 's debate that the country wants change but the question is : what sort of change and who is best placed to lead that change ?
If you vote Conservative you will get a new team and you wo n't be stuck with what you 've got now , " he said .
At the only point in the debate in which he appeared to get angry , he accused Brown of sanctioning leaflets full of lies over Tory plans to cut pensioners ' benefits .
Last night 's outcome suggests that the dynamics of the campaign – which saw the Lib Dems emerge as a powerful third force in the election – have not been reversed .
An hour after the end of the debate , a Guardian / ICM poll of 504 voters who watched the broadcast gave Clegg a narrow win , with the Lib Dem leader on 33 % and Cameron and Brown on 29 % each .
Brown , however , was considered the best potential prime minister of the three : he was on 35 % , with Cameron on 33 % and Clegg on 26 % .
Other instant polls suggested different winners , with Cameron topping one clearly , and Clegg winning in two .
Taken overall , the polls amounted to almost a dead heat , but Brown failed to top any of them despite a markedly improved performance .
He will hope he can improve again in the final debate on BBC1 next week , which will focus on the economy .
After the stunning surprise impact of his first TV debate , Clegg was unlikely to have the same revelatory impact a second time .
Nevertheless , he appeared to negotiate the potentially dangerous waters of his policies on Europe , immigration and the independent nuclear deterrent .
In one of the more memorable moments of the night , Brown rounded on the Liberal Democrat leader , telling him to " get real " on the need to replace Trident , and accused him of favouring an amnesty for illegal immigrants .
On Trident , Brown turned to Clegg and said : " I have to deal with these situations every day and I say to you Nick : get real .
Get real .
Because Iran , you 're saying , might be able to have a nuclear weapon and you would n't take action against them but you 're saying that we 've got to give up our Trident submarine and our nuclear weapons now .
Now get real about the danger that we face if we have North Korea , Iran and other countries with nuclear weapons and we give up our own . "
Cameron also rounded on Clegg on this issue , saying he agreed with Brown .
" You can not put off these decisions .
You have to make them early – you cannot rustle up nuclear deterrent at the last minute . "
After a week in which senior Tories have warned that a hung parliament would be a disaster for the country , Cameron appeared to backtrack , saying : " If there is a hung parliament , we will have to be responsible and do our best to make it work . "
Clegg appeared to seize on this .
" If a hung parliament happened the world wo n't end , and it will be your choice , " he told the voters , adding : " And if the people think no one party deserves support , then the parties have to accept that and work together .
We do n't simply need to choose from the old choices of the past , we do n't need to repeat the mistakes of the past . "
With much riding on his second performance , he betrayed the huge stakes , saying in his closing statement that the country was on the verge of " one of the most exciting elections we have had in a very long time .
People are beginning to hope we can do something different this time .
Do n't let anyone tell you this time it can't be different : it can . "
Earlier , Clegg tried to project himself as a modern , reasoned patriot , saying he was proud of the values that had made our country great – " human rights , democracy , the rule of law " .
But he went on : " The sad truth is that in recent years our governments , under the two old parties , have let those values down .
We should n't have sent our troops into harm 's way without the right equipment and decent pay .
We should n't be facing allegations that we were complicit in torture .
We should n't have invaded Iraq . "
Brown continued to be the most combative of the three men , but also addressed his own weaknesses with candour – making a startling admission about his own unpopularity and inability to communicate .
" This may have the feel of a TV popularity contest .
But in truth , this election is a fight for Britain 's future .
Your future and your jobs .
If it 's all about style and PR , count me out .
But if you want someone to make decisions , and with the judgment and a plan for the future , I 'm your man .
" Like me or not , I have a plan for Britain 's future .
And the way to do it is with a majority Labour government . "

Prostate cancer is a major killer , but the jury is out on routine screening Men should be warned that testing for prostate cancer can lead to unnecessary distress , researchers urge .
While the test is not routinely offered in the UK , men over 45 may request one .
If a man has high levels of the protein prostate specific antigen , a biopsy is carried out , which in most cases shows there is no cancerous growth at all .
A British Journal of Cancer study found for 20 % this was a distressing process , and that for some these feelings continued even after a negative result .
Researchers from the University of Bristol are calling for the psychological effects of testing to be clearly explained to men ahead of any investigation .
They followed 330 men throughout the testing process .
" We found that in some men , the psychological effects lasted even after the men were told their biopsy was benign , " said Professor Kavita Vedhara , who led the research .
" It 's essential that doctors know about this , and that men are fully informed of the psychological challenges they may face during and after a PSA test . "
Testing on request
Up to 70 % receive a negative biopsy result after having raised levels of PSA .
While the protein can be a marker for prostate cancer , it can also be caused by an infection , a non-cancerous enlarged prostate or even recent exercise .
But a major study last year suggested that routine screening could cut death rates by 20 % , prompting a review of the current policy of testing on request by the NHS .
A final decision will be taken this year , but a number of experts have expressed doubts about the long - term benefits of screening .
Worldwide , prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death .
Cancer Research UK , which funded the research , said : " This study shows just how important it is that men in their 50s and 60s can talk to their doctors about the pros and cons of having a PSA test and only have the test if they feel it is right for them . "
Dr Helen Rippon of the Prostate Cancer Charity noted that the majority of men in the study coped well emotionally with the PSA test and subsequent biopsies .
" However , one in five men taking part in the study reported high levels of distress around the time of biopsy which persisted even after they were told that the test had showed no evidence of cancer .
" It is vital that all men considering a PSA test are fully aware of its impact .
We must move swiftly to a position of ' universal informed choice ' where all men are made aware of their right to request a test and to be given clear information about its usefulness and limitations so they can decide whether having the test is right for them , " she added .

I guess it ’s official , more or less .
Director Barry Sonnenfeld tells me that “ Men in Black 3 - D ” is ready to roll .
Will Smith has signed on , Tommy Lee Jones is in , and a script is awaited .
Yes .
I did say 3D .
“ Men in Black 3 ” will be in 3D .
Sonnenfeld says it is so .
Why not ?
Everything else is , and this is one movie that might be cool in the process .
Sonnenfeld told me he ’d get me a neuralizer –that ’s the cigar holder like gizmo that erases memories – but he could n’t promise it would work !
( I love that thing . )
Nevertheless , you can bet Sony is juiced to get this puppy moving since “ Spider Man 4 ” fell apart .
They are in desperate need of a blockbuster for next Memorial Day May 2011 .
And “ Men in Black ” is like money in the bank .
I ran into Sonnenfeld , by the way , at Vanity Fair ’s annual outdoor cocktail soiree at the New York State Supreme Court building .
This is the party that launches the Tribeca Film Festival .
Graydon Carter greeted each guest as they climbed the massive stairs to th e portico .
Right behind him were Robert DeNiro and Grace Hightower , Jane Rosenthal and Craig Hatkoff , and everyone who ’s anyone in town .
That list included Jerry and Jessica Seinfeld , Chazz and Gia Palminteri , Brian Williams , Patricia Clarkson .
Google chief Eric Schmidt , Charlie Rose and Amanda Burden , Rob and Marisol Thomas , John McEnroe , Harvey Keitel , Ronald Perelman , Diane von Furstenberg and Barry Diller , Griffin Dunne , Ed Burns and Christy Turlington , Queen Noor of Jordan , Andre Balazs , Andrew McCarthy , John Leguizamo , Veronica Webb , Police Commissioner Ray Kelly , Mayor Mike Bloomberg , city councilwoman Christine Quinn , Drew and Ann Nieporent , and Oscar winning “ Precious ” screenwriter Geoffrey Fletcher .
Yes . just another night , Vanity Fair style !
Later we ran into Uma Thurman having dinner at Carter ’s Waverly Inn , while Graydon himself was said to have taken a gang up to ( his ) Monkey Bar .
And PS : here ’s a little gossip from John McEnroe , Wife Patty Smythe , a great rocker before she settled down with John to raise six children , is in Nashville recording her first album in 20 years !
Remember “ The Warrior ? ” http://tinyurl.com/y49cdae
Bit by bit , bipartisan negotiations in the Senate over financial regulatory reform have broken down .
Richard Shelby , the ranking Republican on the Banking Committee split with the Democratic Chairman , Chris Dodd in February .
Bob Corker filled the gap , stepping in to try to hammer out a compromise on an issue in which both parties see the potential for good policy and good politics .
But wary of delays after a bitter health care fight , Democrats voted the bill out of committee in March with no Republican support , and now are looking to open up the legislation to amendments and debate on the Senate floor .
As recently as last month , Republican leadership was open to a deal .
In a floor speech this morning , Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell threw cold water on the prospects of detente , establishing a hard line of attack against the Dodd bill , and indelibly marking the party line : “ We must not pass the financial reform bill that ’s about to hit the floor . ”
The crux of his criticism is that the bill “ institutionalizes … taxpayer - funded bailouts of Wall Street banks . ”
He knocked the expansion of power at the Fed and Treasury , while sounding the alarm on Wall Street accountability .
If the outline of his speech sounds familiar , it ’s because it is the exact argument pollster Frank Luntz urged Republicans to make earlier this year in a widely publicized memo .
Compare the excerpts below ( emphasis mine ) :
Luntz : “ The single best way to kill any legislation is to link it to the Big Bank Bailout . ”
McConnell : “ We cannot allow endless taxpayer - funded bailouts for big Wall Street banks .
And that ’s why we must not pass the financial reform bill that ’s about to hit the floor . ”
Luntz : “ Taxpayers should not be held responsible for the failure of big business any longer .
If a business is going to fail , not matter how big , let it fail . “
McConnell : “ [ The Dodd bill ] gives the government a new backdoor mechanism for propping up failing or failed institutions … .
We wo n’t solve this problem until the biggest banks are allowed to fail . “
Luntz : “ Government policies caused the bubble and its ultimate crash .
Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , the Federal Reserve , and the Community Reinvestment Act all had a role in the catastrophe .
The government inflated economic bubbles with easy credit policies . ”
McConnell : “ It also directs the Fed to oversee 35 to 50 of the biggest firms , replicating on an even larger scale the same distortions that plagued the housing market and helped trigger a massive bubble we ’ll be suffering from for years .
If you thought Fannie and Freddie were dangerous , how about 35 to 50 of them ? ”
( See “ Top 10 Financial Crisis Buzzwords . ” )
Thus begins the wrestling match for the populist mantle , both sides claiming their party as the champion of Main Street .
The Democrats ’ response to McConnell ( policy - wise ) will be that the tax for a “ bailout fund ” is levied on financial institutions that pose a risk to the system , and that such a measure would help refund taxpayers for the original cost of TARP , as well as avoid the need for Americans to foot the bill in the future .
Their political response will be basically the same as McConnell ’s attack : to paint the opposition as protectors of Wall Street interests and the status quo .
Though McConnell has been masterful at holding his caucus unified against the Democrats ’ major legislative agenda items so far , some observers predicted the anti-bank populism easily adopted by the Dems on this issue would make it difficult for the GOP to oppose legislation outright .
Not so ; the battle over financial regulation has just begun .
( See “ Financial Reform : Far from a Done Deal in Congress . ” )
Video and text of McConnell ’s speech :
[ youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8m2QLmraW0]
“ A lot of smart people have thought about how to prevent a repeat of the kind of financial crisis we saw in the fall of 2008 .
We ’ve heard plenty of ideas .
But if there ’s one thing Americans agree on when it comes to financial reform , it ’s this : never again should taxpayers be expected to bail out Wall Street from its own mistakes .
We cannot allow endless taxpayer - funded bailouts for big Wall Street banks .
And that ’s why we must not pass the financial reform bill that ’s about to hit the floor .
The fact is , this bill would n’t solve the problems that led to the financial crisis .
It would make them worse .
“ The American people have been telling us for nearly two years that any solution must do one thing — it must put an end to taxpayer funded bailouts for Wall Street banks .
This bill not only allows for taxpayer - funded bailouts of Wall Street banks ; it institutionalizes them .
“ The bill gives the Federal Reserve enhanced emergency lending authority that is far too open to abuse .
It also gives the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp and the Treasury Department broad authority over troubled financial institutions without requiring them to assume real responsibility for their mistakes .
In other words , it gives the government a new backdoor mechanism for propping up failing or failed institutions .
“ A new $ 50 billion fund would also be set up as a backstop for financial emergencies .
But no one honestly thinks $ 50 billion would be enough to cover the kind of crises we ’re talking about .
During the last crisis , AIG alone received more than three times that from the taxpayers .
Moreover , the mere existence of this fund will ensure that it gets used .
And once it ’s used up , taxpayers will be asked to cover the balance .
This is precisely the wrong approach .
“ Far from protecting consumers from Wall Street excess , this bill would provide endless protection for the biggest banks on Wall Street .
It also directs the Fed to oversee 35 to 50 of the biggest firms , replicating on an even larger scale the same distortions that plagued the housing market and helped trigger a massive bubble we ’ll be suffering from for years .
If you thought Fannie and Freddie were dangerous , how about 35 to 50 of them ?
“ Everybody agrees on the need to protect taxpayers from being on the hook for future Wall Street bailouts .
This bill would all but guarantee that the pattern continues .
We need to end the worst abuses on Wall Street without forcing the taxpayer to pick up the tab .
That ’s what Republicans are fighting for in this debate .
The taxpayers have paid a high enough price already .
We ’re not going to expose them to even more pain down the road .
“ The way to solve this problem is to let the people who make the mistakes pay for them .
We wo n’t solve this problem until the biggest banks are allowed to fail . ”
( See “ The Financial Crisis One Year After . ” )
UPDATE : Here ’s some clarity on what the bill actually does as far as “ bailouts ” go :
“ Roadmaps ” for shutting down banks :
The bill would require large institutions to periodically submit plans for systematic shutdown to be used in the event of disaster .
Higher capital requirements and restricted trading activities could be be used to punish companies that failed to submit adequate “ funeral plans . ”
These plans are supposed to help oversight agencies understand the best way to start dismantling the institution and selling assets quickly in a dire scenario — it ’s an information and transparency measure , not a structural change .
Liquidation : Under the Dodd bill , the FDIC would take charge of selling off pieces of large financial institutions that go bust , but the Treasury , Fed and a panel of bankruptcy judges would have to sign off on liquidating an insolvent firm before action could be taken .
( The judges are n’t a part of the Frank bill . )
( See “ Top Ten Bankruptcies . ” )
“ Bailout ” fund :
The biggest financial institutions pay into what is basically a bailout insurance fund , a $ 50 billion pool fed by a tax on the largest financial institutions that acts as a cushion between the cost of intervention and the taxpayer .
( The fund is $ 150 billion in the Frank bill . )
This money would be used to rescue or liquidate some firms in trouble , paying for taking bad assets off the books or the operational cost of busting down the company to spare parts .
The FDIC can borrow more money from the Treasury to work with while it sells off assets , but only as much as they expect to be repaid in the end .
If those funds get eaten through and the government lends institutions money out of its own pocket , the feds get to be first in line for repayment .
Worth noting : Current estimates put total losses from TARP at a bit under $ 100 billion .
So back to the issue at hand .
When McConnell talks about “ the tax payer , ” at least for the first $ 50 billion , he means the banks .
And when he says “ let them fail , ” he means do n’t seize and dismantle .
As far as “ institutionalizing ” bailouts , a more accurate characterization is probably that the bill establishes a protocol for rescue scenarios .
But that does n’t mean it incentivizes them .

Vote share figures exclude Northern Ireland as it has a separate electoral system to the rest of the UK
Seat change is adjusted to allow a direct comparison with the results from the 2004 election
In December a federal judge in Brooklyn ruled that it was unconstitutional for Congress to cut funds for ACORN without conducting a formal investigation into the low - income community activist group .
At the time , ACORN was still reeling from hidden camera videos which seemed to show ACORN employees advising a pimp and prostitute on tax evasion .
These carefully edited videos were eventually found to show no criminality , but ACORN 's funding was never restored .
( The group also came under fire because some workers had written false names like " Mickey Mouse " on voter registration drives in 2008 . )
In asking Judge Nina Gershon to reconsider her ruling , the government cited a Dec. 7 report written by a former attorney general for Massachusetts which " reinforces Congress ' purpose in preventing fraud , waste and abuse . "
But the AP reports that Judge Gershon ruled again that it was " unmistakable that Congress determined ACORN 's guilt before defunding it . "
She said Congress can investigate ACORN but cannot " rely on the negative results of a congressional or executive report as a rationale to impose a broad , punitive funding ban on a specific , named organization . "
Specifically , Gershon ruled that the Code of Federal Regulations establishes a formal process for deciding when federal contractors can be suspended or debarred , and " the existence of these regulations militates against the need for draconian , emergency action by Congress . "
She then ordered the government to alert federal agencies that they 're now allowed to fund ACORN , which has since dissolved in some cities , including New York , where the group is now performing a similar role as New York Communities for Change .
Lawyers for the government are considering appealing the ruling .

Brian Jones explains how the civil rights movement got a new burst of energy through the actions of four college students in Greensboro , N.C .
THE LUNCH counter sit-ins -- of African Americans seated at whites - only lunch counters and restaurants until they were served , one of the most enduring images of the civil rights movement in the U.S. South - - began 50 years ago today .
The first sit -in , undertaken by just four students from a technical college in Greensboro , N.C. , opened a new phase of mass action in the civil rights movement .
The simple act of sitting down at the whites - only lunch counter -- Blacks were required to stand and eat -- set an example for young people all over the country who were looking for a way to challenge Jim Crow segregation .
Within a single year , some 50,000 people had participated in one or more sit-ins .
The U.S. Supreme Court 's 1954 Brown v. Board of Education ruling to desegregate schools and the Montgomery Bus Boycott of 1955 - 57 are often perceived as the beginning of the movement .
But no mass actions followed .
Instead , the rest of the decade was marked by a racist backlash .
Through terrorism , intimidation and subterfuge , Southern whites tried to squash any hope that Jim Crow segregation might be vulnerable .
Four students sit at a lunch counter in defiance of segregation
Historian C. Vann Woodward describes how , all over the South , the " lights of reason and tolerance and moderation began to go out . "
He continued :
During 1957 , 1958 and 1959 , a fever of rebellion and malaise of fear spread over the region .
Books were banned , libraries were purged , newspapers were slanted , magazines disappeared from stands , television programs were withheld , films were excluded .
Teachers , preachers , and college professors were questioned , harassed , and many were driven from their positions or fled the South .
The NAACP was virtually driven underground in some states .
The effort to carry out the Supreme Court 's desegregation orders came screeching to a halt .
The number of school districts that were desegregated rose to 712 in the first few years after the Brown decision , but then plunged to only 17 by 1960 .
This historic logjam was broken not by Martin Luther King , Jr. , nor by the NAACP , nor by any of the established and venerated civil rights leaders and organizations .
It was broken by the direct action of fed - up college students .
LITTLE ACTUALLY occurred at the lunch counter on that first day .
The waitress predictably told the four youths , " We do n't serve colored here . "
" I beg to disagree with you , " responded Ezell Blair , pointing out that they had already been served when they purchased school supplies moments earlier .
Management instructed the waitress to ignore them .
An older white woman patted the students on the back .
" Ah , you should have done it 10 years ago , " she told them .
" It 's a good thing I think you 're doing . "
Other whites were not so encouraging ; they hurled familiar insults : " nasty , dirty niggers , " " you do n't belong here . "
A Black dishwasher behind the counter opposed the action .
" That 's why we can't get anyplace today , " she told the four , " because of people like you , rabble - rousers , troublemakers ... This counter is reserved for white people , it always has been , and you are well aware of that .
So why do n't you go on and stop making trouble ? "
The four remained seated until the store closed , but they returned to Woolworth 's the next day with 23 students .
The day after that , they brought 63 students , occupying nearly every seat at the lunch counter .
The effect of the protests was felt far beyond Greensboro .
The " sit-ins " were national news .
Within two weeks , students sat in at lunch counters in some 15 different cities in five Southern states .
Within the first year , they spread to 100 Southern cities .
Between 1961 and 1963 , 20,000 people were arrested , with 15,000 imprisoned in 1963 alone .
Daring to defy Jim Crow and winning , the students changed the way the nation saw them , and , importantly , they changed the way they saw themselves .
In the words of one participant : " I myself desegregated a lunch counter , not somebody else , not some big man , some powerful man , but little me .
I walked the picket line , and I sat in , and the walls of segregation toppled . "
Franklin McCain , thinking back on that first Greensboro sit-in , remembered the change : " I probably felt better that day than I 've ever felt in my life .
I felt as though I had gained my manhood , so to speak . "
By May 1960 , four theaters and six lunch counters were desegregated in Nashville .
Seven cities in Tennessee had at least some desegregated lunch counters by summer .
Success encouraged activists to push for more .
As historian Harvard Sitkoff explains :
[ T ]he student movement focused on eradicating other vestiges of Jim Crow and experimented with new forms of nonviolent direct action .
There were " kneel - ins " in churches , " sleep - ins " in motel lobbies , " swim-ins " in pools , " wade - ins " on restricted beaches , " read- ins " at public libraries , " play - ins " in parks , even " watch- ins " in movie theaters ...
These demonstrations fundamentally transformed the use of public accommodations in the border and upper South states , where by the end of 1961 , nearly 200 cities had begun to desegregate .
THE SIT - in movement challenged the established civil rights organizations and leaders .
It eventually forced them to support it , but in the first instance , students almost always had to push past the " old guard , " or go around them altogether .
In Atlanta , Jeremy Larner recalled that the established civil rights leaders called for a meeting with the students and told them :
So you see , kids , we 've been in this a long time .
We want the same things you do , but we know by now they can't be gotten overnight .
It 's our experience that you have to work slowly to get lasting results .
We 'd hate to see your movement backfire and spoil the things we 've worked so hard for .
You need guidance , and we hope you 'll have the vision to accept it .
The adults were n't just more conservative because they were older .
The anti-communist witch - hunts led by Senator Joseph McCarthy created an atmosphere of intimidation that cowed efforts to organize against segregation .
Tragically , the NAACP and the labor federation , the AFL - CIO , both collaborated in the witch - hunts .
The AFL - CIO expelled 1 million of its own members in the effort to rid itself of " communist " influence .
The NAACP did a similar purge , and did n't hesitate to expel one of its founders , WEB DuBois .
Thus , with many of the most militant , principled activists removed , both organizations became significantly more conservative .
The NAACP focused on challenging segregation in the courts , and specifically cautioned activists not to attempt to disobey the Jim Crow laws .
In 1947 , when the Congress of Racial Equality ( CORE ) attempted a campaign to desegregate lunch counters in Northern and Midwestern cities , ( consciously modeled on the sit - down strikes of the 1930s ) the NAACP warned that " [ a ] disobedience movement on the part of Negroes and their white allies , if employed in the South , would result in wholesale slaughter with no good achieved . "
But the younger generation was n't cowed by the witch - hunts , nor prepared accept segregation .
As far as they were concerned , change was overdue .
The anti-colonial struggles in Africa were a source of inspiration .
In 1960 alone , some 17 African nations gained independence from European powers .
If Black people could throw off white domination over there , why not here ?
Author James Baldwin was n't the only one who felt that " [ a ]ll of Africa will be free before we can get a lousy cup of coffee ! "
In 1960 , Howard Zinn was a professor at Spelman College in Atlanta .
He would later serve as an adviser to the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee ( SNCC ) and was eventually fired for supporting the student movement .
Zinn summed up the feeling among the students :
Impatience was the mood of the young sit - in demonstrators : impatience with the courts , with the national and local governments , with negotiation and conciliation , with traditional Negro organizations and the old Negro leadership , with the unbearably slow pace of desegregation in a century of accelerated social change .
Many of the students accepted the framework of the Cold War and the righteousness of the struggle against " communism , " even as they challenged their elders in practice .
Diane Nash , one of the first to participate in a sit-in in Nashville , connected the civil rights struggle to military competition with the Russians , stating that if Blacks were given equal education , " maybe some day , a Negro will invent one of our missiles . "
Taken purely on the level of ideas , the early demonstrations were not " radical . "
Students dressed up for the protests to emphasize their respectability .
They aimed not to tear down American capitalism , but to show that they deserved to be included in it .
IN APRIL 1960 , veteran activist Ella Baker convened 150 student activists from all over the South , plus 19 delegates from Northern colleges and approximately 50 representatives from the American Friends Service Committee for the purpose of creating an organization to strengthen and extend the student movement .
The founding statement of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee ( SNCC ) shows the degree to which the principal actors at that stage of the struggle viewed their actions primarily in moral and religious terms :
We affirm the philosophical or religious ideal of nonviolence as the foundation of our purpose , the presupposition of our faith , and the manner of our action .
Nonviolence as it grows from Judaic - Christian tradition seeks a social order of justice permeated by love .
Integration of human endeavor represents the crucial first step toward such a society .
Through nonviolence , courage displaces fear ; love transforms hate .
Acceptance dissipates prejudice ; hope ends despair .
Peace dominates war ; faith reconciles doubt .
Mutual regard cancels enmity .
Justice for all overthrows injustice .
The redemptive community supersedes systems of gross social immorality .
Certainly not all participants raised nonviolence to the level of a principle .
Students who were not religious and were already drawn to radical politics viewed nonviolence as a tactic .
Connie Curry , who is white , was elected as one of the non-student advisers ( along with Ella Baker ) to SNCC in its early days .
" See , we used to have argument after argument , " she remembered , " of whether or not nonviolence was a technique or a way of life , and that was probably one of the biggest debates in the early days of SNCC . "
Still , the dominance of religious and moral ideas made it easy for some on the left to write off the student movement -- it was too Christian , too liberal , it believed in the government and the Democratic Party .
But ideas always lag behind action .
The students had set themselves the task of ending Jim Crow , and committed themselves to whatever it would take to win .
Inevitably , that struggle would shape their ideas .
In a very short time , SNCC became the most radical of all the civil rights organizations .
Those who had chosen to abstain from the struggle because of its formally liberal ideas were doomed to irrelevance .
From its inception , SNCC members were on the front lines of the struggle .
They were the first to put themselves in harm 's way , the first to go to jail .
They dared to send their organizers into the Deep South to register voters and defy Jim Crow , the police and the Ku Klux Klan .
They did all of this for little or no pay , surviving on donated meals and sleeping on floors or the occasional bed , if one was offered .
As early as 1961 , the experience of organizing against Jim Crow , facing racist violence and suffering the foot - dragging of the federal government and the Democratic Party , produced a profound ideological shift among SNCC activists .
Tom Hayden sat in on a SNCC meeting in Mississippi that year and reported the activists discussed that :
[ b] eyond lunch counter desegregation , there are more serious evils which must be ripped out by any means ; exploitation , socially destructive capital , evil political and legal structure , and myopic liberalism which is anti-revolutionary .
Revolution permeates discuss like never before .
By 1963 , SNCC members were organizing study groups on Marxism , the Cuban revolution and African liberation struggles .
At their founding convention , they had allowed trade union allies to prevent Bayard Rustin from speaking because of his socialist background .
Now , a few years later , ironically , the same SNCC members considered Rustin and Martin Luther King too conservative , and criticized them from the left .
When King dismissed an aide in 1963 because of previous connections with the Communist Party , SNCC activists were enraged .
Stokely Carmichael argued that Negro moderates must " stop taking a defensive stand on communism ! "
That same year , SNCC leaders traveled to Africa to meet with anti-colonial leaders , and with Malcolm X .
The 50th anniversary of the lunch counter sit-ins comes at a time when a majority of voters put an African American in the White House because he promised " change . "
But we should never forget how change really happens .
" [ T ] he really critical thing is n't who is sitting in the White House , " Howard Zinn once said , " but who is sitting in -- in the streets , in the cafeterias , in the halls of government , in the factories . "
Segregation was n't destroyed by the Kennedys .
It was n't destroyed by the Supreme Court .
At the end of the day , segregation was overthrown by mass , direct action .
And it 's quite often that such mass movements start small -- say , with just four people .

Fake Forecasts , Misleading Statistics , Misguided Policies , Mass Unemployment and the Current Economic Crisis
Prof. Alan Nasser writes :
On March 17 Congress passed the “ Hire Now Tax Cut ” giving companies a break from paying Social Security taxes for the remainder of the year on any new workers hired who have been unemployed for at least 60 days .
The legislation is a token response to the emerging consensus in both the mainstream and independent media that the economy ’s unemployment problem is cumulative , structural and long term .
But the prescription is entirely inadequate to the diagnosis .
This should come as no surprise , as official sources have offered muddled and confusing accounts of the patient ’s malaise .

The Longstanding Travails of Small Business
The White House and the Fed ca n’t seem to coordinate their stories .
In January the president ’s Council of Economic Advisors reported that the official unemployment rate would remain close to 10 percent for at least 3 years , through 2012 .
The Council foresees unemployment above 6 % through 2015 and above 5 % through 2020 .
But on Feb. 24 Ben Bernanke reported to Congress a projected unemployment rate of 6.5 to 7.5 percent by the end of 2012 .
Both estimates almost certainly display the typical overoptimism of official economic forecasts .
There are two main reasons for the chronic unrealistic optimism .
The official measure of unemployment excludes both those who have given up looking for work because of the lack of jobs , and involuntary part - time workers .
If these are taken into account , the more realistic unemployment rate would be at least 16 - 17 percent .
A second factor distorting unemployment projections is the unrealistic rate of economic growth projected by official sources .
The Council assumed real GDP growth of 3.0 percent this year , and 4.3 percent in 2011 .
Bernanke forecast “ a moderate - paced economic recovery , with economic growth of roughly 3 to 3.5 percent in 2010 and 3.5 to 4.5 percent in 2011 , consistent with modern economic growth . ”
By “ modern economic growth ” Bernanke refers to the healthy growth rates of what economists call the “ Golden Age ” , the period from 1949 to 1973 .
This was the longest period of sustained economic expansion in American history : the economy grew at an average annual rate of 4.3 percent - the growth rate foolishly predicted , recall , for next year by the Council of Economic Advisors - and private - sector jobs increased at a rate of 3.5 percent a year .
And in 1973 the real median wage was the highest it ’s ever been .
The Golden Age is a benchmark for the authorities , and “ recovery ” is taken to mean a return to growth and employment rates at or close to those of 1949 - 1973 .
It is worth looking at some of the ways the administration and the media suggest the implausible scenario that Golden - Age economic conditions are on the way to resurrection .
Statistical manipulation and half - truths are not uncommon .
For example , in January the economy continued to bleed jobs , which is bad ; it was also widely reported that the unemployment rate fell , which looks good .
Both stats are accurate .
How is this possible ?
The official unemployment rate fell because the number of workers leaving the workforce declined more rapidly than job losses .
For the week ending February 20 , first - time jobless claims increased by 20,000 .
But we were told there was a silver lining : the number of unemployed workers collecting federally sponsored extended benefits dropped by 323,000 .
But this does not mean that those workers found employment .
The decline is almost entirely due to workers having exhausted extended benefits prior to Congress approving another extension .
On February 25 the Commerce Department reported a 3 percent January increase in sales of durable goods .
This looks especially promising : increased purchases of consumer durables such as autos , refrigerators and other big - ticket items had been a major factor in reversing most post - Second - World - War recessions .
But a closer look reveals that when defense and aircraft purchases are subtracted durable goods sales fell by 2.9 percent .
This comes as no surprise : with the number of unemployed continuing to increase , we should expect sales of higher - priced consumer goods to decline accordingly .
The media have claimed a rebound in manufacturing over the last few months , suggesting a corresponding job rebound in the making .
In fact , an inventory bounce was in play .
Businesses were re-stocking after an extended hiatus on new orders .
The evisceration of US manufacturing which began with the “ deindustrialization ” of the late 1960s persists through the recession , with the reorganized General Motors currently planning the export of more jobs to low - wage countries .
There is a telling indicator of the state of US manufacturing : we have no domestic consumer electronics industry .
Wal - Mart ’s fortunes are considered a good measure of consumer spending .
The company is after all the world ’s largest retailer and the country ’s single biggest employer .
The business press reports that Wal - Mart ’s profits continued to climb during the downturn , implying that consumers are managing to hold up in spite of the recession .
But we want to know about the company ’s domestic sales , a more accurate indicator of consumer purchasing power than total profits , which include overseas sales .
In fact , Wal - Mart recently announced its first drop in domestic sales in its history , a decline of 1.6 percent , compared to a 2.4 percent increase for the same period a year ago .
The relatively rosy profit picture is due to international sales , especially in Brazil and China .
The sales decline is of course yet another indicator of cumulative unemployment .
Finally , there is the statistical sleight - of - hand of the Bureau of Labor Statistics ( BLS ) .
BLS performs a " net birth / death adjustment " on its unemployment data .
The birth / death model uses business deaths to " impute " employment from business births .
Thus , as more businesses fail , more new jobs are imputed to have materialized through business births .
The birth / death model is based on statistics covering 1998 - 2002 .
This was a period during which explosive telecom and dot.com startups outumbered business failures .
That period bears no resemblance to today 's flat economic landscape .
While the " surplus " jobs created by start - up firms has been revised lower this year , BLS continues to report from the indefensible assumption that jobs created by start - up companies tend to offset jobs lost by companies going out of business .
John Williams of Shadow Government Statistics estimates that at least 50,000 birth / death jobs were conjured up in this way in the most recent BLS report .
What ’s relevant for assessing the health of the economy is that job losses continue to be cumulative .
Things continue to get worse at a slower rate , but this should be no comfort in the context of an economy that has lost 8.4 million jobs since December 2007 , including more than 4 million in the last 12 months alone .
More than 15 million Americans are looking for work , and 6.3 million have been unemployed for 6 months or longer , the largest number since the government began keeping records in 1948 and more than double the number in the next - worst recession , Reagan - Volcker ’s downturn of the early 1980s .
2.7 million will lose their unemployment benefits before the end of April unless Congress extends payments .
On top of all this , the economy must add 100,000 new jobs every month just to absorb first - time entrants to the labor force .
Obama acolytes will point out that while this is a regrettable picture , it does not imply that administration policy has produced no jobs whatsoever .
But on examination none of the job additions announced by the administration since the fourth quarter of 2009 is indicative of an economy in recovery or the return of permanent jobs .
Most fall under the category of “ saved ” jobs .
Employment improved for a while in sectors that are the direct beneficiaries of monetary or fiscal stimulus : government , healthcare , financial services , education and retail sales .
These jobs do n’t reflect the independent strength of the real economy ; they would not have materialized absent the stimulus .
Meanwhile , sectors such as manufacturing , the most reliable indicator of an intact real economy , continued to shed jobs at an alarming rate .
The stimulus will not persist forever , and when it is withdrawn , the " saved " jobs will be among the first to go .
Some have already begun to evaporate : schools , hospitals and state and local governments have been shedding jobs like crazy .
These data point to the atypical nature of the current stream of job losses .
We are not witnessing the kind of unemployment that attends a garden - variety recession .
That type of unemployment disappears as the economy recovers .
Peter S. Goodman points out in a detailed analysis in The New York Times that the recovery , whenever it begins , will not bring sufficient jobs to absorb the record - setting ranks of the long - term unemployed .
( “ The New Poor : Millions of Unemployed Face Years Without Jobs ” , February 21 , 2010 )
He describes the new poor as “ people long accustomed to the comforts of middle - class life who are now relying on public assistance for the first time in their lives – potentially for years to come .
” Goodman fleshes out an emerging consensus among mainstream business observers that he had described this time last year .
In “ Job Losses Hint at Vast Remaking of Economy ” ( NYT , March 7 , 2009 ) we were told that “ … growing joblessness may reflect a wrenching restructuring of the economy … .
In key industries – manufacturing , financial services and retail – layoffs have accelerated so quickly in recent months as to suggest that many companies are abandoning whole areas of business .
“ These jobs are n’t coming back , ” [ said a chief economist at Wachovia ] “ a lot of production either is n’t going to happen at all , or it ’s going to happen somewhere other than in the United States .
There are going to be fewer stores , fewer factories …
Firms are making strategic decisions that they do n’t want to be in their businesses . ”
The article quotes a Stanford Hoover Institution economist as saying “ The decimation of employment in legacy American brands such as General Motors is a trend that ’s likely to continue .
We have to stimulate the economy to create jobs in other areas . ”
This was one of the first allusions to what is now referred to as “ the new normal .
” The especially intractable unemployment problem is the result of structural and institutional changes in the economy .
Institutional investors have come to own an increasing percentage of large companies .
The new owners are driven to increase shareholder value by going for quick profits .
Cutting payroll is standard procedure .
The structure of the labor market has been affected by the decline of union power : employers can reduce costs by relying increasingly on part - time and temporary workers .
Exporting manufacturing and even white collar jobs to lower - wage countries further reduces the demand for US labor .
Unless a political movement emerges with the explicit goal of directly reversing these tendencies , none of this will change under current policy .
That these developments have been in the making for decades is evident in employment changes in business cycles - the economy ’s inhaling and exhaling , successive periods of expansion and contraction - since the 1950s .
During the Golden Age , from the 1950s through the mid-1970s , private - sector jobs increased during economic upturns / expansions at a rate of 3.5 percent a year .
During 1980s and 1990s expansions , job growth dropped to 2.4 percent annually .
Since 2000 , the figure fell to 0.9 percent .
The pace of job growth has steadily declined in each post - Golden - Age expansion .
That this is indicative of an unfolding structural deficiency in the economy is also shown by trends in the time it takes for a cyclical upturn to regain the jobs lost in the preceding recession .
Between 1950 and 1990 it took the economy an average of 21 months to return employment to its previous peaks .
After the 1990 and 2001 recessions the respective durations were 31 and 46 months .
This ongoing deterioriation in the performance of the labor market has led to the notion of the “ jobless recovery . ”
For most of US economic history this term would have been considered self - contradictory .
That it is now part of common economic discourse is testimony to a major conceptual revision in the discourse of propaganda : that the economy is recovering is no reason to expect unemployed workers to find work .
Economic recovery is now treated as consistent with declining standards of living .
Lowered expectations and acquiescence in long term working - class hardship are now built into what we are told to regard as recovery .
Within the framework of mainstream neoclassical economic theory , there are two outstanding confusions concerning the notion of “ recovery . ”
There is the misconception that once the economy begins its recovery it is on the way to sustained growth .
That is not how capitalism works .
The standard use of ‘ recovery ’ connotes a resumption of economic growth out of a cyclical recession .
An economy has recovered when it has regained what was lost since the peak of the previous expansion .
A new period of expansion is under way only if growth persists beyond the recovery .
Restoring the economy to health requires not only a period of successful recovery , but also sustained growth beyond the previous peak .
The prevailing talk erroneously assumes that only the first condition is at stake .
As things stand now with respect to employment , spending , bank lending , sales of consumer goods , the downward trajectory of wages , and investment in the real economy , there is no policy in place that gives reason for optimism regarding a recovery .
A fortiori , there is even less reason to expect renewed expansion .
A second confusion surrounds the very use of the term ‘ recovery ’ .
No alternative terminology is at hand , but ‘ recovery ’ needs to be replaced .
For the term suggests a return to a prior state of economic normalcy , a healthy economy .
But the state of the economy prior to the onset of the meltdown , prior to the burgeoning of the housing bubble , and even prior to the dot.com bubble , was neither normal nor healthy .
The bubble years began in the early 1990s , around the time Al Gore started nattering about the “ information superhighway . ”
Bubble - and debt - driven growth is neither normal nor healthy .
Since the late 1970s the US was well into deindustrialization , depressing net investment in the widget - producing economy and correlatively goosing investment in the financial sector , which began its now - infamous disproportionate growth relative to both total investment and GDP growth .
Household debt had also begun racing ahead of the growth of both disposable income and GDP .
Since 1973 the median wage has essentially flatlined .
Put this all together and what do you get ?
GDP growth increasingly driven by speculative activity rather than real production , and household spending decreasingly fueled by current income and increasingly driven by debt , the mortgaging of future years ’ expected income .
“ expected ” is key here .
Bubbles inevitably burst and the connection between the real and the financial economies reasserts itself with a vengeance .
Income expectations are not met and debts cannot be repaid .
Crisis ensues .
No serious commentator expects a return to anything resembling Golden - Age prosperity .
The economy is in the process of reconfiguration .
Postwar recessions through the 1970s were typically reversed by means including Fed monetary policy of reducing interest rates .
The Fed is now treating the crisis as if it were a standard downturn , only a lot bigger .
Accordingly , Bernanke has been releasing a virtually continuous flood of liquidity to no discernible effect .
A greatly expanded stimulus is needed , and one that directly creates jobs .
The Obama administration has no such intention .
The administration wants to get the credit machine running again so that the private sector can resume what is taken to be its natural function as principal creator of jobs .
Obama ’s advisors reason that since most Americans are employed by small businesses , priority must be given to enticing these operations to start hiring .
So Obama proposed $ 33 billion in new tax credits for small businesses , and on Wednesday the Senate sent the “ Hire Now Tax Cut ” for Obama ’s signature .
The administration is pitch blind to the fact that businesses will not invest and hire unless they have reason to believe that they will have customers , consumers ready , willing and able to spend .
Consumers would be ready and willing to spend were they able .
But they are not .
Piss - poor and declining wages , joblessness and record indebtedness are of course the principal obstacles .
Commercial establishments hire when they expect customers / buyers , and capitalists invest in production when they expect profits .
No rational employer / investor has any such expectations .
The circle is vicious : businesses wo n’t hire because workers have no money , and workers have no money because businesses wo n’t hire .
The circle will remain unbroken unless the lead actor in this tragedy , the consumer / worker , is provided with the means of spending from a source outside the circle .
This can only be government .
As labor militancy forced FDR to acknowledge , government must become a direct provider of employment .
Obama has ruled this out .
At the December 3 , 2009 “ jobs summit ” he repeated one of his favorite refrains : “ I want to be clear :
While I believe the government has a critical role in creating the conditions for economic growth , ultimately true economic recovery is only going to come from the private sector . ”
He admonished those who push for a government jobs program “ to face the fact that our resources are limited … .
It ’s not going to be possible for us to have a huge second stimulus , because frankly , we just do n’t have the money . ”
He was of course referring to the massive federal budget deficit of $ 1.4 trillion .
He left unnoted that the major reasons for the tripling of last year ’s deficit and explosive growth of the national debt was the bailout of the banks and the titanic “ defense ” budget .
( The administration plans to spend more on defense in real terms than any administration since 1948 – a period encompassing the entire duration of the Cold War .
Recall that this includes two large - scale , protracted regional wars in Korea and Vietnam . )
One searched in vain among the newspapers and magazines of the Ministry of Information for any critical suggestion that imperialism and the plutocracy are for Obama a higher priority than rescuing working people from creeping mass destitution .
Wednesday ’s gesture towards addressing the jobs catastrophe is recognized as play - acting .
A February 10 Associated Press report titled “ Promises , Promises : Jobs bill wo n’t add many jobs ” commented that the Senate bill “ has a problem :
It wo n’t create many jobs … .
Even the Obama administration acknowledges the legislation ’s centerpiece – a tax cut for businesses that hire unemployed workers – would work only on the margins . ”
The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the tax break just passed will generate only 18 full - time jobs per $ 1 million spent .
The ineffectiveness of these policies is crystal clear .
The administration either does n’t care , or will not allow itself to grasp the obvious .
It ’s commitment to market fundamentalism requires blindness , and the requirement is met .
The focus of the current legislation on small business is oblivious to finance capital ’s decades - long disdain of this sector .
In December 2009 the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) released figures showing that the amount of loans outstanding in the nation 's banks fell $ 210.4 billion in the third quarter of 2009 .
That was the largest quarterly decline since the FDIC began tracking loans in 1984 .
" We need to see banks making more loans to their business customers , " Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) Chairwoman Sheila Bair told reporters .
The FDIC figures show that banks have been deemphasizing business lending for many years , long before the current contraction commenced .
Since September 2008 the trend has intensified , with business lending contracting at a much faster pace than consumer lending .
The FDIC ’s tracing of this shift over the past decade underscores banks ’ increasing preoccupation with financial shenanigans at the expense of investment in the real economy .
At the end of the third quarter of 1999 , the assets of the nation 's banks totaled $ 5.5 trillion .
As of September 30 of 2009 , bank assets had grown to $ 13.2 trillion .
But commercial and industrial loans outstanding barely budged , only growing from $ 947 billion a decade ago to $ 1.27 trillion by September 30 this year .
At the same time , loans secured by real estate increased from $ 1.43 trillion in the fall of 1999 to $ 4.5 trillion this fall .
And investment in securities doubled , rising from $ 1.03 trillion to $ 2.4 trillion .
Last month the FDIC reported that bank lending contracted 7.4 percent in 2009 , at the fastest pace since 1942 , the first year of US involvement in the Second World WarBanks have lent sparingly to businesses for the past 35 years .
Businesses report that in each quarter since 1974 - the very beginning of post - Golden - Age austerity - ease of borrowing was either worse or the same as it was the prior quarter .
Business loans were increasingly hard to get over this entire period .
The data reveal a secular shift away from productive lending to businesses toward nonproductive lending to consumers and speculative investments .
Here is yet another indication of the structural deficiencies and institutional transformations discussed above that are generating a reconfigured economy .
Neither standard monetary pump - priming nor Obama ’s anemic measures are up to the task of addressing this historic transformation of the US economy .
The deindustrialized , financialized , debt - bloated private economy is no longer a feasible basis of economic revitalization .
The public sector must shift into gear .
How ?
Well , it ’s not as if we lack historical precedent .
Two Kinds of Long - Term Public Investment / Employment
The administration ’s opposition to long - range public investment is adamant .
The Washington Post ( November 8 , 2009 ) noted that White House officials reject the idea because it “ does not produce long - term value ” .
One suspects that “ long - term value ” means long - term private profit .
But why should public investment be expected to produce private profit … unless the administration adheres to the metaphysical premise that all public and private needs can and should be met through the market .
We have seen above that Obama is just such a metaphysician .
He channels his advisors .
Lawrence Summers , the chief economic advisor , asserted on October 19 , 2007 : “ [ P ] olicy measures to spur growth or achieve other objectives should wherever possible go with , rather than against , the grain of the market … .
There is no such thing as the success of the American economy that does n’t involve very substantial success for America ’s entrepreneurs and for American companies . ”
This is the old - time economic religion that is adhered to by the Washington powerful , and which can be defeated only by mass action .
If we are talking seriously about a genuine economic recovery , we advocate what we might call a “ national economic project ” .
I mean a large - scale public investment policy that would employ millions of workers in a range of projects and services designed to address immediate and pressing needs .
Most advocates of such a plan envisage government - funded public works programs to hire the unemployed .
They are right .
But more is required , namely public - service employment designed to meet needs not addressed by relying solely on infrastructure projects .
The case for infrastructure rehabilitation is powerful .
The most reliable source of information regarding the state of the US infrastructure is the American Society of Civil Engineers , which has released a “ 2009 Report Card for America ’s Infrastructure ” .
( Read it here : http://www.asce.org/reportcard/2009/grades.cfm)
The Report Card stresses the advanced decay of roads , surface transit and aviation , tunnels , dams , bridges , public parks and recreation , schools , drinking water , levees and sewerage facilities .
Accordingly , Uncle Sam earned a grade of “ D ” .
The engineers describe in exacting detail the most urgent problems , and price the investment need in infrastructure repair at $ 2.2 trillion .
In recent years there has been especially rapid deterioration in an infrastructure already in a state of advanced decay .
There were , for example , almost four times as many “ high hazard ” deficient dams in 2007 ( 1,826 ) as there were in 2001 ( 488 ) .
The Report states that “ Many state dam safety programs do not have sufficient resources , funding , or staff to conduct dam safety inspections , to take appropriate enforcement actions , or to ensure proper construction by reviewing plans and performing construction inspections . ”
The $ 787 billion “ stimulus package ” monies that might address what is in fact an emergency situation are the $ 71.76 billion allocated to construction projects , most of which remains unspent .
This comes to one thirtieth of the required $ 2.2 trillion , a shortfall of $ 1.176 trillion .
It is clear that the relevant project is national in scope and therefore requires the creation of new jobs on a coast - to - coast scale .
This task can not be met by the private sector alone .
In the light of what ’s been outlined above , Obama ’s promotion of alternative energy and “ green ” investment as a cure - all for mass unemployment is ridiculous .
We have been told that incentivizing homeowners to weatherize their houses - “ cash for caulkers ” - would represent a major step in addressing the jobs crisis .
Like Obama ’s other proposals , “ cash for caulkers ” would have the teensiest impact on unemployment , but it will provide major bucks for special business interests like Home Depot , whose chief executive was the most enthusiastic proponent of this idea at the jobs summit .
The New Deal ’s public employment projects were on the whole great successes .
The 1933 Civilian Conservation Corps ( CCC ) provided men ( no women ) work in the national forests and employed 2.5 million through 1942 .
In the same year the Civil Works Administration was established by executive order and within one year it created jobs for 4.3 million people .
The Works Progress Administration ( WPA ) of 1935 employed millions and oversaw , over the course of 8 years , the construction and repair of 650,000 miles of roads and the building of schools , libraries and recreational centers .
It ’s support of the construction of neighborhood parks employed skilled and unskilled workers , architects and artists .
It also established the only federal arts program the US has ever had .
As for the administration ’s claim that public investment “ does not produce long - term value ” , the CCC and WPA contributed hospitals , schools , auditoriums , museums , city halls , court houses , fire stations , water works , parks , fairgrounds , farmers ’ markets , and a range of other facilities .
Many of these are in use to this day .
What was created is astonishing : Hoover Dam , the San Francisco Cow Palace , DC ’s Reagan National Airport , Houston ’s City Hall , the San Antonio River walk , Bandelier National Monument in New Mexico , the Mountain Theater on California ’s Mount Tamalpais and the Eighteenth Precinct police station in New York City .
Many of us have forgotten , or never knew , that these were New Deal projects .
Most remember the collapse in August 2007 of the I - 35W bridge in Minneapolis , opened in 1967 .
This drives home how impressive it is that a depression - era contribution to the US transportation system like New York ’s Triborough Bridge still carries traffic every day .
The notion that government should assist or even take the lead in this kind of investment was not born of the Depression .
It ’s almost as American as apple pie .
Alexander Hamilton , and later the early nineteenth century Whigs , advocated “ internal improvements ” like canals , turnpikes and , later on , railroads .
( Hamilton ’s motives were mixed .
He intended of course to foster economic expansion westward , but he also had in mind the parallel development of America ’s financial markets . )
That government needed to be involved in these projects was plain economic good sense : because these undertakings required substantial initial outlays but delivered returns only over time , private investors could not foot the bill by themselves .
They thus needed government assistance , either in the form of financing , or , as with the railroads , spectacular gifts of public land , to make them possible .
Investing in physical infrastructure and green energy will give the greatest stimulus to two kinds of jobs , construction and manufacturing .
We who urge these types of spending have given insufficient attention to the distributive desiderata of public spending .
We have not addressed two essential criteria of an equitable jobs program : public investments should be selected with the aims of maximizing the extent of immediate job creation , and of ensuring that the benefits of job creation are available to the broadest possible category of worker , especially the most vulnerable to job insecurity .
The results of a recent study by the Levy Economics Institute of Bard College are helpful in this respect .
The Levy research shows that social - sector investment in areas such as early childhood education and home - based care are especially suited to meet the needs identified by these two criteria .
Social care investment generates more than twice the number of jobs as infrastructure spending and 1.5 times the number of jobs as green energy spending .
And social care investment is more effective than each of the other types in providing work to those with the least education , low - income households and women .
It also creates jobs in occupations identified in a 2006 Bureau of Labor Statistics study as among those most likely to add the greatest number of jobs between 2006 and 2010 : teaching , child care and home health care .
While most social - care jobs would be suited to the above categories , a significant number of jobs would also require some college education and are geared toward middle - and top - income groups .
Even Tim Geithner acknowledged two Januaries ago that “ social sector job creation delivers more bang for the buck . ”
We have seen that the administration ’s predilection for indirect job provision , through financial institutions , will not succeed .
Social care expansion consists in direct job - creating investment in social infrastructure , unlike the “ welfare reform ” welfare - to - work of Bill Clinton or public cash assistance .
And mainstream - type arguments support social infrastructure investment : it is more cost effective than hospital or institutional care for certain chronic patients , and home - based care lifts a burden off family members and allows them to be more productive at work .
According to a 1999 Metropolitan Life Insurance Company study , this would save the economy more than $ 33 billion a year in lost productivity .
That should water the mouthes of private employers .
Appeals to the more progressive are also at hand .
Women provide a treasury of unpaid care to children and the elderly .
Social care investment would provide direct payment for these highly valued services .
The employment crisis is as urgent as urgent gets , and intractable under the present economic settlement .
The inneffectuality of politics as usual could not be clearer .
The stubborn liberal hope , that mainstream politicians - financial investments made flesh - can be talked or voted into repudiating their masters ’ priorities , persists as if unfalsifiability were a virtue .
This delusion cannot be undefeatable .
That would mean , by implication , that history has come to its conclusion .
But history has no conclusion .
America has in hand a workable and desirable middle - term prescription for ordinary folks ’ mounting afflictions .
The task is to get it out .

Eigene Lightroom Presets erstellen : 19 Tipps von Dirk Metzmacher
Lightroom ist Adobes Favorit zum Verwalten , Entwickeln und Veröffentlichen von Bildmaterial , insbesondere der Rohdaten , frisch aus der Kamera .
Die Palette der Möglichkeiten zum Entwickeln der Fotos bietet uns zahlreiche kreative Umsetzungen an , von kontrastreichen Effekten , bis zu fantastischen Farbspielen .
Wir zeigen gleich 19 dramatische Umsetzungen bzw .
Tipps und Tricks .
Das Ziel : weg vom langweiligen Schnappschuss , hin zum sehenswerten Kunstwerk .
Lightroom Presets erstellen : Dramatischer Himmel
Es ist relativ leicht , einen Himmel dramatischer zu gestalten , wenn keine weiteren Elemente , wie etwa Bäume , Felsen oder Gebäude , im Weg stehen .
Dann können
Sie einfach mit der Belichtung und den weiteren Reglern spielen , um schnell zu erstaunlichen Ergebnissen zu kommen .
Doch wenn der Himmel zwar abgedunkelt , weitere Bereiche aber eben nicht dunkler werden dürfen , müssen wir etwas mehr ran .
Zunächst nutzen wir die Regler Lichter und Tiefen , um das Foto etwas ausgewogener wirken zu lassen .
Bei dem Weiß - Regler halten Sie die Alt - Taste gedrückt und ziehen den Regler zur rechten Seite , bis im Schwarzen einige Punkte auftauchen .
Auch bei dem Schwarz - Regler halten Sie die Alt - Taste , ziehen den Regler aber zur linken Seite hin , bis im Weißen einige Flecken zu sehen sind .
Ziehen Sie anschließend die Klarheit nach oben .
Coast of Indian ocean at sunset / # 114323632 / Dudarev Mikhail
Bei dem oberen wie unteren Screenshot wird es schon angedeutet , wie Sie noch gezielter arbeiten können : mit dem Verlaufsfilter .
Ziehen
Sie dazu den ersten Verlaufsfilter von oben über den Himmel auf .
Anschließend klicken Sie das Wort Effekt doppelt an , um alle Regler zurück zu setzen .
Spielen Sie mit der Belichtung und dem Kontrast , bis der Himmel perfekt erscheint .
Bereiche , die nicht dunkler werden dürfen im definierten Abschnitt , heben Sie wieder über den Tiefen - Regler hervor .
Bei Bedarf ziehen
Sie einen weiten Verlaufsfilter auf , um weitere Bereiche des Bildes gezielt anzupassen , wie etwa hier die Felsen , die mir zu dunkel erschienen .
Kontrastreicher Farblook
Wir nehmen zunächst eine allgemeine Entwicklung vor , um die Wirkung des Bildes besser einschätzen zu können .
Mehr Spaß bringt es bei dem folgenden Effekt , wenn die Aufnahme mehr Texturen zeigt denn glatte Flächen .
Wir spielen also mit den Lichtern und Tiefen , erhöhen den Kontrast und die Klarheit und sehen eine gute , kühle Aufnahme , die dank einem kontrastreichen Farblook auch ganz anders wirken kann .
A businessman / # 68180437 / ollyy
Ein guter
Weg , um die Regler einer Software kennenzulernen , führt über extreme Werte in den Einstellungen .
So habe ich hier die Temperatur auf +20 erhöht , die Belichtung leicht zurück genommen und den Kontrast auf +25 rauf gesetzt .
Die Lichter stehen auf - 100 , die Tiefen auf +100 , Weiß auf +50 , Schwarz auf - 50 .
Die Klarheit auf +100 und die Dynamik auf +70 .
Die Sättigung nimmt wieder etwas Farbe heraus , mit - 30 .
Bei der Gradationskurve wurden noch die Lichter um +40 erhöht und die Tiefen um - 40 herab gesetzt .
Experimentelle Einstellungen , die zu interessanten Farblooks führen können .
Zuletzt wurde das Ergebnis noch geschärft .
Da der Himmel sich auch verfärbt hatte , habe ich dem mit einem Verlaufsfilter und blauer Farbe etwas entgegengesetzt .

Sepia -Tönung
Das Foto wird zunächst ganz allgemein optimiert .
So wurde der Kontrast gesteigert , die Lichter auf - 30 und die Tiefen auf +60 eingestellt .
Da wir bei diesem Bild feine Texturen sehen , bietet es sich an , den Klarheit - Regler stark herauf zu setzen .
Unter HSL habe ich die Blau- , Lila - und Magenta - Regler auf - 100 gesetzt .
Das Ergebnis wirkt recht kühl , trotzdem nicht schlecht .
Young people against a graffiti / # 108860234 / wrangler
Für eine Sepia - Tönung wechseln Sie zu Teiltonung und stellen den Farbton jeweils auf 50 ein .
Die Sättigung wird auf jeweils 20 gesetzt .
Unter Effekte aktivieren Sie eine Vignette mit Betrag - 50 , Mittelpunkt 70 , Rundheit - 70 und Weiche Kante 70 .
Auch etwas Körnung kann nicht schaden .
So entsteht eine weitaus wärmere Version , mit ganz anderer Wirkung auf den Betrachter .
Lightroom Presets erstellen : Ansprechende Porträtretusche
Für eine kleine Beauty - Retusche nutzen Sie das Werkzeug Bereichsreparatur , wobei Sie einfach über die Hautstellen malen können , die optimiert werden sollen .
Lightroom setzt eine zweite Fläche an , aus der die schöne Haut kopiert wird .
Passt diese Stelle noch nicht so ganz , können Sie diese durch Anklicken und Ziehen ändern .
Da die Punkte zur Bereichsreparatur in Echtzeit in das Bild gerechnet werden , können Sie diese jederzeit editieren , ohne Qualitätsverluste befürchten zu müssen .
Intimate portrait of beautiful girl / # 158824367 / pio3
Nach einigen allgemeinen Optimierungen ( mehr Temperatur , Kontrast und Klarheit ) werden die Augen hervorgehoben .
Dazu aktivieren Sie den Korrekturpinsel und verkleinerst die Pinselgröße .
Malen
Sie dann über die weißen Bereiche des Auges .
Erhöhen Sie im Anschluss leicht die Belichtung und nehmen schließlich den Kontrast zurück .
Zur Reduzierung der Adern nehmen Sie etwas die Sättigung heraus .
Wir malen mit einem weiteren Korrekturpinsel direkt über der Pupille und erhöhen die Klarheit .
Möchten Sie die
Haut noch weicher gestalten , so malen
Sie mit einem weiteren Korrekturpinsel über die Haut , um dann statt Benutzerdefiniert das Lightroom Preset ( Vorgabe ) Haut weichzeichnen auszuwählen .
Wie weich die Haut erscheinen soll , regeln Sie über den Klarheit - Regler .
Auch die Lippen könnten
Sie separat mit dem Korrekturpinsel auswählen , um sie etwa umzufärben .
Krasse Schwarzweiß - Umwandlung
Wir nehmen zunächst eine einfache Schwarz - Weiß - Umwandlung vor , um zu sehen , in welche Richtung wir die Aufnahme entwickeln können .
Dazu stellen wir die Tiefen und Lichter ein , erhöhen die Klarheit , um dann Schwarz ( nach links ) und Weiß ( nach rechts ) mit gedrückter Alt - Taste einzustellen , bis die ersten Pixelflecken zu sehen sind .
Wir wechseln zu S/W , und nutzen die Regler der einzelnen Farbbereiche , um die Schwarz - Weiß - Umsetzung ansprechend wirken zu lassen .
Beautiful view of Doge ’s Palace / # 169792232 / Sailorr
Nach der Pflicht kommt die Kür : die Aufnahme wirkt jetzt schön , aber nicht so knallig , als das sie groß auffallen würde , weshalb wir für mehr Kontraste sorgen .
Dazu setzen
Sie mehrfach den Korrekturpinsel ein .
Malen
Sie über die Bereiche , die Sie gezielt aufhellen oder abdunkeln möchten und stellen die Regler Belichtung , Kontrast , Tiefen , Lichter und Klarheit ein .
Für jeweils einen Bereich definieren
Sie einen eigenen Korrekturpinsel , weshalb Sie nach jedem Einsatz auf Neu klicken , gleich oberhalb der Regler .
Möchten Sie einen Bereich doch noch einmal verändern , so klicken Sie den entsprechenden Punkt an und editieren die Regler .
Bleiben
Sie über einem der Punkte länger stehen , so sehen Sie eine rote Überlagerung , die ihnen zeigt , welche Bereiche erfasst werden .
Eine Vignette rundet diese ansprechende Schwarz - Weiß - Umwandlung schön ab .
Edler High - Key - Effekt
Hierfür brauchen wir natürlich ein recht helles Foto als Grundlage .
Aktivieren Sie im Histogramm in der oberen , rechten Ecke die Lichterbeschneidung .
Setzen
Sie jetzt die Belichtung so weit herauf , bis wichtige Bildbereiche beschnitten werden , was mit roten Flächen gekennzeichnet wird .
Deaktivieren Sie die Lichterbeschneidung , erhöhen die Lichter und setzen die Tiefen etwas herab .
Beautiful girl model with plastic around her neck / # 175650278 / Kjetil Kolbjornsrud
Wechseln
Sie nun zu HSL und nehmen von unten nach oben die Farben stark oder weniger stark heraus .
Je nach Bildinhalt kommt es da zu anderen Effekten .
Ziel ist es , die Farben zu reduzieren , um das Weiß noch klarer erscheinen zu lassen .
Mit der Klarheit steuern Sie den Kontrast .
Nutzen Sie die Gradationskurven , um über die Lichter , Mitteltöne und Tiefen den Effekt noch besser zu kontrollieren .
Sie sehen : die Stärke der Umsetzung lässt sich leicht steuern .
Lightroom Presets abspeichern
Wenn
Ihnen ein eigens erstellter Bildstil gefällt , wie etwa einer der soeben vorgestellten , so lohnt es sich vielleicht , diesen als Lightroom Preset ( deutsch : Vorgabe ) abzuspeichern , um in Zukunft viel Zeit zu sparen .
Im Entwickeln - Bereich sehen Sie auf der linken Seite schon Vorgaben , die Lightroom von Haus aus mitbringt .
Klicken
Sie da auf das kleine Plus - Icon , um ein neues Lightroom Preset ( eine neue Vorgabe ) zu erstellen .
Es öffnet sich das Dialog - Fenster zur Entwicklungsvorgabe , in dem Sie bestimmen , welche Einstellungen von dem Lightroom Preset erfasst werden .
Nutzen Sie einen Verlaufsfilter wie oben beschrieben , so aktivieren Sie auch diesen Eintrag .
Geben Sie der Vorgabe einen aussagekräftigen Namen .
Möchten
Sie nun das Lightroom Preset auf ein anderes Foto anwenden , so reicht ein Doppelklick auf die entsprechende Vorgabe .
Dramatischer Wolkenhimmel
Der Verlaufsfilter in Lightroom eignet sich besonders , um einen Neutraldichtefilter zu simulieren .
Wurde dieser vor
Ort nicht eingesetzt , so kann Lightroom die Abdunkelung des Himmels übernehmen , wobei der Vordergrund seine Helligkeitswerte behält .
Wie gewohnt entwickeln Sie das Foto zunächst komplett .
Hier wurde die Belichtung leicht reduziert , der Kontrast verstärkt und auch die Klarheit etwas erhöht .
Sie können den Himmel jedoch nicht so dunkel ziehen , wie Sie es gerne möchten , da sonst der Vordergrund versumpft .
Da kommt der Verlaufsfilter zum Einsatz , wobei dieser von oben nach unten aufgezogen wird .
Die weiteren Einstellungen sorgen nun dafür , dass nur der Abschnitt des Himmels weiter abgedunkelt wird .
Doch auch in der Wolkenstruktur gab es Bereiche , die schon dunkel genug waren .
Da kommt der Tiefen - Regler zum Einsatz , um diese Stellen doch wieder aufzuhellen .
Lightroom Presets erstellen : Nebel entfernen
Im Reiter Effekte kann nicht nur eine Vignettierung entfernt , sondern auch Dunst abgeschwächt werden .
Die Kontraste steigern sich , die weiße Nebelschicht verschwindet .
Jetzt können die weiteren Regler wie gewohnt zur Entwicklung eingesetzt werden .
Der Tipp ist nun , diesen Effekt generell als Alternative zur Kontraststeigerung einzusetzen , was sich besonders bei überstrahlten Bereichen auszahlt .
Ziehen Sie dazu die Tiefen auf +100 , die Lichter auf - 100 .
Setze erst dann Dunst entfernen ein. Verstärken
Sie danach die Kontraste .
Fokus setzen
Soll sich der Fokus auf einen Bildausschnitt konzentrieren , so können gezielte Unschärfen nützlich sein .
Aktivieren
Sie dazu einen Radial - Filter und stellen die Schärfe auf - 100 .
Oft ist eine generell stärkere Unschärfe gefragt ( oder auch abgestufte Unschärfebereiche ) .
Halten Sie einfach die Strg + Alt gedrückt und ziehen den Pin des Radial - Filters zur Seite .
Damit haben wir eine Schnell - Kopie erzeugt , die nicht nur anders positioniert , sondern auch eingestellt werden kann ( etwa mit anderen Werten bei der Schärfung ) .
Denken Sie auch daran , die Weiche Kante jeweils anzupassen .
Schneller Colorkey - Effekt
Beim Colorkey - Effekt geht es um das Zusammenspiel einer Farbe , die bestehen bleibt , wobei die restlichen Farben schwarz - weiß umgesetzt werden .
Nach der passenden Entwicklung folgt der Wechsel in den Reiter HSL , in dem unter Sättigung alle Farben entsättigt werden , die eben nicht stehen bleiben sollen .
Die gewünschten Farben , wie hier Orange , werden sogar noch gestärkt .
Störende Bereiche können dann noch mit dem Korrekturpinsel selektiv behandelt werden .
Intelligentes Schärfen
Über den Reiter Details gelangen Sie zur Schärfung von Lightroom .
Dabei bringen wir die Regler zu einem Punkt , an dem die Details scharf abgebildet werden .
Ein Problem ist nun , dass in den flächigen Bereichen oder Unschärfen ebenso Struktur entsteht oder Rauschen verstärkt wird , welches natürlich nicht sichtbar werden sollte .
Dann kommt der Regler Maskieren ins Spiel .
Je höher dieser eingestellt ist , umso mehr Bereiche werden von der Schärfung ausgeschlossen .
Doch ab wann greift die Maskierung auf welche Bereiche zu ?
Leicht wird das sichtbar , wenn bei dem Einsatz die Alt - Taste gehalten wird .
Die weißen Bereiche stehen dann für die Stellen im Bild , die geschärft werden .
Aufhelllicht
Soll ein recht dunkles Foto mit tiefen Schattenbereichen stark aufgehellt werden , so kommen Regler wie Tiefen und Schwarz schnell an ihre Grenzen .
Manche vermissen da den Einsatz des Reglers Aufhelllicht .
Dabei ist dieser immer noch erreichbar : gehen Sie in den Reiter Kamerakalibrierung und ändern den Prozess von Aktuell auf 2010 ab.
Nutzen Sie den Regler Aufhelllicht , um selbst in den dunkelsten Räumen das Licht anzuschalten .
Mit Farbe malen
Um Bildbereiche einzufärben ist es oft interessant , die Farbe direkt aus dem Foto aufzunehmen .
Aktivieren Sie den Korrekturpinsel und wählen als Effekt Farbe aus .
Klicken Sie das
Feld an , um die Farbe zu definieren und halten nach einem ersten Klick in dem “ Regenbogenverlauf ” die Maustaste gedrückt .
Ziehen
Sie nun einfach über das Foto .
So können Sie direkt eine Farbe aus dem Dokument wählen und damit arbeiten .
Gönnen Sie Ihren Aufnahmen einen coolen Bildlook wie aus Hollywood .
Mit einfachen Einstellungen kann Lightroom normale Aufnahmen in inspirierende Meisterwerke verwandeln .
So steuern Sie die Bildwirkung auf den Betrachter .
Sie werden staunen , was Sie alles aus ihren Fotos herausholen können !
Lightroom Presets erstellen : Fashion - Look
Aufnahmen im aktuellen Fashion - Bildlook zeigen nicht nur ein schönes Motiv in besonderer Pose , sondern auch einen speziellen Farbstil , um das Besondere zu unterstreichen .
In den Grundeinstellungen reduzieren Sie dazu die Temperatur auf - 15 und erhöhen die Tonung auf +15 .
Die Tiefen werden auf - 15 herab gesetzt , Weiß leicht erhöht und Schwarz leicht reduziert .
So wirkt das Bild weitaus kühler .
Die Klarheit wird auf +30 eingestellt , die Dynamik auf +20 .
Öffnen Sie die Teiltonung und klicken da auf den Farbwähler .
Jetzt können
Sie aus dem Farbspektrum die Farbe wählen , die zu der Farbstimmung passt , welche Sie mit dem Foto erreichen möchten .
Für die hellsten Bereiche im Bild habe ich hier einen Orange - Ton gewählt .
Für die Tiefen folgt ein bläulicher Ton. Über die Sättigung steuern Sie die Stärke der Umsetzung .
Dank HSL können
Sie auch noch einzelne Farbbereiche stärken .
Hier wurden die Rosen , der Lippenstift und das Kleid hervor gehoben .
Über Effekte wird eine Vignette aktiviert .
Der Betrag stand bei mir auf - 35 , Mittelpunkt auf +35 und die Rundheit auf +60 .
Auch die weiche Kante sollte sehr hoch eingestellt sein .
Sollen allzu dunkle Bereiche punktuell aufgehellt werden , so aktivieren Sie den Korrekturpinsel mit Belichtung und malent über die entsprechenden Stellen im Bild .
Urban Look
Nachtaufnahmen zeigen die leuchtenden Farben der Lichter .
Ist ihnen das das zu bunt , so können Sie sich auf einen Farbton konzentrieren und die restlichen in der Sättigung stark reduzieren .
Gehen
Sie dazu auf HSL und setze da die Farben auf - 100 , die Sie komplett entsättigen möchten .
Die anderen Farben ( hier etwa Orange und Gelb ) werden verstärkt .
Da Sie dem Bild Farbe genommen haben , geben Sie als Ausgleich Kontrast dazu .
Nutzen Sie Klarheit und Dunst entfernen ( unter Effekte ! ) .
Um den Orange - Ton der Lichter noch zu verstärken , gehen Sie auf Teiltonung , stellen da einen warmen Farbton ein und verstärken die Sättigung .
Film - Grain - Look
Besonders bei Schwarzweiß - Aufnahmen lohnt es sich zu testen , ob Sie mit etwas Körnung den besonderen Effekt eines Fotos noch optimieren können .
Ist das Bild farbig , so wird der Regler Sättigung auf - 100 gezogen , dann die Klarheit stark erhöht .
Die Regler Lichter , Tiefen , Schwarz und Weiß steuern dann die Umsetzung der unbunten Version im Detail .
Unter Effekte ist die Körnung zu finden .
Die Stärke bestimmt die Kontraste zwischen den hellsten und dunkelsten Stellen der Körnung .
Die Größe wirkt eher wie ein Weichzeichner auf die Körnung ; lässt diese also verschwimmen .
Der Regler Unregelmäßigkeit könnte auch Rauheit genannt werden .
Von einer „ ordentlichen “ Körnung geht es hin zu chaotischem Rauschen .
Im Zusammenspiel sind sehr schöne Grain - Simulationen möglich .
Cinematic Look
In zahlreichen aktuellen Filmen wird als Color - Grading - Effekt eine Mischung aus orangenen Highlights und bläulichen Schatten umgesetzt .
Dieser typische Orange / Teal Look lässt sich auch in Lightroom gestalten .
Gehen Sie dazu in den Bereich Kamerakalibrierung und spielen mit den Reglern Primärwerte Blau und Primärwerte Rot .
Sollte das noch nicht zum gewünschten Ergebnis geführt haben , so wechseln Sie in den Bereich Teiltonung .
Stellen Sie da die Farben der Lichter auf einen Orange - Ton , für die Tiefen auf „ Aquamarin “ .
Die Sättigung bestimmt die Stärke der Umsetzung .
Gehen Sie in die Grundeinstellungen und verstärken die Klarheit für einen schönen kontrastreichen Look .
Unter Effekte wird die Vignette des Bildes noch verstärkt .
Lightroom Presets erstellen : Western - Bildlook
Es muss nicht immer der action - geladene Film sein .
Auch der Western - Klassiker hat seinen Reiz .
Eine entsprechende Aufnahme wird hier über die Sättigung der Farbe fast beraubt ( - 65 ) .
Über HSL gehen Sie in den Bereich Farbe , um einen Farbton zu betonen .
Hier war das Rot .
So kommt es zu einem schönen Retro -Effekt .
Dieser kann noch verstärkt werden , indem bei der Teiltonung die Werte 40 , 80 , - 100 , 35 und 25 eingegeben werden .
So erreichen wir einen harten Sepia - Look , der gleich noch abgeschwächt wird .
Zunächst wird aber unter Effekte eine Vignette aktiviert .
Der alte , ausgewaschene Vintage - Effekt kommt nun über Dunst entfernen in das Bild .
Der Regler wird dazu stark in den Negativbereich ( - 55 ) gezogen .
Auch etwas Körnung passt zur Bildidee .

While making it crystal clear that this is only intended for developers that want a mega-early look at the platform , Intel and Nokia 's MeeGo team has just announced that the very first cut of the melded Moblin Maemo mobile platform is available for download .
Specifically , users of N900s Atom notebooks , and Atom - powered Moorestown MIDs have all been gifted with their own distributions , which will boot off a USB stick or directly on the devices themselves .
Sadly , the MeeGo user experience -- the good stuff , that is -- is n't included here , so if you flash your N900 you 're going to end up booting into a terminal console , but hey , some of you sickos are into that sort of thing , are n't you ?
Next up for the team is a release billed 1.0 that will come in May , and we 're told details on the road to that version will be unveiled over the coming days .
Take care of yourselves if you go for it , alright ?

With the enormous expansion of the welfare state with the passage of Obamacare , C.S. Lewis ’s insightful essay on the dangers , dehumanization , and immorality of welfare / therapeutic statism , “ Is Progress Possible ?
Willing Slaves of the Welfare State ” ( from his book , God in the Dock : Essays on Theology and Ethics ) is especially timely and noteworthy .
Here are some excerpts :
Two wars necessitated vast curtailments of liberty , and we have grown , though grumblingly , accustomed to our chains .
The increasing complexity and precariousness of our economic life have forced Government to take over many spheres of activity once left to choice or chance .
Our intellectuals have surrendered first to the slave - philosophy of Hegel , then to Marx , finally to the linguistic analysts .
. . .
The modern State exists not to protect our rights but to do us good or make us good — anyway , to do something to us or to make us something .
Hence the new name ‘ leaders ’ for those who were once ‘ rulers ’ .
We are less their subjects than their wards , pupils , or domestic animals .
There is nothing left of which whole lives are their business .
I write ‘ they ’ because it seems childish not to recognize that actual government is and always must be oligarchical .
Our effective masters must be more than one and fewer than all .
But the oligarchs begin to regard us in a new way .
. . .
I believe a man is happier , and happy in a richer way , if he has ‘ the freeborn mind ’ .
But I doubt whether he can have this without economic independence , which the new society is abolishing .
For economic independence allows an education not controlled by Government ; and in adult life it is the man who needs , and asks , nothing of Government who can criticise its acts and snap his fingers at its ideology .
Read Montaigne ; that ’s the voice of a man with his legs under his own table , eating the mutton and turnips raised on his own land .
Who will talk like that when the State is everyone ’s schoolmaster and employer ?
Admittedly , when man was untamed , such liberty belonged only to the few .
I know .
Hence the horrible suspicion that our only choice is between societies with few freemen and societies with none .
Again , the new oligarchy must more and more base its claim to plan us on its claim to knowledge .
If we are to be mothered , mother must know best .
This means they must increasingly rely on the advice of scientists , till in the end the politicians proper become merely the scientists ’ puppets .
Technocracy is the form to which a planned society must tend .
Now I dread specialists in power because they are specialists speaking outside their special subjects .
Let scientists tell us about sciences .
But government involves questions about the good for man , and justice , and what things are worth having at what price ; and on these a scientific training gives a man ’s opinion no added value .
Let the doctor tell me I shall die unless I do so - and - so ; but whether life is worth having on those terms is no more a question for him than for any other man .
Thirdly , I do not like the pretensions of Government — the grounds on which it demands my obedience — to be pitched too high .
I do n’t like the medicine - man ’s magical pretensions nor the Bourbon ’s Divine Right .
This is not solely because I disbelieve in magic and in Bossuet ’s Politique .
[ Jacques Benigne Bossuet , Politique tiree des propres paroles de L’Ecriture - Sainte ( Paris , 1709 ) . ]
I believe in God , but I detest theocracy .
For every Government consists of mere men and is , strictly viewed , a makeshift ; if it adds to its commands ‘ Thus saith the Lord ’ , it lies , and lies dangerously .
On just the same ground I dread government in the name of science .
That is how tyrannies come in .
In every age the men who want us under their thumb , if they have any sense , will put forward the particular pretension which the hopes and fears of that age render most potent .
They ‘ cash in ’ .
It has been magic , it has been Christianity .
Now it will certainly be science .
Perhaps the real scientists may not think much of the tyrants ’ ‘ science ’ — they did n’t think much of Hitler ’s racial theories or Stalin ’s biology .
But they can be muzzled .
. . .
A hungry man thinks about food , not freedom .
We must give full weight to the claim that nothing but science , and science globally applied , and therefore unprecedented Government controls , can produce full bellies and medical care for the whole human race : nothing , in short , but a world Welfare State .
It is a full admission of these truths which impresses upon me the extreme peril of humanity at present .
We have on the one hand a desperate need ; hunger , sickness , and the dread of war .
We have , on the other , the conception of something that might meet it : omnicompetent global technocracy .
Are not these the ideal opportunity for enslavement ?
This is how it has entered before ; a desperate need ( real or apparent ) in the one party , a power ( real or apparent ) to relieve it , in the other .
In the ancient world individuals have sold themselves as slaves , in order to eat .
So in society .
Here is a witch - doctor who can save us from the sorcerers — a war - lord who can save us from the barbarians — a Church that can save us from Hell .
Give them what they ask , give ourselves to them bound and blindfold , if only they will !
Perhaps the terrible bargain will be made again .
We can not blame men for making it .
We can hardly wish them not to .
Yet we can hardly bear that they should .
The question about progress has become the question whether we can discover any way of submitting to the worldwide paternalism of a technocracy without losing all personal privacy and independence .
Is there any possibility of getting the super Welfare State ’s honey and avoiding the sting ?
Let us make no mistake about the sting .
The Swedish sadness is only a foretaste .
To live his life in his own way , to call his house his castle , to enjoy the fruits of his own labour , to educate his children as his conscience directs , to save for their prosperity after his death — these are wishes deeply ingrained in civilised man .
Their realization is almost as necessary to our virtues as to our happiness .
From their total frustration disastrous results both moral and psychological might follow .
All this threatens us even if the form of society which our needs point to should prove an unparalleled success .
But is that certain ?
What assurance have we that our masters will or can keep the promise which induced us to sell ourselves ?
Let us not be deceived by phrases about ‘ Man taking charge of his own destiny ’ .
All that can really happen is that some men will take charge of the destiny of the others .
They will be simply men ; none perfect ; some greedy , cruel and dishonest .
The more completely we are planned the more powerful they will be .
Have we discovered some new reason why , this time , power should not corrupt as it has done before ?
I am curious to hear what explanation Zuffa offers this time .
Josh Gross breaks the story :
Two hours before doors opened Sunday at the 1stBank Center in Broomfield , Colo. , a UFC official informed Sherdog.com -- the largest independent MMA media site on the Web , the official MMA content partner for ESPN.com , and my home as an executive editor from 2004 - 2008 -- that its access had been pulled indefinitely because of a " executive decision , " multiple sources confirmed to SI.com .
Asked to comment on the decision to revoke Sherdog.com 's access , UFC president Dana Whitetold SI.com via text that his reasoning was " none of your [ expletive ] business . "
Darius Ortiz , the editor in charge of boxing and mixed martial arts for ESPN.com , and Sherdog.com founder Jeff Sherwood declined to comment on the UFC 's position .
Sherdog.com went without access to the UFC from late 2005 until the middle of 2009 , when it was allowed to return Octagon - side .
I 've tried to talk to folks close to the situation about the cause of the credential removal .
Either people are tight - lipped or they simply do not know .
Either way it hardly matters .
And frankly , the more I learn about what 's required to obtain and keep UFC credentialing ( both publicly and behind the scenes ) in the print and digital media space , the less I care to try at this point .
It 's an intractable situation .
Either competent journalists are allowed to report in a manner as objective , exhaustive and explanatory as possible or they are not .
And if you think Sherdog.com is incompetently run , I 'm afraid you know nothing about media .
The reality is the UFC is not interested in courting a fully competent and capable press .
Admittedly , there are many good journalists and more generally , good people who the UFC credentials .
There are also many good people who work in Zuffa 's PR offices .
I do not chide them for trying to look after themselves , their families and their careers .
But unquestionably , they are neutered .
There is limited universe as to what reporters can ask or report .
I have had several conversations with many of the folks who the UFC credentials today who have told me as much .
I am not putting words in anyone 's mouth nor am I assuming anything out of thin air .
This is a real living and breathing concern , albeit one shared to varying degrees .
The fact is it is hard to make the case the UFC takes the complete exercise of journalism seriously .
As we know , White sees the role of the media as a de facto PR arm for the promotion of MMA or more likely , the UFC itself .
They also openly credential the incompetent .
Others may have no problem with it , but I take issue with being part of a Senate where my contemporary is a horse .
Within the MMA space , one has to tread lightly to keep credentials .
And outside of the traditional MMA sphere , yes , the UFC is courting legitimate journalists at legitimate institutions .
About that there can be no debate .
But they are doing so to reach a different audience .
They are trying to capture the not - so - savvy - potential - MMA - fan .
It 's actually a very smart corporate strategy : get folks at traditional papers to write about you to widen the scope of the UFC to the mainstream audience .
I actually applaud them for that .
The problem ?
No one ever asks the tough questions in those circumstances either because they do n't care to or they do n't know how .
It 's a clever way of keeping all of the discussion on high - level message points at the surface level .
It 's also a bulwark for the veterans willing to ask questions or pursue stories that come from time spent on the job while keeping close the uninitiated and impressionable .
It 's perfectly reasonable to have issues with the coverage featured on Sherdog.com , but I 've yet to find anyone who can point to systemic problems that indict the entire operation .
And that is sort of key to the issue of credentialing .
Veteran reporters across the sports reporting landscape have told me time and again that their job is to fully and fairly report on matters as they see it without worrying if the league is going to have subsequent issues with the coverage .
None of them have argued that the UFC does n't have the right to credential as they see fit , but none seem to understand the wisdom in their present approach .
It 's the UFC 's world .
They can credential who they please .
No one can say otherwise .
But the costs of admission are candor , completeness and fairness , and not solely at the margins .
That 's a steep price to pay .
Guess who foots the bill ?
Are you passive aggressive but still desperately want to help an asshole learn how to park better ?
Here 's how you can tell them what they 're doing wrong while avoiding confrontation like a frightened little girl .

We know we 're sort of late to the whole YouParkLikeAnAsshole.com thing , but if you have n't already seen it , the site has printable " tickets " that you can leave on an offender 's car informing them of their particular transgression .

Said asshole is then invited to visit the website , where they receive a helpful tutorial pointing out why what they did was wrong and how they can avoid doing it again .
We 're guessing this might work for the casually careless driver , but real assholes might use the service to figure out new ways to piss people off .

Larry Burton ( Panama City , Fl. )
If you 've started reading this article it 's because you are a sports fan .
So was Charles Law .
He loved his Alabama Crimson Tide and knew that most of people attending his funeral were the darn fans of cross state rival Auburn .
Boy , did he have a memorable goodbye .
His obituary in the newspaper was mundande enough .
Here is the beginning of it : " CHARLES MICHAEL LAW 1949 - 2010 Funeral services for Mr. Charles Michael Law , 60 , of Montgomery , will be held Saturday , January 30 , 2010 at 1 PM at Fredericks Funeral Home Chapel with Reverend Hank Demous officiating .
Burial will follow in Auburn Memorial Park .
Visitation for Mr. Law will be held at 12 Noon on Saturday , January 30 , 2010 at Fredericks Funeral Home , one hour prior to the service .
Mr. Law was born on July 1 , 1949 in St. Louis , Missouri to the late Charles and Mary Law and passed away on January 27 , 2010 in Montgomery , Alabama . "
But even in death , Charles had to have the last word and poke the Auburn fans one last time .
Even though he was laid to rest at a place with the name of his rival school in it , there will be no doubt that this was an Alabama fan laid to rest here .
Below is an account of one of the few Alabama fans who attended his funeral .
Many of you may have known Charles Law as he was a fine attorney here in Montgomery who had a solid criminal law practice for some 30 years .
Charles died last week at the age of sixty .
He was such a nice guy , always pleasant to speak to , he will be greatly missed .
I have known Charles since childhood as we grew up in the same neighborhood .
Over the years our profession would cross paths as we would refer clients to one another on occasion .
Yet all this time , apparently what I did not know ( and how this is possible is beyond me ) was that Charles was a HUGE Crimson Tide fan !
What follows is my account of his funeral service this past Saturday which my 15 year old son and I attended in Opelika , Alabama -* Auburn that is * .
We arrived at the funeral home about thirty minutes before the service to pay our respects to Charles 's family and especially to his wife Pat .
Although I never got very close to the casket , I could see from a distance that it was open and it appeared that his body was casually attired .
My eyes however were drawn to what looked like a well worn crimson tide ball cap perched on the top of the pillow facing out toward the room where his head rested .
I had never seen something like that before but thought to myself , a tide fan for sure , that 's nice .
We soon made our way into the chapel and took a seat in the next to the last pew as there was a large gathering of friends and family .
The service began with a typical message from the minister who shared some of Pat and Charles 's favorite Bible verses .
From then on the story of this tide fan began to unfold .
Over the next half hour those in attendance were told by various speakers of the numerous occasions over the years when Charles was heavily out numbered by his friends and , I presume his wife 's family , who were * all devout *
Auburn fans .
It seems that Charles was always in the minority with this group , but nevertheless , he remained an undaunted Alabama fan .
One such story was that of an annual horse shoe tournament held during a men's camping weekend where Charles was the only Tide fan and the rest were in great number , big burley lumber jack types in orange and blue .
Charles was always very competitive and tenacious .
Although he apparently had little experience at horse shoes , he won that tournament as the story was told , not for him , but " to show those Aubs that the Tide was the winner " !
Another " Aub " speaker closed his talk by announcing that he had two last things to say for Charles .
The first was a long , stuttering , downright painful " ro...ro...rol...roll...roll ...
Roll Tide !
The congregation , which again was undoubtedly 99 % Auburn people broke up in laughter .
The speaker then looked toward the casket and stated how much he loved Charles , and that it was so ironic that he was taking yet another national championship with him to Heaven !
Groans erupted from those in attendance .
Soon the funeral director came to the front and motioned everyone to stand so that the casket could be wheeled out of the chapel .
As the pall bearers began to walk along beside it down the center aisle it happened .
Suddenly the strains of " Rammer Jammer Yellow Hammer " began to blast through the sound system .
" Hey Auburn , we just beat the hell out of you " !
I can only say that I was stunned .
My son and I looked at each other with a grin that just could not be suppressed .
It was unbelievable !
No sooner did that song conclude then did the Alabama fight song blare out !
This was a recessional like none other I had ever witnessed .
The Aubs were all stuck in their pews as the family had not exited just yet and I could see them twisting and turning .
Just when I thought it was over , as the fight song had ended with a resounding ' ROLL TIDE !" ........ suddenly from the speaker system you heard the shouting play back of the last 50 seconds of the 1986 Ironbowl !
" Shula 's back to pass , he has a man at the 30 , time is running out , Van Tiffin is on for the field goal to give Alabama a shot at the win " , the snap , the kick , its in the air , its GOOD , ITS GOOD , ITS GOOD , ALABAMA WINS , ALABAMA WINS !!!
I was just stunned - stunned .
Of course , being the tide fan I am I gave a great fist pump in the air and exalted " Roll Tide " !
The Aubs were in total shock .
All my son and I could do then was to make a quick exit for the door and I must confess , we were just hysterical by the time we got in the car .
I could not drive for several minutes .
This was by far the most unusual funeral service I have ever attended .
I can only assume that Charles was giving it back to the Aubs , even in death .
Indeed , a diehard Alabama fan !
There are some things in life that touch the soul of one 's being .
In the south , one of the those things is college football .
For Charles Law it was Alabama football .
What a man .
What a fan .
God rest his soul .
Now he has the best seat in the house .
( end of friend 's account )
Charles
Law just made my list of people I want to meet when I get to Heaven .
I want him to know his farewell made a lot of Alabama , and even Auburn fans smile on that sad day .
He'd be somebody I 'd like to watch a good old Alabama game with some Saturday .
I 'm sure by then , he 'll know the best place to watch it from .
The benefits of Conan O’Brien ’s move to TBS in November include more than just a reported $ 10 million salary and ownership of his show ; he ’ll also gain a host of new freedoms he never had on boring old standards - restricted NBC .
On sex - friendly , expletive - filled basic cable , the gutter ’s the limit !
And if Don Draper can do it or say it , then so can Conan , goddammit .
So what fun new things can he do ?
Not that he needs to push boundaries to be funny , but below are a few things Conan could technically feature on his upcoming TBS show .
( Also : Yes , we know that the FCC had no real authority over Conan when he was on NBC , since his show aired after 10 p.m .
But advertisers would ’ve thrown a fit if he ’d done any of these things on broadcast TV , whereas the relative permissiveness of cable advertisers makes possible filthy shows like Mad Men , Nip / Tuck , and South Park . )
“ Shit ”
It ’s not allowed on network TV , but a 2001 episode of South Park featured the unbleeped use of this low - level curse a whopping 162 times , paving the way for shows like Justified , Mad Men , and Nip / Tuck to use it , too ( albeit a little more sparingly ) .
Obviously TBS - employed Conan will freely deploy it as an exclamation , but we hope he ’ll find other uses for it as well .
For example , if NBC ’s lawyers decide that the Self - Pleasuring Bear is too similar to the Masturbating Bear , Conan can also rename the character the Shitting Bear ( it already wears a diaper ) .
A Drunk Studio Audience
Back when he was one of the hosts of cable ’s The Man Show , Jimmy Kimmel served his studio audience free beer for four whole years without any interference from Comedy Central .
But when he moved to ABC , the suits scotched his open - bar after just one spectator puked on camera during his first episode .
With Conan moving to TBS , maybe it ’s time somebody brought back insobriety to late night .
Team Coco worked hard to get Conan this TBS deal , and he owes them a few drinks .
Rear -entry Sex
Maybe it ’s because we ’ve had HBO since elementary school , but we did n’t realize that rear - entry intercourse was so much more of a TV taboo than the more standard kind .
But we just spent twenty minutes reading various advisories on the Parents Television Council ’s website , and they ’re just obsessed with it .
The major networks are still a little skittish about doggystyle , but , thanks to FX ’s Nip / Tuck , it ’s totally okay on cable .
It remains to be seen just how much good that does Conan , but if you should ever find yourself copulating on the set of his TBS show , be aware that the missionary position is not your only option .
Smoking
Now that Mad Men has made smoking glamorous again , no basic - cable show should be without it .
Conan does n’t smoke , but once he ’s on TBS , we hope that wo n’t stop his guests .
Just imagine how much easier it will be for him to book tar - lunged celebrities like Sean Penn , Katherine Heigl , and Barack Obama now that they can light up right on his couch .
Coke
With all the devil ’s dandruff flying up Arthur Frobisher ’s nose on Damages these days , Conan might look like a prude if his TBS show were totally coke - free .
Maybe doing a few pretend rails at his desk each night before his monologue would improve his dancing .

Fingerblasting
Like we said , if Don Draper can do it , so can Conan .
He ’d just have to find an open - minded guest .

There ’s been debate over the validity of annual game releases .
Long before Call of Duty took the front of the gaming field by releasing a title every year ( starting in 2006 with Call of Duty 2 ) games like Madden NFL have been consistently releasing a new title every single year .
In fact , the aforementioned Madden has been steadily releasing new titles since 1991 ; that ’s well over 20 games in the series , not including spin - offs .
We keep asking , “ When is enough , enough ? ” , but what about the converse , “ When is it too little , too late ? ”
In a recent discussion with some fellow gamers on the topic of Call of Duty , it was asked of me whether there is a similar feeling towards games with extended release delays between titles .
The example brought to me was Max Payne 3 , which is being released nearly a decade after Max Payne 2 : The Fall of Max Payne .
The question was : is it possible to enjoy or care about a game so far after the last iteration was released ?
And is it any different than the excessive releasing done by Activision ( COD ) and EA ( Madden ) ?
Admittedly , I felt a bit of pensiveness about Max Payne 3 .
For starters : it has been almost a decade since Max ’s story was told .
On top of that , the game will no longer take place on the dark , gritty streets of New York .
Max Payne is getting modernized — a tactic many game companies are using for reboots / sequels lately .
MP3 is slated to take place on the hot streets of São Paulo , Brazil , and takes place some years after MP2 ’s biting conclusion .
Rockstar have also shifted development teams , and Sam Lake was not brought on to write the third installment .
The issue that arises from this is that not only has it been a long time since the last story concluded , but the entire setting has changed .
Can an American crime - noire hold up in another country ?
Will São Paulo be a brand new and cohesive setting , or will it inevitably be New York reskinned ?
Can a game really be relevant after such a long time between releases ?
And is it really any different than the ennui we ’re developing seeing the same title cranked out every year with only a few minor tweaks to the engine , or arbitrary changes to game mechanics — e.g. adding more multiplayer content , but not fixing the bugs / issues of previous installments ; just adding a new roster ; now you can use both analogue sticks ?
Typically , if a game was mediocre when it came out , a sequel might be regarded with disdain and scorn ; most hoping the title would be forgotten to history .
Or perhaps it would incite rage that something so mediocre would be getting a sequel treatment above something they feel deserves it more .
Alternatively , if the game was good — or even great — fans and critics may feel that far too much time has elapsed to consider the new addition to the series relevant , or even a good idea ( e.g. my previous comments on Max Payne 3 ) .
And to an extent they would be right .
The reason I say that is because some games just belong in a particular time period .
A major reason why Duke Nukem Forever failed to deliver was that the game itself had outlived its relevancy .
Duke as a character embodied everything that was cheesy and fun about 90 ’s action stars ( film and game ) .
It can and will be argued that DNF ultimately failed due to the poor implementation of the different game mechanics , and yes , they contributed to the debacle .
However , his misogynistic exploits and demeanor eschews the poignant , grand - scaled , and tight - formed stories that most major companies are trying to release today .
As such , his character would feel entirely out of place unless he was given new characteristics , or even an overarching development from pissed off “ bad boy ” , to a wiser , deeper man .
But such a change would ruin everything that made Duke what he truly was , and more than likely would have alienated even more people who were approaching the product .
A logical decision Gearbox would make with any future Duke Nukem iterations ( Randy Pitchford has already hinted that they will release a new Duke title ) is to design Duke as a washed up hero who is called in as a last ditch effort to save the galaxy .
This could serve as a parody of the waning of the same movies / games Duke was originally a parody of , thus adding a level of complexity not only to his character — while not stripping away his persona and what made him a driving force to begin with — but to the jokes presented to us throughout the title .
There is a fine line that needs to be drawn as to how and where — or even if — a product can be released decades after it was first popular .
Titles like Mass Effect and Halo can span that gap because they ’re not rooted in any form of our reality , past or immediate .
They take place in either an alternate universe , or the future , but do n’t directly tie in current issues as metaphors or allegories .
The same can be held for games like Resistance , or even Uncharted / Tomb Raider .
Instead , these games offer alternative viewpoints of reality , creating a universe of their own that can subsist off of their own rules and regulations ; thus allowing them to be relevant regardless of what time they are released .
What comes into play as a difficulty is the story .
The more complex the story , the less time you can and should wait to release your next iteration .
Otherwise your fan - base will have long forgotten where you had been going , or just generally losing their interest to the next big thing .
With titles like Call of Duty , where the solo campaign is pretty much second to the online experience , it seems to make more sense financially to release a new title every year .
At the same time , however , it ’s burning itself out by not taking a year or two off to fully refine the game .
Even more so , the developers forget to focus on a strong or even lengthy campaign with decent writing .
The multiplayer aspect of the game is the primary focal point — so much so that we ’re essentially buying up expansion packs of previous games , but marked up to a full - game price .
The same can be said for most titles that release annually without granting any real changes .
So what is the fine line between too soon or too late ?
It depends on the type of title ; what it is offering to us , the consumer ; and the reality in which the game is based / grounded .
There will never be a universal definition of when a new title needs to come out soon , or when it ’s too late to release it , but it will almost always be easy to individually define .

A friend on facebook sent me the following quote from Mark Twain about the French Revolution .
Have a read too of Tom O’Lincoln ’s article on him in Socialist Alternative online .
The radical side of him is buried among the hubris of celebration .
Why , it was like reading about France and the French , before the ever memorable and blessed Revolution , which swept a thousand years of such villany away in one swift tidal - wave of blood — one : a settlement of that hoary debt in the proportion of half a drop of blood for each hogshead of it that had been pressed by slow tortures out of that people in the weary stretch of ten centuries of wrong and shame and misery the like of which was not to be mated but in hell .
There were two “ Reigns of Terror , ” if we would but remember it and consider it ; the one wrought murder in hot passion , the other in heartless cold blood ; the one lasted mere months , the other had lasted a thousand years ; the one inflicted death upon ten thousand persons , the other upon a hundred millions ; but our shudders are all for the “ horrors ” of the minor Terror , the momentary Terror , so to speak ; whereas , what is the horror of swift death by the axe , compared with lifelong death from hunger , cold , insult , cruelty , and heart - break ?
What is swift death by lightning compared with death by slow fire at the stake ?
A city cemetery could contain the coffins filled by that brief Terror which we have all been so diligently taught to shiver at and mourn over ; but all France could hardly contain the coffins filled by that older and real Terror — that unspeakably bitter and awful Terror which none of us has been taught to see in its vastness or pity as it deserves .

Out of the billions of human viewpoints , millions of human documents , thousands of human schools of thought , and hundreds of expressed philosophies , commonality is more common than you might think .
We can group them pretty clearly .
The most basic division is this :
Reality - based : People who think we should adapt to the patterns of reality .
We perceive how nature works , we make ourselves fit into it , and find a way to master it .
People who think we should adapt to the patterns of reality .
We perceive how nature works , we make ourselves fit into it , and find a way to master it .
Personality - based : People who think reality should adapt to us .
We pick how we wish nature worked , and impose it on reality , using our technology .
( This group always comes after the first has succeeded ) .
Now , physical reality is a terrifying thing .
It ’s out there , not in here — with our minds , and the minds of others we can access via language .
We can make an educated guess about how things can turn out , and can be very wrong , with horrible consequences .
By “ nature ” in this sense , I mean the interaction of forces that produces reality as we know it .
This covers all things we could model mathematically , including tossing your keys at the counter , trying to win a war , designing an engine , getting crops to grow , flirting with a girl .
It ’s all part of reality , with its ultimate reality layer : physical reality , and the consistent patterns it has which imply the natural laws we abstract from it .
From this introduction , you can tell — clearly ! — that this blog is about relationships .
I stumbled on a recent amazingly clear article at HuffingtonPost , who are completing a swing toward a moderate right position as their readers age :
Do You Agree About Major Topics ?
Some things simply cannot be negotiated .
*
You may want kids , but she does not .
* You ’re religious preference is Catholic and his is Buddhism .
* You have differing political beliefs .
* One of you has a much higher sex drive than the other .
* He is a risk taker and you prefer a substantial safety net .
How do you compromise on such a huge issues ?
Simply put , you do n’t .
While minor stuff , like who does what chore , can be discussed and argued , the big one ca n’t and will only get bigger over time .
But make sure you are on the same track about such major issues as children , finances , religion , or sex — or know in advance how you ’ll compromise .
– HuffPo
While this article was written about marriage , it applies to any relationship .
If you ’re not in it for the sex , you want it to last as long as it has realistic potential to succeed .
If you ’re in it for the sex , you ’re engaging in the form of shallowness that puts reward before the goal , and so will eventually wreck your psyche with its backward logic .
But for those who are looking to make life better for themselves , relationships mean that out of all the people out there , you ’ve found one that you think might be someone you ’d like to have near you for a long time .
And because of biological compatibility , there ’s a handy way to do that : a relationship , or courtship , which if it succeeds leads to marriage .
However , what ’s interesting about this article is the expression of a basic physical reality truth .
In personality - reality , or the vision of the world from inside our heads , we like to think that we can make anything work .
But back in physical reality , we realize there must be actual compatibility .
No , not the shallow stuff like both of you enjoying windsurfing and comic books , but the real compatibility : do you fit together biologically ?
Are your minds / personalities compatible ?
This requires you to step outside of your personality , which likes to think it can do anything , and consider yourself as an abstraction .
What can it do ?
What does it feel comfortable doing ?
What does it need to continue its function and , by doing that , make it content ?
You ’re looking at yourself as a vet would a dog brought in for treatment , or an engineer looking over a machine .
That ’s nerve - wracking for most people , who associate any such loss of control or view inside of the human machine as destruction of the illusion that they ’re godlike intellects willing events to be as they are in an enlightened and clear mind .
Back to reality : you ’re a bundle of nerves trying to find enough consensus on a reaction to act .
Plan for the animal .
In this relationship column , Jennifer Hunt and Dan Baritchi show us how the physical reality is going to trump everything else .
Regardless of how you can talk around it , fundamental splits in outlook are going to shatter you as a team .
She ’s a Democrat and you ’re a Republican ?
Well , those are pretty fundamentally opposing views — see the first list in this blog — and so there ’s going to be eventual strife when you have to decide on what basis you make decisions .
Same with religions , sex drive and risk - taking : these are personality defining decisions that are hard - coded into you .
If incompatible , they ’ll clash .
And another sneaky peek into how our decisions shape our futures :
Does She Know All Of Your Secrets ?
It can be hard to take that step in revealing all the embarrassing things they may do when alone or dastardly events in your past about which few people may know .
Even simple admissions like how much debt you owe .
Are you comfortable sharing this information with her ?
Is there anything she is n’t comfortable telling you , in return ?
Remember , honesty is key …
Your actions define you .
Not only who you were then , but what you expect and what you ’re numb to .
Did you accidentally have sex with 10,000 sluts before you met her ?
You ’re burnt out on affection .
You ’re probably going to be unable to form a true romantic attachment , and you ’ll be “ in love ” as long as you ’re “ in lust ” and then it will taper , even if you have good intentions .
Did you live as a homeless dude ?
Take drugs ?
Have a drinking problem ?
Are in debt or have been hugely in debt ?
These decisions reflect who you are .
If you ’re lucky , you can explain some as learning experiences , e.g .
“ My first business failed , and like a moron I made it a sole proprietorship , so I went shooting into debt quickly , but got it paid off last year . ”
And about those 10,000 sluts ?
You ’re looking at physical reality here .
Your decisions show who you are .
They also show what you can perceive , and what you can’t , and what you ’ve burned out on .
You are like every other organism on this earth a biological machine , and what ’s in your program does n’t change much even with discipline .
Even more , it ’s in your genes .
If you have trouble with the drink , at least half of your kids will as well .
If you banged 10,000 sluts , your daughter will , too .
That ’s why it ’s important to know these things when you ’re planning for a relationship , especially one that could last a lifetime .
Most advice columns want to tell you all about how you can decide to be whatever you want .
The article quoted above takes the opposite approach : instead of trying to make reality adapt to be what you want it to be , pay attention to what reality is and plan for it .
This dichotomy shows up in all that we do .
I recall watching a parent making the classic well - intentioned middle - class parent error .
Her daughter was asking about how people got married and had kids .
Would she do the same ?
The mother ’s clueless but politically - correct response : “ Whatever you want to do is fine .
If you want kids , or not , it ’s good by me .
Whatever you want is right . ”
To a child , that ’s a loaded statement .
It says , in this order :
I do n’t care what decisions you make and the consequences you face .
You ’re not important enough for me to pass along hard - earned knowledge to .
I do n’t want to appear as a fascist to you or others , so I ’ll throw the decision onto you , since you ’re the one who brought this challenge to me .
Because of that resentment , I ’ll blame you for how these decisions turn out , because I left them up to you .
That ’s the collision between personality - reality and physical - reality right there .
Physical reality is that the parent probably has strong opinions as to what their kid should do , based on their own observations of what works or not .
Personality - reality is the casting aside of strong opinions so not to appear fascist , and in resenting the child for asking , retaliatory blame .
Those of you who had middle - class Baby Boomers or Boomlet parents know this one well : “ It ’s all up to you !
I have no advice to offer !
Whatever you want is fine , but if you screw it up , it ’s all your fault and you ’re a bad kid . ”
This kind of “ I give up , you drive ! ” attitude is common to parents because they ’re so used to appearing benevolent to others , they ’ve forgotten that social reality ( personality - reality ) wo n’t guide their kids well .
But they ’ve stopped caring .
Personality - reality makes you think about yourself first , and they did take care of # 1 after all — anyone watching will think how progressive , liberal , benevolent , altruistic , egalitarian and most of all contemporary they are !
Saying “ whatever you want is OK ” signals to a child that they are a possession , not a person .
When you see that attitude becoming common in a society , you can be sure that that civilization is in its dying stages — people have gone from trying to figure out physical - reality , to living in personality - reality and pushing any sense of the consequences of their actions far from their minds .
That ’s how great empires fall .
No one notices because the slow death creeps up on them .
The behaviors they think are “ good ” turn out to look “ good ” to a large crowd of people who have trouble with physical - reality , so live in personality - reality , and soon the whole society secedes from physical - reality and lives in its own mind ( and by extension , the social mind ) .
A consensual hallucination ?
Indeed .
And some day , when the acid wears off , reality shows up and whacks them in the face with a rake .

When buying a new shampoo ( or whatever ) , I 'm always sure to ask the same question : " Has this been tested on animals ? " " No , " they often assure me .
" Well , do you have anything that was ?
" And of course they always do , because just about everything you put on , in and around your body has , at some point , made bokkie cry .
Which is fine by me .
I do n't want to end up with a head full of blisters because some tree - hugging liberal scientist was too much of a pussy to inject a little shampoo into a bunny rabbit 's eyes before flogging their jumped up soap to innocent consumers .
Now do n't get me wrong – I 've given this a lot of thought .
During my ideological post - adolescence I self - righteously became a vegan , which lasted for nearly three years .
And I hate vegetables , so I 'm sure you see the nobility of my sacrifice .
Delirious with starvation , I eventually allowed myself dairy .
Then eggs .
Then fish .
Then I devoured at fat , rare steak after drunkenly convincing myself that the animal had died peacefully in its sleep .
Probably .
In hyper - defence mode , I started campaigning for vegetable rights , which fitted neatly into my newfound carnivorous lifestyle .
"
It takes a single cow to feed a family for weeks , " I 'd opine to vegans .
" But do you know how many lives are lost because you 're inhuman enough to order a bean sprout salad ?
You 're eating BABIES !
" I still supported Beauty Without Cruelty , but then suddenly , Doc Martens became required footwear for gothy metalhead nerds .
Bugger .
Hobbling painfully out of the shoe shop as if the Mafia had just prepared me to sleep with the fishes , I realised that protesting against fur coats was no longer an option if I wanted to remain hypocrisy - free .
So I thought , what the fuck , and bought a leather jacket .
Awesome .
I 'm not completely without conscience .
I still support PETA 's anti-pet stance , although I suspect this has less to do with animal liberation , and more to do with the fact that I think pets are like babies that never grow up , and then die just as you 're getting used to picking up their shit .
I 've realised that my attitude to animal cruelty all comes down to my personal convenience .
Like Christopher Reeve - who could n't give a tinker 's cuss for stem cell research until the horse he was torturing got its own back - our principles are purely selfish , and often saturated with hypocrisy .
We protest vivisection , despite the fact that just about every cure and medical advancement we have would n't have been possible without it – including cures for cholera , smallpox and polio , and treatments like insulin penicillin pain killers and pacemakers .
Here 's a challenge : next time you 're ill , ask your GP for medication that has n't been tested on animals , and see where that gets you .
We protest fur , while wearing leather shoes .
We condemn traditional slaughter while standing around a fire topped with blistering flesh .
We measure the carbon footprint in our groceries , then go home and make more babies .
You might say , " Chris , you arsehole , those are entirely different things ! "
But do you honestly think an animal cares why it 's being murdered ?
It 's time to come clean , and accept the fact that animal rights take a distant second place , not only to humanity 's survival , but also to our comfort , convenience and yes , even pleasure .
So how about we dispense with all this fashionable , animal - loving bullshit , and live our lives without the constant need to apologise for being what we are ?
That 's what every other creature on the planet seems to be doing .
Finding the Best Broadband with Line Rental
To find the best phone and broadband deals for you , it ’s important to know where to start .
Most people will compare deals based solely on price .
Sure , you want to find the cheapest deal , but you also need a bundle that satisfies your needs .
So , start things off by looking at what you need from your broadband and phone bundle .
Take a look at each service , and figure out what things are a must - have for you .
Firstly , let ’s take a look at what you should think about when looking for a good broadband package :
Speed :
Your internet speed can be very important if you do a lot of things online .
Perhaps you stream live TV or download movies a lot ?
In this case , you ’ll need the fastest broadband there is , which is fibre optic broadband in the UK .
If you have a very limited internet usage , then you can probably make do with a standard broadband speed instead .
Usage : Every time you connect to the internet , you ’re using up data .
If you ’re an avid downloader / streamer , you ’re going to use up loads of data , fast .
In which case , you should be getting a package that has
Every time you connect to the internet , you ’re using up data .
If you ’re an avid downloader / streamer , you ’re going to use up loads of data , fast .
In which case , you should be getting a package that has unlimited data limits .
TV : If you love TV and want a service that includes loads of satellite subscription channels , then you may want to consider bundling your TV with your broadband .
It can save a lot of money , and most of the big companies like Sky , Virgin Media , and BT all offer TV bundles .
Look for The Best Home Phone Plan
Once you ’ve figured out what you want from your broadband , it ’s time to look at your home phone plan .
Generally speaking , pretty much every broadband package comes with standard line rental .
However , that does n’t mean there are n’t additional things you should look for in a home phone plan :
Inclusive Calls :
If you find everyone in your house is always using the home phone to chat away , then you can benefit from adding inclusive calls to your home phone plan .
But , if phone usage is rare , you can save money by just sticking with basic line rental or getting evening and weekend calls instead .
Call Charges :
It ’s important that you check how much a provider charges you for making calls with your home phone .
Often , they sneak in call charges in the small print , meaning you do n’t notice them until it ’s too late .
Extras : There are many extras you can add to home phone plans these days .
Popular ones include inclusive calls to mobile phones and cheap overseas calls .
Sure , extras will cost extra , but they ’re worth it if you really need them .
Who Provides the Best Broadband And Phone Packages ?
In truth , almost every provider will have a host of great broadband and phone deals for you to choose from .
Perhaps the biggest of the bunch are Virgin Media , Sky , TalkTalk , BT , and Plusnet .
These companies tend to have the best variety of phone and broadband deals , but do n't be put off by smaller providers you might not have heard of .
Broadband and Mobile Phone Deals
Some people want to combine their broadband with a mobile phone plan rather than a home phone .
There are a few bundling options out there , the likes of Virgin Media , TalkTalk and BT do offer some packages that include mobile phone deals too .
However , these also tend to include TV and home phone services too , meaning you pay for four services in total .
Truthfully , it makes more sense and can save you money if you get your mobile phone service from one of the many mobile networks in the UK .
As luck would have it , we ’ve got a mobile comparison service that will help you compare the best deals .
What 's a Landline ?
If you 're below a certain age , you might not remember the last time you used a landline phone .
However , most broadband deals come with phone lines too , and it 's worth considering whether you 're going to use yours .
Using your landline to make calls can save you some money if you select the right package .
Just like on your mobile , you can get inclusive calls with your landline .
You can choose anytime calls or evening and weekend calls if you just use your home phone when you 're not out and about .
You can also choose not to have any calls included if you 're not planning to use your landline much at all .
If you 're also looking for a better deal on your mobile , you can bundle up your broadband , TV , and mobile into one package to save money .
Can I Keep The Same Phone Number if I Switch ?
Yes , but only if you ’re staying in the same house as before .
If you ’re switching providers and moving to a different house , you might not be able to keep your number .
Especially if you ’ve moved far away and will need a different area code .
Can I Have a Second Phone Line Installed ?
You can get a second phone line installed , but it will cost you extra money .
The exact price will depend on your provider , so you should contact them and find out the specifics .
Getting a second phone line is a great idea if you ’re splitting your property into separate flats or want a dedicated business line coming into a home office .

Introduction :
When you buy your parts to build a new computer , CPU cooling is't always high on the list of things to get if you are not an enthusiast .
Mainly because the CPU comes with a heatsink already !
If it ai n't broke then do n't fix it right ?
Wrong !
But where do you go and what do you choose ?
There are plenty of coolers that can do the job but the size of the heatsinks and costs can vary from the mild to the wild .
One thing you think of as on the wild side is liquid cooling .
Liquid cooling can be decidedly on the wild side with pumps , blocks , radiators , and tubing in a myriad of possible combination 's .
Then you have the possible leaks and constant maintenance that have to be attended to .
In the end some people yearn for an easier way .
Coolit has had the answer with their pre-assembled and permanently sealed Advanced Liquid Cooling systems that come in a variety of configurations and costs .
They have taken the the wild side out of the equation and have brought reliability and long term value with the introduction of the Coolit ECO A.L.C..
Coolit has listened to the market when it comes to their products such as the Pure and Domino A.L.C. that performed well but fitting them into a chassis without room was a challenge , not to mention the cost associated with a high end pre-assembled liquid cooling system .
Coolit has put the ECO together as a low ( relatively at $ 74 ) cost solution with higher chassis compatibility due to the the compact assembly of the unit .
Cooling the CPU down can be a challenge any way you look at it , whether using air cooling or a high end custom water cooling setup .
Lets see if the Coolit ECO A.L.C. can handle the needs of the enthusiast .
Closer Look :
The Coolit ECO A.L.C. packaging comes without any flash but is all business .
Each panel of the package has information about the ECO A.L.C. .
Depending on which panel you look at , you will get a bit more information so you finish up with a true picture of what the Coolit ECO is all about .
Information you can read includes notes about the proprietary pump and its MTBF of 50,000 hours ,
The high performance radiator , universal retention mechanism , Coolit 's A.T.C thermal compound and more .
When you open the box you have a foam insert that holds the ECO A.L.C. and all of its accessories .
The outside of the insert holds the accessories that includes backplates for three different Intel sockets as well as mounting brackets to fit the latest socket configurations from AMD .
Splitting open the foam insert , you reach the ECO .
The contents of the packaging include everything you need to get started .
You get an instruction pamphlet , the ECO A.L.C. , Mounting brackets for AMD systems and backplates to install on the last three commercially available Intel sockets ( 775,1156,1366 ) .
The ECO comes fully assembled so all that is left is to mount it into the chassis of your choice .
Water cooling never looked so simple has it ?

Few statements are true in all respects or for all plausible interpretations .
This is especially true of interesting or significant statements and arises from the vague and ambiguous nature of language .
The only way we know of surmounting this problem is to look for proportion in a set of statements or ideas .
To this end and to make discussion more interesting the following quotes and aphorisms have been grouped into sets of two , three or more .
Successive items within each set have then been connected with an italicized word or phrase which suggests a relationship .

W ESTERN P HILOSOPHY
Have you ever wanted to read the classics of Western philosophy , but shuddered to think of how much time that would involve ?
Glyn Hughes has created a website called ‘ Squashed Philosophers ’ that is the answer to your ( perhaps unconscious ) prayer .
His brilliant idea was to take the works of the great philosophers from Plato to Karl Popper and to condense them to a fraction of their original length — the Confessions of St. Augustine was reduced from 160,000 words to 10,119 — while trying to retain their styles and famous maxims .
Hughes also provides a short introduction to each philosopher and his work , a glossary , and sometimes a Very Squashed Version of only a few paragraphs .
He even gives an estimate of the time required to read the squashed version , as well as its length as a percentage of the original work .
I have made extensive use of this time - saving website and I cannot recommend it highly enough .

T HE P ARADOX OF C AUSATION
An effect can become a cause , reinforcing the original cause and producing the same effect in an intensified form , and so on indefinitely .
George Orwell
for example
A man may take to drink because he feels himself to be a failure , and then fail all the more completely because he drinks .
for example
If thought corrupts language , language can also corrupt thought .
George Orwell
for example
We act as we do because we are what we are : and what we are is the result very largely of the use we have made of our freedom to act as we will .
INTELLECTUAL TOOLS
[ 2 ]
T HE P ARADOX OF E XTREMES
When a thing is pushed to its extreme , it moves to its opposite .
for example
Beyond a certain level of intensity , medicine engenders helplessness and disease .
Ivan Illich
for example
Beware the fury of a patient man .
John Dryden
for example
In every age of transition men are never so firmly bound to one way of life as when they are about to abandon it .
Bernard Levin
INTELLECTUAL TOOLS
[ 3 ]
L ANGUAGE D EALS IN H ALF - TRUTHS
There are no whole truths ; all truths are half - truths .
It is trying to treat them as whole truths that plays the devil .
A. N. Whitehead
in fact
Every heresy is a truth taught out of proportion .
G. K. Chesterton
for example
The ego or the self is a social construct .
for example
There is no such thing as objectivity in anything involving human interpretation .
for example
In personal and public life , in kitchen , bedroom and halls of parliament , men wage unremitting war against women .
Marilyn French
for example
Love is what we call the situation which occurs when two people who are sexually compatible discover that they can also tolerate one another in various other circumstances .
Marc Maihueird
for example
Nobody can make you feel inferior without your consent .
Eleanor Roosevelt
... nevertheless
There are no entirely false opinions .
The listener , then , must proceed from what is valid in the opinions of the speaker to the fuller and purer truth as he , the listener , understands it .
Josef Pieper
HAPPINESS & UNHAPPINESS
[ 9 ]
T HE S ECRET OF H APPINESS
The belief that youth is the happiest time of life is founded upon a fallacy .
The happiest person is the person who thinks the most interesting thoughts , and we grow happier as we grow older .
William Lyon Phelps
consequently
I have known some quite good people who were unhappy , but never an interested person who was unhappy .
A. C. Benson
yet
We act as though comfort and luxury were the chief requirements of life , when all that we need to make us really happy is something to be enthusiastic about .
Charles Kingsley
on the other hand
If we could have just one thing , it would be energy .
John F. Kennedy
HAPPINESS & UNHAPPINESS
[ 11 ]
C HRONIC B OREDOM IS S OMETHING
T O BE A VOIDED AT A LL C OSTS
Nothing is as fatiguing as boredom .
for example
Speaking of the public school at which he boarded C. S. Lewis wrote : I think that this feigning , this ceaseless pretence of interest in matters [ school games ] to me supremely boring , was what wore me out more than anything else ...
Never , except in the front line trenches ( and not always there ) do I remember such aching and continuous weariness as at Malvern .
consequently
When a thing bores you do not do it .
Do not pursue a fruitless perfection .
Eugène Delacroix
for example
Speaking about her work a former female associate of a prestigious Manhattan law - firm said , " At best it ’s tedious , and at worst the tedium will kill you .
It deadened my senses .
I ’d go out at lunch and find myself envying people who scooped ice cream for a living .
At least they could daydream all day . "
in conclusion
The enlightened person is not easily bored .
Nonetheless the enlightened person knows when he or she is being bored and knows for sure when she or he is not .
No amount of spectacle or surface glamour should ever persuade you that you are not being bored when , in fact , you are .
Lister Sinclair ( of CBC ’s Ideas )
LOVE & FRIENDSHIP
[ 19 ]
I S L OVE A F EELING OR AN A CT ?
Love is a matter of feeling , not of will or volition .
Hence there is no such thing as a duty to love .
Immanuel Kant
rather
It is obviously impossible to love all men in any strict and true sense .
What is meant by loving all men , is to feel well disposed towards all men , to be ready to assist them , and to act towards those who come in our way as if we loved them .
John Henry Newman
in other words
Genuine love is volitional rather than emotional .
M. Scott Peck
for example
Love seeks to make happy rather than to be happy .
Ralph Connor
for example
Love is an act of endless forgiveness .
Peter Ustinov
often
To love is to suffer ; to be loved is to cause suffering .
Comtesse Diane
LOVE & FRIENDSHIP
[ 20 ]
I S F RIENDSHIP THE H IGHEST L OVE ?
You ca n’t love what you do n’t know .
but
We only know someone through friendship .
St. Augustine
and
The bond of companionship , both in marriage and friendship , is conversation .
Oscar Wilde
LOVE & FRIENDSHIP
[ 21 ]
T O L OVE IS TO L ISTEN
Those who are unhappy have no need for anything in this world but people capable of giving them their attention .
Simone Weil
in fact
Attention is , in many ways , the heart of charity .
whereas
The worst sin towards our fellow creatures is not to hate them , but to be indifferent to them ; that ’s the essence of inhumanity .
George Bernard Shaw
consequently
The first duty of love is to listen .
LOVE & FRIENDSHIP
[ 22 ]
I S L OVE’S P ATIENCE I NEXHAUSTIBLE ?
Men have to be reminded that things must be loved first and improved afterwards .
G. K. Chesterton
however that may be
If you treat men the way they are you never improve them .
If you treat them the way you want them to be , you do .
Goethe
consequently
Have patience with all things , but chiefly have patience with yourself .
St. Francis de Sales
LOVE & FRIENDSHIP
[ 23 ]
S HOULD F RIENDSHIP BE THE M AIN
C OURSE IN L IFE ’S B ANQUET ?
You almost do n’t know you exist until someone else receives you .
Our friends create us in lots of ways .
however that may be
Life is to be fortified by many friendships .
To love , and to be loved , is the greatest happiness of existence .
Sydney Smith
whereas
He that has no one to love or confide in , has little to hope .
He wants the radical principle of happiness .
Samuel Johnson
LOVE & FRIENDSHIP
[ 25 ]
S OMETIMES T RYING TO B REAK D OWN
B ARRIERS IS A M ISTAKE
A different taste in jokes is a great strain on the affections .
George Eliot
perhaps
There is a certain distance at which each person we know is naturally placed from us .
It varies with each , and we must not attempt to alter it .
We may clasp him who is close , and we are not to pull closer him who is more remote .
Mark Rutherford
LOVE & FRIENDSHIP
[ 27 ]
D OES F RIENDSHIP H AVE THE
R IGHT TO E XCLUDE ?
I have no duty to be anyone ’s friend and no man in the world has a duty to be mine .
C. S. Lewis
because
In friendship ‘ Do you love me ? ’ means
‘ Do you see the same truth ? ’— or at least , ‘ Do you care about the same truth ? ’
The person who agrees with us that some thing is of great interest or importance can be our friend .
whereas
People not qualified to enter a circle of friends must be excluded or the circle will be transformed into something else .
C. S. Lewis
consequently
In friendship no standard applies except the standards of friendship .
That is why it is the most delightful of all human relationships .
Malcolm Muggeridge
LOVE & FRIENDSHIP
[ 28 ]
F RIENDSHIP IS LIKE E ROS
IN SOME R ESPECTS
Friendship must be willed .
But more than this is necessary .
A few years ago I worked on the same project with a man close to me in age and cultural interests .
I had high respect for both his intelligence and his emotional qualities .
We also found ourselves in perfect accord on ideological and spiritual matters .
I have rarely so intensely desired to become anyone ’s friend ; I confided my desire to him and from all evidence he had an identical desire .
We made meritorious efforts to meet one another , endeavoured to achieve as intimate a dialogue as possible and acted in all things like friends .
It was all in vain ; the emotional spark was not forthcoming .
We had to resign ourselves to being good companions , friends in the broad sense of the term .
We got along marvellously on the intellectual plane , but our emotional accord left something to be desired .
Ignace Lepp
consequently
Friendship , like eros and affection , has its source in emotional energy .
LOVE & FRIENDSHIP
[ 29 ]
U NDERSTANDING A NOTHER P ERSON
I S NOT AS E ASY AS IT L OOKS
Each man and woman dwells in a different environment — so different that I believe that not two people have so much as half in common .
Men know each other ’s inner world so slightly that they neglect this difference and it is only when two people have a relationship of utter love and trust that their inner lives begin to become perceptible to each other and are revealed as mutually most strange .
Sherwood Taylor
consequently
It is a luxury to be understood .
Ralph Waldo Emerson
ROMANTIC LOVE & THE OPPOSITE SEX
[ 32 ]
A G ENDER D IFFERENCE THAT
I S W ORTH R EMEMBERING
You see an awful lot of smart guys with dumb women , but you hardly ever see a smart woman with a dumb guy .
Erica Jong
because
Men love with their eyes , but women love with their ears .
consequently
Women woo men with dress and appearance while men woo women with words .
ROMANTIC LOVE & THE OPPOSITE SEX
[ 33 ]
I S C OMPETITION B ETWEEN THE S EXES
A T HING TO BE A VOIDED ?
The more men and women are rivals the less they are lovers .
however that may be
Winning an argument with the opposite sex is like winning a nuclear war .
After it ’s over life is n’t worth living .
perhaps
The more the sexes are in violent contrast the less likely they are to be in violent collision .
The more incompatible their tempers are the better .
G. K. Chesterton
ROMANTIC LOVE & THE OPPOSITE SEX
[ 36 ]
D OES S EXUAL A TTRACTION O PERATE
A SYMMETRICALLY B ETWEEN THE S EXES ?
The man ’s desire is for the woman ; but the woman ’s desire is rarely other than for the desire of the man .
Samuel Taylor Coleridge
consequently
Healthy sexual attraction between a man and a woman usually takes the following form : the man must desire the woman and the woman must know she is desired by the man .
but
Not everyone can find a partner who is personally as well as erotically compatible .
Quite often the ‘ perfect ’ sexual partners remain isolated in their solitude .
ROMANTIC LOVE & THE OPPOSITE SEX
[ 37 ]
I N M ARRIAGE A LWAYS A SSUME THAT
W HAT Y OU S EE IS W HAT Y OU G ET
There is no greater folly than to seek to correct the natural infirmities of those we love .
Henry Fielding
consequently
A man who marries a woman to educate her falls into the same fallacy as the woman who marries a man to reform him .
perhaps
People should marry selfishly so that they can act unselfishly after they marry .
HUMAN NATURE
[ 42 ]
T HE B RUTALITY OF R EASON
People do n’t ask for facts in making up their minds .
They would rather have one good , soul - satisfying emotion than a dozen facts .
in other words
Man is not a rational animal , but an animal capable of reason .
moreover
Nothing hath an uglier look to us than reason , when it is not on our side .
Marquess of Halifax
consequently
Reason is always a kind of brute force ; those who appeal to the head rather than the heart , however mild and polite , are necessarily men of violence .
G. K. Chesterton
HUMAN NATURE
[ 43 ]
A H OMELY B UT I MPORTANT P RINCIPLE
Most emotion is situated on the level of sense experience .
for example
We can face things which we know to be dangerous if they do n’t look or sound too dangerous ; our real trouble is often with things we know to be safe but which look dreadful .
C. S. Lewis
for example
Appearances beat the facts nine times out of ten .
for example
There are some people who state that the exterior , sex , or physique of another person is a matter of indifference to them , that they care only for the communion of mind with mind ; but these people need not detain us .
There are some statements that no one ever thinks of believing , however often they are made .
G. K. Chesterton
for example
I have heard with admiring submission the experience of the lady who declared that the sense of being well - dressed gives a feeling of inward tranquillity which religion is powerless to bestow .
Ralph Waldo Emerson
for example
It is almost impossible to remember how tragic a place the world is when one is playing golf .
HUMAN NATURE
[ 46 ]
H UMAN N ATURE
Human beings are creatures of emotion , creatures bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity .
Dale Carnegie
consequently
If you can engage people ’s pride , love , pity , ambition ( or whatever is their prevailing passion ) , on your side , you need not fear what their reason can do against you .
Lord Chesterfield
HUMAN NATURE
[ 49 ]
P ATIENCE I SN ’T A LWAYS A V IRTUE
Endurance is frequently a form of indecision .
however that may be
It would seem as if a living creature had to be taught , like an art of culture , the art of protesting when it is hurt .
It would seem as if patience were the natural thing ; it would seem as if impatience were an accomplishment like bridge .
but
One can reach a point of humiliation where violence is the only outlet .
Arthur Koestler
HUMAN NATURE
[ 55 ]
H UMAN N ATURE
The great consolation in life is to say what one thinks .
Voltaire
however that may be
Self - expression is the dominant necessity of human nature .
Dale Carnegie

Sam Goldwyn
HUMAN FRAILTY
[ 60 ]
H UMAN F RAILTY : I MAGINATIVE
What a man knows at fifty which he did n’t know at twenty is , for the most part , incommunicable .
Adlai Stevenson
because
Nothing ever becomes real till it is experienced — even a proverb is no proverb to you till your life has illustrated it .
John Keats
for example
For nothing can seem foul to those that win .
King Henry IV ( King Henry )
for example
We are all strong enough to bear the misfortunes of others .
de la Rochfoucauld
for example
One half of the world cannot understand the pleasures of the other .
Jane Austen
for example
A man must have grown old and lived long in order to see how short life is .
Arthur Schopenhauer
consequently
Everyone is a prisoner of his own experiences .
Edward R. Murrow
HUMAN FRAILTY
[ 61 ]
D O L IKES AND D ISLIKES W EIGH M ORE
W ITH U S THAN R EASON OR C ONSCIENCE ?
We resent offenses against our taste at least as much as offenses against our conscience or reason .
If we are not careful criticism may become an mere excuse for taking revenge on things we dislike by erecting our temperamental antipathies into pseudo - moral judgements .
C. S. Lewis
often
Morality is simply the attitude we adopt towards people we personally dislike .
Oscar Wilde
in other words
Men are disliked not for what they do , but for what they are .
Hugh Kingsmill
for example
I was glad when I found Celia ( his wife ) was unfaithful .
I felt it was all right for me to dislike her .
Charles Ryder to his soon - to - be lover
( from Brideshead Revisited )
HUMAN FRAILTY
[ 63 ]
B IGOTRY IS A F AILURE OF
THE I MAGINATION
Bigotry is an incapacity to conceive seriously the alternative to a proposition .
It is not bigotry to be certain we are right ; but it is bigotry to be unable to imagine how we might possibly have gone wrong .
G. K. Chesterton
whereas
The simple realization that there are other points of view is the beginning of wisdom .
Knowing what they are is a big step .
The final achievement is understanding why they are held .
but
It takes effort to imagine how other people see the world and many people are not prepared to make that effort .
HUMAN FRAILTY
[ 67 ]
H UMAN F RAILTY : E GOCENTRICITY
A man has his beliefs : his arguments are only his excuses for them ... we only see what we look at : our attention to our temperamental convictions blind us to all the facts that tell against us .
George Bernard Shaw
in other words
People only see what they are prepared to see .
Ralph Waldo Emerson
moreover
What ardently we wish , we soon believe .
Edward Young
for example
People believe lies , not because they are plausibly presented , but because they want to believe them .
So , their credulity is unshakeable .
Malcolm Muggeridge
consequently
It ’s not a controversial proposition that people tend to believe what they want , and that the strength of their conviction is usually proportional to their self - interest .
EGOTISM & SELF -DECEPTION
[ 81 ]
HUMAN F RAILTY : S ELF - DECEPTION
Everyone is guilty of enjoying the comfort of opinion without submitting himself to the discomfort of thought .
for example
If we could add up all the minutes we have dedicated to a critical examination of one of our most deeply held beliefs , we would probably be shocked at the ridiculously small sum .
nevertheless
One likes to believe that one ’s views on all subjects are the product of calm , dispassionate reasoning on the available evidence .
consequently
What probably distorts everything in life is that one is convinced that one is speaking the truth because one says what one thinks .
EGOTISM & SELF -DECEPTION
[ 82 ]
H UMAN F RAILTY : S ELF - DECEPTION
It is in the ability to deceive oneself that one shows the greatest talent .
Anatole France
for example
We always deceive ourselves twice about the people we love — first to their advantage , then to their disadvantage .
Albert Camus
EGOTISM & SELF -DECEPTION
[ 87 ]
A RE S UBJECTIVISM AND E GOISM
E SSENTIALLY THE S AME S IN ?
When you ’re an egoist all the harm you do is unintentional .
for example
Other nations use ‘ force ’ ; we Britons alone use ‘ Might ’ .
Evelyn Waugh
however that may be
We do n’t see things as they are , we see them as we are .
Ana‹s Nin
moreover
All violent feelings produce in us a falseness in all our impressions of external things .
John Ruskin
consequently
The truth is generally seen , rarely heard .
Gracian
on the other hand
Objectivity means that we can separate facts from our thoughts and feelings about those facts .
but perhaps
When a subject is highly controversial one cannot hope to tell the truth .
One can only show how one came to hold whatever opinion one does hold .
One can only give one 's audience the chance of drawing their own conclusions as they observe the limitations , the prejudices , the idiosyncrasies of the speaker .
Virginia Woolf
FEELINGS & EMOTIONAL ENERGY
[ 90 ]
F EELINGS ARE THE P RODUCTS AS W ELL
AS THE C AUSES OF A CTIONS
‘ To wrestle with a bad feeling only pins our attention on it , and keeps it still fastened in the mind ; whereas if we act as if from some better feeling , the old bad feeling soon folds its tent and silently steals away . ’
Thus William James claimed that negative states of consciousness are more effectively dissipated by strategic behaviour than by introspective scrutiny .
because
Action seems to follow feeling , but really action and feeling go together ; and by regulating the action , which is under the more direct control of the will , we can indirectly regulate the feeling , which is not .
Dale Carnegie
for example
Praising what is lost
Makes the remembrance dear .
All ’s Well That Ends Well ( King )
FEELINGS & EMOTIONAL ENERGY
[ 91 ]
I S IT P OSSIBLE TO R OOT O UT
U NCONSCIOUS B ELIEFS ?
Let your conscious beliefs be so vivid and emphatic that they make an impression upon your unconscious strong enough to cope with the impressions made by the formative experiences of your early childhood .
Bertrand Russell
because
Unconscious beliefs about oneself often grow out of childhood experiences and a negative view of oneself is at the heart of depression .
for example
You ’ve no idea what a poor opinion I have of myself — and how little I deserve it .
W. S. Gilbert
moreover
We are all apt to believe what the world believes about us .
George Eliot
consequently
We speak of independence of thought , but the real challenge is independence of feeling .
FEELINGS & EMOTIONAL ENERGY

D EVOTE Y OUR T IME TO THE T HINGS

The most exhausting thing in life is being insincere .
That is why so much social life is exhausting .
Anne Morrow Lindbergh
in fact
Only when a person is paying attention to something he really cares about can he concentrate and find true satisfaction .
consequently
People who bore one another should meet seldom , people who interest one another , often .
C. S. Lewis
FEELINGS & EMOTIONAL ENERGY
[ 93 ]
E MOTIONAL E NERGY IS O NE OF THE
M OST S OLID F ACTS OF L IFE
Emotional energy can no more be defined than pain or pleasure , but it is every bit as real .
moreover
Our emotional energy is meant to flow in a certain direction and if we impede that flow or try to redirect it unhappiness and dissatisfaction are sure to follow .
for example
Speaking of the family parties of his boyhood , C. S. Lewis wrote , ‘ My party manner , a deliberate concealment of all that I really thought and felt under a sort of feeble jocularity and enthusiasm , was assumed as consciously as an actor assumes his role , sustained with unspeakable weariness , and dropped with a groan of relief the moment my brother and I at last tumbled into our cab for the drive home .

Owing to differences of outlook a person of given tastes and convictions may find himself practically an outcast while he lives in one set , although in another set he would be accepted as an entirely ordinary human being .
A very great deal of unhappiness , especially among the young , arises in this way .
Bertrand Russell
consequently
The essence of living reasonably is to be where you feel you belong .
All forms of social malaise and discontent derive from ignoring this most important of all principles .
Malcolm Muggeridge
for example
There is something very wonderful about this country [ The United States ] , but not for me .
In no country that I ’ve been in have I felt so completely an outsider as here .
Malcolm Muggeridge
for example
Almost immediately after starting Exeter [ an exclusive New England prep school ]
I became miserably unhappy .
The reasons for my unhappiness were totally obscure to me then and are still quite profoundly mysterious to me today .
I just did not seem to fit .
I did n’t seem to fit with the faculty , the students , the courses , the architecture , the social life , the total environment .
Yet there seemed nothing to do other than to try to make the best of it and try to mould my imperfections so that I could fit more comfortably into this pattern that had been laid out for me and that was so obviously the right pattern .
And try I did for two and a half years .
Yet daily my life appeared more meaningless and I felt more wretched .
The last year I did little but sleep , for only in sleep could I find any comfort .

I NSTINCTIVE D ISLIKES
We often irritate others when we think we could not possibly do so .
de La Rochefoucauld
in fact
After appetite human beings seem to be driven by aversion as much as by anything .
for example
At the heart of our friendly or purely social relations , there lurks a hostility momentarily cured but recurring in fits and starts .
Marcel Proust
for example
I was taught when I was young that if people would only love one another , all would be well with the world .
This seemed simple and very nice ; but I found when I tried to put it in practice not only that other people were seldom lovable , but that I was not very lovable myself ...
The oddest thing is that you will find yourself making friends with people whose opinions are the very opposite to your own , while you ca n’t bear the sight of others who share all your beliefs .
You may love your dog and find your nearest relatives detestable .
So do n’t waste your time arguing whether you ought to love all your neighbours .
You ca n’t help yourself ; and neither can they .
George Bernard Shaw
consequently
Feelings of antipathy are instinctive and have to be recognized as such .
Since we can’t pretend we feel differently than we really do we simply have to accept our instinctive dislikes as an unavoidable trial .

It can never be repeated often enough that nothing intellectual can be achieved in a field that does not attract us .
Working in our vein , without a sense of effort , and , on the contrary , with a sense of ease and freedom , is the fundamental condition of a healthy mental operation .

Tolerance is a tremendous virtue , but the immediate neighbours of tolerance are weakness and apathy .

The real test of tolerance only comes after one is deeply committed to certain ideas , and deeply intolerant ( by logical necessity ) of the opposing ideas .
To show tolerance towards human beings who disagree with our passionate convictions is the vindication of tolerance .
in other words
Tolerance applies to persons , but never to truth .
Intolerance applies to truth , but never to persons .
Tolerance applies to the erring ; intolerance to the error .

Malcolm Muggeridge
moreover
You ca n’t have an unlimited expansion of the concept of equal rights or equal recognition because at a certain point it begins to undermine another necessary principle , that of community cohesion .
You simply can’t have a society that recognizes virtually all forms of behaviour as equal .

Technological progress makes whole categories of people useless without making it possible to support them with the wealth produced by the progress .

Milton Friedman
however that may be
I think that Capitalism , wisely managed , can probably be made more efficient for attaining economic ends than any alternative system yet in sight , but that in itself is in many ways extremely objectionable .
John Maynard Keynes
for example
In our society competitive capitalism has put family life and working life on a collision course .
for example
Normally speaking , it may be said that the forces of a capitalist society , if left unchecked , tend to make the rich richer and the poor poorer and thus increase the gap between them .
Jawaharlal Nehru
for example
Under capitalism the more money you have , the easier it is to make money , and the less money you have , the harder .
Or as Edgar Bronfman Sr. put it , ‘ To turn $ 100 into $ 110 is work .
To turn $ 100 million into $ 110 million is inevitable . ’
for example
Consumer capitalism is dedicated to the proposition that production is good in itself , no matter what is produced .
The net effect is the massive production of absurd , empty and useless items which are nevertheless utterly serious since we earn our living from them , and dedicate our leisure time to them .
Jacques Ellul
for example
A society in which consumption has to be artificially stimulated in order to keep production going is a society founded on trash and waste .

I think that where it is possible to do work that is satisfactory to a man ’s constructive impulses without entirely starving , he will be well advised from the point of view of his own happiness if he chooses it in preference to work much more highly paid but not seeming to him worth doing on its own account .

C OMMON S ENSE P HILOSOPHY
Sometimes a thing must first be trusted in order to discover whether it is trustworthy or not .
Such is the case with An Outline of Common Sense Philosophy .
In it we organize ideas under six main themes : logic , faith , common sense , mystery , paradox and language .
Within this framework we try to present and illustrate nine fundamental principles or insights .
They are as follows :
1. The Insufficiency of Logic
2. The Undeniability of Certainty
3. The Necessity of Faith
4. The General Reliability of Common Sense
5 . The Fact of Freedom
6 . The Inescapability of Mystery
7 . The Authority of Experience
8. The Paradoxical Nature of Being
9 . The Analogical Nature of Language
Although we claim that these nine principles constitute a ‘ Philosophy of Common Sense ’ we might just as easily have called them the ‘ The Fundamentals of Thinking ’ or ‘ The Laws of Thought . ’
This is not to say that all philosophies must abide by these laws .
Any kind of thinking can be dignified by the term ‘ philosophy ’ even if we sincerely believe it to be utter rubbish .
In fact , of the four main world views or philosophical systems possible to human thought , only theism is completely consistent with our common sense philosophy .
Buddhism is almost totally opposed to common sense philosophy , while monism and materialism lie somewhere in between .
But , for the sake of argument , it ’s not unjust to begin with a consistent set of principles that favours one particular world view .
Experience has taught us that freewheeling philosophical discussion is far less productive than discussion that proceeds within such a framework .
It allows one world view to be tested and understood more thoroughly than could any one of the various incompatible philosophies that emerge in fragmentary form in the course of an intellectually unbounded discussion .
All of us insist that other people have rules for their mind .
All true lovers of philosophy naturally strive for consistency and coherence in their thought .
It is in keeping with these common sense assertions , and the endlessly useful maxim , ‘ what a person really believes are what his actions show he believes , ’ that we offer the fundamentals of common sense philosophy .
It is both a philosophical method and the bare outline of a philosophy .
Furthermore we contend that virtually everyone lives by this philosophy , and thus unconsciously accepts it .
If you are deeply committed to , say , Buddhism , there is still great value in grasping the principles of common sense philosophy , if only to theoretically reject them .
For you will discover that you accept most of them in practice .
What ’s more , once you become consciously aware of them you will find that they keep on shedding light .

If you could prove your first statement , then it would no longer to be your first .
in other words
[ 219 ]
All argument begins with an assumption , or a set of assumptions ; that is , with something you do n’t dispute .
You can , of course , dispute the assumptions at the beginning of your argument , but in that case you are beginning a different argument with another set of assumptions at the beginning of it .
And so on ad infinitum .
in other words
[ 220 ]
Logic is always an ‘ if ... then ’ process which proceeds from the known to the unknown .
But if nothing is known at the beginning of the process , then nothing can ever be known .
You ca n’t use logic to generate knowledge from a state of total ignorance .
in other words
[ 221 ]
If nothing is self - evident , nothing can be proved .
There are some premises that ca n’t be reached as conclusions .

You can only find truth with logic if you have already found truth without it .
G. K. Chesterton

I wanted certainty in the kind of way in which people want religious faith .
I thought that certainty is more likely to be found in mathematics than elsewhere ... But after some twenty years of arduous toil , I came to the conclusion that there was nothing more that I could do in the way of making mathematical knowledge indubitable .
Bertrand Russell
________________________________________________________
[ 233 ]
The concept of certainty depends on the concept of truth .
The moment you doubt or deny the concept of truth , the word certainty ceases to have meaning .
Certainty and uncertainty imply truth because it ’s always the truth of something that you are certain or uncertain .
Therefore to say that one ca n’t be certain of any truth is a contradiction in terms .
in other words
[ 234 ]
It is not certain that everything is uncertain .
Pascal

It is brilliantly silly to ask whether anything can be known for certain .

Only a fool tries to demonstrate the obvious .
Working on the principle that a thing once seen is its own proof a wise man will try to find an image , or an analogy , or a parallel that will bring about that flash of illumination that the mind experiences when it apprehends truth .

One of the most disastrous consequences of rationalism is the vague feeling that you should n’t believe anything you ca n’t prove .

Faith declares what the senses do not see , but not the contrary of what they see .
Pascal
in other words
[ 271 ]
Reasonable faith does n’t mean believing in spite of the evidence or in the absence of evidence , it means believing on the basis of unseen and indirect evidence .
in fact

Faith is intense , usually confident , belief that is not based on evidence sufficient to command assent from every reasonable person .

As for future life , every man must judge for himself between conflicting vague possibilities .

G. K. Chesterton
C OMMON S ENSE ; Limitation ; Dogma
[ 316 ]
Common sense appeals to realities , truths or tendencies that we all know are real , but which ca n’t be demonstrated , and therefore have no place in argument except as postulates .
consequently
[ 317 ]
It ’s difficult to have a profitable discussion unless it ’s acknowledged that logic must be governed by common sense .
There ’s not much use counting the steps of the logic if every step takes us further away from common sense .
moreover
[ 318 ]
To be really reasonable we sometimes have to reject logic just as we sometimes have to reject common sense .
Truth always takes precedence over logic because logic is only one of a number of instruments for discovering truth .
There are times when truth will yield to intuition or common sense , but not to logic .
for example
[ 319 ]
Logically it ’s possible to argue that the difference between warming your hands by the fire and being roasted alive is only a matter of degree .
But common sense knows better .
for example
[ 320 ]
It ’s almost a paradox that Darwin ’s book is called The Origin of Species because , in fact , Darwin deconstructs species .
One of the things the book shows is that species disappear .
This common sense category disappears as some kind of ontologically special level of reality .
That is , there is no such thing as dog .
Dogs are part of a grade of environmental expressions of certain genetic properties ...
And so all creatures start to grade one into the other .
Species are simply snapshots of the world given to us by the fact of our mortality .

It ’s also the bedrock of authority , the thing that should support all other forms of authority .
P ARADOX ; Subjectivism
[ 410 ]
The sane person always cares more for truth than consistency .
If he sees two truths that seem to contradict each other , he accepts both truths and the contradiction along with them .
His intellectual sight is stereoscopic , like his physical sight : he sees two different pictures at once and yet sees all the better for that .
for example
[ 411 ]
What is mature love ?
It is union under the condition of preserving one ’s integrity , one ’s individuality ...
In love the paradox occurs that two beings become one and yet remain two .

[ 417 ]
There is nothing abnormal about paradox because being is paradoxical .
Paradox is inconsistency , explicit or implied .

No sceptic who believes that truth is subjective has any hesitation about treating it as objective .
No determinist who thinks his mind was made up for him by heredity and environment has any hesitation in making up his mind .
All sceptics without exception work on the principle that it is possible to accept in practice what it is not possible to believe in theory .
G. K. Chesterton
consequently
[ 440 ]
Most subjectivism is intellectually dishonest because it claims for itself a privilege which it denies to other viewpoints , namely the privilege of being inconsistent .
Either statements can be true or untrue , which implies some truth can be formulated in language , or truth and self - expression are one and the same , which implies all statements are equally valid .
It has to be one or the other .
Dishonest subjectivists insist on having it both ways .
They will attack things which are untrue or illogical when taking objectivity for granted , and then , when it suits them , defend anything they please , however untrue or illogical , by suddenly insisting on the subjectivity of all experience .
L ANGUAGE ; Analogy ; Fundamentalism
[ 458 ]
One ca n’t go on defining one ’s terms indefinitely .
in fact
[ 459 ]
The thing that ca n’t be defined is the first thing , the primary fact .
The word that has no definition is the word that has no substitute .
because
[ 460 ]
As nothing can be proved but by supposing something intuitively known , and evident without proof , so nothing can be defined but by the use of words too plain to admit a definition .
Samuel Johnson
for example
[ 461 ]
Good is incapable of any definition in the most important sense of that word .
G. E. Moore
consequently
[ 462 ]
All of us know the meanings of words we can’t adequately define .
for example
[ 463 ]
The son of a celebrity described his famous father as a " mean spirited , self - centred , jerk , " a view that finds considerable support in a recent biography of the man .
Note that the words , ‘ mean , ’ ‘ spirit , ’ ‘ self , ’ and ‘ jerk ’ are primary words that largely defy definition .
But even though the speaker could n’t adequately define his terms , it does n’t follow that he does n’t know what they mean , or should n’t use them with confidence .
________________________________________________________
[ 503 ]
Words point to realities which are far greater than the realities of words .
in fact
[ 504 ]
Reality is too complex and too subtle to be mirrored perfectly by language .
Yet reality is also less vague and more definite than language .
But because language is closer to us in the sense that it ’s the tool we use to explore reality , it ’s often language that seems more definite .
So when language fails to do justice to reality our attitude should be ‘ so much the worse for language . ’
Unfortunately it ’s often ‘ so much the worse for reality . ’
This oversight or turning from the world to clutch blindly at the word is the essence of fundamentalism .
in other words
[ 505 ] Fundamentalism means being fooled by language .
consequently
[ 506 ]
The first step in escaping fundamentalism is to distinguish between what a sentence says and what it means .
but
[ 507 ]
It would seem that nothing is more effectively hidden in the farthest recesses of obscurity than the obvious .

Tens of thousands of Israelis routinely holiday in the Sinai Israel has issued an " urgent " warning to its citizens to leave Sinai in Egypt amid fears of a terrorist plot .
The prime minister 's office said it had " concrete evidence " that terrorists were planning to attempt to kidnap Israelis in the peninsula .
Israel took the unusual step of calling on families of the Israelis who are visiting Sinai to contact them .
It fears that Palestinian militants will transfer hostages to Gaza through tunnels under the border .
Leave immediately and return home
Israeli anti-terror office
The warning by Israel 's security agencies came after a rumour that an Israeli had been kidnapped in Sinai .
The Israeli emergency service Zaka later said that rumour was untrue .
" According to concrete intelligence , we anticipate an immediate terror activity to kidnap an Israeli in Sinai , " Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's office said on Tuesday .
Tens of thousands of Israelis routinely take holidays in Sinai over the Passover holiday .
Most have returned after the week - long festival .
A few hundred were reported to have remained .
Egyptian police have been searching Sinai for any missing Israelis but found no evidence that anyone was missing .
Past attacks
In unusually strong wording , the Israeli anti-terror office called on " all Israelis residing in Sinai to leave immediately and return home " .
Families of Israelis in the peninsula were urged to contact them and update them on the travel warning .
Israel 's anti-terror office has a standing travel advisory telling Israelis to stay out of the Sinai desert because of the threat of terror attacks .
In 2004 , suicide bombers attacked Egypt's Taba Hilton Hotel , just across the Israeli border , and several campsites popular with Israelis .
Dozens of people were killed and hundreds wounded .
Israel controlled Sinai from its capture in the 1967 war until returning it to Egypt in 1982 .
The desert is just across the border , and its seaside resorts are popular with Israelis .
Sinai has been the scene of number of terrorist attacks , including bombings in the resort town of Sharm el - Sheikh in 2005 and Dahab in 2006 , which killed dozens .

The scientist at the centre of the storm over mistakes by the UN 's climate change panel has broken his silence on the affair to defend his report as " robust and rigorous " .
Martin Parry , a climate expert at the Grantham Institute and Centre for Environmental Policy at Imperial College , London , said he was " perplexed " at the way the media has focused on what he called minor points .
Parry was co-chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 's ( IPCC ) working group on impacts , which produced a 2007 report that included the false claim that Himalayan glaciers would melt by 2035 .
The discovery of the mistake , and the way it was handled , has produced calls for IPCC chairman Rajendra Pachauri to resign .
It has also led to reports of further errors in the report , including that the IPCC wrongly stated that 55 % of the Netherlands is below sea level .
In an open letter sent on Saturday to scientists that prepared the 2007 report from IPCC working group two ( WG2 ) , which has been the focus of criticism , Parry says : " What began with a single unfortunate error over Himalayan glaciers has become a clamour without substance . "
He adds : " It is easy to forget the big picture , which is that the WG2 volume represents a sound and reliable statement of our knowledge , and is the product of robust and rigorous assessment by you all . "
Parry said the IPCC had looked into the further alleged mistakes , and that they were " generally unfounded and also marginal to the assessment " .
On the Netherlands , he said there were several different figures that could be used , which vary on how the issue is defined .
The Dutch Ministry of Transport , he said , uses the figure 60 % , which counts land below high water level during storms , while others use 30 % , which is land below mean sea level .
Parry also defended IPCC statements on losses due to disasters , projected Amazon forest die - off , African agricultural decline and the use of observations made by climbers of high - altitude ice .
He said many of the criticisms were based on a mistaken belief that the IPCC could not use so - called grey literature – reports from outside academic journals such as from campaign groups and governments .
" Many such reports are intensively reviewed , both internally and externally .
Even if not peer - reviewed , there are reports that contain valuable information . "
He also defended the time taken by the IPCC to respond to each reported mistake : " Each of the queries raised has involved about a week of investigation and discussion by IPCC authors before a conclusion is published .
This is why many colleagues feel our critics are having a ' field day ' or ' dream run ' and the press are not reflecting a balanced picture .
But , is there any other way than for us to take our time and conduct a careful investigation of each query ?
We have to trust that in the long run common sense will prevail . "
Cuccinelli -- a far - right , gay - bashing Virginia politician -- is now our Attorney General and as such is empowered to issue legal advice and has the authority to follow up his advice with legal action against anyone who does not follow it .
He has now declared that , because the state has no law preventing discrimination based on sexual orientation , state colleges and universities can no longer include discrimination based on sexual orientation as one of the practices they ban on their campuses .
Of course , as far as the Old Redneck knows , there is no state law against cheating on final exams , so , . . .

Virginia attorney general to colleges : End gay protections By Rosalind S. Helderman
Washington Post Staff Writer
Saturday , March 6 , 2010 ; A01 ICHMOND -- Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli
II has urged the state 's public colleges and universities to rescind policies that ban discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation , arguing in a letter sent to each school that their boards of visitors had no legal authority to adopt such statements .
In his most aggressive initiative on conservative social issues since taking office in January , Cuccinelli ( R ) wrote in the letter sent Thursday that only the General Assembly can extend legal protections to gay state employees , students and others -- a move the legislature has repeatedly declined to take as recently as this week .
Reaction from colleges and universities is muted -- so far .
Cuccinelli's move has dismayed students and faculty members .
It suggests that Cuccinelli intends to take a harder line with the state 's university system , where liberal academics have long coexisted uneasily with state leaders in Richmond .
" It is my advice that the law and public policy of the Commonwealth of Virginia prohibit a college or university from including ' sexual orientation , ' ' gender identity , ' ' gender expression , ' or like classification as a protected class within its non-discrimination policy absent specific authorization from the General Assembly , " he wrote in the letter .
Colleges that have included such language in policies that govern university hiring and admissions -- which include all of Virginia 's largest schools -- have done so " without proper authority " and should " take appropriate actions to bring their policies in conformance with the law and public policy of Virginia , " Cuccinelli wrote .
Official representatives of several universities , including the University of Virginia , Virginia Tech , the College of William and Mary and George Mason University , reacted cautiously to the letter , declining to comment and indicating that their governing boards would examine the issue .
As you would expect , Republicans in Virginia just love Cuccinelli 's attack on the colleges .
Former attorney general Jerry Kilgore ( R ) agreed it would be difficult for Cuccinelli to enforce his opinion without pursuing court action .
But he said college visitors swear an oath to abide by state statute .
" Board members are required to follow the law , " Kilgore said .
" And he 's telling them what the law is . "
Cuccinelli's predecessor , Robert F. McDonnell ( R ) , who became governor in January , also held that only the General Assembly could name new classes for legal protections .
But he never specifically targeted university policies that seemingly contradicted his position .
And in a 2006 letter to Longwood University , his office declined to conclusively tell the Farmville school that it could not include sexual orientation in its policy .
Meanwhile , on several other fronts , AG Cuccinelli -- backed , I 'm certain , by the governor -- a graduate of Pat Robertson University -- has no plans to limit his march backward to gay rights only .
The former Fairfax County senator has signaled that he will be an activist attorney general .
This month , he sued the federal Environmental Protection Agency , challenging its ruling that greenhouse gases pose a public health risk by contributing to global warming .
He also advised McDonnell to halt a process begun by former governor Timothy M. Kaine ( D ) in December that could have resulted in Virginia allowing health benefits for the partners of gay state employees , including at colleges and universities .
" I do n't think it 's going to surprise anyone that Attorney General Cuccinelli is not going to be a quiet attorney general , " said Christopher Freund , a spokesman for the Family Foundation , which has long contended that legal protections based on sexual orientation are unnecessary .
Freund applauded Cuccinelli for the consistency of his advice .
One wonders :
Why do rightwing Republican men spend so much time thinking about other men's dicks and what they do with them ????
What 's next in Virginia : College admissions open only to straight white men who carry concealed weapons ?
Only slave owners will be allowed to vote ?
African - Americans will count as 3/5 of a person in the census ?
Do n't laugh , folks -- we tried to warn Virginians where the McDonnell - Cuccinelli - Pat Robertson administration would take us and now we are headed down that road .

At first glance it looks like an airliner livery designed by teenagers .
Or a Ryanair clone done with a sense of humour .
But check out the web pages of Kulula Air , a South African low cost carrier , and learn that air travel over there IS different .
Kulula allows passengers to check bows and arrows , sporting guns , surfboards , snowboards plus boots and even gives a free extra 10 kilogram allowance for one golf bag per customer , above the 20 kg limit included in the fare .
And you can take your mountain bike with you too , provided you disassemble and pack it according to Kulula ’s published procedure , and check it in at least 90 minutes before departure .
Kulula has a pretty laid back customer culture .
The rules for expectant mothers are found under Pregnant Fairies , and as for refunds , it says
No turning back , once your booking is confirmed , no refunds ( sorree ) .
More special liveries are promised , including one called ‘ camo ’ .
Maybe it ’s a good idea not to fly that one when they first land it at Harare or Lusaka in their own metal instead of as code shares .

An envoy from Qatar who authorities said grabbed a surreptitious smoke in a jetliner 's bathroom and then joked about lighting his shoe on fire , sparking a bomb scare and the scrambling of military jets , has been released from custody .
LANDING ELSEWHERE LANDING ELSEWHERE WASHINGTON
( AP ) 
A Qatari diplomat was on his way to an official visit with an imprisoned al - Qaeda sleeper agent when he touched off a bomb scare by slipping into an airline bathroom for a smoke , officials said Thursday as the diplomat prepared to leave the U.S.
The diplomat , Mohammed Al - Madadi was going to meet Ali Al - Marri in prison , according to a State Department official and another person close to the matter .
Al - Marri , a citizen of Qatar , is serving eight years in prison after pleading guilty last year to conspiring to support terrorism .
Al - Marri was arrested after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , accused of being a sleeper agent researching poisonous gasses and plotting a cyberattack .
DIVERTED FLIGHTS : Security alerts push more flights off course in 2010 Consular officials frequently visit foreigners held in the United States to make sure they are being treated well .
The purpose of his visit raises further questions about Al - Madadi 's behavior , such as why someone familiar with terrorism cases would apparently flaunt airline security rules .
Law enforcement officials said Al - Madadi later joked that he had been trying to light his shoe — an apparent reference to the 2001 so - called shoe bomber , Richard Reid .
The people who discussed the case did so on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter .
No explosives were found on the plane and authorities said they do n't think Al - Madadi was trying to hurt anyone during Wednesday 's scare .
He enjoys diplomatic immunity from U.S. prosecution and will not be criminally charged , authorities said .
The State Department official said Qatar had not yet informed the administration how it will handle the case but has assured the U.S. that Al - Madadi will leave the country .
U.S. officials expect that to happen later Thursday or Friday .
" We fully expect this will be resolved very quickly , " State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley told reporters .
Crowley said the U.S. government is satisfied that the Qatari government is taking the matter seriously .
Wednesday 's scare came three months after the attempted terror attack on Christmas when a Nigerian man allegedly tried to blow up a Detroit - bound airliner .
Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab went to the bathroom just before he allegedly tried to ignite a bomb in his seat .
Since then , law enforcement , flight crews and passengers have been on high alert for suspicious activity on airplanes .
That scare exposed major holes in the country 's national security and prompted immediate changes in terror - screening policies .
Some air travelers at Denver International Airport Thursday were amazed that Al - Madadi would not be charged with anything .
" I think it 's wrong .
I 'd get busted .
I do n't think that ( immunity ) should be a factor , " said one of them , Hank DePetro , a retired psychologist from Greeley , Colo .
Under international protocol — the 1961 Vienna Conventions on Diplomatic Relations — diplomats in foreign countries enjoy broad immunity from prosecution .
That immunity can only be waived by a diplomat 's home government , something that is rarely requested and even more rarely granted .
But even without charges being pressed against him and without such a waiver , the U.S. could have moved to declare Al - Madadi " persona non grata " and expel him from the country .
However , officials said they would not pursue this , given the close nature of U.S. - Qatari ties and the importance the country plays in the Middle East .
Qatar , about the size of Connecticut and Rhode Island combined and with a population of about 1.4 million people , is an oil - rich Middle East nation and key U.S. ally .
It is situated on the Arabian peninsula , surrounded on three sides by the Persian Gulf and to the south by Saudi Arabia .
The country hosts the forward headquarters of the U.S. Central Command , which runs the wars in both Afghanistan and Iraq , and is a major supporter of operations deemed critical to both campaigns .
Qatar 's ambassador to the United States , Ali Bin Fahad Al - Hajri , cautioned against a rush to judgment .
" This diplomat was traveling to Denver on official embassy business on my instructions , and he was certainly not engaged in any threatening activity , " he said in a statement .
" The facts will reveal that this was a mistake . "
Al - Madadi is the embassy 's third secretary , a relatively junior position , although diplomatic assignments in Washington are considered plum posts in most countries ' diplomatic corps .
An online biography on the business networking site Linked In shows that a Mohammed Al - Madadi has been in Washington since at least 2007 , when he began studying at George Washington University 's business school .
The job title listed on the site is database administrator at Qatar 's Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
The Boeing 757 was carrying 157 passengers and six crewmembers , United Airlines spokesman Michael Trevino said .
It left Reagan National Airport at 5:19 p.m. ET and landed at Denver International Airport at 7 p.m. MT. Copyright 2010 The Associated Press .

Elon Musk , the uniquely named CEO of Tesla Motors , took the time to reassure investors and potential customers last Thursday that Tesla is working on more than just the Model S that is due to hit the road in 2012 .
With the current model , the Tesla Roadster due to cease production in 2012 , many have wondered whether the team at Tesla had anything else up their sleeves , Musk put this speculation to rest by explaining that they are working on a crossover vehicle and a number of other models that will roll out between one and three years after the introduction of the Model S .
Many have been hoping to hear news like this ever since clapping eyes on the $ 50,000 Model S , a shorter wheelbase version of the Model S with more focus on performance would be an astonishingly tempting motorcar .
The kind of car you sell your house for .
I ’m not saying this is what they are working on , but hey , they are going to need to replace the hole left in their line up by the departure of the Roadster with something , so why not a convertible 2 door Model S ?
The crossover vehicle that Musk mentioned is interesting , anyone who knows anything about America knows that Americans love big SUV’s .
A lot .
So a 100 % electric suv built by Tesla would be a popular car almost without question , especially in states like California .
A lot of observers have pointed out that introducing a number of new models in such a relatively short time frame is a significant feat , and questioned whether the team at Tesla is up to the task .
I think it ’s important to remember that Tesla is the electric car company that is actually selling electric cars ( not just talking about it ) , over a thousand of them at last count have been sold in over 25 countries .
Tesla
Motors do have what it takes to get cars from the concept stage to the showroom floor , whether they can produce and sell multiple models will be a step up from where they are now but it is a significantly smaller step than going from concept to final product .
Tesla is also being relied upon by automotive industry greats like Daimler AG ( NYSE : DAI – who currently own an 8 % stake in the company ) to provide battery systems and electric drive expertise for the upcoming electric version of the Smart Car and the Mercedes A - Class both due in Europe later this year .

The rule prohibits marriage for girls under 17 and boys under 18 .
In the country the magnitude of " child brides " , girls of 8 or 9 given in marriage , usually for economic reasons , to old men .
Sanaa ( AsiaNews ) - Strictly covered by black niqabs , thousands of Yemeni women protested ( pictured ) against the law setting the minimum age for marriage : 17 years for women and 18 for men .
The women held banners with slogans such as " Do not prohibit what God has made possible . "
One of them , commenting on the support for the law by groups of human rights , said : " Many women who are part of these groups are 40 and are not married "
In the country the tradition of " child brides " children of 8 or 9 given in marriage to much older men is widespread , especially in rural areas .
The reasons are often economic ones .
The tradition came to the attention of international public opinion for a few sensational cases , particularly those of a girl of 12 who died in childbirth with her son and another of 8 who requested and obtained a divorce .

WHAT WE
LOVE ABOUT IT :
The Google - ­developed Android OS has a plethora of apps ( free auto navigation ! ) that are absent on the iPhone .
Android is available on many different phones , and on all major carriers .
Its unrivaled business acumen extends from solid e-mail and messaging services to its appearance on phones with famously thumb - friendly keyboards .
Unparalleled usability and as intuitive as they come .
The Apple App Store defined the field and still has the most ( and the best ) apps — particularly when it comes to games .
Extremely fast and easy to use , with topnotch multitasking .
Phone - wide " universal search " makes it very easy to find files and contacts across programs .
The platform is powerful and filled with features — as long as you can navigate its archaic interface .
A ray of light :
The upcoming Windows Phone 7 ( due in late 2010 ) should improve the experience .
DRAWBACKS :
Its app store is still a distant second to the iPhone 's — particularly when it comes to games .
The multitude of Android phones means some of them could have issues supporting some apps .
The OS feels a bit dated next to the ﬂashier competition .
Its app store can't compete with the iPhone's .
The platform is notoriously closed — Apple restricts what sort of apps developers can create for it .
Minor differences aside , there is really only one phone to choose from .
No multitasking .
Its app selection is very thin , as is the roster of webOS phones .
Palm 's uncertain financial future means there 's a real risk that webOS will be a short - lived platform .
Notoriously sluggish and the most difficult OS to use .
Finding simple functions on the frustrating interface can involve digging through multiple menus .
BOTTOM
LINE :
If you 're reluctant to buy into Apple 's ecosystem or AT&T 's over - stretched network , Android is a strong alternative .
A great choice for the business class and heavy e-mailers , but it falls a bit short in the fun department .
The gold standard when it comes to usability and app selection .
But if you want to play , you have to play by Apple 's rules .
In terms of sheer usability , webOS rocks .
But without many apps , there 's little that allows it to shine in a crowded field .
Our advice : Wait for Windows Phone 7 — a promising update that should act as a much - needed reboot for the OS .

the most wonderful , sarcastic , brilliant person to ever grace this earth .
likes to bake brioche and listen to spiritualized at the same time .
dislikes shitty bands .
Instead of being set in a fictitious world like most Japanese RPGs , Glory of Heracles is set right here on Earth in ancient Greece .
This means you will be knee deep in Greek Mythology faster than you can say , “ This is Sparta ! ”
Normally there would be nothing wrong that , but almost everything about this game makes it incredibly mediocre instead of the epic mythic tale it should be .
One would think that Glory of Heracles would borrow and expand on an already existing story from Greek mythology .
Instead the story is brand new and it starts you off playing as Heracles , or at least an immortal man who thinks he is Heracles .
Along with the other members of his party , including another immortal who thinks he is Heracles , he loses his memory and is on a quest to Mount Olympus to find out who he is .
This plot is quite boring and I was constantly disappointed when finding out that everybody ’s reason for visiting Mt. Olympus is the same memory loss ordeal instead of something unique that would set the characters apart .
There are two things that make the story uninteresting from the very beginning .
The first thing is the cast of characters .
Every one of your party members is a stock character seemingly pulled from the book of RPG archetypes .
Whether the character is a cocky ladies man , or a witch child who happens to be really powerful , they all seem to be very run of the mill and unoriginal .
They have some funny lines from time to time , but that ’s about it .
The second thing is the constant setbacks .
To lengthen the story , the party encounters many setbacks on their way to Mt. Olympus and this happens so often that you will probably lose what motivation you had to get to Olympus in the first place .
As far as the graphics go , there is good news and bad news .
The good news is the animation for all of the character and monster sprites are fluid and detailed .
Instead of just walking around with the intensity of a wooden board , you can see the character ’s entire body in movement when they walk and the battle movements are just as good when the characters perform their special attacks .
The bad news is the characters and environments themselves look sub par .
The cel - shaded style looks okay for larger enemies , but it is sometimes difficult to tell what smaller characters and enemies look like .
As far as the environments go , almost every town looks exactly the same , and the dungeons are always a straight shot from beginning to end , which is disappointing considering the architecture of the setting .
The audio was enjoyable at some points , but overall it was nothing special .
There is a sweeping over world theme , mildly intense battle themes and a calming town theme among others present in the soundtrack .
The music was enjoyable enough , but you definitely do n’t need your headphones for this game .
The sound effects are standard battle sounds like sword slashes and explosions , and there is no voice acting to speak of .
Glory of Heracles follows in the traditional Japanese RPG ’s footsteps down to the letter .
The progression of most of the game follows the “ town –> dungeon –> town ” formula and it rarely strays from that path .
The combat is turn based , which can be pretty fun at times , and there is little to speak of in terms of side quests .
Throughout most of the game you will be traveling from one town , to a dungeon , to another town and so on .
This gets old fast since all of the towns look the same and the dungeons are all bland and lifeless .
You can save at almost any time , but there are some points where you cannot and these moments are usually tedious .
For example , at one point I had to fight four bosses in a row using only two of my characters .
These situations are never very difficult , but the thought of having to start that all over always gnawed at the back of my mind .
One aspect of this game I have to give props to is the combat system .
It is turn - based , but with a twist .
There is your usual fare like HP , MP , magic and special attacks , but there is also a new element called ether , which dictates the spells you can cast .
There are different types of ether on the battlefield for each element and if there is not enough ether to cast a spell , your character takes residual damage .
There is usually more than enough ether on the field in regular battles , but in some of the longer boss battles you might be forced to switch up your strategy from hammering the enemy with magic to using some of your other special moves .
To get ether back you can either wait until the end of the turn , or you can “ overkill ” enemies , which you do by attacking them for a set amount of damage after they get knocked out .
If you do n’t overkill them , they usually disappear at the end of the turn .
There are also different mini games you can play during battle to power up your magic and special attacks .
At first I thought this was going to be another case of “ forced stylus use , ” but they actually work out well and never feel like they ’re breaking up the pace of the battle .
Also , these games are just about the only parts where you are required to use the stylus , which is a plus , and you have the option to skip them if you know the attack is already going to kill the enemy .
Unfortunately this semi-innovative battle system is played to death .
Throughout the majority of the game you will be running into random encounters and the encounter rate is set pretty high .
The battles are never too hard , but getting into a new battle every few steps bogs the game down and makes the dungeon crawling aspect of the game slow and monotonous .
If this is n’t bad enough , you start encountering other immortal enemies a couple hours in that can only be defeated by dealing enough damage to get overkill .
If you do n’t , they just pop right back up at the end of the turn making the battles even longer .
Whenever you ’re not fighting enemies in dungeons or elsewhere , you are in towns upgrading your equipment .
There are a lot of weapons and armor pieces to choose from and you can equip your characters with different combinations to enhance specific abilities .
However , this usually is n’t necessary and most of the time you can get away with just equipping the strongest weapons and armor to each of your characters .
In addition to buying your equipment , you can find it in dungeons and forge it from materials obtained from enemy battles .
The equipment you find in dungeons will usually be rusty and you will have to go to a polisher to find out what they are .
You can also add abilities to equipment to help you in battle , which has the potential to be very useful .
For example , the ability “ Dispatch ” randomly lets a character attack an enemy that is almost dead even when it is not their turn .
Overall the equipment system can be fairly in depth , but you are never forced to take it to that level .
Glory of Heracles had the potential to be an epic title , but it fell into the depths of mediocrity .
The game is not bad by any means , but the less than inspirational story , bland graphics and tedious fighting make it far from being noteworthy .
The battle system and the detail of equipment management are definitely high points in this game , but since the story is told in an incredibly linear fashion and players are constantly bogged down by too many random encounters , most will probably be tired of it before the half - way point .

Many scientists want to keep their data and resources free ; cybersecurity specialists want them under lock and key .
Jeffrey Perkel reports .
In 2002 , bioinformatician Mark Gerstein and his colleagues set up a server to host some commonly used genomics databases .
Operating within this was a free software application called Snort , which actively monitors anomalies in web traffic , surreptitious scans and server nudges that might be attempts to compromise a system 's integrity .
Then the researchers watched and waited .
Seven months later , the picture that emerged was one of a network under siege .
" If you put up a server , it just continuously gets barraged , " says Gerstein of Yale University in New Haven , Connecticut .
Most days , the server was hit ten times or fewer , but on occasion the hit count spiked into the thousands1 .
Not all of those hits were attacks , Gerstein notes , but many were .
On two high - hit days , for example , more than 90 % of events attempted to induce a ' buffer overflow ' , whereby superfluous amounts of data are written into a system 's memory in an attempt to make it fail , opening it up to exploitation .
In the face of such a relentless onslaught , most ventures onto the World Wide Web should be taken with caution .
Having a graduate student with little experience set up a website could be disastrous , Gerstein says .
Entering either through poorly written code or open ports — digital entry points into computer hardware and operating systems — hackers could deface the content on the site or , worse , install malicious software on the machine running it .
Attacks can run the gamut from the installation of programs intended to co-opt system resources to keystroke loggers and scanning software designed to purloin user information and passwords .
Some hackers target university systems to steal computing resources or even intellectual property — proprietary compounds , instrument designs , patient data and personal communications .
Hacking is suspected in the November 2009 release of e-mails from the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia , UK , which resulted in a global crisis of confidence in climate science .
" There is no sector that has been able to withstand this onslaught of intrusions , " warns Steven Chabinsky , deputy assistant director in the cyber division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) in Washington DC .
Protecting research data presents particular challenges .
Most information - technology ( IT ) professionals suggest ensuring that large or sensitive data stores are managed by a centralized IT team that can monitor and administer systems , keeping a close watch over traffic and limiting access .
But this can conflict with the ethos of researchers who need such systems to be accessed by a wide variety of students , postdocs and collaborators .
" Universities tend to be fairly open kinds of environments , " says John McCanny , lead scientist at the Centre for Secure Information Technologies at Queen 's University Belfast , UK .
And some researchers bristle at the idea of losing control .
" I 'd rather be insecure and free , " says Phillip Zamore , a biologist at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester .
Drive - by hacking
It is a rough world in which to take such a stance .
Michael Corn , chief privacy and security officer at the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign , estimates that each day his university 's firewalls block some two million to three million scans — essentially Internet drive - bys looking for open communications ports .
A " significant percentage " of these , he says , are likely to stem from " professionals in the employ of organized crime or possibly state actors " .
The network at the San Diego Supercomputer Center of the University of California , San Diego , logged an average of 27,000 intrusion attempts per day during the first three months of 2010 , according to Dallas Thornton , division director of the university 's cyberinfrastructure services .
Thornton says that this number actually underestimates the problem , because many common attacks are simply ignored .
“ Researchers are the best in the world at basically ignoring the administration . ”
Successful intrusions are rarer .
Until recently , the Educational Security Incidents website ( http://www.adamdodge.com/esi) reported breaches in cybersecurity for higher education , recording nearly 500 incidents of data theft , loss or exposure between July 2005 and December 2009 .
Most of these occurred in the United States ; just 10 occurred in the United Kingdom , 11 in Canada and 8 in Japan .
But that may be just the tip of the iceberg ; most incidents go unreported , says Chabinsky .
McCanny reports that cybercrime 's growth in the United Kingdom has greatly outpaced expectation .
" The train is coming down the track much faster than most people would have anticipated even 15 months ago , " he says .
EDUCAUSE , a non-profit organization of higher - education IT professionals , undertakes annual surveys of academic chief information officers .
The 2009 survey ranked security third overall among IT problems facing higher - education institutions today2 .
Security officers in such institutions face two crucial problems .
One is funding , which ranked first in the survey .
The chemistry department at the University of Wisconsin - Madison , for instance , has one IT person overseeing 1,300 computers used by 500 staff and several thousand students .
In such a climate , says departmental chairman Robert Hamers , " it 's just very limiting in terms of what you can actually expect one person to do " .
Last year , Hamers ' department suffered a breach .
In the absence of a firewall ( now installed ) , foreign hackers infiltrated 40 computers , installing software that turned those systems into file - sharing servers for copyrighted music , movies and television programmes .
The other problem , says Alan Paller , director of research at the cybersecurity - focused SANS Institute in Bethesda , Maryland , is researcher independence .
Academic researchers need to be able to install software on demand , to collaborate with colleagues , to develop new tools for public or private consumption , and to cater for an ever - changing and heterogeneous user base .
Besides that , " researchers are the best in the world at basically ignoring the administration " , says Paller .
In 2006 , a researcher at Georgetown University in Washington DC independently decided to migrate a server handling confidential patient data from an IT - monitored UNIX system to an unmonitored Windows one .
The server was hacked , and the names , birth dates and social - security numbers of some 41,000 individuals may have been accessed .
The university was legally obliged to notify each of them .
Such incidents , says Brian Voss , chief information officer at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge , mostly occur when researchers strike out on their own .
" It 's like herding cats , " he says .
" The challenge is , how do you get them all under the umbrella ? "
Generally , universities do that by promoting the benefits of their centralized services .
Many academic institutions offer a battery of common but effective defences — everything from pushing operating system and antivirus patches out to users , to remotely monitoring network traffic , to the establishment of secure virtual private networks for encrypted communication and virtual machines .
Virtual machines are hardware surrogates : although users can interface as if they are working on physical computers or web servers , they 're actually just working through windows running on a centralized host computer .
Gerstein says that most of his lab is set up on a framework of virtual machines .
This allows him and his colleagues to maintain back - ups for all the resources they put up on the web .
" If something gets hacked into , we are not as worried any more , " he says , " because we can roll back really easily and then put the thing back up . "
“ The best way to secure a computer is to remove the keyboard , then the human cannot make a mistake . ”
The American University in Washington DC also offers virtual - machine services to its faculty members , says chief information officer David Swartz , who ( with Voss ) co-chairs the EDUCAUSE Higher Education Information Security Council .
" If they need a server I say , ' Come to me , I 'll set you up ' , " Swartz says .
The resulting sites are professionally secured , continuously monitored , and easily backed up and restored .
And in the event of a breach , that intrusion is often effectively contained by virtue of the virtual machines ' isolated architecture .
Cybercrime is evolving rapidly .
At the University of Nevada in Las Vegas , Lori Temple , vice - provost for information technology , says she is seeing increased intrusion through social - networking sites .
Facebook games and images , for example , are particularly problematic , she says .
" As much as you try to be ahead , you are almost always one step behind . "
How much individual researchers need to worry depends on their own cost–benefit analysis , says Chabinsky — a reflection of the value of the data 's confidentiality and integrity both to the researcher and his or her competitors .
Many will calculate that they have little cause for concern , save the loss or corruption of their own data , which can be mitigated by routine back - ups .
But for those who must store personal , confidential or economically valuable information , he says , " they should ask some strong questions of their system security providers " .
They should enquire , for example , about the confidence they have in the systems in place and what additional measures they can take to mitigate risks .
This is especially important as US federal granting agencies are beginning to require certification that sensitive information such as health records will be secured in compliance with the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 .
" An incident at the university could cause more than public embarrassment or a lawsuit , " says Swartz , " it might actually cause the loss of federal grants . "

Ultimately , preemptive training might be the most cost - effective weapon IT departments have .
Knowledge , after all , is power ( see ' Ten tips for cybersecure science ' ) .
Especially given that no amount of infrastructure can overcome user carelessness .
In 2007 , the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign suffered a breach in which a spreadsheet containing the personal information of 5,247 students was accidentally e-mailed to 700 unauthorized individuals .
As Marty Lindner , a principal engineer in the computer emergency response team ( CERT ) at the Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute programme in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , says : " The best way to secure a computer is to remove the keyboard , because then the human cannot make a mistake .

CERTAIN parts of the brain - which control scepticism and vigilance - appear to deactivate in some people when they 're in the presence of a speaker who they believe has divine healing powers , scientists in Denmark have found .
Researchers recruited 36 male and female participants ; about half were devout Christians from the Pentecostal church , while the other half were non-religious .
The participants who considered themselves religious believed that some people could possess divine powers of healing .
The non-religious participants did not believe this .
Each person listened to 18 different prayers performed by three different people - a Christian , a non-Christian and a Christian known for their '' healing ' ' powers - while undergoing a brain scan .
( In reality , all three speakers were '' ordinary ' ' Christians , with no reported healing powers . )
After the scan , participants were asked to rate each speaker 's charisma .
The devout Christians in the study rated the speaker presented as a divine healer as the most charismatic , while they voted the non-Christian speaker as the least charismatic .

According to a recent study by Justin J. Gunnell ’05 law ’08 and Prof. Stephen J. Ceci , human ecology and the Helen L. Carr Professor of Developmental Psychology , more attractive defendants in court are less likely to be found guilty than less attractive ones .
If there are damages , then more attractive people tend to receive higher rewards and in criminal cases , better - looking defendants receive lower sentences .
This phenomenon has been proven by more than 30 studies conducted over the past 60 to 70 years , according to Gunnell .
“ We [ already ] knew about this phenomenon , so our question was : is there a specific type of person who ’s more likely to do this ? ”
Gunnell said .
In their report –– which will be published in the academic journal Behavioral Sciences & the Law and is titled “ When Emotionality Trumps Reason ” –– Gunnell and Ceci studied how individual information processing styles affect juror decisions .
“ Information processing can proceed through two pathways , a rational one and an experiential one .
The former is characterized by an emphasis on analysis , fact and logical argument , whereas the latter is characterized by emotional and personal experience , ” the study said .
“ Our hypothesis was that if we identify the two groups , then the experiential people are more likely to focus on extralegal factors , which should n’t have any bearing on the legal process , ” Gunnell said .
“ Attractiveness was the variable we used . ” Every participant was given a survey to determine the degree to which they processed information in a rational or experiential manner .
They were then given a case study , where they were exposed to four photographs of the defendant and his or her general profile .
Participants were later asked to listen to the cases ’ closing arguments .
Afterward , the participants were asked whether they would find the defendant guilty and , if so , what sentence they would recommend .
The study confirmed what it referred to as an “ unattractive harshness effect . ”
In terms of sentencing , jurors that processed information in more of an “ experiential ” manner gave an average of 22 months more jailtime for those that they deemed unattractive .
Those same jurors found less good - looking defendants guilty 22 percent more of the time than good - looking ones .
“ The interesting thing was the degree of influence of one system [ of thought processing ] over the other , ” Gunnell said .
“ One can overtake the other .
For example , you ca n’t approach a math problem emotionally .
It ’s context dependent .
” Gunnell began the study in 2005 as an undergraduate on the Cornell in Washington program .
It was done completely online and all of the participants were fellow undergraduates , the majority of whom were psychology majors .
“ I ’ve been working on it for a long time since the statistics were pretty complex , ” Gunnell said .
“ It was actually my senior thesis . ”

How did the music business end up with a triumph with the new Digital Economy Act ?
How did photographers , whose resources were one laptop and some old fashioned persuasion , carry an unlikely and famous victory ?
How did the digital rights campaigners fail so badly ?
Back in January , a senior music business figure explained to me that Clause 17 , which gave open - ended powers to the Secretary of State , was unlikely to survive the wash - up .
But he did n't much care ; the other sections which compelled the ISPs to take action against infringers were good enough .
Anything else was a bonus - possibly even a distraction .
Yet to the amazement of the music business , web blocking is now legislation .
I think this is a watershed in internet campaigning .
It 's not just a tactical defeat , it 's a full - on charge of the light brigade , and the biggest defeat for internet freedom in the UK since it opened for business .
I 've spent time talking to legislators and protagonists , and concluded that it was avoidable .
Much of the argument was already lost when the Bill was introduced last November , admittedly , but campaigners ' tactics made a bad situation worse .
This explodes the idea - sometimes called the ' Overton Window ' in the jargon - that by adopting an extreme position , you pull the centre ground your way .
The digital rights campaigners forced waverers into the music business camp , and hardened their support for tougher measures against file sharers .
In the end , the BPI wiped the floor with the Open Rights Group .
Let 's compare the digital rights failure with the amazing success of the Stop43 campaign - what resources did each have to hand ?
The Open Rights Group had 4.5 full time staff , the industrial might of the ISPs , a major quango backing them up in the shape of Consumer Focus , and a sympathetic media happy to let false statements ( eg , " disconnections " ) go unchallenged .
And it enlisted the support of 38 Degrees .
By contrast , Paul Ellis from the photographers ' Stop43 campaign tells me his resources were :
A standard hosting account , provided by EPUK
My MacBook Pro with a copy of RapidWeaver
Nearly a month 's unpaid full - time voluntary work from a handful of people - it's back to paying the bills , now
The generosity of those photographers and retouchers who made their copyright work and skills available to us to produce the " virals "
The pent - up energy and frustration of thousands of photographers who previously had lacked a specific focus - Stop43 gave them the arguments to use and the tools with which to use them
Clearly the failure has something to do with the contents of the digital rights message as well as the tactics .
I 've tried to highlight a few issues below .
1. Failure to build common alliances
Successful political operators find a division in the enemy and exploit it .
It 's clear that there were subtle but important differences between the BPI and UK Music , the umbrella organisation that includes the BPI .
That reflects historical antagonisms : publishers versus record labels , majors versus indies - this is a business that has traditionally been at war with itself .
In addition , many producers accept its position is its own fault : the business failed to innovate new ideas that take advantage of the technology .
See Martin Mills summary here : Luddite and paranoid - why the big record labels failed at digital .
The ORG failed to see this , let alone use it to advantage .
Several parts of the music business were looking for common ground , most specifically the Featured Artists Coalition , which was expected to come out against the technical countermeasures .
But they were spurned .
To the campaigners , everyone was equally evil .
If they were dealing with the music business , they were supping with the Devil .
Safest not try , then .
2. Failure to play the Trump Card
The strongest argument against the file sharing legislation is that it is n't needed - or at least not yet .
Market failure is usually the reason for regulatory intervention : the market should be given a go first .
The activists could have argued that if the music business is n't even prepared to offer services such as legal P2P , it 's simply being incompetent or lazy ( or both ) , and can't reasonably claim it 's tried everything it could .
File sharing remains " illegal " because the suppliers refuse to give licenses .
Incredibly , campaigners never made this case .
It would have required activists to be pro-business , even pro-copyright , and demand ' where 's our legal P2P ' ?
That 's certainly something most supporters would prefer to technical counter - measures and tribunals .
But it was n't something the leadership were prepared to argue - even as a means to an end .
Australia 's biggest tobacco companies say the Government 's decision to introduce plain packaging for cigarettes will only provide a boost for the black market trade .
But anti-smoking groups and health advocates have backed the move , calling it a groundbreaking policy .
In a statement , British American Tobacco Australia says it opposes the plan and is surprised the announcement has been made while a Senate inquiry into the issue is underway .
It says the move could bolster the black market tobacco industry , leading to lost tax revenue and more underage smoking .
Imperial Tobacco Australia spokeswoman Cathie Keogh says her company is now looking at its legal options .
" Introducing plain packaging just takes away the ability of a consumer to identify our brand from another brand and that 's of value to us , " she said .
" It really affects the value of our business as a commercial enterprise and we will fight to support protecting our international property rights . "
She warns the move may actually be to the detriment of public health .
" If the tobacco products are available in the same easy - to - copy plain packaging , it makes it much easier for counterfeiters to increase the volume of illicit trade in Australia , which is currently reported at about 12 per cent of the market , " she said .
" That illicit product wo n't have or may not have the health warnings on it .
It wo n't be subject to ingredients reporting . "
Australia would be the first country in the world to force cigarette companies to use plain packaging .
From 2012 , the companies will only be allowed to print their brand name in a standard style and there will still be graphic health warnings on the packaging .
The Government is also expected to announce a hike in the cigarette tax .
Health Minister Nicola Roxon says the legislation will be carefully drafted to hold up against any legal challenge .
" We have firm advice that this action can be taken , " she said .
" Tobacco companies will hate the decision , but it will help people stop smoking . "
" We believe this decision should have been taken a decade ago .
The last government squibbed that decision but this government wo n't . "
The Federal Opposition 's Health spokesman , Peter Dutton , will not yet say if the Coalition will support the Government 's plan .
Mr Dutton has attacked the timing of the announcement , calling Mr Rudd a " tricky politician " .
" The Government 's been sitting on this recommendation for 10 months and they release it today at a time when they need a mass distraction away from the policy disasters of the ETS [ emissions trading scheme ] and the insulation debacle and the school halls program , " he said .
" And also , strangely enough , on a Newspoll weekend as well .
This is Rudd Government spin at its best . "
Anti-smoking groups thrilled
The chairman of the National Preventative Health Taskforce , Rob Moodie , says he is pleased the Government has accepted the group 's recommendation .
He says plain packaging can reduce smoking to low levels with the help of other measures .
" It 's part of a comprehensive package , " Mr Moodie said .
" It has to be also included with good social marketing , restrictions on exposure to second - hand smoke , to taxation and pricing increases , but certainly the studies that have already been done show that people do respond to them . "
He has also welcomed the Government 's target of cutting smoking to 10 per cent or less of the population .
" If we can get to below 10 per cent - a million fewer smokers by 2020 - that would be a marvellous result , " he said .
" Now that we 're seeing such clogging up of our hospital systems with huge demand - a lot of it's resulting from smoking - this would in a sense help our health system all over . "
Public health expert Professor Simon Chapman says tobacco companies are worried because they know the move will reduce smoking rates and their own profits .
" It 's difficult to exaggerate the importance of this , " he said .
" It will remove every opportunity of the tobacco industry to put colours , associations , anything that says to smokers , ' you will look fantastic with this ' . "
He says the move is an important world first .
" We know that from 30 , 40 years ' experience that whatever the tobacco industry lobbies hardest enough against is exactly what the Government should do , " he said .
" The tobacco industry has lobbied harder against this than anything I 've ever seen in my career , so that should be a lesson to all of us . "
Professor Chapman does not believe the tobacco industry will follow through on threats to sue .
" Constitutional lawyers and trade lawyers have been crawling all over this proposal for many , many months , " he said .
" All are united in the view that the tobacco industry does not have a leg to stand on . "
Youth targeted
ABC radio's AM program spoke to a number of smokers about the proposal for no frills packaging .
" I stick to the same packet of cigarettes , " one smoker said .
" I do n't go into the shop and go , ' hmm , which one is going to look prettiest this week ' .
I have a particular brand that I smoke and have smoked for quite a long time and will continue to smoke those . "
A fellow smoker shared his sentiment : " I do n't think it 's going to have a big impact .
I think for smokers it wo n't make any difference at all . "
The president of the Australian Medical Association , Dr Andrew Pesce , says established smokers are not the target .
" Hopefully it will [ help prevent ] children and young people from taking it up by decreasing the attractiveness of the packaging , " he said .
" Hopefully that will have an effect on preventing people from taking it up in the first place . "
The chief executive of the Cancer Council , Professor Ian Olver , also welcomed the government 's move , describing it as groundbreaking policy .
" It 's a very important move for the Government , " he said .
" We applaud them because this actually makes Australia take the lead again in tobacco control .
" The reason tobacco companies are upset is they understand how effective this move will be . "
He says the policy will bring huge benefits and cut cancer rates .
" It stops tobacco companies being able to attract young people with brightly coloured packs and it will stop them blunting health warnings .
It 's really the last form of advertising they have , " he said .
Greens leader Bob Brown says his party will back up the Government if tobacco companies take up the fight .
" If they do that , the Greens will move to have the tobacco companies pay the cost to the public health system , " he said .
" The tobacco companies , through their promotion of smoking , cost the nation billions of dollars , not least in the area of health , and the level of smoking has n't decreased as much as health authorities were hoping .
" We 'll be right behind the Rudd Government implementing this proposal . "
Sheet rock and brand new lumber from the hardware store seem awfully boring – and incredibly wasteful – when you see the beautiful ultramodern homes and other structures that can be built from recycled once - new materials .
An entire Buddhist temple made from glass bottles , modern modular shipping container homes , houseboats perched on land and resort lodging in a vintage ‘ 60s airplane are just a few of the awesome buildings that make use of unconventional and sometimes offbeat recycled junk .
Bottles
Do n’t throw those empty glass beer bottles in the recycling bin – use them to build a house !
Or , perhaps , an absolutely amazing Buddhist temple in Thailand .
It took one million beer bottles to create this temple , which stands not only as proof that recycled and reclaimed building materials can be truly beautiful , but as a reminder of the waste that we generate .
Because of their translucency and ability to hold thermal mass , glass bottles are also often used in cob building to enhance natural daylighting for a stained glass effect .
Silos
Who would have thought that grain silos could be so luxurious ?
Ubiquitous sights in rural pastures , disused grain silos can often be purchased and moved to create unusual circular homes .
Some people use them for quick , upcycled eco-friendly dwellings on the cheap , while others have given them a remarkably modern makeover .
Grain silos even have potential for durable , inexpensive prefab housing .
Cans
When John Milkovisch retired , he got bored – but he did n’t turn to golf for entertainment .
He began adding ‘ aluminum siding ’ to his Houston , Texas home in the form of flattened beer cans “ for both practical and decorative reasons ” , he says on his website .
The house is now covered in 50,000 cans .
Of course , Milkovisch ’s home is n’t the only building made from this rather random junk material .
Aluminum cans are often used as ‘ bricks ’ in earthship building , stacked and mortared with lime or earth .
Shipping Containers
When piled high on a barge , shipping containers are n’t exactly fertile inspiration for recycled architecture – but creative thinkers have managed to turn these boring rectangular boxes into surprisingly beautiful homes , offices , apartments and dorms .
Like giant modular metal Legos , shipping containers can be stacked into all sorts of configurations with a crane – and of course , they ’re really easy to transport .
Tires
Millions upon millions of tires end up in landfills every year in the U.S. alone – but many are salvaged for creative uses like – drumroll please – building houses and other structures .
Packed with rammed earth , tires make an incredibly solid building material that helps retain heat in winter and keep the building cool in the summertime .
Off - gassing is said to be a non-issue , and tires work especially well when built into the earth as earthships often are .
Ships
Boats are n’t just for the water – as proven by numerous ‘ house boats ’ seemingly stranded on land , which people actually use as a primary residence .
And how better to recycle a ship that ’s no longer seaworthy ?
Huge ships like the Great Lakes Shipping Boat ( top ) – now known as The Ship Residence on an island in Lake Erie at Put - in - Bay , Ohio – make incredible seaside mansions that are quite a sight when seen from the water .
Wood Pallets
Wood pallets are plentiful , thrown out every day by companies that no longer trust them to keep merchandise safe during shipping .
So how could they possibly be reused as a building material ?
Well , wood pallets are often still in great shape and can easily be nailed back together .
And while they may not be a great load - bearing material for anything other than a shed , they do make a fantastic addition to building exteriors to filter sunlight .
Cardboard
A cardboard building may sound like the most temporary of structures – something you expect to find in a shantytown , not a suburban neighborhood .
That it is , but imagine how such a material could be put to use for inexpensive emergency shelters that set up ultra-fast .
Architects Stutchbury and Pape developed a $ 35,000 flat - packed prefab cardboard house made from 100 % recycled materials with a waterproof outer membrane made of HDPE plastic .
Scrap Metal
Surrounded by industrial scrap metal every day for years , a former scrapyard owner saw a lot of potential for reuse – and put those ideas to work in his own home , a modern metal masterpiece 90 minutes northwest of Toronto .
A rusted metal gate made from an old truck chassis , old galvanized steel siding and I - beams rescued from a demolition job are just a few elements of the mostly recycled home .
And what will happen to this recycled home when it ’s finally due to be demolished ?
“ With most houses , when they ’re torn down , everything goes into a bin , ” homeowner S. J. Sherbanuk told Dwell .
“ When this house gets pulled down 60 or 80 years from now , they wo n’t even need a bin .
It ’s all gonna get reused . ”
Airplanes
They ’re not exactly known for comfort when you ’re flying the friendly skies , but take out all those seats and airplanes are really roomy .
Just take a peek inside the 727 Fuselage Home at the Costa Verde resort in Costa Rica , a two - bedroom suite made from a refurbished vintage 1965 Boeing 727 airframe .
Retired from its former hectic life as part of South Africa Air ’s fleet , the salvaged airplane serves as a cozy and unique lodging perched atop a 50 - foot pedestal for the feel of being in the air .
The volatile qualifier in C / C++ is a little bit like the C preprocessor : an ugly , blunt tool that is easy to misuse but that — in a very narrow set of circumstances — gets the job done .
This article will first briefly explain volatile and its history and then , through a series of examples about how not to use it , explain how to most effectively create correct systems software using volatile .
Although this article focuses on C , almost everything in it also applies to C ++.
What does a C program mean ?
The C standard defines the meaning of a C program in terms of an “ abstract machine ” that you can think of as a simple , non-optimizing interpreter for C .
The behavior of any given C implementation ( a compiler plus target machine ) must produce the same side effects as the abstract machine , but otherwise the standard mandates very little correspondence between the abstract machine and computation that actually happens on the target platform .
In other words , the C program can be thought of as a specification of desired effects , and the C implementation decides how to best go about making those effects happen .
As a simple example , consider this function :
int loop_add3 ( int x ) { int i ; for ( i=0 ; i < 3 ; i++ ) x++ ; return x ; }
The behavior of the abstract machine is clear : it creates a function - scoped variable named i which loops from 0 through 2 , adding 1 to x on each iteration of the loop .
On the other hand , a good compiler emits code like this :
loop_add3 : movl 4 ( %esp ) , %eax addl $ 3 , %eax ret
In the actual machine , i is never incremented or even instantiated , but the net effect is the same as if it had been .
In general , this gap between the abstract and actual semantics is considered to be a good thing , and the “ as if ” wording in the standard is what gives the optimizer the freedom to generate efficient code from a high - level specification .
What does volatile mean ?
The problem with the gap between the abstract and concrete semantics is that C is a low - level language that was designed for implementing operating systems .
Writing OS code often requires that the gap between the abstract and actual semantics be narrowed or closed .
For example , if an OS wants to create a new page table , the abstract semantics for C fails to capture an important fact : that the programmer requires an actual page table that sits in RAM where it can be traversed by hardware .
If the C implementation concludes that the page table is useless and optimizes it away , the developers ’ intent has not been served .
The canonical example of this problem is when a compiler decides that a developer ’s code for zeroing sensitive data is useless and optimizes it away .
Since the C abstract machine was not designed to consider cases where this data may be snooped later , the optimization is legitimate ( though obviously undesirable ) .
The C standard gives us just a few ways to establish a connection between the abstract and actual machines :
the arguments to main ( )
the return value from main ( )
the side - effecting functions in the C standard library
volatile variables
Most C implementations offer additional mechanisms , such as inline assembly and extra library functions not mandated by the standard .
The way the volatile connects the abstract and real semantics is this :
For every read from a volatile variable by the abstract machine , the actual machine must load from the memory address corresponding to that variable .
Also , each read may return a different value .
For every write to a volatile variable by the abstract machine , the actual machine must store to the corresponding address .
Otherwise , the address should not be accessed ( with some exceptions ) and also accesses to volatiles should not be reordered ( with some exceptions ) .
In summary :
Volatile has no effect on the abstract machine ; in fact , the C standard explicitly states that for a C implementation that closely mirrors the abstract machine ( i.e. a simple C interpreter ) , volatile has no effect at all .
Accesses to volatile - qualified objects obligate the C implementation to perform certain operations at the level of the actual computation .
Where did volatile come from ?
Historically , the connection between the abstract and actual machines was established mainly through accident : compilers were n’t good enough at optimizing to create an important semantic gap .
As optimizers improved , it became increasingly clear that a systematic solution was needed .
In an excellent USENET post 20 years ago Doug Gwyn explained how volatile came about :
To take a specific example , UNIX device drivers are almost always coded entirely in C , and on the PDP - 11 and similar memory - mapped I/ O architectures , some device registers perform different actions upon a “ read - byte ” , “ read - word ” , “ write - byte ” , “ write - word ” , “ read - modify - write ” , or other variations of the memory - bus access cycles involved .
Trying to get the right type of machine code generated while coding the driver in C was quite tricky , and many hard - to - track - down bugs resulted .
With compilers other than Ritchie ’s , enabling optimization often would change this behavior , too .
At least one version of the UNIX Portable C Compiler ( PCC ) had a special hack to recognize constructs like ( ( struct xxx *) 0177450 ) - > zzz as being potential references to I/O space ( device registers ) and would avoid excessive optimization involving such expressions ( where the constant lay within the Unibus I /O address range ) .
X3J11 decided that this problem had to be faced squarely , and introduced “ volatile ” to obviate the need for such hacks .
However , although it was proposed that conforming implementations be required to implement the minimum possible access “ width ” for volatile - qualified data , and that is the intent of requiring an implementation definition for it , it was not practical to insist on it in every implementation ; thus , some latitude was allowed implementors in that regard .
It ’s hard to overstate how bad an idea it is for a compiler to use strange heuristics about code structure to guess the developer ’s intent .
Nine ways to break your systems code using volatile
1 . Not enough volatile
The most obvious kind of volatile error is to leave it out when it is required .
Let ’s look at a specific example .
Suppose we ’re developing software for an AVR 8 - bit embedded processor , which ( on some models ) has no hardware multiplier .
Since multiplies are going to happen in software , we ’re probably interested in seeing how slow they are , so we know how hard to try to avoid them .
So we write a little benchmark program like this :
#define TCNT1 (*( uint16_t *) ( 0x4C ) )
signed char a , b , c ;
uint16_t time_mul ( void ) { uint16_t first = TCNT1 ; c = a * b ; uint16_t second = TCNT1 ; return second - first ; }
Here TCNT1 points to a hardware register living at address 0x4C .
This register provides access to Timer / Counter 1 : a free - running 16 - bit timer that we assume is configured to run at some rate appropriate for this experiment .
We read the register before and after the multiply operation , and subtract to find the duration .
Side note : although at first glance this code looks like it fails to account for the case where TCNT1 overflows from 65535 to 0 during the timing run , it actually works properly for all durations between 0 and 65535 ticks .
Unfortunately , when we run this code , it always reports that the multiply operation required zero clock ticks .
To see what went wrong , let us look at the assembly language :
$ avr -gcc - Os - S -o - reg1. c time_mul : lds r22 , a lds r24 , b rcall __mulqi3 sts c , r24 ldi r24,lo8 (0 ) ldi r25,hi8(0 ) ret
Now the problem is obvious : both reads from the TCNT1 register have been eliminated and the function is simply returning the constant zero ( avr - gcc returns a 16 - bit value in the r24:r25 register pair ) .
How can the compiler get away with never reading from TCNT1 ?
First , let ’s remember that the meaning of a C program is defined by the abstract machine described in the C standard .
Since the rules for the abstract machine say nothing about hardware registers ( or concurrent execution ) the C implementation is permitted to assume that two reads from an object , with no intervening stores , both return the same value .
Of course , any value subtracted from itself is zero .
So the translation performed by avr - gcc here is perfectly correct ; it is our program that ’s wrong .
To fix the problem , we need to change the code so that TCNT1 points to a volatile location .
#define TCNT1 ( *( volatile uint16_t *) ( 0x4C ) )
Now , the C implementation is not free to eliminate the reads and also it cannot assume the same value is read both times .
This time the compiler outputs better code :
$ avr -gcc - Os - S -o - reg2. c time_mul : in r18,0x2 c in r19,0x2d lds r22 , a lds r24 , b rcall __mulqi3 sts c , r24 in r24,0x2 c in r25,0x2d sub r24,r18 sbc r25,r19 ret
Although this assembly code is correct , our C code still contains a latent error .
We ’ll explore it later .
Normally , you will find definitions for device registers in system header files .
If so , you will not need to use volatile in this case .
But it may be worth checking that the definitions are correct , they are n’t always .
Let ’s look at another example .
In an embedded system you are implementing , some computation must wait for an interrupt handler to fire .
Your code looks like this :
int done ;
__attribute ( ( signal ) ) void __vector_4 ( void ) { done = 1 ; }
void wait_for_done ( void ) { while ( ! done ) ; }
Here wait_for_done ( ) is designed to be called from the non-interrupt context , whereas __vector_4 ( ) will be invoked by the interrupt controller in response to some external event .
We compile this code into assembly :
$ avr - gcc - Os wait . c - S -o - __vector_4 : push r0 in r0 , __SREG__ push r0 push r 24 ldi r24,lo8 ( 1 ) sts done , r24 pop r24 pop r0 out __SREG__,r0 pop r0 reti
wait_for_done : lds r24, done .L3 : tst r24 breq .
L3 ret
The code for the interrupt handler looks good : it stores to done as intended .
The rest of the interrupt handler is just AVR interrupt boilerplate .
However , the code for wait_for_done ( ) contains an important flaw : it is spinning on r24 instead of spinning on a RAM location .
This happens because the C abstract machine has no notion of communication between concurrent flows ( whether they are threads , interrupts , or anything else ) .
Again , the translation is perfectly correct , but does not match the developer ’s intent .
If we mark done as a volatile variable , the interrupt handler code does not change , but wait_for_done ( ) now looks like this :
wait_for_done : .L3 : lds r24 , done tst r24 breq .
L3 ret
This code will work .
The issue here is one of visibility .
When you store to a global variable in C , what computations running on the machine are guaranteed to see the store ?
When you load from a global variable , what computations are assumed to have produced the value ?
In both cases , the answer is “ the computation that performs the load or store is assumed to be the only computation that matters . ”
That is , C makes no visibility guarantees for normal variable references .
The volatile qualifier forces stores to go to memory and loads to come from memory , giving us a way to ensure visibility across multiple computations ( threads , interrupts , coroutines , or whatever ) .
Again , our C code contains a latent bug that we ’ll investigate later .
A few other legitimate uses of volatile , including making variables in UNIX programs visible to signal handlers , are discussed by Hans Boehm .
Summary :
The abstract C machine is connected to the actual machine in only a few places .
The memory behavior of the actual machine may be very different from the operations specified in source code .
If you require additional connections between the two levels of abstraction , for example to access device registers , the volatile qualifier can help .
2 . Too much volatile
In a well - designed piece of software , volatile is used exactly where it is needed .
It serves as documentation , saying in effect “ this variable does not play by the C rules : it requires a strong connection with the memory subsystem . ”
In a system that uses too much volatile , variables will be indiscriminately labeled as volatile , without any technical justification .
There are three reasons why this is bad .
First , it ’s bad documentation and will confuse subsequent maintainers .
Second , volatile sometimes has the effect of hiding program bugs such as race conditions .
If your code needs volatile and you do n’t understand why , this is probably what is happening .
Far better to actually fix the problem than to rely on a hack you do not understand to solve a problem you do not understand .
Finally , volatile causes inefficiency by handicapping the optimizer .
The overhead that it introduces is hard to track down since it is spread out all over the system– a profiler will be little help in finding it .
Using volatile is a little like deciding what kind of insurance policy to buy .
Too little insurance and you may run into problems down the road .
Too much insurance and you ’re covered but in the long run you end up paying too much .
Summary : Use volatile only when you can provide a precise technical justification .
Volatile is not a substitute for thought ( Nigel Jones said this ) .
3. Misplaced qualification
At the level of C syntax , volatile is a type qualifier .
It can be applied to any type , following rules that are similar to , but not quite the same as , the rules for the const qualifier .
The situation can become confusing when qualified types are used to build up more complex types .
For example , there are four possible ways to qualify a single - level pointer :
int * p ; // pointer to int volatile int * p_to_vol ; // pointer to volatile int int * volatile vol_p ; // volatile pointer to int volatile int * volatile vol_p_to_vol ; // volatile pointer to volatile int
In each case , either the pointer is volatile or not , and the pointer target is volatile or not .
The distinction is crucial : if you use a “ volatile pointer to regular int ” to access a device register , the compiler is free to optimize away accesses to the register .
Also , you will get slow code since the compiler will not be free to optimize accesses to the pointer .
This problem comes up pretty often on embedded mailing lists ; it ’s an easy mistake to make .
It ’s also easy to overlook when vetting code since your eye may just be looking for a volatile somewhere .
For example , this code is wrong :
int *volatile REGISTER = 0xfeed ; *REGISTER = new_val ;
To write clear , maintainable code using volatile , a reasonable idea is to build up more complex types using typedefs ( of course this is a good idea anyway ) .
For example we could first make a new type “ vint ” which is a volatile int :
typedef volatile int vint ;
Next , we create a pointer - to - vint :
vint * REGISTER = 0xfeed ;
Members of a struct or union can be volatile , and structs / unions can also be volatile .
If an aggregate type is volatile , the effect is the same as making all members volatile .
We might ask , does it make sense to declare an object as both const and volatile ?
const volatile int *p ;
Although this initially looks like a contradiction , it is not .
The semantics of const in C are “ I agree not to try to store to it ” rather than “ it does not change . ”
So in fact this qualification is perfectly meaningful and would even be useful , for example , to declare a timer register than spontaneously changes value , but that should not be stored to ( this example is specifically pointed out in the C standard ) .
Summary : Since C’s type declaration syntax is not particularly readable or intuitive , volatile qualifiers must be placed with care .
Typedefs are a useful way to structure complex declarations .
4. Inconsistent qualification
The last version of Linux 2.2 was 2.2.26 .
In that version , in the file arch / i386/kernel/smp.c at line 125 , we find this definition :
volatile unsigned long ipi_count ;
So far , no problem : we ’re declaring a long to store the number of inter- processor interrupts and making it volatile .
However , in the header file include / asm - i386 / smp.h at line 178 we find this definition :
extern unsigned long ipi_count ;
C files that include this header will not treat ipi_count as volatile , and this could easily cause problems .
Kernels in the 2.3 series also contain this error .
Recent versions of gcc treat this kind of inconsistent qualification as a compile - time error , so these problems have disappeared .
However , it ’s a good bet that some embedded compilers ( obviously including those based on older versions of gcc ) will permit you to make this mistake .
Another way to get inconsistent qualification is through typecasts .
Casts can be implicit , for example passing a pointer - to - volatile to a function expecting an unqualified pointer .
The compiler will warn about this ; these warnings should never be ignored or suppressed .
Explicit typecasts that remove qualifiers should be avoided , these generally do not cause any warnings .
The C standard explicitly states that a program ’s behavior is undefined if you access a volatile object through an unqualified pointer .
Summary : Never use inconsistent qualification .
If a variable is declared as volatile , then all accesses to it , direct or indirect , must be through volatiles and pointers - to - volatile .
5 . Expecting volatile to enforce ordering with non-volatile accesses
Next we come to an issue that even some experts in embedded software development get wrong , and that even experts in C language semantics have arguments about .
The question is :
What was wrong with the fixed C code examples above , where we added volatile to the TCNT1 register handle and to the done flag ?
The answer , depending on who you believe , is either “ nothing ” or else “ the compiler may reorder the operations in such a way as to create broken output . ”
One school of thought is that compilers may not move accesses to global variables around accesses to volatile variables .
There seems to be a consistent reading of the standard that backs this up .
The problem with this reading is that important compilers are based on a different interpretation , which says that accesses to non-volatile objects can be arbitrarily moved around volatile accesses .
Take this simple example ( which originated with Arch Robison ) :
volatile int ready ; int message [ 100 ] ;
void foo ( int i ) { message [ i/10 ] = 42 ; ready = 1 ; }
The purpose of foo( ) is to store a value into the message array and then set the ready flag so that another interrupt or thread can see the value .
From this code , GCC , Intel CC , Sun CC , and Open64 emit very similar assembly :
$ gcc - O2 barrier1.c - S -o - foo : movl 4 ( %esp ) , %ecx movl $ 1717986919 , %edx movl $ 1 , ready movl %ecx , %eax imull %edx sarl $ 31 , %ecx sarl $ 2 , %edx subl %ecx , %edx movl $ 42 , message ( , %edx, 4 ) ret
Obviously the programmer ’s intent is not respected here , since the flag is stored prior to the value being written into the array .
As of this writing LLVM does not do this reordering but , as far as I know , this is a matter of chance rather than design .
A number of embedded compilers refuse to do this kind of reordering as a deliberate choice to prefer safety over performance .
I ’ve heard , but not checked , that recent Microsoft C/C++ compilers also take a very conservative stance on volatile accesses .
This is probably the right choice , but it does n’t help people who have to write portable code .
One way to fix this problem is to declare message as a volatile array .
The C standard is unambiguous that volatile side effects must not move past sequence points , so this will work .
On the other hand , adding more volatile qualifiers may suppress interesting optimizations elsewhere in the program .
Would n’t it be nice if we could force data to memory only at selected program points without making things volatile everywhere ?
The construct that we need is a “ compiler barrier . ”
The C standard does not provide this , but many compilers do .
For example , GCC and sufficiently compatible compilers ( including LLVM and Intel CC ) support a memory barrier that looks like this :
asm volatile ( " " : : : " memory " ) ;
It means roughly “ this inline assembly code , although it contains no instructions , may read or write all of RAM . ”
The effect is that the compiler dumps all registers to RAM before the barrier and reloads them afterwards .
Moreover , code motion is not permitted around the barrier in either direction .
Basically a compiler barrier is to an optimizing compiler as a memory barrier is to an out - of - order processor .
We can use a barrier in the code example :
volatile int ready ; int message [ 100 ] ;
void foo ( int i ) { message [ i/10 ] = 42 ; asm volatile ( " " : : : " memory " ) ; ready = 1 ; }
Now the output is what we wanted :
$ gcc - O2 barrier2.c - S -o - foo : movl 4 ( %esp ) , %ecx movl $ 1717986919 , %edx movl %ecx , %eax imull %edx sarl $ 31 , %ecx sarl $ 2 , %edx subl %ecx , %edx movl $ 42 , message ( , %edx , 4 ) movl $ 1 , ready ret
What about compilers that fail to support memory barriers ?
One bad solution is to hope that this kind of compiler is n’t aggressive enough to move accesses around in a harmful way .
Another bad solution is to insert a call to an external function where you would put the barrier .
Since the compiler does n’t know what memory will be touched by this function , it may have a barrier - like effect .
A better solution would be to ask your compiler vendor to fix the problem and also to recommend a workaround in the meantime .
Summary : Most compilers can and will move accesses to non-volatile objects around accesses to volatile objects , so do n’t rely on the program ordering being respected .
6 . Using volatile to get atomicity
Earlier we saw a case where volatile was used to make a value visible to a concurrently running computation .
This was — in limited circumstances — a valid implementation choice .
On the other hand it is never valid to use volatile to get atomicity .
Somewhat surprisingly for a systems programming language , C does not provide guarantees about atomicity of its memory operations , regardless of the volatility of objects being accessed .
Generally , however , individual compilers will make guarantees such as “ aligned accesses to word - sized variables are atomic . ”
In most cases , you use locks to get atomicity .
If you ’re lucky , you have access to well - designed locks that contain compiler barriers .
If you ’re programming on bare metal on an embedded processor , you may not be so lucky .
If you have to devise your own locks , it would be wise to add compiler barriers .
For example , older versions of TinyOS for AVR chips used these functions to acquire and release the global interrupt lock :
char __nesc_atomic_start ( void ) { char result = SREG ; __nesc_disable_interrupt( ) ; return result ; }
void __nesc_atomic_end ( char save ) { SREG = save ; }
Since these functions can be ( and generally are ) inlined , it was always possible for the compiler to move code outside of a critical section .
We changed the locks to look like this :
char__nesc_atomic_start( void ) { char result = SREG ; __nesc_disable_interrupt( ) ; asm volatile ( " " : : : " memory " ) ; return result ; }
void __nesc_atomic_end ( char save ) { asm volatile ( " " : : : " memory " ) ; SREG = save ; }
Perhaps interestingly , this had no effect on TinyOS efficiency and even made the code smaller in some cases .
Summary : Volatile has nothing to do with atomicity .
Use locks .
7 . Using volatile on a modern machine
Volatile is of very limited usefulness on a machine that is out - of - order , multiprocessor , or both .
The problem is that while volatile forces the compiler to emit memory operations on the actual machine , these loads and stores by themselves do not constrain the hardware ’s behavior very much .
It is vastly preferable to find good locking primitives and use them , as opposed to rolling them yourself .
Consider this spin-unlock function from the ARM port of Linux :
static inline void arch_spin_unlock ( arch_spinlock_t * lock ) { smp_mb ( ) ; __asm__ __volatile__( " str % 1 , [ %0 ]
" : : " r " ( &lock -> lock ) , " r " ( 0 ) : " cc " ) ; }
Before unlocking , smp_mb ( ) is executed , which boils down to something like this :
__asm__ __volatile__ ( " dmb " : : : " memory " ) ;
This is both a compiler barrier and a memory barrier .
Summary : Without help from properly designed synchronization libraries , writing correct concurrent code on an out - of - order machine or multiprocessor is extremely hard , and volatile is of little help .
8 . Using volatile in multi- threaded code
This issue overlaps with the previous two but it ’s important enough to be worth repeating .
Arch Robison says that volatile is almost useless for multi- threaded programming .
And he ’s right .
If you have threads then you should also have locks , and should use them .
There ’s a wonderful result showing that properly synchronized code — where shared variables are always accessed from within critical sections — executes in a sequentially consistent fashion ( provided that the locks are properly implemented , and you should n’t have to worry about that ) .
This means that if you use locks , you do n’t have to worry about compiler barriers , memory system barriers , or volatile .
None of it matters .
Summary :
To write correct multi- threaded code , you need primitives providing ( at least ) atomicity and visibility .
On modern hardware volatile provides neither .
You should write properly synchronized multi- threaded code whenever possible .
Idioms like double - checked locking are best avoided .
9 . Assume volatile accesses are translated correctly
Compilers are not totally reliable in their translation of accesses to volatile - qualified objects .
I ’ve written extensively about this subject elsewhere , but here ’s a quick example :
volatile int x ;
void foo ( void ) { x = x ; }
The proper behavior of this code on the actual machine is unambiguous : there should be a load from x , then a store to it .
However , the port of GCC to the MSP430 processor behaves differently :
$ msp430-gcc - O vol .c - S -o - foo : ret
The emitted function is a nop .
It is wrong .
In general , compilers based on gcc 4.x are mostly volatile - correct , as are recent versions of LLVM and Intel CC .
Pre -4.0 versions of gcc have problems , as do a number of other compilers .
Summary :
If your code makes correct use of volatiles and still does not work , consider reading the compiler ’s output to make sure it has emitted the proper memory operations .
What about the Linux people ?
You can find various rants , screeds , and diatribes against volatile on Linux mailing lists and web pages .
These are largely correct , but you have to keep in mind that :
Linux often runs on out - of - order multicores where volatile by itself is nearly useless .
The Linux kernel provides a rich collection of functions for synchronization and hardware access that , properly used , eliminate almost all need for volatile in regular kernel code .
If you are writing code for an in - order embedded processor and have little or no infrastructure besides the C compiler , you may need to lean more heavily on volatile .
Summary
Optimizing compilers are tricky to reason about , as are out - of - order processors .
Also , the C standard contains some very dark corners .
The volatile qualifier invites all of these difficulties to come together in one place and interact with one another .
Furthermore , it provides weaker guarantees than people commonly assume .
Careful thought is required to create correct software using volatile .
Happily , most programmers who write user - mode C and C++ can get away without ever using volatile .
Also , the vast majority of kernel mode programmers will seldom if ever need volatile .
It is primarily needed by people working near bare metal ; for example , working on an embedded microcontroller or porting an OS to a new platform .
Credentials
I ’ve been programming computers for 26 years and embedded systems for 17 years .
For the last eight years I ’ve taught operating systems , embedded systems , compilers , and related courses to undergrads and graduate students .
I ’ve tried to educate them about volatile and have a pretty good idea about where people go wrong with it .
In February 2010 I gave some lectures at RWTH Aachen , including about an hour on getting the volatile qualifier wrong .
This post expands on that material .

German police have arrested a man they suspect of being the mastermind of an armed raid on a poker tournament in Berlin .
The heavily - armed gang made off with the tournament jackpot of 242,000 euros ( $ 327,000 ; £ 217,000 ) in early March .
Police said a 28 - year - old Lebanese man , the fourth arrested in connection with the raid , had been detained on Sunday .
In a statement , authorities described the man as " the brains behind the operation " .
" According to the current state of our investigation , the suspect is thought to have been the organiser [...]
He also drove the getaway car , " a black Mercedes - Benz , Berlin police said in a statement .
Two other suspects were arrested earlier this week and a third on Saturday morning at Berlin 's Tegel airport , the Associated Press news agency reports .
On 6 March , the gang of four - reportedly carrying handguns - burst into Berlin 's Hyatt hotel in the city 's Potsdamer Platz .
To the shock of the poker players taking part in the tournament , they made off with the jackpot in bags of cash , whose initial sum was reported to be far higher .
The financial might of the IPL was on display again on Sunday when Pune and Kochi became the league 's two new franchises , being sold for a value in excess of the original eight franchises combined .
The Sahara group , the biggest patron of sports in the country , became owners of the Pune franchise after offering a staggering US $ 370 m .
The other new franchisee is a consortium of five companies called Rendezvous Sports World , which bid US $ 333.33 m for Kochi .
There were three other qualified bidders , including Adani Enterprises and VC digital solutions Pvt Ltd ( Videocon ) , who were in the fray to become part of the IPL , which will be heartening for any existing franchise owners looking to offload their stake .
" It only shows there is no recession for the IPL and it is on the upswing , " Lalit Modi , the league 's commissioner , said after announcing the new franchises in Chennai .
Sahara , who have been sponsoring Indian cricket for the past 15 years , had bid for the same amount for three cities , but ultimately chose Pune over Ahmedabad and Nagpur .
" When we considered the cities , in terms of infrastructure and logistics , Pune came first , " Abhijit Sarkar , the head of Sahara 's corporate communications , said .
" Ït is also close to Mumbai - the commercial capital of India - and Aamby Valley ( an upmarket township owned by the Sahara group ) . "
Ajay Shirke , president of the Maharashtra Cricket Association ( MCA ) and a prominent businessmen from Pune , said he was obviously happy about Pune being rated as the most popular venue at the auction with three out of the five bidders preferring Pune as their home base over the rest of the 11 cities .
Puneites have been hungry for top-quality cricket for nearly half a decade now .
The last international match played in Pune was in the 2005 ODI series between India and Sri Lanka .
" MCA has always maintained that we will support all bids that are made for Pune , " Shirke , who was present at the auction venue in Chennai , told Cricinfo .
" That only increases Pune 's association with cricket manifold .
" What they [ the bidders ] would have kept in mind was the market of Mumbai and Pune are nearby .
Then there are private cities like Lavasa and Aamby Valley , which are about 20 kilometres from the ground . "
According to Shirke , the Sahara franchise would have its home ground situated on the outskirts of Pune city , in Gahunje , which is on the Mumbai - Pune expressway .
The ground construction is already underway with Shapoorji Pallonji being the main contractors .
He was confident that the ground would be ready in time for the IPL 's fourth season when Sahara would unveil its team .
" The construction work has already started and it should be ready by March 2011 , " Shirke said .
While Sahara have a long history of sports sponsorship and are a high - profile corporate group , little is known about the winners of the Kochi franchise .
It is a consortium with five partners - the Rendezvous group , Parini developers , Anand Shah Estate , Anchor Earth Private Limited and Film Waves .
Minister of state for external affairs Shashi Tharoor was involved in bringing the group together , but has no stake in the franchise .
In fact , Tharoor clarified to Cricinfo that he had no stake in the Kochi franchise and that his role was limited to encouraging the consortium that bagged the team .
" My role consisted only of encouraging and blessing the venture , and steering it to Kerala , " he told Cricinfo .
" Tharoor was involved in facilitating and trying to get a team for the state , " Modi confirmed .
" He is an ardent fan of cricket and he has been trying to get people from Kochi to bid for it .
I think his involvement ends there . "
Modi said the tournament 's organsiers would provide the Kochi franchise a home ground till the Kerala Cricket Association completes construction of its new stadium .
" Kerala Cricket Association is in the process of building the infrastructure and as when the stadium is ready teams will play there , " he said .
" But till the structures are ready , the IPL will provide them with an alternate venue . "
Speaking to reporters , Shailendra Gaikwad of Rendezvous World Sport said , " We have closely been following every development within the IPL , right from the inaugural year .
Today , I am very happy for our consortium of Rendezvous World Sport and the people of Kochi as we finally have a team to call our own in this amazing city - based sports franchise "
While the huge money offered by the new franchisees shows the health of the IPL , Modi said there were no plans in the near future to further increase the number of teams involved .
" We also have no plans to expand further immediately .
In fact I do n't foresee an expansion in many , many years to come but then you never know . "
The IPL will now feature 10 teams and - if the current format is retained - a total of 94 games , from the existing 60 .
After the first season in 2008 , the league has already expanded its reach to other centres such as Cuttack , Ahmedabad , Nagpur and Dharamsala .
The franchise auction process was to have been completed on March 7 but was postponed by two weeks after the bidders and the BCCI objected to stiff financial clauses .
Whales are dignified , intelligent and sensitive beings .
We have known this for some time , and yet still they remain , much to our shame , susceptible to human assault .
In recent centuries , great cetaceans have been driven nearly to extinction while nations competed in the hunt without restraint .
But we now live in globalised times .
The world has become smaller and , of necessity , more co-ordinated .
The old order based on full state sovereignty is being partially replaced by an integrated system of international law .
While this change is most visible in the domain of human rights – which has become seen as supported by the " universal conscience of the world 's peoples " – other spheres have been affected , too .
Not least , the worldwide treatment of whales , a subject which has returned to the headlines as the International Whaling Commission considers plans to green - light limited commercial whaling .
In recent decades , a broadening international consensus has begun to emerge in the policies of those institutions concerned with " whaling " – in itself an unpleasant term for what should accurately be called whale hunting – and in particular that of the IWC , created in 1946 to co-ordinate the different national industries .
As legal scholars have noted , such policies , by moving from the initial stage of free resource to the present stage of preservation marked by a moratorium on commercial hunting , have come close to acknowledging a major theoretical shift – the adoption of the view that whales are entitled to life .
And , though there still are countries – Japan , Norway , and Iceland – which , through various devices , keep hunting , the relevant premises for such a shift are unquestionable .
The idea of duty to whales is gradually being translated into obligation under international law .
At the same time , the " universal conscience of the world 's peoples " is relevant , too : evidenced by the millions of people who regard the killing of whales as inconsistent with current moral ideals ; by the number of international NGOs – such as the UK - based Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society – which constantly work to implement such ideals ; and by the global sympathy for those who wage war against whale hunters .
To this , a powerful new element should be added .
We have discovered that whales " sing " .
Scientists have explained to us that whale societies display complex and stable vocal and behavioural cultures previously suggested only for humans .
More impressively still , research into whale behaviour points to an ability to look to the past , present and future – functions on which consciousness of oneself as a distinct entity existing in time are mounted .
A relevant backward - looking attitude is revealed , for instance , when hordes of whales , returning to their original territory after long - distance trips , first sing the old songs of the previous year , and then the new songs ; the existence of a conscious self in the present , with the attendant ability to attribute mental states to others , is apparent in cases of whales doing acrobatic manoeuvres to warn approaching vessels of their presence ; and female killer whales ' tutoring of their offspring in the dangerous activity of shallow - water hunting offers evidence of the capacity for formulating and carrying out plans .
Since , according to current ethical reflection , the concept of being a person is the concept not of belonging to a certain species but of being endowed with certain mental properties – particularly , self - consciousness – whales turn out to be nonhuman persons , thus confirming the moral soundness of both the trend in international law and the intuitive popular view .
Why , then , has n't the principle of whales ' entitlement to life already been agreed ?
Because of the continuous , subterranean work of a few governments ( governments , not nations , as there is also opposition to whaling in the whaling countries ) .
In fact , the IWC is even considering lifting the moratorium , agreed in 1986 , thereby allowing commercial hunts .
That is , with the acquiescence of some " anti- whaling " governments , a few pressure groups may block a process that would be almost universally welcomed .
And what are the grounds for doing it ?
First , the claim that the depleted species of whales are flourishing again – a claim that , apart from being contested , misses the point , which is now about moral protection , not conservation of harvestable resources .
Second , a claim of " cultural exception " based on national cultural practices – an argument about as respectable as that of " cultural exception " advanced by countries that would deny women equal human rights .
In the face of these contentions , one can only wish that people let their voices be heard , insisting that tactical interests are not placed above legal and moral progress .
Questions have been raised in the past about the IWC role , and proposals were made calling for the UN to assume jurisdiction .
This idea has become more relevant today .
An institution created with the goal of regulating exploitation is no longer the best organisation to deal with whale protection .
If , as humanity comes to recognise the moral standing of whales , the IWC fails to act accordingly , the time may be ripe to remove this task from its hands .
A recent survey conducted by the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) found that a whopping nearly one - third of the U.S. population ( 93 million people ) do not subscribe to broadband at home .
The main causes have been identified , and the government plans to address them at the national level .
Le musée de la Communication de Berlin , courtesy dalbera
FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski discussed the survey ’s findings at the Brookings Institute on Tuesday ( February 23 ) .
The three main barriers to Americans in obtaining broadband access at home are :
Affordability : 36 % of respondents say the monthly fees , cost of installation , or purchasing a computer in the first place are too expensive .
of respondents say the monthly fees , cost of installation , or purchasing a computer in the first place are too expensive .
Digital Literacy : 22 % of respondents claim they lack the skills to use broadband internet or are afraid if the dangers of being online .
of respondents claim they lack the skills to use broadband internet or are afraid if the dangers of being online .
Relevance : 19 % of respondents believe they simply do n’t need broadband access at home .
Addressing these concerns , Genachowski asserted that not being connected in the coming digital age is simply not an option .
As quoted from a CNET article :
“ We need to tackle the challenge of connecting 93 million Americans to our broadband future , ” he said in a statement .
“ In the 21st century , a digital divide is an opportunity divide .
To bolster American competitiveness abroad and create the jobs of the future here at home , we need to make sure that all Americans have the skills and means to fully participate in the digital economy . ”
Unfortunately , the solution will not be a simple one .
In addressing the issue of affordability , the survey asked participants how much more likely they would be to subscribe to broadband access if the price were lowered substantially .
The current average subscription cost for high - speed internet is $ 40 / mo .
If lowered by half to $ 20 / mo. , only 6 % said they would buy in .
Even when lowered to a mere $ 10 / mo. , projected subscription rates only rose by 8 % .
This indicates that among those claiming a problem with affordability , a significant percentage share concerns such as digital literacy and relevance .
Simply creating a cheaper government plan or offering subsidies for qualifying low - income residents will not come close to solving the problem .
The option of providing national broadband access is only a facet of a larger plan that Congress has ordered from the FCC .
This larger plan must ( as the above affordability issue illustrates ) not only provide infrastructure and service , but also educate Americans on how to safely and productively use high - speed internet and why use of the internet will be crucial to success in the burgeoning digital age .
The National Broadband Plan report received a four - week extension and is now due in Congress March 17 .
One suggestion likely to be made , according to Marguerite Reardon , is to reallocate the government ’s $ 7 billion Universal Service Fund for subsidizing telephone service to subsidize broadband instead .
The total cost of the greater plan , including infrastructure expansion and subscriber education , could reach up to $ 350 billion .
While this would be mostly payed for by private industry , the money must come from somewhere .
Said private industry are bristling at the increase in FCC involvement in what has traditionally been an unregulated market .
AT&T , Verizon , CTIA , and the National Cable & Telecommunications Association have issued challenges to the FCC as it attempts to bring internet service providers ( ISPs ) under its wing .
The FCC argues that as an increasingly standard and necessary medium of communication , the internet and its ISPs ought to be considered the same as telephone service and its providers ( which it oversees and regulates ) .
Interestingly , it is the government with its regulation that is striving for an open web .
The current issue “ stems from Comcast ’s appeal of a 2007 ruling , which found that [ Comcast ] violated open - access guidelines that prohibited network providers from slowing or blocking Web sites . ” ( Kang )
With Congressional dreams of a connected country , the FCC will likely have all the support it needs to win its cases against an irate private internet industry .
However , the FCC will also need internet service providers ’ active help in accomplishing its mandated goals .
Not to mention the public backlash over perceived or feared government monitoring of the heretofore unfettered web .
The road will be long and bumpy , but you can ultimately expect some form of Big Brother Broadband .
Do you think the FCC will continue to champion the open web ?
What are your fears and concerns ?

When you ’ve got Eve Online ’s senior technical producer on the phone , it ’s rude not to ask him about his plans for that most righteous of MMOs .
Here ’s what Olafsson had to say about Eve and forthcoming expansion , Tyrannis .
We also had a few words about console action crossover , Dust 514 .
( Am I convinced there wo n’t be a PC client ?
No , not convinced .
CCP still saying it ’s their console game , however . )
RPS : Around 2003 there was a lot of optimism about what MMOs could do – Eve , Planetside – there does n’t seem to have been another big wave of MMO innovation since then .
I wonder if we ’re getting back toward that now … but there ’s still no one copying Eve ’s model ( aside from Perpetuum , which remains in a closed beta ) .
Does it surprise you that no one is trying “ do a CCP ” ?
Olafsson :
Well I think plenty of people are being influenced by Eve , at least , just as we are influenced by many other games .
I think the wave of optimism in 2003 had a lot to do with Ultima Online coming out and firing up the developers .
Look at it backwards : consider the time it takes to create an MMO , what people were doing before that , and playing before that , it ’s Ultima Online and MUDs .
What we can see about MMOs is the space is dominated by a single product : Ultima , Everquest , and then World Of Warcraft came and killed them dead .
It makes the space difficult to get into .
But you are asking about more sandbox approaches …
RPS : Well , I talk to a lot of MMO developers , and I never hear them say “ oh we ’re trying be Eve ” , or “ oh we got that from Eve … ”
Olafsson : Perhaps people consider us too hardcore , too obscure .
They may be concerned that they ’re never going to reach twelve million subscribers if they go the sandbox route .
And it ’s also more challenging .
It would be incredibly hard to do a big launch on a sandbox game .
These kinds of games rely on social structures to work .
You ca n’t go straight to a million players in this way when there are a million strangers .
A million subscribers … you need to grow from a smaller number , to grow relationships , not just the world .
RPS : Can you talk about Dust ?
How did that come about ?
[ Dust is a planned crossover with consoles to create a planetary action game that is plugged in to the functioning Eve universe at an economic and strategic level – ExplanaBot ]
Olafsson :
It came about because we think that Eve itself is an exciting IP , and we really like that world we have created .
A lot of people are excited about it – books , tonnes of fiction and so on .
We wanted to capitalise on that .
But secondly we as a company want to make console games , but our expertise is sandbox MMOs and larger network infrastructure .
This was a perfect opportunity to go into the console space .
We were not going to copy something else that had been done previously , but instead capitalise on our expertise in managing large , networked communities and infrastructure , to manifest our IP there .
Rather than create something that was sideways in time , or otherwise disconnected from the original game , we decided to plug it right in : to connect this new console game to the vibrant , pre-existing economy and social structure of Eve .
It ’s a good way to catalyse a community : to have movement already there .
That ’s the problem with any community – if you start from scratch you will struggle .
If you can plug what you are doing straight into the pre-existing movers and shakers then you have momentum .
It ’s a game design nightmare .
An interesting nightmare .
We ’re enjoying the technical challenge .
RPS : So anyway , moving back to Eve itself , the planetary interaction stuff you have planned for Tyrannis is presumably groundwork for Dust .
How does that work ?
Olafsson : Because
Eve is all on a single server it is quite volatile , quite fragile .
If we put out something on the server then it could break the game , the entire community , the entire economy .
With this in mind we put our expansions every six months .
Rather than rolling out huge expansions every eighteen months to a big fanfare , we are producing them iteratively .
What we are doing next is our planetary interaction expansion , Tyrannis , which also includes our new socialisation features , EveGate .
The planetary interaction feature set is the first step of many to building on planets which will lead into Dust .
In the expansion right now you are given the ability to scan for resource deposits and to build infrastructure to extract them .
It ’s just the core mechanics of planetary interaction gameplay this time , that we will then iterate on in future expansions .
It will provide an excellent source of income that can make money for you while you play the rest of the game .
RPS : Can you explain a bit the mechanics of it ?
How does infrastructure work ?
Olafsson :
What is important is that this has a low barrier of entry .
All a player needs to do is purchase a command - centre somewhere on the open market , a command centre for the particular type of planet .
All of the 55,000 planets in Eve are available for interaction , provided you can fly up next to it .
If you are deep in low security space it could be protected by someone .
You fly up , right click , and open the planet in planet mode .
Plonk down the command centre and you can start to build extractors , processors , factories and different things .
Then you need to place the factories close to the command unit and then be strategic in how you place modules , and then set up a production chain : what goes from where to where to produce material .
Finally , of course , you need to fly to the planet every now and then to pick up your produce .
The interface is interesting , because it is a hybrid of abstract and photorealistic , the planet is realistic and the pins are abstract .
We decided to use that approach because the worlds are so different in size , but also in terrain : we have gas giants , desert worlds , lava planets , and so on .
We had to abstract out the graphics of the installations with little holograms .
RPS : What happens if someone already has a command centre down there ?
Olafsson :
If he is extracting then the resources will be low .
In busy systems the planets will be sucked dry by lots of players .
Everyone can interact with every planet , everywhere , but the more people who are using a planet , the less valuable it is .
RPS : No destruction mechanism for planet infrastructure ?
Olafsson : No , not in this expansion .
We will be iterating on the concept and introducing PvP concepts later .
RPS : Okay , so can you tell us a little bit about the other aspect of this expansion , EveGate ?
Olafsson : EveGate is a portal into the game .
We feel that the game is bigger than the client , and we feel that interfacing with the world when people are n’t in front of their regular gaming rig is important .
We ’re doing this iteratively too , so we focused on the most needed parts .
For now we focused on social aspects , so there will be ways to log on and read and send Evemail , to access calendars where you can organise events , as well as create corporation profiles and view those of others .
It is a socialisation interface , but we expect to introduce actual web browser .
So you will be able to interact with those aspects of the game which do n’t require 3D graphics , such as corporation management .
But those are to come , for now it is mail , calendar and profiles .
In the future I want you to be able to pick up your iPhone and interact with the game on some level .
RPS : Looking back on the last couple of expansions ( this is the 13th ) how do you feel about the sovereignty mechanics ?
Obviously that was a big change in Dominion … how do you feel about it now ?
Olafsson : I think it was a good start .
It ’s certain not finished .
I think it was really successful as an expansion , because it renewed interest in Eve – we saw old players coming back .
In terms of mechanics , we saw warfare in 0.0 in become more tactical , and it became more interesting as a result .
I think we can improve .
After watching the gameplay , the graphs , the feedback , I feel we could do more to make it interesting .
We fixed old and broken mechanics , of course , and many of them had been broken for a long time .
But there are few systems in Eve I regard as “ finished ” .
The whole game is in flux and is open for iteration and polish .
But there are just so many systems , and so little time .
RPS : Speaking of time , thanks for yours !
Tyrannis hits Eve on May 18th .
The one economic indicator that seems to point toward long - term hope for businesses is the increase in the U.S. household savings rate — the portion of income that wage earners are n’t spending .
Savings were close to nil until the economic collapse but have been rising ever since .
As of this writing , the rate stands at about 4.8 % .
Economists and business leaders say this is a good sign , despite the short - term drag created by decreased spending .
“ I would feel more pessimistic if it were still 1 % , ” says Gregory W. Brown at the University of North Carolina ’s Kenan - Flagler Business School .
Friends of mine who run companies , both private and public , have expressed pretty much the same sentiment .
A savings rate that ’s even in the 6 % - to - 8 % range is respectable .
And if consumers do n’t return to their old borrowing - and - buying habits , the argument goes , one day they ’ll go out and spend all this saved - up cash , and businesses everywhere will reap the benefits .
But in fact , the rising savings rate is telling us something very different .
It ’s not reflecting an imminent recovery but rather a drawn - out malaise that will soon become something like a lost decade .
Because of the way the government measures household savings , the increase does n’t signify more money in people ’s wallets ; instead , it suggests that consumers are paying off their mounting debt during a period of reduced borrowing .
That ’s no harbinger of growth .
Companies planning for sudden and relatively near - term growth should reshape their strategies to make the best of economic flatness .
FIRE Extinguishes Savings
The savings rate is one of those numbers that econo - wonks adore because it is seen as an indication of pent - up consumer demand .
Its history is simple .
After the early 1980s , when the FIRE ( finance , insurance , and real estate ) economy was born , we saw two glorious decades of falling interest rates and rising asset prices .
So an entire generation internalized the false belief that home values and stock prices would forever rise .
Equity portfolios averaging double - digit annual increases and home prices doubling every six years scotched any incentive to sock away 8 % of income .
As households spent , they also took on large amounts of debt .
Cash went into mortgage payments for overpriced housing , and the savings rate dropped to near zero .
Which was fine until asset prices collapsed .
Even now it ’s hard to fathom that $ 6.3 trillion in financial assets and more than $ 5 trillion in real estate value vanished in the 24 months between late 2007 and late 2009 .
The popular delusion of asset price inflation as a savings substitute disappeared in tandem , as did millions of jobs and the portion of the economy sustained by private debt growth .
When people stopped spending and borrowing , the government cut interest rates and pumped $ 1.6 trillion of deficit spending into the economy .
This was the Great Recession , and it led to the current sharp rise in household savings , the first increase since the FIRE economy took hold .
One Step Forward , One Step Back
The reality is , households are using their savings to pay off the massive amounts of debt they accumulated even before their net worth declined a staggering $ 11 trillion over 2008 and 2009 .
The money is not going under mattresses or into bank accounts , from where it will emerge one day to jump - start the economy .
It ’s actually subsidizing the previous boom , which was built on debt and the presumption that assets would always cover that debt .
The fact that savings are a mirage is made worse by the simultaneous credit crunch .
Credit card and auto loans have become much more difficult to get .
Federal Reserve data show year - over - year decreases in those types of consumer loans ( revolving credit ) — a phenomenal development .
( See the exhibit “ Looks Like Progress — But It ’s Not . ” )
That has n’t happened since records began , in 1969 .
Looks Like Progress — But It ’s Not The Personal Savings Rate Begins to Rise …
Click here for a larger image of the graphic .
The percentage of disposable income that goes to household savings has risen during the economic crisis , after a steady decline that began in the early 1980s .
( Shaded areas indicate recessions . )
Meanwhile , revolving credit — auto and credit card loans — has sharply decreased .
… and Consumer Credit Plummets
Click here for a larger image of the graphic .
So Americans continue to pay off their debt , and they ’re unable to borrow as freely as before .
The net effect misleadingly shows up in the statistics as an increase in the savings rate .
Banks can loosen lending policies to allow people to borrow and spend again — but for that to solve anything , consumers must be extremely judicious in how they take on and use their debt .
It ’s more likely that consumer debt levels will rise again as individuals stretch themselves to afford what they want .
Alas , this will drive the reported savings rate back down .
By the end of 2010 , I expect it to dip below 3 % .
Then , any drop in asset values will set off the debt trap .
We ’ll again see a rising savings rate and tightened lending , followed by loosened lending and a declining savings rate .
The recovery will become a series of starts and stops : promising progress , periods of retreat .
Japan provides a glimpse of what may lie ahead for the U.S. Although Japan once enjoyed famously high savings , the rate fell as asset prices climbed during the country ’s great stock and real estate booms .
After the collapse in 1990 , the savings rate rose for about a year before resuming its downward trend .
Japan entered the Lost Decade and has since drifted in and out of recession .
Where does all this leave corporate America ?
With a lot of domestic consumers who ca n’t afford as much stuff as before .
They ’ll be maxed out on loans , they wo n’t be able to borrow as much against their homes as they once did , and many of the high costs that precipitated the financial crisis , such as energy - related expenses , will continue to eat away at their funds .
What Consumers Want Now
In response to their dwindling net worth , constricted credit , the weak labor market , and high energy prices , people will now think more carefully about how they spend their income .
They ’ll look for well - made products that retain value — that is , they ’ll “ invest in ” rather than consume goods — and make fewer show - off purchases .
They will fear obsolescence , whether from poor quality or from a lack of innovation .
What should companies do ?
Emphasize the reliability of cars , washing machines , and other big - ticket items , as well as the added value of service agreements .
Promote upgrades for computers and peripherals .
Draw consumers ’ attention to the durability of shoes and clothing .
Talk up the long - term health benefits of sports - club memberships and diet supplements .
And remember that buyers will prefer a high - quality down - market product over a low - quality upmarket one .
— E.J .
Hopes for a real recovery will fade .
Increased lending will lead to decreased savings , and the cycle will start again .
If the savings rate fails to stay high enough long enough for consumers to pay off debts and save up real spending money , notes Gregory Brown , the economy will “ end up treading water for years . ”
While the Republicans can still filibuster , they are at a disadvantage during floor debate given the Democrats ’ 59 to 41 majority .
And the decision to allow floor debate appeared to be a significant retreat by the minority , reflecting a calculation that further delay was politically untenable .

Among the challenges for Republicans was explaining how they could participate in an oversight hearing on Tuesday criticizing Goldman Sachs executives and proclaiming the need to tighten regulation of Wall Street , but then go to the Senate chamber and vote to block debate of the financial regulatory bill .
In an uneasy appearance on Wednesday morning on the “ Today ” show on NBC , Senator Susan Collins , Republican of Maine , a centrist who is known for working across party lines , faced a series of tough questions on that issue .
Later in the day , Ms. Collins was among the first Republicans to say it was time to open debate .
“ Negotiations have concluded , ” she said .
“ It makes sense to proceed to the floor . ”
The Republicans met late Wednesday afternoon to discuss the financial regulatory legislation and the steps ahead , and they defended their blocking maneuvers , saying it had helped secure assurances that changes would be made to the legislation , particularly in a chapter on liquidating failing companies .
Democrats , however , said that they had made no firm commitments other than to take up Republican concerns during floor debate , where amendments on any controversial issue typically require 60 votes to be approved .
In particular , Republicans said they had won the elimination of a proposed $ 50 billion fund that would be paid for by big financial companies and would be used to help pay for putting failed banks out of business .
The Obama administration also had opposed the fund , out of concern that it would complicate efforts to deal with more costly bank failures .
And the Democrats had already indicated a willingness to remove the fund from the bill .
The south polar ice cap of Mars is receding , revealing frosty mountains , rifts and curious dark spots .

: It 's not every day you get to watch a planetary ice cap vanish , but this month you can .
All you need are clear skies , a backyard telescope , and a sky map leading to Mars .
Actually , you wo n't need the sky map because Mars is so bright and easy to find .
Just look south between midnight and dawn on any clear night this month .
Mars is that eye - catching red star , outshining everything around it .
It 's getting brighter every night as Earth and Mars converge for a close encounter on August 27th .

Mars has gotten so big in recent weeks that even a backyard telescope will show details on the planet 's surface : dust clouds , volcanic terrains , impact basins .
Best of all is the south polar cap .
Made of frozen COor " dry ice , " it reflects more sunlight than any other part of the planet .
The southern hemisphere of Mars is tipped toward Earth and the bright cap is remarkably easy to see .
Do n't wait too long to look , though , because the ice will soon be gone .
Like Earth , Mars has seasons that cause its polar caps to wax and wane .
" It 's late spring at the south pole of Mars , " says planetary scientist Dave Smith of the Goddard Space Flight Center .
" The polar cap is receding because the springtime sun is shining on it . "
As the cap shrinks it develops rifts , dark spots , and a ragged border .
Lately , for instance , amateur astronomers using 8 - inch and larger telescopes have been watching a frosty mountain range emerge from the ice .
Says Smith , " these are the Mountains of Mitchel " - - named after the Ohio astronomer who first spotted them 150 years ago .
A bold dark rift called Rimas Australis cuts through the polar ice just south of those mountains . (

are visible in Thomas Williamson 's photograph of Mars at the beginning of this story . )
Something else to look for is the " Cryptic region " - - a dark zone hundreds of km wide .
Even after the ice above it recedes , the Cryptic region remains remarkably cold according to infra-red cameras onboard NASA 's Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft .
No one is sure what the Cryptic region is , " but it 's probably big enough to see from Earth , " notes Smith .

Here 's an amazing fact :
The seasonal polar caps are made of martian air that freezes during winter .
Depending on the time of year , more than a quarter of the martian atmosphere can be found lying on the ground around the poles .
( The atmosphere is 95 % CO 2 ; that 's why the seasonal polar caps are made of dry ice . )
As seasons come and go , carbon dioxide shifts back and forth -- lying on the ground during cold months , floating through the air during warmer months .
The world - wide air pressure rises and falls by 25 % .
For comparison , the air pressure inside a hurricane on Earth is often only a few percent lower than ambient .
You can experience a full 25 % difference in pressure by traveling from sea level to the top of a 9000 ft ( 3000 m ) mountain .
Just try running a 100 yard dash up there .

The south polar cap is vaporizing now , which means CO 2 is rushing back into the atmosphere .
" Remember , though , " adds Smith , " there are two polar caps on Mars - - north and south .
While the south polar cap is vaporizing the north polar cap is growing .
It 's a balancing act .
Overall air pressure will be greatest when there 's the least amount of CO 2 on the ground . "
The next such peak is due in early October - - that is , early southern summer on Mars .
The boost in pressure has some interesting consequences .
It wo n't make the martian atmosphere thick by Earth - standards .
At best the air pressure on Mars is 100 times less than Earth .
But it might become thick enough in some places for liquid water to flow .
NASA spacecraft have detected frozen water beneath the surface of Mars .
Liquid water , on the other hand , is scarce .
Why ?
On a warm summer day , ice does n't melt , it vaporizes -- skipping directly from solid to gas .
This happens because the air pressure is so low .
But a small boost in pressure could be enough to allow ice to melt and water to flow under a warm summer sun .
Southern summer , therefore , might be a good time for future human explorers to visit .
( For more information read Science@NASA 's Making a Splash on Mars . )
On the other hand , thicker air also encourages dust storms , which are a big problem on Mars .
Small dust clouds stirred by sun-warmed winds sometimes grow to encircle the entire planet .
In 2001 such a storm lasted for months and frustrated astronomers who could n't see through the haze .
Will that happen again this year ?
No one knows .
Below :
In early August , look for bright Mars rising above the southeastern horizon after 10 p.m. .
The planet is even easier to find between midnight and dawn , when it hangs high and bright in the southern sky .
( These instructions apply to observers at mid-northern latitudes . )
When the seasonal polar cap finally vanishes , Smith recommends looking for the permanent polar cap .
" The permanent cap is made of frozen water hiding beneath the seasonal cap of CO 2 , " he explains .
While the seasonal cap is wide - ranging ( 90o to 60o latitude ) and shallow ( only 1 - meter deep ) , the permanent cap is compact and about 3 - km deep .
" It harbors a mass of water comparable to the mass of the martian moon Phobos . "
To amateur astronomers peering through telescopes , the water - ice cap will look like a tight white knot within 10o latitude of the pole .
Dark " cryptic " spots .
Mountainous rifts .
A treasure trove of water .
There 's a lot to look for around the south pole of Mars .
Grab a telescope and see for yourself !
Editor 's note :
In this story we talk about the martian polar caps " melting " or " vaporizing . "
That 's not exactly right .
A physicist would say more accurately " the polar caps are subliming . "
In other words , the frozen CO 2 -- better known as " dry ice " -- transforms directly from a solid to a gas without going through an intermediate liquid phase .

Science reveals secrets of invisibility Invisibility could one day be more than an optical illusion .
QUICKVOTE
Can you imagine invisibility technology ever catching on ?
Yes - one to watch for the future .
No - ca n't see it .

Your comments YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Future Summit or or Create Your Own ( CNN ) --
Invisibility has long been a fantastical ability exclusively enjoyed by teenage wizards , super heroes and the ultra- advanced civilisations of science fiction .
But more pragmatic - minded scientists and engineers now believe that invisibility - enabling technology may be within reach of lesser mortals as well .
The key to that possibility is the development of increasingly complex metamaterials -- manmade composites engineered on a nano scale with properties entirely different to anything found in nature .
Doctor Ulf Leonhardt , a physicist at Scotland 's St. Andrews University who has recently published two papers on the theory behind invisibility technology , said the key was developing a transparent material capable of bending light around an object concealed behind it .
" What you want to do is to surround yourself with a transparent material that is not only transparent but bends the light around you , " Leonhardt told CNN .
Leonhardt said the underlying principle was inspired by natural phenomena when light is bent to create optical illusions such as the refraction of a spoon in water or a mirage in the desert or on hot tarmac .
" There are many examples of ways a transparent material like water glass or air can bend light , " said Leonhardt .
" The reason that is possible is because light will always take the shortest route , which is not always a straight line .
All you need is a transparent material that bends light around an object like water moving around a stone . "
Work on metamaterials that could ultimately make invisibility a reality is already underway at Duke University in the U.S. , where a team led by Professor David R. Smith is experimenting with the design of materials to shield objects from other electromagnetic waves such as microwaves .
Leonhardt said that once that technology had been developed it would merely need to be replicated on a smaller scale to work for light waves as well .
" The essential idea is that all you have to do is make things smaller .
Visible light has a significantly smaller wavelength than microwaves or radio waves but you could take the same building blocks and make them very small .
Thanks to nanotechnology there is a chance that can be done . "
One problem that engineers would face would be in creating a metamaterial covering the full range of the optical spectrum rather than a single color or light frequency .
Currently researchers are only working on developing materials with the ability to channel waves of a specific frequency .
But Leonhardt said he believed the issue was surmountable : " There will be advances on both the technological and theoretical sides which will make invisibility happen in the not too distant future .
This is not completely beyond the range of present technology and theoretical ideas . "
While there may ultimately be practical , ethical and security considerations to be considered for invisibility technology , initial applications are likely to focus on microwave shielding , protecting electrical devices from electromagnetic interference , and applications to enable more effective wireless communications , Leonhardt said .
" What these new ideas give you is a new set of tools to guide microwave radiation in a controlled and precisely adjusted way .
Generally anything connected with wireless technology would benefit from these new design ideas . "
Ironically , the method by which invisibility might be achieved is not dissimilar to the way in which one comic book hero already achieves her special powers .
The Invisible Woman , one of Marvel 's " Fantastic Four , " hides behind a forcefield which guides light around her .
" This really is the underlying principle of these devices .
You mimic with a material an effect that would occur with a field like a curved space , " said Leonhardt .
" That 's the closest example to what people could perhaps do with modern technology . "
But the Invisible Woman and Harry Potter , armed with his invisibility cloak , may still have an advantage over anything technology is capable of .
In the real world , anything or anyone concealed from view would also be trapped in darkness .
" You would see black , of course , " said Leonhardt .
" You are completely cut off from light as it is guided around you -- so you would n't see anything . "
